i dont know anything about minmatar ships so bear with me i can agree with the naglfar but im unsure of the nidhogguryou said yourself that compared against a similar ship it lacked in several aspects but did much better in others pros v cons it cant be the same as a compared ship and excel in other points as wellthen people would complain about the other ship being weaker then this onebut still support for the verticaly challenged

a resounding no to this proposalthough i am a proponent of fw and lived in 00 for most of the 8 months if you want to play with the shiny fw mechanics or even just get regular combat sorry but get out of your big alliance corps and join the militiame puts on flameproof suit

without kugs i would never have found out that t20 had cheatedwithout kugs i would have never spent an entire xmas trying to placate members of my corp that had to spend their festive period trying to un what kugs didwhen given the choice i would much rather sacrifice the former so i could avoid the latteron top of which ccp dont need to give reasons  its their game they can  and state they can in the eula  withold rights to play for whatever reason they choose
i support the idea
misleading topic title you only discuss one single ban your topic title suggests this considers a generic approach to banningssadly its just an attention seeking post to dig up old dramathe guy acted like an ass to ccp they have every right to ban him over thatcase closed nextps  posted on the first page dont worry torshin he plays
id like to hear your opinions about this idea ive put on the fid forums regards
i would prefer the simple carry on training next level solution but its great to see that this issue will be brought to ccp by the csmexcept that we end up with a lot of partially trained skills that waythey probably use macros anyway
yes it should be given high priority imho
i say no to character grinding if you set an alarm to get up at the crack of dawn to change a skill i think you play this game too much besides i sort of like messing with my evemon skill plans to find one so i can be constantly training
i agree with a shortlimited queue this would be immensely useful
i like the primarysecondary skill idea support granted
well why not  i mean its not like you have any of those ores in highsec so what does it matter if veldspar is superseeded by two or even all three of these new ores there of course you can also totally rething ore compositions not just add three new ones  have veld also carry traces of other things and so on and so forth  basically have all ores carry some traces of a lot of minerals in themheck you can have veldspar have 776 trit 20 pye 5 mex and 1 iso per refine batch and pyroxeres 564 trit 20 pye 80 mex 1 iso 9 nocx and 1 zyd for all i care for instancebasically the idea should be something like this   the base values of ores should slowly increase the deeper into lower security rating you go culminating with highest base value in arkonor all minerals should be mineable out of systemsecurityspecific  or very close to systemsecspecific  ore at least 14  of not 13 or even 12  of the regionspecific mined ores minerals makeup should be in the 1 mega  4 zydrine  16 nocx  64 iso  256 mex  1024 pye  4096 trit ratios with the rest 34 of it  or 23 or even 12  concentrated on relevant mineral type  megacyte in deep 00 mix of mega and zydrine in average 00 mostly zydrine and some nocx in shallow 00 mostly nox and isogen in lowlowsec mostly isogen and mex in shallow lowsec mostly pyerite in lowhighsec and mostly tritanium in highsec  probably most lowerend ore refine batches will have to be increased  in batch cubic meters  number of units required  in order to have the above condition properly fulfilledthat way you can always use a portion of it in local manufacture  14 13 or even 12 of mining yield  while the rest has to be exportedand that from mining only secratingspecific oreif you mix and match with ore valilabale in higher sec ratings  which you can still find  you should be able to cover most local needs in the deepest 00 with minor imports  the force behind the need to export would be profit not complete lack of alternativesas for fw being the boost du jour for lowsec mehits not much more than mindless fighting id hardly call it a boost a distraction at bestat best it brings people into lowsec but not to make money there but rather waste money theretheres no actual boost for lowsec income levels in that  just a boost in lowsec population count
as far as im concerned moon mining should be dynamic as proposed earlier in the thread with moons providing a guaranteed income each month without the possiblity of a moon becoming mined out just plays into the hands of the major powers in the game the rich get richer and the poor have no chance if after a specified time of mining a moon it becomes empty then the onus is on the people owning that moon to go find another high end moon to mine ccp done this to a certain degree with static plexes certain entities would run the static plexes everyday without any problems as soon as the system became dynamic and the plexes moved around and had to be scanned the system corrected itself over a short period of time this needs to be done with moon mining as above all moons which have been mined for a period of time will run dry and another moon will spawn that mineral simple and also takes the power away from the power blocks and makes it more accessible to all corpsallainces that spend the time going out and locating the newly spawned moonsmoon mining is broken and needs fixingakita t i totally agree with the idea of having all asteroids available in all systems across eve basing the yield amounts on the true sec status of each system that way the riskreward is based purely on how far each individual is willing to goplease forgive if not very well written as had rather too many glasses of vino tonight hope you get the gist of it though
dear waristina thank you for your wordsbut youre at least the 3rd poster who agrees with me on a particular solution and i have no idea how manyeth poster who thinks this issue should be addressed by the csm and ccp but forgets to select the support checkmark in their post
is the free market working of course are the current prices a natural result of that yes the problem is that those results are not good for game play as it stands mining anywhere outside of deep 00 is less profitable than mining in high sec or doing missions in high sec and this is contrary to the game design that this is a natural result of the current state of the game and the free market does not mean that the current state of the game is not brokenthe current mineral prices reflect an oversupplyunderdemand of the middle tier minerals the game was designed with a number of different ores that yield an overlapping mix of minerals so that supply and demand will cause price fluctuations which in turn will cause miners to adapt which ores they mine in order to supply the demand if trit is expensive people will mine veld to fill the demand if mex and zyd are expensive people will mine jaspet and kernite to fill the demand the problem is that the variety of ores is insufficient to allow miners to adapt to supply the minerals that the market demands the solution is to either add new ores to allow miners to increase the supply of trit to match the demand or to allow manufacturers to adapt the demand by relying more on minerals other than tritthe latter would mean adding code and complicating the build system to allow builders to choose to use say 30 less trit but 20 more pyerite and 10 more mex but this would involve a good deal of dev work the simpler solution is to add new ores to lownull sec that supply large amounts of trit and little to none of the middle tier minerals this will allow the miners to adjust supply to market conditions and restore lownull sec to its proper place as more profitable than high sec eventually the prices of mexisonocx will come back up to the point where mining jaspet hedbergite and hermorphite and mining in lownull sec will be more profitable than mining veld in high sec again as they should be to that end i propose adding 3 new types of ore1  spawns in systems 02 sec status and less of two of the four empires on tier with hermorphite and hedbergite yields 50 more trit than veld with a touch of zyd2  spawns in systems 02 sec staus and less of the other two empires on tier with hermorphite and hebergite yields 50 more trit than veld with a touch of megacyte   less than the amount of zyd in new ore 1  3  spawns in 00 only on tier with spoudmain contains 90 as much trit as veld but also some zyd4  modify spoudmain to contain 90 as much trit as veld still with some megamaybe make all four require deep core mining as it would be nice to see that skill get some more use and would provide a bit extra incentive not to shift to these oresas for the moon minerals the problem there is far more pronounced if there are 200 dysprosium moons in the universe all at maxium production and you need 50 cobalt moons for each dysprosium moon to satisfy the build needs for the maxium production that those 200 dysprosium moons can support then that means that only 1000 cobalt moons in the universe can be mine before it becomes unprofitable when there are 10000 cobalt moons and only 200 dysprosium moons that will eventually mean that the only moons that are actually profitable to mine are dysprosium while they should be worth a good deal more they clearly should not be the only moons worth miningthe two best ideas i have seen to allow the market to resolve this are to either allow small amounts of rare minerals to be mined from all moons or allow builders to use more common minerals and less rare ones when building things this would allow market forces to keep rare moons valuable but most other moons also worth mining
i would disagree about the manufacturing part there is some complication as the the naming but you just need alternative bpos and the resulting item will reprocess to the original bpo minerals this will1 level the mineral market2 create a way to transfer one mineral type into other given some waste and cost
dont forget time too not just cost  and according to dev hints the cost will probably be significantly increased in the near future  they plan to make pe levels almost as valuable as me levels on top of increasing the install cost substantially to promote economies of scale or at least so they said recently
chron was very specific in saying that this is the current plan on the pipeline
akita is usually full o guff  but really its well worth looking at the distrobution of raw materials around new eden  i support said guff  
i agree with the content of this threadsome tweaks should be made to the availability of moon materials and the ore in lowsec in particular needs to be more profitable as it currently is better to mine veldspar in hisec than to venture in lowsec and grab roids theremaking all ore available everywhere but in different concentrations is a solution that i havent heard before that could use some looking into
suggestionchange some lower value moons into higher value moons by discovering deposits of highest priced moon mins in them at the same time the low value deposits runs dry
i prefer the elasticity solution of allowing varied reactions ie using twice as much of the low moon mins to make a higher reaction in this way when pricing reaches a breaking point the other bpos become profitable and the market equalizes also creates more demand for other moonsthat and a change into how sov works would solve the moon mins problem imhofor ores i like the suggestion of just seeding the ores differently around the region and also removal of mins particurally high end in loot drops
the schism in roid and moon mineral prices does need serious looking intoit has been hinted that ccp is looking into a revamping of industrial production which may include a new layer to the construction of ships and modules via tech1 components through this new construction layer the need of minerals for ships and modules may possibly be rebalanced to place mineral values closer to the original modelas for moon minerals i am not qualified to suggest a solution as i am only vaguely familiar with the whole process and market in that area
ive posted in the faid forum about more dev and other ccp staff involvement in that forum people are posting here and in egd because dev and other ccp staff responses indicate that they read these forums faid is sadly lacking in any official responses so it appears to some that they dont bother to read it
these other threads also touch on the issuemore dev responsesfeatures and ideas redundancyissue assembly hall used in lieu of features and ideas discussionthere are a few others i have seen too there are becoming more and morethis is a real big issue
if the suggestion is just to remove insurance from concord kills im for it
exactlythats why i dont support the ideayou make ships youre suppose to sell them to traders who take their time effort and skills to make money by beating other traders
supportedwith pure egoistic interest because it gives better chances to me to sell my produced stuff for a little better price actually the request reduces the possibility of market pvp a bit regarding the 001 undercutting game but i do not participate in it i place my orders and dont care about them for the next few days  thats why my sales success is probably quite bad today  its a mystery to me how someone can stand this market and order window clickery and should not be happy to see it removed from the game  or at least reduced 
yep especially the mission editor for the following reasons1  eve is meant to be player created no matter how much time ccp put into improving the variety of missions they can not compete with the ingenuity of 100000 players2  the devs have enough to do as it is players will pay ccp for the privelige of doing the work and enjoy it too3  piracy people will be creating juicy high sec missions then lying in wait for faction fit ravens this is nothing different to what happens already only most of the time the pirates wont be there because fw is much better pvp and the pirates have to give something back to the mission runners in the form of missions that are enticingly good fun to fly in a pimped shipanyways my 2 isk for what its worth 100 support to a topic that has been raised soooo many times something should really be done

most the standing i have gained are from capturing dungeons unopposed by defending black rise if fedef pilots came into those sites and killed me  pvp  it is then not to hard for them to defeat the npcs  who have tags worth isk and can be turned in along with lp for things like faction battleships  and hold the site for 20 minutes  which is time enough for me to get a new ship and grab a few friends and try and drive them off the site  pvp  which ever side holds the point for the required amount of time  1020 minutes  gets a standings increasethe fact that you arent using the mechanics available isnt ccps or my fault and your reward is the fact you dont have to pay the weekly cost to maintain the war if you want standings how about complete actual objectives and not just blob 1 of the many rally points the various militias usei suspect that the minmatar have quiet a few players with high ranks since they have taken 6 systems i also suspect there was quiet a bit of pvp going on
i agree
awesome idea i hate having to run my fat fingers across f1f8 every time i want to shoot something my keyboard is already stained with enough butter and grease as is
this should have definitely gotten into the game before overload rack strange it didnti support any form of better key binding options eaven if its just an activate rack buttonbuying a g15 keyboard is out of the question because1 its ugly and large2 its not wireless  and i need that 3 i wouldnt use it for anything else than this specific thing on topic here
i would like to propose the following feature players should be allowed to willingly unlearn certain skills i know it sounds kinda strange however here is my reason i have a perfect amarr char only amarr ship no industry nothing unrelated to pvp amarr recently somehow my little bro was toynig with the game and out of best intetions decided to go to jita and buy and train as many allowed skills as possible he thought that this will allow the character to expand his capabilities my skills setup was very nice and clean only laser guns for instance trained to max now i have bunch of silly 1 level skills totally unrelated to amarr and totally unrelated to pvp which just makes the picture incredibly unaestheticso here is my suggestion  introduce like a option in char sheet pane where you can click button unlearn and willingly get rid of any skill you want that will automatically adjust amount of sp i do understand that it may potentially introduce additional hazzard and security issues hence the feature can be password protected or protected by any other means like double confirmation for instance im not exactly mad at my bro cos i know he wantd to do some good but i would very much like to get rid that stupid small projectiles level 1 skill in my gunnery and such and suchthoughts 
and support   
so let me see if ive got this straight you allowed your brother full access to your character  and therefore your account  either by logging in and accidentally letting him have access  pure negligence on your part and a probable breach of the eula  or by knowingly allowing him access to your password  a direct eula breach account sharing  either way i see no reason here to support unnecessary mucking around with the database just so that you can have a neater character sheetedited to clarify points
the problem i have with that is that it leaves people open to character destruction if say an angry ex gets onto the account after a nasty breakup i like the principle but id stick a limit on it similar to the 12hour timer for character deletion how about untraining at a rate equal to your training rate obviously youd be able to do it as you trained but it should be difficult for an unwanted user to ruin a character just like its difficult for an unwanted user to kill a characterfamily members know my eve password because my eve password is the same as my password for a bunch of other stuff i cant imagine im unique in that i dont think any of them have ever logged in since none of them know how to play but they could if they wanted to assuming perfect security is wholly unrealistic
all tru good replyon the point of desctruction there is absolutelly nothing that stops an unwanted unauthorised user to log on and do multiple pod destruction with basic clone that will have pretty much same effect as unlearning skills even more that aspect of the game has zero secuirity on thatif you are not objective to this scenario i do not see any reason why you should be objecting ot introduction of skill unlearn feature
a fair point though that method would take somewhat longer 3 minutes per podding assuming you dont have a buddy around in lowsec  my system also deals with accidental misclicks as well  you lose 10 seconds of skill before you fix it not 2 months
1  take this to features and ideas discussion 2  many others myself included have been proposing a system where a skill can be untrained one of the safeguards was that it will take 30 days for the skill to be actually deleted off a character and with every log in the message would pop up  mining is scheduled for deletion 20 days left etc and then finally at the end of the 30 day period you go in and physically click the skills and option pops up delete permanently and thats it anyway i support this idea but i will not issue thumbs up because it needs to go where all ideas supposed to go  features and ideas discussion  not the bloody assembly hall for csm
this listen to the manalso uhh extra skills never hurt anybody dont like that its messy beat up your brother for it its not ccps business if you violate the eula which you agreed tonot supported

sounds good
looks like a good idea youve got my support
far from it programaticly a gate is just a place holder if player is near thing called gate player can jump to system x substitute gate with planet and the differences although they exist do not require an entire rewrite would it be a big project yes but its scale is anything other than the slant imposed by entire
dont fix something that isnt broke tbhthe way the jumping works isnt broken other parts of the game are out of wacki dont see the advantage for this over the current warpjump system plus it would be a lot of effort to redesign this its not feasable
the post i saw was lengthy detailed and obviously had a lot of thought put into it i like this however i didnt get to read as much as id have liked because i have a murderously powerful migraine thats keeping me awake tonightfrom what i did see though the idea is far too much of a departure from what eve currently is to be implemented in anything less than a couple of years its length implies complexity and i have to confess that i didnt understand half of what i read  probably due to the migraine  or how it would be implemented this alone gives me concern  eves learning curve is high enough as it is without making movement hideously complicated as wellim ambivalent about this idea at the moment
the idea is massive really massive i doubt all things can be incorporated but some things can be taken and it will still improve eve in general i fully support it
agreed
yeah okay so weve got like 18 threads about this including some in the other forum and there theres someone complaining that the general discussion forum is getting these toowe have a major problem with omg i has idea and its causing trouble all across the eve forums not just the assembly hallthe council of stellar management needs to bring this issue to ccp because the problem is beyond the scope of the csms ability to control it
not supported the op doesnt really provide a thorough convincing explanation of why the bs sized autocannons are lacking now a question to the op do you want everything in this game to be equal one of the reasons eve is great is because not everything is perfectly balanced yes lasers might be better than autocannnons but have you considered that this is the way it should be if you want the advantages of lasers train into amarr simple as that if you will get a buff to your autocannons why shouldnt i get a buff to my missiles why shouldnt gallente also get a buff then we will all be equal balanced and boringeve had many issues and imbalances since its release many of these are still not fixed i think its for a reason and its a good thing if the game has endured for so many years and people are still playing it despite these issues then apparently people are willing to live with it and take advantage of their races strong points instead of whining about disadvantages as opposed to other races why because not all of these issues are issues a lot of it is for a reasonif youd bring up a strong point such as minmatar assault ships have only half the armor and damage of amarr ships id support you because that would be a huge completely illogical disadvantage but saying that minmatar bs sized autocannnons are a bit lacking when compared to amarr lasers give me a break man next thing i know youll be asking that minmatar bs is made equal to raven so minmatar can be just as efficient in missions guess what you have to train for a raven to have all the advantages of flying one not ask that these benefits are applied to the ship you currently fly where some races are lacking in damage or range they compensate in armor or speed where some races are speedy or armored they lack in damage or range you choose which of the above factors are more important to you you dont ask to have all of the abovemy car might be lacking a bit in comfort when compared to your car but i wont complain about it since my vehicle is faster and more powerful and you wont complain cause you want the comfort and the smooth ride catch my drift yethere you already have an example of how some csms are abusing their power i cant believe he even had the nerve to bring this up with other people up top before there has even been enough votes supporting him to do so
actually the issue did get approved in a 54 vote by the council it just did not get approved before the deadline for an official response from ccp if i had brought up this topic one week before it would have been officially raised and the devs would have done a detailed analysis and stuff for the csm delegates to see that kind of thingas for the other guy who blasted some kind of virulent diarrhea all over this thread about how autocannons are supposed to be worse than lasers and blasters in every situation you need to get your head checked because youre a complete nut
lol so the elected people chose there own stuff to fix i want to delte my vote cuse you all gona fail if you do it like thisi have never ever beated a skilled minmatar pilot on sissi never i wonder why it must be my perfect gal skillsoh well make sure they are better good jobruns of to iron a shirt with the ironi
im not sure if youre referring to me here but if you are all i said was that the balancing has to be done at the ship level not at the weapon level minmatar ships are generally faster than other ships and as such they need to be worse in other fields to compensate damage seems a natural candidate i dont want to see minnie battleships doing 3 dps but i also dont want to see autocannons doing blaster dps with no cap use on a hull thats twice as fast both of those are bad situations i think we can agree
i was actually referring to sir ibex though youre a little bonkers toothe premise that i presented to ccp was that at the battleship level autocannons do not have a big enough berth of ranges at which they will outdps blasters or that this range is too difficult to maintain given changes such as the hp buff in revelations 1 and the introduction of overheatable webs took about two minutes i think doesnt seem like a harmful thing to say and if they find that its not the case after their eventual examination then they wont change anything
why should they out dps blastersblasters take alot of cap to fire and only shots thermkinwhile with autocannons you can pick your damyour boost dont make sense in any terms other than to boost minmatar even more
please dear council can you ask ccp to provide us with a tick box that switches off all gui window snap to behaviour
agree with several of the points not all support to get them all discussed anyway
good ideas

yea it is very annoying
yeah and since thats not totally silly how about cages that drop down once the ship enters and some hot inspace agents that float around the outside of the cage with large number cardsoh oh how about fw npc corp agents that get in there and smack talk in local while the fighters warm up and like those agents can whack the opposing player over the head with chairs when concords not lookingoooh how about big belts for the winning players shipyeah this is cool
this is designed as something to fix 2 problems1  waiting for 30 minute timers really sucks2  the one enemy in local can get a fight instead of having to wait for a blob to formfw  aka catch the flag  is so popular because ccp has finally admitted that this is a game and has stopped trying to force pvpers into 00 blob warfare the high risk of loosing vast ammounts of isk by being podded hasnt changed and neither has the amazing economy and diversity in eve so adding game elements that give people what they want in terms of easy acces to pvp is goodsince the release of fw ive very rarely seen gatecamps in low sec other than the militia ones who mostly only fire at other militias why because all those bored pvpers now have something to domore of what fw has done for eve please
i would hate to see a forced 1 vs 1 it would take the whole point of eve and throw it out the window
im personally not a fan of this ideaintroducing a new module to fix a broken type of ship is not how to fix ithowever this seems so far to be the best idea for afs and would add to fw as wellthe gist of thisfix massagilitygive ab bonus to get small sig and good competative speed below that of intie and af with mwd but being near mwd speedshave a web resist to the ships i would say 6080 resist to web effect more than generous

ive been playing for 3 years now i would love to see them gomy simple idea was remove advanced skills and add in up to 10 implantsreplace all 5 implants with 10 and such so the  10 isnt more expensivebam that takes literately 5 months of training time out the window
i created this character the other day to just go get the basic pvp skills for tackling and frigate combat stuff so i got to see the game from the new player perspective againthe 3x skills on my main train about as fast as a 1x skill on this piece of this is the first thing a new player experiences when they come into the game assuming they have a tutor sitting behind them telling them what to do then they know what to train in order to fly x ship and use x module if they even know what modules to use which takes a tutortime and time again i hear from people that tried out eve only to be bored to tears during the first couple days and then never logged on again and honestly why should they ccps response to the barrier of entry has always been cry more eve is harsh and this is to people that have just dipped their toe in the kiddy pooli dont know the overall metrics of eve but ive personally tried to get both my brother and a colleague into eveafter i explain learning skills to them they both decided to take learning skills up first both lost any excitement they had for eve before they finished learning skills i even suggested hey look train a fun skill so you can fly that ship you wanted to but they insisted to stick with learning skills because its the smart thing to do they stopped logging in to train their chars so i finished the learning skills for themtold them theyre done with the learning skills and they didnt give a  anymore why should they their new player experience the important time period where a game makes a lasting first impression on the player was spent training up learning skills their lasting impression of eve is yawnthey watch videos of hotdrops and gatecamps and all of the exciting  that eve has but thats not what they rememberthey remember doing some level 1 missions in a ty frigate with ty fittings waiting on some boring skills to trainpeople come up to me while i play eve at work and like what they see my main can do all kinds of cool  covops recons passive tank drakes nano curse interceptors a second account with a fleet sniper battleship with excellent skills at itthey want to be a part of it they ask me to help them get into it now days i suggest that they create an account and let me create and train their character for 2 months before attempting to play of course none of them follow through with this because its a ridiculous proposition but one that i believe in otherwise theyd probably get bored to death and quit after a day or 2 like that last 2 people i tried to get into eveto be honest though eves new character creation process needs a hell of a lot more than to delete the learning skills from the gamesupport skills the skills that effect fitting and capacitor are essentials these skills like learning skills arent fun theyre just necessary i cant fit my equipment without these i cant operate my equipment without those not to mention they dont make any goddamn sense but this is internet spaceshipsso yeah there are things that arent new player friendly ccp should probably recognize these and do their best to make their game more fun and focus less on making sure that the player earns that funeliminating learning skills would be a start and proof that ccp actually caresfake edit i think youd see vast improvements to eve if all the devs were forced to delete all of their characters and start as a new player and make them play alongside someone thats never played eve before
stat implants are another thing that hurt the game because it makes people far too careful all newer players want to have stat implants obviously you cant sustain that if you keep getting podded so they are ultra careful they create carebearsstat implants are a carebear implant they dont help you in pvp or help you do anything better they just make your pod cost millions more than it normally would and they are very attractive to new players  and do a great job at making new players avoid pvp the only new players that ive seen approach the game in the correct way are the goons but thats because they did ccps job for them and pretty much dictated what to do and what not to do and in what order like dont use any implants youre going to die and educate the player exactly what they are getting into with skill training and learning skills what to expect and how to approach it
but but but i am entitled to win because i am a human being with emotions and i think its wholesomely unfair that my interests to win are not being addressed we are all people and we need equal amounts of win time to keep it all fair to suggest some people can be only winners and some can only be losers breaks the cooperative spirit of game play we should seek to foster within the star cluster
when i first started i didnt really have a mentor telling me what skills to train i started with the fun stuff and it was fun as the time went on i started wanting to do more and it was usually along the lines of heck i need a bit more cpu to be able to use that fitting  you do know there is a skill that increases cpu dont you and so on i have followed that philosophy and still subscribe to it now  even with 35m sps im still finding new newbie skills i have not trained yet simply because i havent needed toas for learning skills i came across those almost by accident after 5 or 6 monbths of play time until then i hadnt really appreciated the way in which stats affected training time  i thought you needed them to actually fly better i started to intersperse them with the fun things  one fun skill then one learning skill one fun skill and so on and they eventually got done i saved the higher echelons of those skills for times when i was too busy in rl to log on for any length of timemy point is that as experienced players we already know the short cuts however eve is about discovery the main barrier for new players in any established mmorpg is the incredibly steep learning curve  i seriously pity any new players starting everquest now with its 14 expansions  which is a natural process of devs adding cool new stuff sometimes its better not to try and tell new players all the short cuts let them ask in their own time sure learning skills make them learn skills faster but if they dont know about them they wont worry about themi personally think they should stay learning skills are only good for the long term player but you dont get a long term player without letting them get hooked right at the start if they want to learn fun stuff first let them and let them have fun save the learning skills until they develop the more philosophical longterm view of skill training  i regularly train skills that take several weeks these days  52 skills at level 5 and counting  when i first started id go stir crazy if i even had to wait a couple of days to see a new skilli have waffled here for which sorry  but i gotta get ready for work and have no more time to go back and edit for legibility sorry bout that

i understand that some people dont mind learning skills but its more important than simply saying well some people are fine with it it stayssome people are fine with it others hate it and think it ruins the new player experiencethats an easy compromisethose that dont mind the learning skills wouldnt feel anywhere near as strongly about them being removed as others feel about their current existencei love them  i like them  i dont care  i dont like them  i hate them  i lost interest because of themhow many people fit into which category i think youd find few people who love them and many who hate them and im guessing thousands of people that have stopped playing eve due to them ruining their initial eve experienceso for a lot of people its a lot more important than the fact that those of us who play were able to cope  obviously cause we play  but then were the only ones posting here you wont see my brother posting here about it  whome was once very excited about eve until he started waiting to play the game 
disagreed most of people dont care about learning
when i started this game about 1 year ago i was thinking that i probably hate it and i will never return after the trial expirationwell within 2 days i had signed for a real account i dealt with the leraning skills a sa feature that in course of time will help me gain some time but i realised that i wouldnt need to train them too much at the beggining since they dont count so much if you plan to train the basic skills till lvl 3 so i trained them a bit but i didnt spend my first 2 weeks training only them you are not oblidged to train the learning skills i didnt at first and havent regreted for doing so but i dealt with them as a cool feature that will help me gain skillpoints faster nothing more nothing lessthe approach that is a must to train them and you must not train anything else before train them is not very valid for me all in all i may have lost about 1 week of training just because i didnt train the learning skills at the very beginning no big deal what matters is that i absolutly enjoyed this game from day 1i think some people get too obsessed with numbers you can train all the basic learning skills just to lvl 3 and then train the other basic stuff it will give you a serious ability boost without wrecking your fun i dont see what is this whine all about
the reason so many people complain about the new character experience now days is very very simple eve isnt the same as when you all started oh you may think its the same minus a few odds and ends here and there but really think about it every new system every new mechanic every new ship every new module eve tends to progress at a rate faster than any other mmo i can think of in the area of gameplay mechanics and it all stacks everytime they add something it gets exponentially harder for a new player to actually learn the gameccp really needs to just stop for a patch stop putting any new content or mechanics in and just write an update of nothing but tutorials explanations and interactive in game guides it would do more for their bottom line in subscriber base than any amount of advertising they dobecause i really dont think the devs or any of the old players can really appreciate what the current learning curve of this game is ive learned languages with less of a learning curve than eve has
hi all i have an issue that i hope all of you can agree withcan you advocate to have ccp add giant cans and all containers to the list of objects that can be probedthis could happen as a 36 month trialmy reasoning is that many isk farmers have can fields of 2030 giant cans anchored per system in 00 this gives them a permanent base better than a pos as the only way you can discover their can lot is by getting a lucky probe hit on their ship at the cans uncloakedsince we have probes that can catch shuttles and interceptors it makes sense that probes can also pick up cansi think allowing cans to be probes will also add a deeper level to 00 game play it will help stop farmers and stop farmers from staying in one system for weeks on end while it 5s just deliver thousands of missiles to themagain i submit this request respectfully and id appreciate your contributions to reining in farmers in 00
missiles users can choose which one they want they dont have to max out all their skills to get what they wanti dont have all the skills but here goesfrom lv1 heavy missiles to t2 cruise  37d 16h 31m 29s cost  935millionlv2 large hybrid turrets to t2 large hybrid turrets  75d 18h 26m 16s cost  13millionso you have to train twice as long pay more for the skills aswell even tho i have less skills in missiles it still takes alot less time to train for t2 missilesthere may be more skills for people to train in missiles but they have a choice in which they want to train we have to train all of them to get what we want
capital guns are the same aswelfrom heavy missiles lv1 to capital missiles  31d 11h 17m 57s cost  154millionwith less skills to trainheavy turrets lv2 to capital hybrid turrets  30d 22h 45scost  15millionwith less skills to train for turrets it will still take me about the same ammount of time and cost to train for capital turrets
csm meeting 6 july 6 2008 1800 hours eve timeagenda announcements 1 votes from iceland on admin issues i alternate serviceterm limitsalt service does not count against csm 2 term limitii 5 rule changed to 25 of active voters in previous electioniii replacement alternates chair will write to current alternates and ensure they are able to commit to the role if we need replacements we will table a followup proposal chair will give status update on sundayiv electable chair rejected by csm but clarification in the future it will be possible for winner of the popular vote to stand down and recontest if desired we dont however have the ability to bind future csm councils to this kind of principle v general principle that csm has full authority to rewrite administrative issues and refine the process to improve csm performance  re drafting csm document vi general approval of csmauthored issue templates the process of presenting issues to ccp accepted by ccp council csm actions since election supported and endorsed by ccp councilcsm raised issues  to be submitted with template to csm mailing list by 1800 hours friday 4th july 1 alliancecorps in fw
to clarify each csm sits for a period of only six months and gets three opportunities to put ideas forward to ccp  one in person two online  as such it would seem wrong to me for a given issue to keep coming back to the table two or three times during that csm session once it has been reviewed by the csm  and possibly answered by ccp  at best it would get a perfunctory examination on subsequent reviews as see discussion last time would be the probable answer and effectively it would just waste time which could be better served looking at other issuesneedless to say should new information become available on a subject  for example if it get changed by a patch during the 6month session period  then of course it would be possible to reopen the discussion but otherwise asked and answered should probably be the resultiz
thats all well and good but then i object to the csm members picking up only a tiny portion of an issue  like when you decided to only forward a small part of the ui problems to ccp  and then declaring the whole issue locked until the next termyou arbitrarily chose to only forward the simplest supparts of the ui interface issue and now we cant talk about ui issues anymore for 6 months wtf is thatedit i think youve all switched from being our representatives to being our moderators with prevent niggling as the primary directive
what about for issues that werent addressed in detail in the csm minutesi saw many issues that some of you cared about but let slip to the side because others seemed to not care or not take it seriouslywe already know that the csm delegates are not an accurate representation of the eve community and rather just a popularity contest so perhaps the least you guys could do is take the time to read some of the convincing arguments that people present to youjade youre proven to purposely present skewed descriptions of issue and others seem utterly apathetic and against the propositions by default if they do not care about themperhaps rereview the things you guys have already brushed aside on a meh and discuss with voice chat the issue and the supporting reasons and theory behind the argumentccp already voiced they were surprised displeased  with how you guys arent taking up big issues and ideas delve down into debate with both the council and the populusthe only time ive seen you guys interested in what the community were was during the elections i dont see any of you discussing it publicly you basically just bring up the things that you yourselves are interested in those are the only issues that have their positions fought for everything else is just yeah whatever
which issues are this exactly
the only issues that should be locked are those that have been submitted to ccp if an issue was voted on  like capitol ships online  but not submitted it should remain unlocked so pilots can add more information in hopes it will get to the point that it can get a favorable vote just because an issue was voted down by the csm does not mean it will never get to the point that the csm will see it for the issue it is and vote to submit it to ccpon the same note any issue that is updated between meetings with ccp should be eligible for considerationin both cases why start a new thread when all the data of the original thread is still just as valid
have the csmccp meeting minutes been posted
i completely regret wasting my 2 votes on lavista vista cause he promised to pay 1 billion isk per vote and has failed to follow through with his promise wait that sounds so much like a politician always failing to deliver
i voted for lv because no one else running  and even still now that they are elected  had a deep understanding of how important the industrial and market aspect of the game isno regret
im actually pretty proud of my candidate they were one of the three candidates i think acted appropriately during this whole debacle the others need to learn how to listen when someone else is talkingthen speak not just override everyone else and browbeat them when you dont like what they say but really did anyone expect anything different when you get something like this together there will always be to many egos in the room

this should be implemented asapalso conspiracy theory coming up on the house ccp simply left things this way in order to build up negative tension between players more wars and fightsmore stuff blown upmore gaming time when the players are patching together their inventory
we made it a high priority issue fingers crossed
oh yeah 
any chance of linking an issues template to this thread for people considering making a post would be useful  
there is always a place for industrial espeinage and stolen trade secrets  
agreed
i made a thread addressing our skilling issues here
as described in this thread citadel torpedoes are currently the laughingstock of capital weaponry when you have the combined firepower of over 6 phoenixes against a titan resulting in less damage than one moros  and not one of the harder hitting ones either  you begin to wonder about all those wasted skillpoints  and the future of the caldari state this also ties into the naglfar to a lesser extent since citadels make up half its firepowerproposal as citadel torps are staggeringly huge either make them innately much tougher and more resistant to defenderssmartbombs or add a bonus to that property in siegemode this would only serve to make phoenixes and naglfars viable for things other than shooting pos structures no other ships would be affected  well i guess the leviathan but srsly  and no balance would be unduly tipped i actually hope ccp remediates this of their own accord before this becomes more of an issue however my respiration is not pausededit naglfar sorrycoming back from a hiatus and had a mental hiccup dang minnie naming conventions
hmm okayi wasnt aware of the issue but i suppose as a phoenixcapable pilot i really should be indeed considering their expense citadel torpedoes should be nighinvulnerable to destruction or one could make the comparison that fighters are significantly more difficult to kill than tech1 light dronesextend this to starbase batteries too though yeah i know nobody uses citadel torpedoes but half of that could be that a single battleship fitted with smartbombs can protect an entire fleet from missilessupport vote given
this killmail illustrates the problem quite nicely
another killmail illustrating the utter ease with which citadel torps are rendered wholly ineffective
ccp will not get any more money from me i havent renewed any of my accounts and will not 
in my opinion zulupark is a complete idiot and should not be employed by ccp his solution to everything is to nerf his job should be nerfedthat would be suicide im not sure they wont do something like that though they have been getting very good at shooting themselves in the feetas to the gtc change i personally own nine accounts i had been running all of them on 30d gtcs so i could keep tight control over whether and how much i pay ccp i vary the number of active accounts according to how pleased or ed i am with ccp reducing the money i pay to ccp is one way of forcing a reimbursement denied by a gm and the reimbursement comes back in rl money as savings in reduced subscription feesto have all nine accounts active i was paying just under us135 per month to buy 30d gtcs at the moment this change became effective and i could no longer buy 30d gtcs i would have had to shell out just under us300 to keep all the accounts going uh no i dont agree to do that i let some of my accounts expire and left some expired for about 10 daysnow i have switched to cc payment 30d at a time and i track the expiry dates as i did with gtcs when it comes time to reduce the active accounts for whatever reason i will cancel themthis month i will have all nine active because i just switched to 64bit xp pro and i want to see whether i can run all nine at the same time with 32bit xp pro i could never run more than seven since trinity in recent days i successfully ran eight and will activate the last account to test running ninethe recent fix to the cache setting seems to have helped and with it set to off or none i no longer see the memory usage creeping ever upward if i can run all nine i will be happy for a while otherwise or if ccp es me off in some other way i will reduce the number of active accounts
there you have the real reasons in a nutshell and here we have the marketing crap ccp tells us
blargh
please count this as 6 thumbs up  2 accounts with alts 
vote for those from 00 who want to fight in this are already doing it anyway
the idea of a single corp within an alliance being able to join a militia is a good idea it would act as a pr outlet for that alliance and provide a stepping stone between 00 and fwhaving all the corps in an alliance join fw is the same effect as having the alliance sign up so id say no unless a proviso could be written in to the code that if multiple corps from an alliance wish to join that alliance must have no sovereignty
yeah i support itbring the ushrakhan into fw
the above quote hopefully outlines the current situation in fw with regards to war declerations and a possible solutionpvp needs to be kept at everybodys foremost thoughts in regards to eve and fwas it stands nonfw player corps have the ability to declare war on fw corpshowever fw corps are unable to form alliances or ask for aid from other fw corps in their fight for survival yet the nonfw corp may add more corporations to the war within an alliancetherefore a simple allowance for fw corps to aid other fw corps at war with nonfw corps free of charge would allow the in game mechanics of eve for fw players to again run smoothly
this i believe is an acceptable compromise i think a lot of people are in agreement that there needs to be a change but theres a lot of ideas on what that change should be i think this is one of the better changes as it does not upset the way things currently work and simply adds an option for others in the militiasupported
obviously i support it but it didnt register my support
i agree fw corps should be able to get support for wardecs
very happy to support this allows the militia corps better options to defend their allies and widens the sphere of pvp conflict to involve more people completely in favor and assuming this issue gets a decent number of supports ill raise it to the csm as an issue for formal voting
thi biggest problem i see with allwing corps in militias to be wardec is pretty easy to pick out what stops mega alliances from comeing down and killing all fw members cause lets face facts here milita gangs are nt as well orginized or equiped as alliance gangs cause we dont have access to 00 resouces nor do we have the ability to have a stable chain of command being most players are in a noob corp i understand that members of alliance are upset that fw did not include them but to be honest alliance have enough of eve didicated to there ejoyment and what they want to to in eve more than half the regions in eve are dedicated to alllowing alliance to create there own empires control there own space and engage in politics with other alliances around them i think ccp saying if alliances want part of fw they they can disband and join as corps isnt the answer but really isnt that hard to do im sure some of you remember before tha lliance system was in place some how people managed to orginize and do fine withough the alliance system the right comprimise here is somewhere between not allowing corps in milieas to be wardecd by outside orginizations and keeping people from hideing in milieas to exploit thatnow my idea isnt perfect but its an idea in the right direction and im open to honest constructive critisism why not put a min vp or kill amount on corps in fw per week so if your corp joins the militia and does notheing to help the war effort after a week or two they shold be made to leave and not allowed back for a week or so i dont agree with any solution that allowes player alliances any part in fw as is i believe that they have no place in fw and i understand there are factin rp alliances and i feel ther pain but if they where true rpers they wouldnt have issue with disbanding there alliance to join the militia  see above about how alliance did work once before without a offical system 
personally id like it to be fleshed out or explained buyins would they cost any moneyits worth restating what ccp already explained as to consider what basis they had developed them on to suggest changes if necessary
as far as i can see it says free and thats what we are voting for
i think any system that allows alliance any part in fw is wrong single corps cant claim sov can they that being said corps in militias should not be imune form wardecs but anyone wishing to wardec a milita corp should be kos to the faction navies of that militia aswell as gang members should be able to assist members of there gang being attacked by war targets that are not militia releated
i 100 agree with this i think the only change that is needed it for when an alliance decs a fw corp then that factions npc navy sets that alliance kosfair enough
damn i rolled snake eyes on reading comprehension skill test on that one the mechanics are a bit different with militias are they not corps can leave them quicker than alliances make sure its thought it thoroughly we already have lots of people moving back and forth between to avoid war decs i am just saying people could be joining and leaving and joining again to exploit the mechanics militia members dont have roles there could be potential for exploitation there ill have to look into that and then i can decide on the issue
i didnt start the topic for banter but for a solution in a positive directionwe cant have everything and i would personally settle for thisjust because a corp is in fw means they are not immune to aspects of war decs therefore they should have the ability to aid from other fw corps as the nonfw corp can aid its attack with other nonfw corpthis isnt the end of the problem but will make fairer gameplay
i think you need a discussion thread elsewhere nitalya the op for this thread has proposed a solution and i think that should be basis of dicussion here by all means come up with another proposal and start your own thread though  but you do risk derailing this one into nothingness if you arent going to engage with substantive debate on the opits always best if these assembly hall issue threads stick with the topic in the op
i like the idea of being able to optin as a participant in a wardec as long as you are then beholden to the same rules  ie you cant optout again until the war endsbasically its like standing up and saying no im spartacus and tying your corp to the wardecced corp so that the wardec now applies to you as well for no additional cost to anyoneedit oh yeah and i support it
the biggest delima i see is a truly balanced system that keeps alliances out of fw and please understand i get how much this sucks for rp alliances and the like i would agree to a systme that does not allow corps into the militia before anything that makes it easy for alliances to take part and not because i hate alliances i think the best course of action for eve to to have some form of fleet pvp for newer players that does not have influence from outside sources and player politics and ill explain whylets say alliance a get involved with amarr factoin well alliance b c d and e hate them for whatever reason so they all get involved with mimitar faction now you have player politics and 00 alliance wars spilling out into empire wars between the npc factionswhat about allowing single player corps to wardec corps in the militia without any intervention from concord or faction navy and other milia corps but makeing corps in the militia imune to wars from alliances this seems like a pretty fair comprimise
im all for choice and repercussions so a yes from meother solutions may be more optimal regarding wardecs imho eg being allowed to wardec the whole militia and only that  but they all create other problems  like megaalliances hitting fw fullforce  while i cant see big drawbacks here
pointless suggestion as the possibility is already therei see no reason why the wardecs for other militia corps should be free
silly questionplayer corp  pc1  in a player alliance  pa1  gets war decced by another player corp  pc2  in another player alliance  pa2  what happens to the war dec is it on the corp or the alliance can those members of pa1  and pa2  help in the war between pc1 and pc2it seems that if pc2 can only war dec pa1 and not pc1 or of the war dec is in reality pa2 vs pa1 then the answer is to make the faction militia an alliance that if you war dec a player corp in it you war dec the alliance and pay that cost you know the one for a war dec on an alliance with 2 other wars  at least  already
nice proposal nvchicky the militia should be able to help out those corps fighting for the war if they want toanother problem with fw as mentioned by ulstan is that in hisec the fw corp and these friends that would help out are often having to fight npc navy while the wardeccing corp does not hopefully someone brighter than myself can think of a way to correct that
i think a lot of people would be very happy to be able to wardec the militias but there are some balance issues problem is the militia entity is not an alliance  its a different system ccp specifically wanted to ensure that the militia npc entity was not wardeccable from outside faction warfare  where issues like this thread come from is a problem with corporations affiliating with the militia as corporations it would be wrong on a fundamental to protect them from wardecs  but should it be easier for their militia corp mates to help them outid say yes on the proviso it was a system akin to that described in the op
ill vote for support but ccp will have to look at locking down that war for the helping corp for a certain amount of time so they cant just join in for some big op and then leave again and be safeas well as the joinleave militia mechanic
i support this of coursei must add that i seriously wonder why ccp is so silent about that it is the most called for feature ever in the history of this game and there is virtually no response  except something on the drawingboard 
you dont get the point sorrysometimes you need a quick injection of new abilities for some aspect of the game  in my case this was for example cybernetics iii  you cant imagine what  in the  learning this level of skill was for meim not a nerd i have a real life as well this is game i pay foryour suggestion is not helping in any way with stuff like that i have a lot of skills i can train to level 5 but sometimes its that annoying 2  16 hour skills that are the problemyou fail
whoa seriously 11 pages and ccp doesnt have the nerve to even post a well get back to you messagesigned
being a relatively new player this is something id like input on be it for or against id like to hear ccps thoughts on the matter
if its your job to farm characters youre going to farm charactersnot having a skill queue just hurts the casual playersigned
get this bin skill queue setup best idea eversigned
seriously its getting ridiculous nowi log on this game every day but right now i have a period of 18 hours each day when i cannot log on  due to work  sleep  making training of 6 hour  skills a waste of time really lameskill queue changing skills through this website anything would do
this made me happy i dont know who first proposed it in the mining mkii thread a long time ago but i cant take credit for thinking of it
cost  everything other than conversion waste  ie isk for labsmanufacturetime delay etc  
ah well if you use the word cost to mean that then yeah true
moar dynamic needed
seems like you can escape concord
oh why notdoes make sense on the insurance payout part of it at least
i agree and hope to see measures taken in a swift manner
there should be no insurance payout if a ship is destroyed by concord
well make it minimum of 1 of avarage item price not 001 isk fixed
not supported at allif they want to change the price every 5 minutes they obviously want it more than you do
i dont believe that anyone wants to sit in front of his screen to monitor and modify sell orders every 5 minutes its only a compulsion and a spiral of greed and stupid market mechanics if someone wants to make big money with buysell orders he does not want to watch and change the price every 5 minutes but rather he is forced to do so due to the current market system
sadly i dont think there are any caldari pvpers on the csm if the nighthawk issue is anything to go by the csm will just say lolcaldari  go pve and vote it down
hm on second thought im undecided what about precision heavy assault missiles then to make it fair
there are no precision rockets or torpedoes eitherquickedit im not saying there should be im merely observing that such a missile class is not present in the other shortrange missile classes
im not entirely sure eitherbut while precision heavies should obviously be fixed doing only that puts a strong disincentive on using heavy assault launcherseg torpedoes obviously have their own role compared to cruise missiles with heavy assault missiles i dont see it that clearlyadmittedly i have t2 hams trained in addition to t2 hms and see myself more or less only using them on hulls which have boni for them already if precision heavies were fixed i personally wouldnt eg ever fit hams on a drake or such so less varietyheavy missiles and heavy assault missiles are more or less meant to hit cruiser sized targets now many cruiser sized targets travel quite fast these days resulting in both missiles types often not being adequate for the taskan increase of both heavy missile types explosion velocity maybe plus fixing precision of course thus a no from me for only fixing precision ones
hams grid is a much larger problem than any other stat about them tbh the grid they consume just cripples some caldari ships that would be happy to use themanyways i would not personally be in favor of a precision style variant of any t2 unguided missile its out of flavor and unnecessary ham drakes can dump 600dps into a target at warp disruption range  all the while being more agile than a harbinger and still sporting a very large buffer tank the ability to hit distant or fast ships is a worthy trade for the sum odd 25 dps increase from hams t2 hams also have javelins which allow them to play the minihml game and is in line with the other short range weapon system long range t2 ammofixing ragefury missiles should be done along with fixing all other broken t2 ammo in the case of precisions at least its a normally good ammo thats just edly broken at a specific tier
i vote to remove jade from hisher spot on csm
i vote to remove jade
you forgot to check the boxjust sayin
vote against removing jade just to balance out the id people that are personally insulted for a wardec and dont even understand what this thread is about
i predict that in november  when i step down from csm chair at the time of the next election  this thread will have 900 supports and i suspect i could run permarun my nanocerbs mwd on power derived from the emo tears expressed by the posters here
if i could vote against the idea i would but i am typing it out herei am voting against the removal of jade
this or go down the drainthumbs downyawn
i vote for the removal of jade the recent exploits by sf to try to crap all over fw and deccing only certain militia corps tells me he is not a good representative of the communityhis arguments are drivel of words as he tries to confuse you with obscure terms that have no relevance to the discussion he doesnt listen to anyone that has an opposing view he just dismisses them as everyone else is wrong and he is righteous and right this is unacceptable
in a position such as chair of a comittee you can hardly please everybody even some of the timeso if everybody hates you id wager youre doing as good a job as can be expectedas a result i lol at this thread especially as the person who brought it up isnt even on the csm the members of which should surely feel far more aggrieved and if they truely do believe that changing the chair is the right course of action are pretty remiss in their failure to do so without prompting from the forums
in my experience jade does two things1  talks  types alot2  listens and debates based on the facts as presentedbut thank god someone has an opinion hell where would we be without people who were righteous
some facts to rain on your paradea  you are the kind of person to scream exploit  on an alt  when youve been wardecced by another participant in an open pvp game b  you are the kind of person that never responds to an argument with logic and merely twists and turns and makes insults of your own c  you are the kind of person that gets upset when i dont afford you the status of other posters that register opinions with their main accounts and keep their temper under control in the course of debates no ayrianna nagaya you are unacceptable and your arguments are poor feel free to a  cry me a river and b  vote for somebody else in the next election because if i wasnt opposed by people like you i wouldnt be doing my joband thats the truth of it
true words there dianabolic i was always going to annoy some people with a pro small unit pvp agenda in these elections

ive read through this forum and see valid arguments on both sides of the coin as to the discussions that t2 ships should not be the standard or the risk of loosing them should be high i agree to an extent but in a game where skill points continue to grow and characters gain more skills there is the assumption prompted by the design of the game itself that t2 ships and tech are the natural progression for players graduating to the next level of play in eve  if you gain skills and gain isk then you may buy x as expansive as eve is other options exist for players to experience the game without flying a t2 ship lets be realistic everyone wants to fly the bigger and better ships and t2 is the next logical step for players after playing the game for a few months poor insurance coverage for t2 ships may have an adverse effect on some players encouraging them on one hand to experience the next level of eve but then destroy their will to play after loosing their ship for whatever reasonalso as the wealth in eve is split between the haves and havenots in regards to access to valuable resources in 00  better belts better ratting etc  loosing a t2 ship for someone with access to wealthy resources is a fraction as painful as compared to someone without access to those resources remember that risk is subjective and has a different meaning to someone that can make 60 million isk in an hour and someone that can only make 1 million isk in the same time insurance should be used to balance this playing fieldive also noticed that an alternative to insurance that i have used is when a ship is lost i go buy and sell a gtc to compensate while it works for me i see an adverse balance in real world wealth affecting the balance of haves and havenots this is a discussion for another thread but i feel insurance may be used to help balance out of game concerns of gtc as a casual player i feel a bit confused i love eve for how forgiving it is with the real time skill training that allows me to attend conferences do my work effectively hang out with family friends etc on the other hand i am disheartened that eve that allows months of game time work to be lost because of making one mistake im left with a lovehate relationship with the game and asking myself is this the right game for a casual player like myself or isnt it from my experience as having lost several billion worth of ships through pvp mishaps or power outages eve doesnt have to go any further to prove its the most serious mmorpg out there in regards to assumed ingame risk on the part of the player however i have plenty of risk and challenge in my life i dont need to experience it in a computer game does the outlook on my life make me unworthy of flying a t2 ship or graduating to the next level of eve gameplay being a little more forgiving i think would retain more players that get a taste of next level and then decide to cancel their accounts in favor of a more forgiving less intense game i also feel that there is a bit of selection bias in who would come here to post on fixing insurance in two ways first obviously i feel that people who have lost a great deal of time and cash invested would want to see amounts increased second i feel that players that want the hardcore unforgiving environment to be maintained the voice that i feel is not being represented are those explayers that may have quit eve for greener pastures after having foolheartedly experienced the end game and lost invested time for a bad split second decision i offer a couple of potential scenarios that would resolve the issues as i see them to be1  leave insurance as it is but allow insurance to be gained to cover specific modulesimplants etc players who knowingly enter into high risk areasactivities have the option to purchase the additional insurance on said items to lessen  not negate  their potential losses2  increase pay out amounts of insurance to 6080 of purchase amount however subsequent insurance claimspayouts decrease with each subsequent claim in x time frame this version of insurance protects the casual player that makes a single bad decision but minimizes exploitability and doesnt coddle those that choose to live and die by the sword 3 some said that the influx of insurance isk would cause inflation how about increasing intial insurance amounts exponentially but upon loss of a ship the player received a new ship in lieu of isk in closing i think that a review of insurance is necessary providing a little bit more in insurance i think would help a long way in retaining players without sacrificing much of the hard core environment that many players enjoy
the problem with insurance is that it existsremove it completely and then it will be 100 fair
nothis is not correct  rp empire factions consider alliances as dissidentsalliances must be in 00 where they fight for their own empire they dont care about empire factionsfactional warfare is a mean for solo players or corps to regroup themselves and have some fun with pvp giving the ability to alliances  of about say 2000 people  joining is a nonsense
i support this this was an extremely useful tool and i have mourned its loss since the day it was removed
posted the same thing but asking that all 4 of those maps be separatedso maybe if we get tons of threads on it the csm will take it up with ccp
bring back the backup sonar display pleaseendorsed
whole ui needs a rework might as well add this one to the list
this not being in the game already is either a major oversight or some crazy technical issue i hope its not some crazy technical issue
this topid has been raised alreadythe exact same text was postedno one supported it then and he brought it here dispite thatyou have been notified
trolls go away  away i said you nasty little pestsok seriously  anyone else feels like giving constructive comments supportnot support 
this thread doesnt really belong here it is not an issue in any way likely to gain support from 5 of the eve populace it is not a fully fleshed out idea and in fact it doesnt seem to have been discussed in another area prior to now even if it were you provided no evidence of such a discussion so the csm has little to work with this is not a suggestions forum it is a forum for presenting pertinent issues to ccpfurthermore it is an entirely unnecessary addition which solves a problem which is only caused by the convergence of both a eula violation and an anal attitude about your character sheetill share the same sentiment as is stated in marcus gideons signature
its as fleshed out as it needs to be and its likelihood of getting enough support is for the op to decide its not spamparody and its not unreasonable in any fashion furthermore theres no rule anywhere saying that these topics have to be taken up elsewhere before being posted here  in fact most of the most successful assembly hall threads were posted here without any prior discussion dont support it if you dont like it but its legit
yes its within limits of the forum rules but honestly how many folks are going to hold this up and say this is what the csm is for as an exampleill stop being all anal but really lets use the forum for what its intended for and the fi forum for what its intended for
i looked through first 30 pages of ideas section and could not find a related thread where is it

uh no your unhappy because your skill screen is clutteredlol
what why unlearn skills at all just deal with the clutter youre now more skilled thanks to your brotherid be fine with this if we could unlearn then apply that sp to other skills that we would rather have but i dont think that is going to happen
it probably went back to 20052006  thread are autolocked now so create a new one i am just saying it should to to features and ideas  not that this is bad on the contrary this is something i would use to rid my character of the 2 industrial skills
definitely not supportedonly positive is that it could unclutter your skills panelnegativesallows destruction of character  minor destruction of database performance  major  this would either require an extra table to be joined to subtract unlearned skills when calculating your skillset or it would require deleting from the table of skills you learned if you are unfamiliar with databases deleting is almost always bad allowing deletes can open up security holes it can create fragmenting in the database and any loss of the datas history can cause referential integrity problems
id say bring the drone bay in line with the normal domi and you have a winner
do want
fixededitlink moved
all i really want is a light cruiser or battlecruiser with an astrometrics bonus it could have less damage and tank than most other ships of its class but still enough so that its not completely useless in clearing the sites it discovers
a tech2 hurricane is pure sex i would start training for exploration to fly that
yeah great ideaand lets call the gallente one galaxy  remember the star trek vessel enterprise is an exploration ship and rather king sized as well those guys were wise they knew that exploration requires a great deal of onboard resources 
want single player then dont play mmo games go install one and do there

i would like to propose the following modification to the generic empire channels ie minmatar amarr gallente and caldariput in an motd with a link to the rp corporation shortlist so that more people know its there
and what about linking that thing with the bounty office  making contracts for destruction etc

any thoughts or opinions on the current reimbursement percentages of insurance coverage for ships i feel that the amount insurance pays when a ship is lost is out of tune with the actual value and cost of ships anyone agree or disagree any thoughts on impact to economy if paid insurance amounts were increased is it even possible is it wanted etcalso is it possible for insurance to cover items other than shipsexpensive modules implants etcthanks in advance for discussion on this and if a previous thread exists i apologizethanks
well buy command ship for 150mln and you will get max 20mln from insurence d forget about fitting also
insurance should be about market price fluctuating with the market situationthis should also cover t2modules hm dunno
ive discussed my thoughts on this here  put simply marketbased insurance for everything
i assume this is a request for lowering insurance payout as anything else would be pretty braindead as a suggestion
i do not feel t2 ships should be fully covered or eve mostly covered correct me if im wrong but insurance is based upon actual build material costs this is pretty agreeable with t1 ships across the board  being able to fit and insure a domi with only a few million isk loss is proof  the only think left is t2 one of the purposes of t2 is the elevated risk in flying it but you cant have insurance cover a t2 ship otherwise people could invent insure selfdestruct repeat and make billions however if material build cost is drastically different then insurance maybe ccp should take a gander at it however i personally think there are many more important issues they should address first even when a cerberus was 3x what it costs now people agreed with this approach
why not just make everything freethe idea of some insurance for your ship means you dont loose everything if you cant afford to loose it then dont fly it
thanks for pointing me to the correct thread moving my thoughts there
market based insurance  ie if you can build an insurable item you can generate infinite free isk 1  i build a zealot2  i sell it for the billion or so i have in the wallet to my alt its easy because nobody else is stupid enough to buy it 3  i now insure it for like 300m thats roughly what the platinum cost would be4  i blow it up i now have 700m and obviously the billion in my alts wallet5  repeat6  7  profitany situation which takes average market prices instead of specifics obviously leaves it open to massive manipulation effects as well as the fact that everyone would fly their gear to syndicate to insure and blow it up for free isk as theres loads of stations with bugger all on the market can you see now why t2 insuring for what it costs would be bad insurance needs to be decreased or at the least stay as it is we dont need even safer pvp

too unfortunate that drones dont make that much damage to begin with
as the op said currently drone ships lack two things that give conventionalweapon ships the advantage damage mods and implants yes dedicated drone ships can get massive damage bonuses however drones are fairly weak to begin with and utility drones dont take advantage of any of those bonuses what drone ships needhighslot damage mod that uses hardpoints  trade gunslaunchers for drone damage drone rigs that arent useless  trading in cpu in massive quantities  no no drone implants to help with speed and durabilitymore drone space  drone ships are easily cripped by smartbombs and other drones

isnt it a bit unfair for those of use who like to use turrets either becasue of their race or weopon preferances have to wait so long to get t2 turretsthose that use missiles can just train for one class of missiles for instance cruise and not have to train anythingthing but that skill an the specialisation skill for that classwhile those that use turrets have to train all the other turret skills for instance large turrets they have to train all the skills for them to lv5 and their specilisation skill for all the different sizes of turret before them to lv4 aswell to get the t2 they wantthis makes it almost twice aslong to train for the t2 turrets than it would for someone to train for t2 nissilesshouldnt it be made more even so that it takes a equal amount of time for bothi think either make it so you dont have to train all those skills for the t2 turrets or make it so those who use missiles have to train more for their t2 missiles instead of being prejidice agasint those that use turrets or those that dont choose caldariagreed tech 2 weaponry is essential for fleet sniping and it currently takes way too long imosuggestion made by tzujeihmy obvious suggestion belowlarge t2 shortrange weapon specialization prereqslarge weapon turret vmotion prediction vgunnery vlarge t2 longrange weapon specialization prereqslarge weapon turret vsharpshooter vgunnery vmedium t2 shortrange weapon specialization prereqsmedium weapon turret vmotion prediction ivgunnery vmedium t2 longrange weapon specialization prereqsmedium weapon turret vsharpshooter ivgunnery vsmall t2 shortrange weapon specialization prereqssmall weapon turret vmotion prediction iiigunnery vsmall t2 longrange weapon specialization prereqssmall weapon turret vsharpshooter iiigunnery v
t2 weaponry is not essential for a sniping fleet it is a simply preferred that all ships be t2 fit now if you cant get it into your thick skull to quit messing with the game  far to much in my opinion  then go back to your moms basement real men play here boys play over in wow
i dont see anything wrong with the training times sure you can be using tii cruise missiles before tii large lasers but you have to train both torps and cruise missiles to v in order to use both tech ii short and long range missile options as opposed to both long and short range turret options being opened with large energy turret to v this means that it actually takes a little bit longer to max out missiles than gunnery and given that gunnery tends to be more highly regarded for pvp im not too unhappy with the longer training times for tech ii large guns
in addition t2 turrets are alot better than t2 missiles and all the skills you get to buff 1 type of turret buff another type if not all types of turrets where as missile are not that way and require essentially the exact same training
hello allissue 1 wardecs  issue 2 militia leadership issue 3 pvp point system final note  ccp you are on to something with fw its a whole new and wonderful dynamic to eve it just seems in a few areas which are easily overlooked need to be discussed and hopefully addressed
eve is a not very new player friendly game and the fastest way to learn eve is joining a corp with expirienced players i suggest that corps that excel at training new players should be rewarded concrete suggestionshow good is a corp at training newbsan anonymous questionnaire of the trained newbs could be thebasis for a rankingwhat reward something like between 1 and 10 milweek per newb dependingon the ranking additional the corps could gain standing improvents to the fraction of the newb or the galactic department of education   could have some cool and cheap training ships g  exploits if a newb is defined by the age of his account  maybe 6 month  there would notbe much room for exploits right
i have full support for the majority of the initiatives in the real space initiative for those concerned about a major programming change it would be mostly to frontend as i understand the majority of the backend could be implemented through existing mechanics obviously we as the playerbase would need to adapt but amongst other things i believe some of the ideas in the rsi would seriously help enforce the idea of huge cold dark empty and more dark space dremember not all the ideas need to be implemented at the same time it could be a staggered approach over 1218 months culminating in the collapse of the gate network and the introduction of navbeeks
agreed more guidelines on what to do and where would be good we see suggestions in gd fi and here people cant find them so make new ones and all in all it gets a bit messyi mean how many can we please make bpcs different to bpos threads have we had despite it being stickied in fi
i disagree it doesnt really matter where discussion happens as long as discussion happens thats the entire point of a forum in the first place to talk about stuff some things may not technically belong in the area its being posted in but if its getting real traffic and real discussion by the people who frequent that forum over another i say let it be it simply doesnt matterso some of the stuff that ends up here may end up being half baked lame brain ideas that whomever posted hasnt completely thought out welp you gotta take the good with the bad you cant have an open discussion about an issue if you start censoring about where or how its talked aboutbesides read some of the most discussed items on this or any other forum no matter how well thought out an idea or how good of an idea it may be it about 34 pages in it stops being about the idea itself but instead about the politics of the idea and how people feel about the idea all reasonable discussion simply breaks down if were all willing to read all that which most of us do on the off chance some nugget of genius is contributed well i think we can all live with reading some of the more out there ideas that end up on this forum who knows if you change it a little you could keep to the spirit of the idea and end up with something completely new and good
hello therei read somewhere that the csm was lacking issues from pirates well ill try and do my best at explaining something i have been thinking a bit about1 imo it should be possible to get a systems sec changed as in why does a 04 system get to keep its sec rating when a lot of kills happens in that system there should be a way of getting the system bumped down if enough kills happens in target system pr day or something like it still the limit should be that systems clasified as lowsec should still not be able to go lower than 01 or higher than 04  basicly the idea is based on that you have certain limitations in 04 eventhou its still clasified as lowsecif it was possible to bump the system security down it would actually make us pirates feel like were doing something  on a larger scale  some are prolly gonna say go to 00 and get sov  but thats not what were talking about here2 why does there need to be limitations of a 04  its not like its more secure than a 3 or lower if i sound confusing which im know by friends to do then please ask constructive questions and ill try and answer the best i canim also hoping that a csm will take this up and prove that you are listening to all players of the game  
yea can we have some semblance of order  ever i mean yea there are some ideas that were migrated from the features and ideas discussion forum to the assembly hall because they were fairly important parts of the gameplay like the pos dead horse issue csm should address issues and ideas that impact an extremely large population or at least a significant aspects of the game better yet give features and ideas discussion forum the thumbs upthumbs down feature so the assembly hall is not used as a substitute of popularity we need some sort of moderation to clean this place up
i dont really think the two are comparable the sort of thing the csm were talking about  if i remember correctly  isnt really possible at all the way things work now which means it would pretty much require creating a new role to accomplisha solo exploration ship like youre talking about is just putting two existing roles together the problem is that combining those roles sort of defeats the purpose of having separate roles in the first place which is to encourage group participation it also circumvents the tradeoff that every other person making money in 00 has to deal with specifically that you need to either spend a lot of effort have some friends or have proper 00 infrastructure  poses or outposts mainly  in order to make money effectively in 00 i expect youd get the same response if you wanted a combned miningrattinghauling shipi read through the last thread and it seemed like there wasnt much reason for why such a ship was needed rather than just wanted if theres a better reason out there than i should be able to do anything in the game solo and why do you hate my playstyle out there i would think that either the csm or ccp would listen
popoi i really dont see how a solo exploration ship makes exploring in 00 easy or riskfree that doesnt make any sense to me you are flying a large bulky pve vessel into enemy territory without any scoutingthe reason for it is very simple it would provide a fun way to make some isk that at the same time requires a considerable risk providing new targets to pirates the current common methods of doing exploration resemble farming just like every other isk making activity and require far less risk than they do grinding the most common solution to requiring different roles sadly isnt teamwork but staying local and reaping the same systems over and over  andor alts  give me a ship that is good enough to discover and complete exploration sites that are at least considerably more valuable than what you could find in highsec and i will gladly take the risk it still wouldnt be nearly as efficient as having safe access to 00 and the ability to farm the most valuable sites in your parked battleship it shouldnt be more efficient than good teamwork eitherwould it really be so bad to give us one alternative to l4 grinding or hulk mining that actually incites us to move and take a riskright now there is just nothing in the game i really enjoy doing on a regular basis so most of the time i am just not playing this would be one thing i could get excited about  bounty hunting is another  i dont care for the rewards they just have to be potentially high enough that the activity doesnt feel completely meaningless  compared to much safer and easier activities like exploring in highsec 
its hard to argue a need to do anything solo of course there is no need i could do missions in a permatank raven in motsu and travel a massive one jump back to my salvage boat in order to loot and salvagethe playstyle of solo exploration already exists it may not be intended im not sure as it involves the player being tethered to a station its a lot like a yoyo and makes what could potentially be an awesome solo experience into a grindthe ships that would be combining roles of would be part recon part covops and part industrialthe standard lowsec00 exploration tools of the trade are a covops and pilgrimyou go out godknowshowmanyjumps in your covops until you find something soloable usually hacking and archsalvage sites then you travel godknowshowmanyjumps back to your pilgrim then travel godknowshowmanyjumps back to the site do the site then travel godknowshowmanyjumps back to your covopsthe sites im talking about arent difficult it doesnt take a bc or battleship you can easily do them in tech 1 cruisers or afs the pilgrim isnt some massive damage dealer its a vexor with a cloakso the combining of roles isnt so true if you were to take the pilgrim and replace the tracking disrupter and neutnos bonuses with 10 cargo capacity and 10 exploration probe time bonuses youd have a great exploration ship it wouldnt be able to solo everything but for the stuff that is soloable it could do that well enough without having to yoyo so many jumpsto be clear it is the yoyoing of solo exploration that ruins it for me like others have said i dont need the fat loots i dont even care if it isnt more profitable than missioning in motsu with all of the traveling involved it definitely isnt and even without yoyoing mission running is probably on average higher because a lot of the stuff isnt selling so well anymore
oh god why is it just the covops cloak why not just a ratting bs that has better dps far better tank and is actually insurabletheres no reason to do this one at a time a much better method would be to probe out a bunch of stuff then come back sometime within the next 3 days and run them all at once of course thats rough on a cruiser hulls cargo bay which creates even further mystery around using a pilgrimi cant remember ever running a 00 exploration site that wouldnt have melted a cruiser  except maybe a hac  in short order i guess you could do it against serpentis or bloodsso basically if you took a combat ship made it slightly worse at combat then made it equally as good as the best probing ship at probing it would be fine youre right that doesnt sound like combining roles at all its just putting a combat ship into a role thats notorious for having no combat ability at all i suspect theres a reason beyond simple inertia that ccp hasnt released a combatcapable astrometrics shipi should point out that it is entirely possible to fit a ship  bigger than a cruiser at least  that can probe and tank it took me about 10 seconds to modify my dominix fitting to do so its going to be pretty bad at probing since its not an astrometrics ship but it prevents yoyoing and it satisfies both roles required for exploration just not as well as two specialized ships would
yes a combat cruiser with an explorationonly probe bonus not recon probe bonusexploration didnt exist when either role was created exploration was not a consideration at allccp overlooks things and makes mistakes do not take the selfassuming argument of it is so therefore it is intended you dont know thatalso i know the pilgrim isnt some beast of a ship its simply enough to get the job done yes the covops cloak is the most important part youd be surprised how popular heavy dictors are in lowsec gatecamps by far more risky than some battlecruiser rats as i said you can do them in a vexor they dont take much they are just too much for a covops to tankneither am i saying it isnt possible to solo right now ive clearly stated that it is possible to solo them right now you could do it with a nonastrometrics ship or by yoyoinga new ship class will always be both a lazy and greedy requestdo not fool yourselves into thinking otherwiseboth marauders and black ops were wanted by someone that somebody else would consider lazy and greedyyes its a greedy and lazy request as will be every single thing the csm ever requestsno matter what the issue is you will never find it undeniably necessary every single addition and change eve has ever gone through has faced oppositionremote dddno stacking penaltiesweak concordganginvite gankingeverything none of it was necessaryexploration ships arent necessary nothing will ever bean exploration ship will simply improve the experience of solo explorersan exploration ship would not worsen the experience of anybodythat is all you really need to look at leave the rest up to ccp to decide
you know after all the whining i have seen on this forum i have to say this actually is a valid point and to the  who said slaves dont work on capitals tell that to my superior armour on my nid with my hg slave set
while i stand in agreement that farmers must go your idea needs to be flushed down the nearest toilet burned then thrown into outer space adding cans to the list of stuff to probe is going too far its a can obviously if you fail at scanning adding one more thing to scan for is not going to make you betternow please for the love of god almighty stop with the nerf this patch that  on the forums thank you
i agree with the op all cans should be probable

i was specifically disturbed by the utter lack of concern for explorers when you guys discussed the exploration ship ideasome sites arent solo content like unknown and gas cloud sites but others are i solo hacking and archeology sites in my buzzard and pilgrim theyre definitely soloable its just the traveling part that is annoying an exploration ship would help this playstylebut none of you play this way so nobody cared but voted against it anyways
so our csms became what our player owned ccp puppets  the travesty this is becoming
i have absolutely no intention of not considering  and forwarding  further ui issues i want them  indeed ive asked for them on the forums so that they can be put forward the ui makes the most difference to the most players because it is something that we use every single minute that we are piloting in new edenui issues indeed no issues other than those explicitly already covered should be considered locked until the end of the csm term and that is not what i was suggesting this is about things which have been discussed by the csm and either put to ccp or where the csm decided it could not support the idea in the best interests of the majority of players there have also been issues which we needed and sought further information about  capital ships etc  which will be ongoingiz
so whos to decide that an issue is identical to one that was already discussed because see we are gamers you are gamers and we all know how gamers think so if someone really ever feels the need to bring up an issue for review a second or even third time we all know how the argument will roughly be going no last time we discussed changing amarr battleship color to blue thats not the same as discussing changing it to light blue because bluelight blue qed now exchange that silly example for a more serious issue and it might in some cases really become difficult to decide and taken to the other extreme it leaves room for abuse too this is market stuff again we already discussed some market issues once and this is just different market issues so as far as im concerned the same boring stuff next issue pleasethe acting chair obviously cannot be the one to make that decision as he is likely the one bringing up the repeat issue so force the real chair to decide  sorry but id kindly ask you to rather minimize the opportunity for further whaaa whaaa jade did bad things to me type of drama that doesnt look like a productive use of council time reallythe most reasonable way would surely be a quick vote if somebody thinks that an issue is a repeat the rest of the council votes wether or not they agree to delete it from the agenda of course they could just as well vote down the issue itself then stating that they do so because they think its already been discussed before  in which case you dont need any special rule at allif the majority of the council doesnt want to raise an issue again they can easily vote it down if the majority however wants to bring it up again i dont see any harm in letting them and considering issues that repeatedly receive the neccesary percentage of voter support a rule not only allowing but even forcing the council to ignore such a large part of the people they should represent seems pretty ridiculous to memaybe it would help if you could give an example of the kind of issue this rule should be targeting anything voted on so far that you feel needs to be prevented from being brought up again or anything on the horizon that you think the council will get spammed with  maybe a better wording for the rule could be found if you could make clearer what it should actually be good for
i am assuming that i am probably completely daft however i have seen several threads where people talk about how they have read discussions on their issues and were happy or unhappy about it i see the csmmeeting minutes section on the website here however i do not see the ones from the trip to iceland we even appear to have minutes from a meeting after that one but where did it goam i missing something are these out there and i just cant find them
theres still missing 3 of the initial minutes that were submitted before the trip to icelandbut from what i can see there was a small delay on the minutes from iceland due to ankh having some rl trouble   but the minutes are being looked trough on our internal mailinglist to make sure nothing was missed hopefully we will send it off to ccp soon
there is a post on the scrapheap forums about the iceland meeting which jade hardin and others have posted to i know jade has posted a link but i dont know what it was
seeing as darius and bane are the only delegates who arent carebears im pretty satisfiedalso im not gay or anything but bane is the hottest of the bunch
no cause i voted canadian yeah to the dude who was running for csm from canadacanadians know how its done
i actually forgot who i voted for but to be fair it doesnt really matter who i did vote for it only mattered when i was taking that vote the voting is in essence a tool to get a diverse as possible group together that can address more then just one single issue if all csm members came from the same type of players pvpers miners traders rpers possers you name it i would have been sorely dissapointed but so far im seeing lots of different issues and problems being pointed out so im happy with whoever got my vote againno if only one of those csm personalities would be so kind to champion the af cause id be completely happy
a similar idea would be to use the idea of actual assets to determine wardec cost assets could be members isk controlled space whatever the difference in assets between the wardec corpalliance and the target alliancecorp would determine the cost a larger alliance declaring war on a small one would cost a lot of money while small against large would be significantly lessanother method for fixing the endless war issue is attrition the longer you are at war with someone the more it costs keep the current more people  more money in place however for each consecutive week the war continues it would double in cost this way it becomes prohibitively expensive to prevent a war against you and it also keeps a person from declaring war on you for too long furthermore after a war is over there is a cooldown timer on the cost after a week the wardec cost gets cut in half continually until it is back down to the original price that should keep wardecs from pausing then reactivating for base price and give a bit of cooldown on the psuedoinvulnerability
disclaimer  i am not a pvper so im posting here as an outside observer looking in im an empirehugger and im just going by what people are posting here  elsewhereif 00 pvp consists of blob and pos warfare and empire pvp consists of experienced pirates deccing relatively defenceless empire carebear corps just to get something to shoot at  then it looks to me that there is something inherently broken not with war decs but with pvp in general whats left low sec  fw from what i understand thats turning into a nice pretty blobfest as wellif people are really so desperate to find pvp in what is welladvertised as a pvp game then there is something badly wrong with the mechanisms in game that allow pvp to happen im posting on an alt here because my main is in a deccable corp and as my response to a war dec is 1  to go away and cry a bit and then 2  sit in station training skills until the nasty people go away and i dont want someone to spend a couple mil to grief me   yes im spineless and i like being an invertebrate
hows about a compromisewardeccing doesnt raise in cost by number of wardecsandwardeccing somebody lets anyone shoot you anywhere legally  if it isnt consentual so itd be like you bribing concord to not stop you from shooting corp x but at the same time they cease defending you entirelywardec is an act of aggression and should have unforgiving consequences imo
according to what jade wrote on the scrapheap thread ccp prefers we all pay with credit cards directly to them they recognize some people want to pay isk for their monthly game and have the gtc option open but that as eve is a premium game they believe their customers understand a premium is warranted  paraphrasing 
its fine with me for every pubby that likes to talk about goons as if were all remedial theres 5000 people that will shoot you ingame and never vote for youjade is a douche
i dont care if someone insults goons or goonswarm as an entity at all its amusing on so many different levels however lumping thousands of people together in real life and declaring you hate every last one of those people because they hail from a particular fictional internet spaceship guild is just childish and moronic no matter how you cut it whatever your affiliation may be the csm is a real life entity and your eve corpalliance is not even the conversations you have with characters ingame should be taken with a grain of salt one can only hope people see the difference there and act accordinglyhowever seeing as how jade responds with what amounts to roleplaying ingame rubbish every time someone mentions a goon i think my trust is likely misplaced someone asks him a csm question and he invariably responds with irrelevant bs about 00 politics or goon alts please step one of being an effective chair would be to separate reality from fiction after that youre on your own ccp obviously isnt going to provide you with any help
having read some of the feedback from recent meetings and the csm visit to iceland i have to give most hearty congratulations to the entire csmyou folks did the eve community proud youve represented brought feedback and your work will make our little virtual world a better placethank you  and congratulations on a job very well done
there has been a lot of discussion over the csm its effectiveness professionalism etc i think the following quote from the new york times article really says it alli have to tell you that i have been involved in eu meetings where the participants were not as prepared and professional as what weve seen here he said referring to the european union these players have approached this meeting with what seems like real understanding of their roles they are not just fighting for their particular interests but seem to be very socially responsible in wanting to represent all the players of eve perhaps some realworld politicians could learn from thema statement like that from a professional all i can say is that im glad to have these folks representing usill say it again  and hopefully not for the last time  great job csm
in game we earn each others hate and respect through competition on all levelsirl we are all eve players and have much more in common than people will usually considerid liken the csm more to a collection of sports players that were nominated and voted on by their peer ball playerson the field they are enemies and will do anything to defeat the other team who you are off the field is up to the individual ive faith in the professionalism of all of the csm delegates now that theyve met irl now maybe they can discuss the issues in an offthefield manner instead of ingame enemies
any1 no wat happened with this topic that was made i no csm said ccp was making a topic about it soon but that was like 34 weeks ago right any1 no wether they have changed it to normal again or r they keeping it like this
as i understand it  from a post jade made  ccp is replacing the gtcs of various values  30 50 90 and 100 days  with 60 day cards to eliminate the admin headaches the different cards created and the change was not really open for discussion
the full reply is listed somewhere in the 22 pages at

as a phoenix pilot i gladly signed
yeah it definately needs to be looked at
did you ever think that maybe they did no damage because they never fired a volley in the first place or maybe they just started firing just as that mothership diedusing killmails to determine how much damage a ship dealt is arbitrary because so many differet variables can be in place you have no clue when the phoenix started firing nor do you know how many defenderssmartbombs were being used if any at all however i still think it should be looked at because even though you poorly showed us some examples i could see how the citadels could be gimped from personal experience
i dont have much experience with capitals but id assume that all the caps cynoedwarped in and sieged at the same time so it would be reasonable to assume that the zero damage indicates a fundamental problemwhat this thread really needs is a consensus whether citadels should be vulnerable to smartbombs if they should be vulnerable it needs to be decided exactly how vulnerable they should be for that well need some modelling involving numbers and types of smartbombs on typical capitals numbers of capitals in a range of engagements  and their proximity to each other  the speed and ehp of citadel torps and estimates of the typical kill  of citadel torps in each environmentas i said i have minimal experience with capitals but i dont really see why citadels should be vulnerable to smartbombs at all no other xl weapon systems can be intercepted in this fashion and a comparison with dps lost by tracking issues on xl turrets are dealt with by the sig radius and explosion factors and the large sig and low speed of the intended target capitals
sound and reasonable idea

two thumbs up i wouldnt mind giving more people build access with view only access to or locked down bpos and limited mineral stockpiles but the ability to cancel a capital ship job which just throws out all the minerals that went into it is too big of a risk

you should be able to choose the colors green and red are really bad for color blind people to see for example you can choose color onyellow color off blue color offlining blinking white
i support this
100 support im not color blind and i have trouble seeing what of my 8 guns are firing and have to approach the screen to confirmtoo much alpha on all those module pictures not to mention some of them still have boxed outlines  for example fit a catalyst destroyer with 4x tractors 4x salvagers and youll see what im talking about you can see the bottom left corners of the image on the salvagers and tractors all across your top row
should have been done a long time ago
i would recommend an ingame solution a skill setequipment fittings that allows entering a system that keeps your presence hidden in local  within game and on the log server 
can we get an issue thread going to bring back bacon but integrated into evehaving to watch some chat channel to determine if a hostile has entered the system is rather dumb whats a chat channel got to do with flying a ship like an above poster said aurora should do a hostile detected or friendly detectedeve client is seriously lacking a decent ui and an optimal one should be one that doesnt have to be babyset and fought just to make your intentions realized and having to stare at some small portion of a screen for an almost tacit update  its ridiculousyou guys must all be real proud of the chat channel vulturing skills that you have is that even a worthy skill i can vulture over the chat channel for people joining and leaving the channel like its nobodys business wow  mad skills lol
id recommend this package  or something similar 1 have a small chance for a datacore  or something valuable  to drop from mining veld in only losec regions2 ability to deploy a small warp stabilization bubble3 a mining ship with the cargo space of a covetor and a tank of a drake  or better than a drake s
i only want more cargo space for my mining cruiser and a bit more cpu power so i can have 4 lasers and would be nice to have npc to haul the ore back to the station for medont need or want low secs
you do realize that a hulk can fit two t2 upgrades to the covetors single t1 and that between that and the exhumer skill bonus a hulk mines 25 more than a covetor 1100 to 1400 m3min is quite a jump not to mention that the hulk can tank many of the rats in 00mining skills and ships are fine it is the variety of trit heavy ores that is lacking add new trit heavy ore to lownull sec
yes im all for it

rtfs we are not talking about the wardec system but that of the choice and a button for a war decd fw corp to ask for help from other fw corps within the same faction
not really that silly of a question but the answer to that is that ccp so far stated they dont want that as the big 00 players could then enter fwmaybe they will change that but if not the above suggestion seems imho a reasonable workaround for the unsatisfying situation we have right now so bringing it up cant hurt if ccp then says theyll change the whole thing anyway fine nothing lostregarding esmenet the problem is you have mixed fleets of many corps in fw all these corps would have to wardec the aggressor on their own meaning the price for the wars would skyrocket under current rules meaning effectively it cant be donefw is id say the only part of eve where you get so many fleets consisting of so many different independant corps in empire space and these are not really that independant but pledged to a common cause so i think one can justify an exception to normal rules
so whatthe militia is not an alliance its just a loose organisation to fight the other militias so if your corp is beeing wardecced for whatever reason your corp should follow the normal wardec mechanics for corps and if you want to involve more corps to help you then they need to actively start a wardecotherwise it just turns into a extra protection for highsec corpsif you want a change to this you should open for the possibility to wardec the whole militia similar to what you can do with an alliance
i still dont think you get the point to this vote please refrain from posting irrelevant information if you have a valid reason against allowing fwcorps to assist other war decd fw corps please go ahead
so what happens when tims brigade wardecs leet warrors both of them members of the state factionis a third corp in the faction able to wardec both of them for freeand yes this could matter especially for some of the rp corporations
its not the ability of fw corps to war dec for the last time
i would only put external wardecs on the list of wars other militia corps can join in on something like your empire supporting the thing with concordrp wise someone would have to pull conords strings or pay upi wouldnt imagine them doing that for internal strife
signed100 behind this proposal
i support this idea
signedi am not a member of fw but this sounds like a needed game change regardless
i heartily support the ability to aid my fellow militia members as a small nonprofit corp i think this is extremely important and i think that the emphasis on free or cheap buyins would be crucial
want to fight an empire youre welcome  no offense to jade still some mechanic bits like whos declaring whom and the mechanics likely these new militia counterwars would need to be additionally considered mutual wars and to be used only against nonmutual incoming wardecs however you then again shouldnt be able to use the militia as a freelyjoinable alliance to fight deal with a mess youve made yourself in this case getting wardecd  but this is again a can of worms since quite naturally we cant expect all corps to join a militia be not in an incoming war though the good sides outnumber the bad ones in this suggestion
it sure seems like your proposal is to allow fw corps to opt into a war another fw corp is already in this allows the aiding corp to effectively go to war with whoever declared war on their fellow corpmy example was a possibly situation in which the aiding corp could be at war with both corps if they are all in the same faction reasons for wardeccing within a faction would include things like pirates hiding in the factionlucai understood my example and i think provided a sufficient mechanic to not allow this to happen for corporations within the same militia
sorry if i misunderstood your argument it was quite unclear
100 support from me
free so if i want to warmonger i could sign up to a militia and declare war freely on anyone that is at war with anyone else in my militia i think free is too far perhaps 12 cost or something it isnt like the militias are that close in relationship perhaps the whole war declaration thing should be revamped
we arent saying fwcorps should have ability to war dec for free not at all just aid others through corpceos votes to join within a current war between a nonfw and fw corp like alliances ok maybe a small fee should occur and standard war procedures met but the option should be freely available
great idea and lovely to hear it got a favourable reception from ccp if all the fittings it took was a wcs or two and a cloak it would make hauling larger quantities of stuff from lowsec a little more comfortable than flying up and down 20 times through that gatecamp in an occy oh and if anybody wants to propose a superfreighter they have my support too i dont buy this hardly ever use it thing my 900k obelisk is full up  again

evemon is a third party program that isnt endorsed by ccp therefore shouldnt be needed to play the game nuff said
right the functionality of evemon and eft should be part of the eve  clientin fact without those programs you are more or less left clueless about stuff like how long will my tank hold how much punishment can my ship take etcthis is another issue
longest overdue feature in eve
we should make a signature for a skill queue so the developers see the massive public need for this featurealso everybody supporting this idea may have a look at my bio ingameto be honest what we really want is a dev blog saying we are going to include a skill queue system or dual skill training whatever with the next patcha negative response to this would make me reevaluate the customer orientation of ccp tbhagain this is not about making this a total afk  game or something this is about comfort this is about getting rid of the half done skill problem  which is annoying as hell  and this ccp    is about giving your paying customerbase a feature that almost everyone wantslets see what the response is
im in favor of a skill queue provided skills stop training within some reasonable time of not having an active account immediately up to a week seems fair to meon a related note i want alts to train skills too
if you had to decide between queued training and training while unsubscribed which would you choose ccp is likely concerned about the impact of training queues on peoples second and third account subscriptions and thats not really something they can easily tell their player base at the very least its something they should very well be concerned about but which the average player will likely be fairly unsympathetic toward
queued training if i was ccp i would have never implemented training while unsubscriped this is unfair towards ccp as well as the playerbase
i doubt there will be an official response cause you see its good for the ccp to have you train one skill at a time so you wont progress too fast and get bored with the game so they can suck more money out of youcant say i blame them for wanting money but as their client i hate itits the same as allowing autopilot to warp directly to the gate with out wasting hours crawling there as usualwe pay for the account though so i think we also should have all our alts train skills at the same time i dont see any other reason for not letting us do this then just ccps corp greed

the oremineral problems could be solved by having the high end ore  abc etc  include a lot more lowend stuff that would actually solve two birds with one stone  00 would have a good deal less importing from empire  freighter runs comprised solely of tritanium ugh  on the low ends so less grinding the mineral prices for low ends would be reduced due to lower demand and the high ends would increase due to increased demand this generates a better profit in 00  something a lot of people have been complaining about improvements to refining techniques occurs when youve trained advanced reprocessing skills  advanced oretype processing  advanced ice processing could yield a scratch amount of lowend minerals  mineral contaminates in the ice etc  as well as some additional ice products lowend and lower midrange asteroids  veldspar scordite basically all the ores whose current processing ranks are 1 and 2  would simply yield more  of their own minerals higher midrange and highend asteroids  current rank 3 and 4 processing  would yield significantly more lowend minerals  trit pyerite  some additional midrange minerals  mexallon isogen  and remain constant for high end minerals  nocxium and up advanced scrapmetal processing would be at a disadvantage here if you further increase its yield you end up to a point where its a useless skill  implants allow 100 refine everywhere with  basic  scrapmetal processing 5 even at outposts  so to remedy the situation to allow it to have some useful purpose advanced scrapmetal processing could reduce the yield modifier at starbase refineries  currently theres always a minimum 25 waste there except for ice  advanced scrapmetal processing would allow you 3 reduced waste per level when using a refining array anchored at a friendly starbase which means the best yield you could get there would be 90  using a mediumintestive refining array  this is still significantly less than you could get at any outpost even including many alliances taxes this would allow nonalliance entities a better chance at gaining income from 00  at the increased risk of being attacked by xenophobes or neighboring enemies thats my suggestionbut by far and wide i completely agree that the whole industry system especially mining needs to have another look and changed ive been saying that incorp since before revelations 1 was released so support  1
this needs to be fixed sooner rather than later i dont see why everything needs the same two types of moon mins they should have the different races needing different moon mins with maybe the caldari getting the most expensive moon mins

i agree this issue needs looking athas the idea of asteroids containing moon minerals spawning in exploration sites not come up  this would do something for mining and for exploration but both really require a more serious overhaul  the industrial side of eve is in the dark ages compared to the pew pew side
waratron is right about one thing sov needs to be reimaginedi went digging through the database and was stunned by somethingbase mineral pricescobalt 800platinum 1600dysprosium 25600promethium 25600if akita is correct about base mineral prices  im not going either way because i honestly dont know  then something is upsettingly wrong with moon mineral prices theyre all horribly inflated i guess on one hand it boils down to pos upkeep costs a 100cobalt per tick moon wont even cover the cost of a small tower even though cobalt is 2750 more expensive than its base price yet a promethium mine will cover the cost of a whole sov network and still yield profit something is wrong herei dont like to provide a problem without a reasonable solution but it seems to me that the fixed supply of moon minerals is a flawed creation perhaps its okay that tritanium is empires bistot as long as the players make that call through supply  demand however the amount of available moon minerals yielded every hour can be summarized down to the number of available moons and i dont mean the hundreds or thousands that dont yield profitrethinking the sovereignty system is a slippery slope that i just dont want to get in to i am not nearly optimistic enough to see it ever steering in a positive direction that being said i think making the worthless moons more valuable is only a quick fix moon minerals should not be a limited supply item no matter how you portion out the twenty kinds of moon minerals their prices are going to share a direct correlation with the number of moons that can be towered not the amount of production hours performed by players
two problems with suicide ganking today1  today there appears to be no risk to suicide ganking2  there also is no real way to counter it other then using a second account i have not read one post which successfuly proves otherwise on either point i do think that suicide ganking is a bit unbalanced as it stands todayif the suicide gankers feel that completely removing insurance eliminates suicide ganking then what would a resonable penalty  payout beshow some reasonable math to show a balanced approach to the situation not i dont like mission runners so i want a risk free way to kill them at will
definately something should be done about hisec suicide ganking because there is no risk for those that do it if it hurts for those that are victim to it then there should be a large risk for it in hisec space if i rob a guy in the middle of a big city in one of the safe countries in the world im gonna get arrested and put in jail big risk however if the reward is big enough someone is gonna take it no matter the risk things shouldnt be done to stop it but things should be done to make it painful and risky for those doing it support

i am definitely against this UFFFDber lame idea it is even at this moment absoluetly impossible to get high sec ganked unless you act like a complete moronrisk vs reward not even 10 should be entirely risk free for people hauling billions of worth modules in their ships made out of wet paper bags in the history the security of empire has been toughened several times each time has meant going to worse stop that ccp people supporting ideas like this just want only the reward without the risk it is wrong grief them out of the game please
there ya go fixed it for ya no need to thank me
no please not suicide ganking is one of the things that make me smile when i read the cp  forum i love the carebear whines

what a load of bull it is very easy to create that risk just slap in med slots full of shield extenders most likely the ganker will miscalculate assault fail lose his ship but not get any rewardthats what i always do my innocent looking haulers are actually quite as touch as battleships some people even have fallen into it it always makes my day imho you skilless lame newbie dorks should learn how to play the game instead of whining
forced oh no maybe you could do these thingsa  sellbuy something elseb  sellbuy somewhere elsebut okay say you change it so you cant mess with your orders every 5 minutes make it 24 hours unless you cancel the order then what your power trader will make them for smaller quantities to avoid hellish broker fees and cancel and remake as needed they will train their skills get their standings and make it as virtually painless as it is to 01 isk danceoh wait much like the current system of who wants it more gets it
not supported but can hopefully can offer some constructive advice to the optrading is like pvp and avoiding 001 iskers can be thought of like avoiding piratesdo notdont sell popular items at major trade hubs people who have millions of sp in trade skills can change their orders from anywhere in the region and usually have very slick systems for checking and changing ordersdont manufacture stuff that drops in rat loot a lot far worse than the 001 isk brigade is some noob who drops the price by thousands of isk or more 001 isk is pro trader stuff those 001 isks add up when youve 70 large orders openremember pvp is about assesing the competition going head to head with the best jita traders is like pvp in 00 so dont go in unless youve taken the relvaent precautions like watching and understanding a market before manufacturing the goodsdoconsider the buyer if youre making interceptors think about selling them at entrances to 00 so some pod can make it past the gate camp maybe sell on contract with basic fittings  low end t1 frigs placed at noob start up stations ice mining lasers in systems with ice belts etc etcif you can perform a service to someone they will pay a moderate premium for the goods and you can rake it in while the supposed pros are locking horns and loosing money 001 isk at a time plus you never have to go into jita consider training the following skills  trade lvl 3 retail lvl 3 daytrading lvl 4 shouldnt take too long and will allow you to controll a enough trades to gather any resources you need and sell your stock without the need to sit in a trade station eg if someone outprices you while youre mining 15 jumps away then one click of a mouse and youre on top again basic tax skills are nice if you sell a lot of goodsremember that manufacturing is about final profit wheras trading is about turnover a traders profit is limited by the number of goods they can shift but a manufacturers profit is limited to what they can produce so it is often still worth the traders while to sell at a very small margin over the mineral cost often the trader wont know much about mineral cost but will sell for under mineral value due to smart buy order placementdo get info on your competition some traders will sell at a specific x69isk or x33isk like a tag and dropraise the price by 1 isk at a time so look out for this also if you are competing against a small number of people consider filling one unit of their order to get their name bookmark them and change your order when they go to bedsorry about the essay but trading is a complex game of psychology any attempt to nerf what is for me nothing to do with the isk and everything to do with understanding people and their motivations whould be very sad

i disagree i think it makes sense that if a ship is under the exclusive ownership and control of one pilot all of that pilots skills should apply in determining what the cargo capacity of the ship is regardless of whether it is the active ship if a ship is packed to the gills with stuff and then given to another pilot or loaded onto a carrier then so long as a different pilot isnt trying to launch the stuffed ship into space or add or remove anything from its cargohold then its cargohold should maintain the same capacity as when the first pilot stuffed itits like a suitcase if someone very skilled in packing a suitcase is able to wedge a lot of stuff in it then so long as nobody else disturbs the contents the suitcase can be handled fully loaded by anyone
i second this technique
u have my vote  
 inanna zuni  please do not editorialize a decisionso let me get this straight1  an issue if a member can return and replace his alternate comes to vote2  darius and inanna dont like the wording of the statement3  jade asks hardin to rephrase it4  hardin rephrases it in a straight forward sensible manner 5  they vote that a member can come back and regain voting rights6  jade says that the vote passes and those members can come back and regain voting rights7  inanna asks to jade not editorialize the vote 8  some back and forth conversation goes on and inanna gets a temporary bannow i agree that the ban is a bit excessive imho and not something that i would have done myself but honestly we are arguing about the wording of a vote i would prefer less drama from the csm members over something as stupid as the wording of this fairly unimportant vote lets focus on the important things improving the overall game making the experience for all players better as a whole and give up the ridiculous back and forth that has commenced over the last couple of weeks regarding the wording of a voteits the chairs job to insure that meetings move forward in a timely manner and that all issues are addressed while you may not like the wording of a particular sentence i would ask that you grow up get over it and vote on the issue we dont care about the minutes of every meeting but we do care about the end result and the votes on the issues spending time going over the ridiculousness of a few words is a waste of everyones time and defeats the overall goal of the comitte and also detracts from where we want the csms attention to be focused on the important issues there are plenty of real issues to argue about take your pick but leave the drama over wording behind please
i disagree with jade in the large debate in the the general forums concerning fw and think he and star fraction are just promoting their own agenda and not whats best for the game in generaljust because somthing is within the rules does not always meen its within the games best interests heck the csms were elected to fix problems that are in the game not exploit the loopholes for their own enjoymentfor a verry basic cliffnotesjand and friends there is no problem war deccing corps that are members of factional warfare its an allowed mechanicbest argument against its unfair currently because fwcorpa being war decced byr regcorpb cannot enter the space of the opposing faction giving regcorpb a safe haven from the war while regcorpb can travel anywhere because they did not sign up for fwjade fails to see the imbalance and has tried shouting down anyone who opposes just like in this thread and in case anyone is wondering why because jades alliance star fraction is the alliance that is war deccing bits and pieces of the caldari militiai support removing jade as chairman and no im no goon i generally find their tactics deplorable and sometimes even low but much as i hate to admit it i agree with them whole heartedly here check corp history myself and my other account steelw0lf  with a zero  have been in most of the anti goon alliances
wrong a republic is a country where the rulerhead of stateleader isnt a hereditary monarch it doesnt need to be a democracy it can be a oligarchy like chartage but is generally ruled by a portion of the people norway feks is a constitutional monarchy so the king is the head of state but there is government and parliment chosen by the people that rules for the king or something like thatdemocracy meaning peoples rule come in different flavoursdirect democracy the people vote for all the cases concerning the entity they live in so if a new tax on cars would be up for vote all the joes and sallys would vote yay or nayrepresentative democracy the people vote for representatives to vote for them on cases concerning the governing of their nationstatecountryif the csm thing was a direct democracy then we would be voting on the issues not the csm delegates this is however a representative democracy who knows why but it is
and lets not forget there was no ban issued just a temporary mute second line where jade probably tried to unmute something could have gone wrong thoughsee the timestamps could be an unmute than the message is weirdbugged could be an outright bugwhen inanna was complaining she is blockedlooks like a very primitive attempt to trigger some drama and throw a tantrum by inanna imho inanna oh i was being muted  starts crying loud and throwing toys around and thatis a clear lie compareso how can she be mutedunmuted if shes not on the channel but blockedand then accusing others of lying the childishness displayed by innana seems to know no bounds in this case
fw threadthis is one of the major reasons i wuld vote jade off the csm she is trying to use every excuse in the book to allow his alliance to declar war on fw corps who have signed up with the caldari militiai wont go into all the detail here since its a long complicated issue but when it all comes down to balance it is clear to see that jade and sf are taking advantage of loopholes in the fw design and are able to declare war with no drawbacks for them whatsoeveri would encourage anyone who hasnt if they care about game balance to read it and draw their own conclusions
oh my all that drama without even needing to get into the issue you call that a loopholeexert from the faction warfare player guideplusmaybe you should look up the definition of a loophole wardecing fw corps is clearly an intended game mechanic and one of the rules introduced by ccp thus calling it a loophole is a tad weird isnt itthe drawbacks are the usual ones for declaring war and this is apparantly how ccp intended it to be at the momentstill wanting to shout exploit or any of its synonymsbut by all means drama on seems to be a vital need for some of you wouldnt want to be responsible for you asphyxiating with a big red head cause you couldnt vent the hot air
the real issue in that thread had you bothered to read it is te lack of ability to engage anyone shooting other militia members all other militia members can do is sit there and watch geeze that sounds like its balanced doesnt iti could give a bloody damn what you think to be quite honesti care about the people actually doing fw and consider it a very large game imbalance i dont care bout you so you can go back to your hole now youre dismissedps you want any recognition then post with you main if not stfu
so by your estimation the recent game mechanic that allowed ivy league to become basically immune to any war dec is also how ccp intended it to bedont be so naive in a game this complex there are many loopholes that can be exploited to make the game more beneficial for yourselfin this case a corp alliance who can make a war dec and have an entire area of space where they are immune from reprisals is clearly not an intended use of the war dec mechanic
wow talk about egojade has to go
i just cant see what ingame action that is perfectly within the rules of the game has anything to do with chairing the csm forcing him which is extremly unlikely to happen out of the csm wont change his action  views ingame at all so what about you go elsewhere with your exploit fake drame

the irony is that while the csm members themselves have met had a damned successful face to face meeting that ended in a very positive nyt article that got us praised as approaching the business in a professional and diligent manner this thread still keeps on sucking in a collection of bottomfeeders trying to make some kind of mileage on their personal vendettas and angst this caldari fw thing is a case in point having discussed the issue on the thread in question and challenged the caldari fw members to post an issue thread with their proposed solutions only one actually did that nvchicky the rest  including the worst of the people posting immediately above  decided that their arguments were too weak to actually make a proposal and they preferred to keep whining and making false exploit accusations in the face of clearly presented evidence to the contrary i said in the other thread and ill say it here i consider it a personal triumph that people who hate nonconsensual pvp and loathe very notion of the empire wardec mechanic want me removed from the csm it validates the manifesto i stood for it emboldens the vision i have for the game and it convinces me it was right to stand and serve on this committee just to confront and neutralize the kind of whiny poltroons who would make eve into an instanced wow arena game if they got their way i dine out on the emo tears of those posters above me crying about how membership of the caldari militia hasnt protected them from empire wardecs i laugh at their weakness and cowardly lack of backbone and its my pleasure to blow up their ships ingame i ran for csm on an election platform of propvp opportunity and dynamism and it would be the height of hypocrisy for me not to be a fan of small unit pvp in game eve as dark universe and its a hard environment for people used to 100 safety and instanced pvp in controlled environments but thats the soul of eve the beauty and the allure of the game is in player vs player strife and consequence for actions and the day that corporations can make themselves totally safe in empire from wardecs is the day this game begins to die i stand utterly opposed to the notion that arlenna molatov steel tigeress ayrianna nagaya nitalya and lord frost can declare their corporations for a militia and will no longer have to be vulnerable to the corporation wardec mechanic i am utterly opposed to the notion that anybody wardeccing them will be faced by faction npc response and i am utterly opposed to the principle that carping whines and mewling complaints on the forums will get these people more safety for their ingame corporations hard words people might condemn me for standing on the csm and having strong opinions but thats ridiculous i got elected because of strong opinions and its my responsible to keep on expressing them and ensuring that the people who read my election manifesto and trusted me to promote the kind of eve online i described there has a place in the future we are helping to build so caldari militia how about facing up to your real issues and learning how to deal with wardecs with spaceships in space and small unit pvp you have an opportunity to play this game now you joined a thing called faction warfare and its time for you to prove that you know what the second word actually means enough of this ridiculous forum whining and more action in space if you do have an actual assembly hall issue you want to express be my guest  make a thread lets see how the debate goes but if you decide instead to keep on whinging and trying to personalize the issue of game mechanics that are working exactly as they were intended then you are going to work a minor miracle and reduce your reputation even further this csm forum is not a selfhelp group for butthurt wannabe pvp pretenders who go crying to their mothers when the first time a hostile wardec comes in
a few whiny caldari dont really change the reasoning behind the original suggestion
dont get me wrong i believe the entire thread is full of failposters and im happy to laugh at anyone foolish enough to click support on this issue for the reasons stated the last few caldari whiners just help to typify the general standard of people posting yes in this thread quite neatly  basically anyone butthurt by any decision or issue that goes against them gets to shout abuse at the csm chair in this thread its probably theutic edit how the hell is the word theutic filterededit2 gah i see thats therapeutic  thats as in  a consequence of a medical treatment of any kind the results of which are judged to be desirable and beneficial 
now dont get me wrong i love what you do and you are a great speaker but you have to see the inherrant flaw in your own argumentwhy should it be possible for someone to war dec someone else and be completely secure in their own area of space it was not intended to work this way and yet by deccing someone in fw you are effectivly making it so that you only have to fight when you want to on your terms negating them the benefit of ever making any kind or suprise or ambush tactic and also taking any risk from war time logistic operations this is what you are saying you want to not happen if they made fw corps immune to decs which i agree is not right nobody should be safe this is eve not carebears onlinenow i am not saying you will use this tactic i belive you will sit in low sec systems in contested space and tell people to bring it but this doesnt mean others wont and this is where something may need to be donei havnt come here with any suggestions or solutions to this problem only to highlight the fact that if it isnt yet it may well become a problem that needs to be dealt with and as the chair of the csm it should be your perogative to look at it with an unbias view and present a solution or at least recognise the potential for honest debate however with you being the head of the alliance in question are you truely able to stay unbiasps sorry for the spelling grammar
well lets say im a 00 alliance all my logistics money making ratting and holdings are out somewhere in deep 00 protected by a nap fest cynojammers jumpbridges and the rest if i wardec x target in empire then my pvpers are going to go after those guys while all my logistics and moneymaking remain safe in deep home ground 00 its very much the same issue and end of the day is spinning through hisec gallente space any more dangerous for the caldari fw militia then taking a tour through delve would be i dont think so well were actually sitting in their hisec systems saying bring it as well as contested lowsec systems but the point is the militia is a tool they can use in one way get lots of free wardecs against enemy militias or join as an individual to be protected from wardecs or they could just as easily pull the corp out of the militia and go hunting wherever they wish they have complete flexibility of response and countermeasure sure others could conceivably wardec a caldari militia member corp and then sit in gallente hisec and do nothing but that costs a wardec fee to no good ends the onus is on the declarer to do something with the war end of the day or they end up paying for nothing oh absolutely sfs role in this is relatively minor i suspect many many organizations will wardec individual militia corp members in the weeks to come because thats eve just because a corporation affiliates with a fw militia doesnt mean it stops being a player corp that is responsible for handling the consequences of its actions theres also a bit of a confusion over the role of csm chair in all this my responsibility as chair is pretty straightforward 1 organize and chair meetings of the csm ensure that issues get heard votes get made and process gets followed i do have a responsibility to ensure that other csm reps get a fair hearing and get to register their decisions on the public record my responsibilty as a csm delegate is pretty straightforward too 1 represent the views and interests of my constituency and advocate those issues i believe will be in the general interest of eve online these are two different things and responsibilities as chair have no bearing on specific positions on items like the wardec mechanics or faction warfare  as long as i make sure the discussions happen voting is fair and results get recorded thats the duty of chair sorted as a csm rep ive got a full right and duty to express the opinions and positions i was elected on in this case im pro pvp combat and player on player consequence in the matter of empire wardecs
you have to consider your personal agenda too you have this preconception of caldari whiners but truth is you are simply drawing your own conclusions to a debate and not taking anyone elses opinion into account just because people want fairness and balance doesnt give you the right to call them whiners and for you to sit on that chair and say that tells all of us you dont belong there you do not have this community as a whole in mindthats hardly the case and shows how self centered and egotistical you arei sit and watch how you gain the safety of or gallente navies while caldari deals with the drawbacks yet you sit in your safe haven calling them carebearsi think they are all implying that you are invulnerable with your war decas csm chair you have a lot of issues and pigeon holing an entire faction is why you suck at your job so star fraction why not face up to your real issues and learn to join a militia the intended way and jade face your issues and learn to see eve as a whole community and not your personal perception you have much to learnyou already have reduced yourself by all means keep sinking lower nice you just sank lower jade please act professional you are in a postion of power act like it
amazing argument but you know that jade wont reply to you specificaly for that reason
ill stop you there were in nouv thats caldari hisec where incidently our wardec targets in the caldari militia live perhaps you are watching somebody else entirely in any case that basic failure to address ingame reality and post truthfully on the forums does rather neatly summarize the rest of your post i suggest you stop watching  the wrong people  and get into your space ship and fight the wardec you are complaining about rather than spamming the forums with your erroneous complaints about a game mechanic that people have repeatedly indicated is operating precisely as intended
so uh whats your responce to the rest of his allegations
first off just cuz you may not be in gallente space  rather you lie about it  doesnt mean others wont abuse the powersecond ummm yes operating as its intended that doesnt mean everything ccp intended to do was precisely correct now does it seems you want alliances to have a role in fw i dont see a problem since its operating precisely as intended yet you whine so why is your whine more important than the other whineyou are way up on your soapbox trying to push for your agenda
groundless and false without merit just like your post in fact
thank you for your mature and constructive responce  
which is where you fail as soon as anyone disagrees with you you lose it and start enforcing your point of view this thread and the fw one are prime examples instead of looking at the issue and sseeing there is the posibility of unbalance and abbuse you shout down the opposition because it affects you and yoursa professional leader would look into matters regardless of their personal feelings on the issue you fail in this so are unfit for leadershipexcept for that right now it appears that the issues your constituency are interested in is fixing fw and removing you from your seat oh wait that cant be right that doesnt agree with the voices in your head so when an issue is raised that has garnered as much support as this one it should be laughed off and insulted because it doesnt agree with you i pity what your going to go through when ccp gets tired of the elected chair laughing at and insulting its playerbase and ignoring the issues brought forth and supported on this boardfor once you should do the respectable thing and realize that if your actions and beliefs stir up this much controversy perhaps you arnt suited for the juob and leave on your own but that wont happen regardless of the fact that well over 200 votes of support want the issue of your removal raised
no tigeress i have robustly argued a point and dealt with your false accusations of exploits griefing and broken mechanics you have been crying sploit like a spoiled child because you have become the victim on an empire wardec many others have pointed out that you are wrong undeterred you continue to allege exploits and griefing because you feel your own gameplay has been hindered by a hisec wardec what you wanted was for somebody in a position of some kind of authority to agree with you instead you have been challenged to back up your points and present factual argument you have failed on all accounts and now fall back on the tried and trusted route of alleging bias and misbehavior a professional leader looks into the facts before they listen to the sensualist cries of haxx and exploit you have directly lied about many things in the course of this discussion tigress either these are intentional lies or lies from simple incompetence in any case your arguments are damaged by your inability to debate matters without descending into falsehood and sensationalist slander i challenged you to put an issue thread into public debate why dont you do it when you get 200 supports in favour of nerfing empire wars lets talk thats because these 200 votes come about around 60 people who got butthurt for various reasons into trying to undo the result of a democratic electoral process thus far it has received no support from a csm member and consequentially hasnt been brought to our formal attention quite properly the 2400 votes i received in the election are considerably more relevant in the grand scheme of things so once again if you want the csm to sponsor changes you propose in eve online make an issue thread and set out your arguments if they hold water youll get some good support and a csm delegate will bring the issue to the council id advise you to have a nice cup of tea first though and clear some of the vitriol from your veins because nobody is convinced by personal attacks mixed with game development objectives so if you actually have something you care about go do this
finelests assume 1 thing lets pretend i am involved in factions at allsf wardecs steelwolfs fine and dandy you can shoot at me i can shoot at youthats all fine what is not fine is that sf can hunt me anywhere in empire while i cannot hunt you if i was caldari you could hide in galente or min space and i couldnt pursue that is the imbalance you have been ignoring for 12 pagesyou say thats fair because the fw corp chose to be in fw thats correct they did to fight other people on the opposing team in fw its the same way if you choose to attack a fw corp you should no longer be welcome in their space you chose to declar the war so its all fairexcept that would crimp your allinces little jihad and even though the problem is staring you in the face you refuse to see it the emporer cant be naked his cloths are just invisible
ive underlined your falsehood you can certainly hunt us while you are in the militia you will have to keep moving since enemy npcs will hit you sure or you could temp drop the miltia and hunt us or you could pay mercs to hit us or you even shift to the other milita and hit us or you could drop your corp and join the militia as individuals or you could surrender and ask for terms there is a world of options and the problem you are expressing is absolutely no different from the problem faced by many eve corporations and alliances that find themselves wardecced by entities with home and income streams based in owned 00 space if you get wardecced by band of brothers are you going to be able to hunt them fleely in delve or are you going to be relentlessly hunted by their patroller drones  players  defending their space really you are making a big fuss over nothing and claiming you have no options or ability to counterattack when you clearly do
there is a huge difference between the two one is an automated defence that will happen anytime no way around itthe other can be avoided has a much slower response time and most import bob in 00 is being protected by other playersyou and sf have the opportunity of protection by npcs and that protection is costing you nothing its a side effect of your enemy being in fwyour posts have already been reported course i dont actually think ccp will do anything but you were reported for conduct unbecomming a person holding a ccp endorsed position even if nothing is done at least they will be aware of the problemthats you
are you really trying to claim that youd have more luck moving a caldari faction warfare gang through delve than you would spinning through a couple of gallente hisec systems being chased by some faction npc ships that dont even scramble seriouslywell its costing us 100200m isk a wardec actually thats not nothing and its considerably more than you pay by being in the militia and getting free protection from the enemy militia in your hisec well maybe theres an upside and through the process of making nonsense reports youll learn about proportionality and how to handle an adult debate without losing your temper in the end it could turn out to be a learning experience for youstill ill return to my earlier advise and suggest if you do still feel strongly about this subject you should raise an issue thread with your proposed resolution would be much more productive than following me round the forums and shouting sploits haxx griefer broken war mechanics csm bias have the courage of your convinctions and put up an issue i know you can do it
dont you ever ever lecture me about courage and convictions you fail to grasp what either of those two words actually meen maybe when you ever have to sacrifice anything for what you believe we can talk on this issue suffice to say you have the freedome to be a prick because of the sacrifices of guys like meuntil then keep spinning your wheels how ever fast you like because the more you post about how much all the oppinions in this thread dont matter the more people will realize how wrong you are for the job
ill keep lecturing you about courage and convictions as long as your gameplay appears to lack these things you are complaining about gameplay consequence and incoming wardecs in an openpvp game that is famous for its dark and brutal environment and opportunity for conflict and warfare rather than fighting ingame and getting into your spaceship to defend your allies youve brought the fight to the forums and are trying to make mileage by attacking a csm member who dares disagree with your illthought out and badly argued tirade against the principle of corporation wardecs you basically want everything your own way and you lack the backbone to fight for what you believe in ive advised you many times to start an issue topic on this subject and you still prefer to come back attacking me rather than taking the slightest risk in tabling your own topic for discussion that ive reached unfavourable conclusions about your lack of courage should hardly be surprising still you could always reach for the wardec button from your alt corp
this is an issue topic thread one concerning your removal the only one dodging and avoiding the topic at hand here is you you are the problem that needs fixing most at this point because at this point in time trying to fix anything else is rather pointless as there is not an unbias csm chair at this point and propossed issue thread has to get by youi may have overstated the votes in this thread though there are 198 votes for your removal  2thats more votes than most issue threads the only issue thread i found with more was the skill que thread which is at about 253 votes of approval which incidentally i like the solution you sudgestedit goes to show you do have good ideas so long as they dont affect anything you like negativly
and no you wont keep lecturing because you can only lecture somone who is willing to learn the thing you need to learn is that there is selfless service which is what a leader should be and selfish service which is what a power junkie practicesi currently practice the first and you the second and you will never sway me into thinking you are in the right

agreed
without mechanics to promote defence there will never be any 00 player run empires just pvp groups shuffling around the mapwe should be looking at ways of forcing combat to the borders of claimed empires and restricting the ability of offensive forces to project their power directly at what should be the softer civilian hearts of empiresit is exactly the lack of this type of structure which discourages players from making the move to 00in order to facilitate defence freedom of movement of defending forces around their borders is something that needs to be in place but not to the point where an alliance can border off an area of space disproportionate to its size and abilityborders should be somehow expanded to accomodate growing numbers rather that claiming vast swaithes of space and hoping to fill themthat is a concept for the clever people to get their teeth in to not paltry changes to an existing mechanicjump bridging caps in to cyno jammed systems isnt really an issue at allthe jump bridge network is in itself attackable and cyno jammers can be taken down by moderate sized forces in minutesthis isnt an issue that should be changed in isolation either if it was considered as part of a more widespread review of space claiming mechanics then it may have some merit but as it stands it seems more like a cry for help than an issue of balanceit isnt undefeatable but it requires a concerted effort  isnt that what attack should be about
ridiculous i say
these devices were added to allow defenders the advantage they deserve and prevent the 4 am blitzkrieg attack and they have done this very well the real argument those complaining about them have is that they allow one alliance to defend against an equal size or smaller alliance launching a blitzkrieg attack at 4 am which is of course exactly what they are supposed to doif a significantly larger alliance were to seriously attack an entrenched defender then they can easily take down the jammer in minutes bring in their caps and lock the system down completely until the towers are dead the only people these proposed changes would benefit are smaller hit and run instant gratification types who are frustrated that they cant defeat a larger enemy by setting their alarm and launching one quick attackif a serious and worthy attacker needs some way   other than the 4am blitz   to bring capitals to the fight then let them gain control of the system long enough to set up their own tower and let pos mounted cyno generators punch through jammers and allow the attacker to online one without sov   though it should take several hours to do so giving the defense the chance for a counter attack  
thats all you have to say about the uiweaksauce
let me guess you are going to vote for enemy of caldari xdcome on have a laugh you know you want to
as long as it keeps this bloody faction gangs from targeting neutrals who are just farming rats or jumping gates i hate being targeted by the gangs even in high secs this days
tbh all we really need is a way to make filthy republican militia pilots valid war targets even access to fw agents is a secondary issueimo the best solution would just be to set all members of the pirate militia to sec status 10 that pretty much solves all alliancefw related issues in one fell swoopbut in the meantime this will do
yes bring it back pls
i would definently support the idea i too have myself a couple of stupid skills which i would like to get rid off on the technical note im a bit confused why is it do we player community be concerned about it at all  this is not our job we are no paid for being concerned technical aspects of the game on the other hand ofc i appreciate that if someone is showing interest and knowledge of database building then he could do some input but to me it appears that its totally unconstructive im quite positive that even if you do have knowledge of the certain it systems you would know what exactly does it take to implement a new feature unless you are an internal dev with respect to character skill sheets ive read somewhere back then that for ccp it costs zero money monet to support and maintain that database hence they said that they would keep that information infinitely im not an it specialist but basing on that i would guess that implementing something like unlearning skill feature should be relativelly easy 1 signed
worst idea ever and if its an idea you should prolly post it in the features and ideas discussion forum
if you dont want one you dont have to get one its okps small bussines entrepreneur not single player
ive had this thread in features and ideas discussion for almost two years now sadly most of the ideas proposed are still issues or have not been implemented and in general the ui is just as bad or worse than it was back thenbut rather than attempt to reiterate the whole thing here ill link it then give a little taste with the room thats left in this postand thats just part of the first post there are 13 pages in that thread
fully support theres a lot here that would make players lives a lot easier
same here tbh a word processor or spreadsheet application would not pass quality control with the same amount of user unfriendlinessmay i add sell everything  command for all selected items
i would love to see all this fixed just to see what xaen spends the next 2 years trying to get fixed also because it needs fixing
yes please
yep also more 2 click options like click item in overview then click warp toorbit etc in the box abovea station menu similar to the selected ietm box above the overview could be introduced with buttons likerepackage and sellrepackage and reprocessfit to active shipetcall these buttons could have hot keys set through the shortcuts tab in the esc menusome cargo containers could be exempt so that you dont accidentaly select all hit repackage and sell then realize youve just sold the corps mineral cans and their contentsalso see rsi issues with hotkeys
i support this if everyone in the flipees alliance is immediately flagged to me  the flipper  and my corpalliance think of it as a 15 min wardec heh
yes to alliances no to gangsisk farmers often use a gang to keep track of the location of thier sweat shop npc corp miners flipping thier cans and stealing thier ore is one of the tools we as the player base have against these people in addition to the petitionthey use the npc corps for protection from war decs that needs to have an associated cost riskreward etc riskreward applies because not all npc corp miners are farmers some are legitimate playersanother reason to not do gangs is for new players often noobs are recruited by a helpful and friendly older player yes such people do exist in eve the noobs are somewhat protected by this as well as previous posters have pointed out although this can be mitigated by the helpful player using a 10 standing towards the noob it is a cumbersome work around to an action that should be easy  we should want older players that do want to help new players be able to help them with as little effort and risk to both as possible
i believe tachyons are oversized battleship guns which other races do not have
i think its capacitor usage is to compensate for no ammo consumption and yes tachyons are pretty hefty
no if they were easier to fit they would become way too powerful
especially they will suck all your cap in 3 mins at all 5 skills  evear heard of heavy energy neutralizer dominix it will suck laser ship out of cap in less than minute
i think its an abaddon problem and not a tachyon problem tachyons must remain hard as hell to install as a payoff for their incredible poweri just think abaddon misses a bonus to cap usage for lasers similar to the other amarr bses the reason behind my suggestion is that if we accept the very hard fiting requirments of the tachyons are fair we must not forget that this fact makes you havinng to fit several rcs that mess up your fiting these rcii mods you must fit take 2 lows already and the cap consumption is so great that you have to install also cap power relays to remediatethat is why i think the best solution is to leave the tachyons as they are but add a bonus to laser cap usage for the abaddon on top of the other bonuses perhaps not a 10 per lvl but at least a 75 per lvl
global bonus like in apocalypse would be nicer to new players
since when should new players be flying a toptier bs if you dont like fitting an rcu drop down a tier or drop a gun an apoc with 7 tachs does the same damage as a megathron with a much greater optimal if you could fit a full rack of tachs on an abaddon without an rcu it would be overpowered
especially that lasers do mostly em damage which is preety useless vs omni armor tanks
bumpcsmplease add this to the list of issuesi think everyone agrees with this ideawe just need a dev response about the possible load issuse
totally im tired of sitting in jita with 10000 items having to right click and quick sell each one to expand on the idea i would like to be able to set a threshold for example if stack of items exceeds a specified amount it will not be automatically check marked in the window
for blob warfare this isnt new there are already bombs to do this  kill frigsceptorsdrones but if u really wanted to do some damage you wouuld have to self destruct ur carrier tbh and everyone will be more than 20km away given that everyone can see the message your self destructing ye fithy terrorist
hell no you stick your dk in the meat grinder you deal with the consequences we already have seen idiots self destruct motherships when they are going down just to deny the fleet killing them the kill mail they deserve now you want them to also get kills of their own for such a cowardly act
welldont give them the killmail for the selfdestruction kills make it a neutral kill of sorts
id rather the ui overhaul get done than this i spend so much time zoomed out to see the battlefield that nice little pretty weapon effects mean nothing to menow the ui that effects us all
it certainly wouldnt do any harm
as long as we can keep it decently up to date yes how we do that i am not sure
im always in favour of more tradetype ideas but there must be some serious safeguards against scams doubledealing ripoffs and associated asshattery and with a very complex system chances are that well need to hire pwc or mckinsey to audit the placeso not a thup nor a thdown i supposeedit had to hyphenate safeguards er safeguards because of some issue with the naughtywordcatcheredit2 can someone please enlighten me in what language  is a naughty word  
of course support for more love for the stock market didnt lv include this into the csm meeting with ccp thoughas an aside imho the best option and simplest would be to make stocks and shares like bearer bonds and tradeable on the open market like ships and everything else in the gameedit for support hurrrrr
that would be awwesomethe ability to invest online in a game
i agree that mmo trade ideas are always great to hear however a stock market this one has been talked to death for yearsbiggest problem is what is the compeling reason to buy stock from any alliance or corperation i would be willing to bet that if it was trackable there are more profitable sinlge corperations that you would want to buy than some of the largest alliancesthe reason for buying stock is not the dividend payout the largest draw is the profitabilty in the market do to share price flucuation however what would information would ever casue a stock to go down who would cover the cost if say bob went bankrupt are you going to also have a ingame bankrupcy mechanic to allow them to cover corp and alliance assets if the market crashesare you going to allow takeovers i really do like this idea but alot more has to be considered first and it wont be just a few tweaks or simple added game mechanicsi think it would be better as someone else said to just allow alliances to sell off bonds that pay dividends based or something simple like the combined intake of all the alliance shared pos have that money dump into a huge slush fundpay the divedends the the rest gets spilled out into the alliance wallletthis way you cover the profts of the bond market and can easily track everything you must also have a wallet that holds in escrow enough money to cover the existing bonds and have it pay an intrest so that it covers the buyback ability of the alliences and also gives them a compelling reason to sell the bonds and tie up the funds in the first placefirestrm

okif your a noob and want to get some researching done and your in caldari space then your in troublei am not talking about productivity research cause you can do that just takes little efforti am talking about material researchin the whole bloody region all slots are used upi am not going to go to amari space just for this as gm told me toowhy should i i think its not fair that some ppl hoged all the slots and i have to look over the entire region to find slot where i have to wait half a month i am sick of iti payed for the time i play yet i cant use the game features that i am entitled to pls ccp fix this and allow us noobs to get some research done either by increasing research slots to 50 or making sure an account always has a slot free to research 1 slot is it too much to ask for
i research in amarr space and it still takes at least two weeks to get a slot active frankly though this isnt really a problem  it creates a market for playerowned slots theres someone on these forums offering research slots as a business 9000 iskhour  and it balances out the fact that me research is way way better than pe also it doesnt prevent you from doing anything it just means you have to wait for it waiting is hardly onerous
npc slots need to be removed and player owned slots be public rentableproblem solved for everyone
alright i am a member of about four or five forums this is my sixth i have lurked posted once or twice on these forums now my concern is mostly routed in the caod forums but its also present throughout the rest the persistent one word replies and blatant spams trolls and frankly unnecessary posts that plague these forums make me not want to read them for the information i come for i would like there to be more strictly enforced rules for trolling and one word posting and other just stupid posts that these forums do not needits not impossible one of the forums i frequent has thousands of members like this one and is able to make most threads readable and free of spamtrolling i know i am not the only one that has seen this or likes it and it really makes these forums less then what they can be please resolve this issue
yea well caod is kind of the alliance smack chanel there is never really any sort of information in there i am not too sure what info you would ever be looking for in that forum its mainly entertainment more than anything else as is most of these forums there are some good areas howeverfor info as to ships skills and suchbut mainly this is pretty much like the wwf you know its fake and its stupid but you cant just turn away

dude
farrqua i would just like people to actually do as the title of the forums says corporation and alliance discussion not corporation and alliance smack not corporation and alliance wwf its supposed to be a place to see news about the alliances and what is new with them what wars are happening which still gets posted but then half the posts are trash some are cleaned out by mods but most is left there to make half the forum unreadable or topics having twice as many pages as needed its rediculous and something needs to be done
i am a loyal caldari navy mission runner who is also in the caldari militis i am accumulating a lot of loyalty points that i do not know what to do with i want to get a caldari faction ship but im not too into ravens ospreys or merlins is it possible to add a caldari navy drake
even though i support the sentiment i fear the flaw is that in any market and any item there comes a point where the value of its parts is going to be more than the value of the object especially over timeif it costs 5bil to build a titan  i dunno just some number  and tomorrow it costs 51bil you are already at that pointyes your suggestion would deliver some interesting trade opportunities for noobs and experienced traders alike but much more effective realistic and interesting would be to follow what the right hon mr vista suggested and that is to remove as many npc goods from the marketheck ill go make trash if theres money in it
hey i used to fly the imicusyes that ugly shipwith a prototype cloak for moon scanning i had to stare at that thing a lot and that was with classic graphics its not that bad quit whiningnow personally i wish ccp would have changed the purpose of the t1 ships as opposed to the hulls of the t2 ships for example make the imicus an ew ship and the maulus a scanning ship and then the t2 hulls can match up appropriately but hey i hear the new anathema is sexy ive got to toss that on my alt  
id rather have the navitas hull than anything else
oops sorry to double post but i forgot to check for support
thisyou pay more in modulest2 ships to get better performance and your tradeoff is to take a bigger isk hit when it dies why should this be changed
if this is an idea shouldnt it be put into the fi discussion forum
ever heard of median price 1 zealot at 10b wont change insurence price if there are 1000 at 80mln price it wil increse about 2mln you fail
it think you missed the importance of the sjust keep doing it until you hike the price enough all it is costing you is broker fees which are negligible with trade skillsfail indeed
this is easy enough to fix  base it on evewide mineral prices nobody is a big enough player to manipulate those meaningfully
thats how it currently is slappyproblem is t2 ships arent made directly from minerals and thus they get royally gimped insurance payouts

no supporteve needs insurance removed from the game entirely there is no need for this isk faucet in the game anymoreif anything make it possible to have player insurance corporations
no it isnt except for a selfish minoritythe majority would get a lot of more fun if t2 ships were more casual
you already have invention pushing prices to the effective floor insurance is not needed
80 million isk for a throw away  pvp  ship  deimos  still isnt exactly what i call on the effective floorwith 100 insurance payout it would be ok
the ship you are looking for is called a thorax
oh really
100 insurance on t2 items would be economy suicide insurance is a faucet it injects money into the game it would also effectively put a floor price on all t2 componentsno if you want to help make t2 more affordable i suggest you mosey on over to the critical eve isk issue in this same forum and lob your support for a change in the way moon minerals are derived and used through the various t2 processesas it stands you have prices the way they are because demand is high and supply of just two moon minerals  which account for 80 of the make up of component cost  are low
issuersi caused by extended use of multi button functions leading to early onset of arthritis  aka playstation thumbs solutioni would like to propose that any multi button shortcuts have the option of using a mouse button instead of alt ctrl or shift  eg ctrl  f3 can cause awkward hand positions yet mouse  f3 would be fine a type button such as 6  f3 would also be fine because 6 is close to the f keys but could lead to some very odd conversations in localhaving some buttons on the drone ui like launch  engage target  return would be nice too as currently if you dont want to use multi button shortcuts youre into right click menus which are a bit clunky for combatthe default shortcuts should discourage the use of ctrlaltshift  f keysreasoningmany people find a dull ache in their wrist or lower arm after extended computer use especially if you also play an instrument like the guitar or spend too much time in gallente pleasure hubs this dull ache is caused by friction between the tendon and the tendon sheath which over time can cause a build up of tissue leading to impairment in early old age  ie once youre retired and want to be out enjoying yourself if youre not worried about retirement then think about everything youve done in the last 5 years then imagine getting an extra 5 years of use out of your arms at the end of your lifeits just a thought so any other rsi reduction ideas appreciated
reposting to support
truethere are a lot of possibilities in eve when it comes to relieving rsi
to reduce server charge and then db access i think it should be allowed  i think i was possible long time ago  to stockpile items in hostiles stations remotly and repackage undamaged items  ships toofor example i have personnally now like more than 30000 stack of items in various station with various char and if this is implemented i think i can easily make it going down to 20000 easy
posted this too fast apparently notes have been or are going to be sent to ccp when we will see them no cluemanasi
this is a perfect example of an idea that needs to be in the features and ideas discussion forumthe idea is mostly just a selfish nerf to another faction so my faction could beter pwnand none will agree with this for any other than that reasonthe idea is also not thought throughi might post an idea make battleships imune to light and medium missiles i think that would greatly make up for the fact that missile users can pick damage types  se how stupid these ideas sound when there against your faction
ill say exactly the same thing as i did at jita park when you made this thread theremissiles and turrets are different  this isnt a bad thing
you want cruise luncher t2 so you train it you had large t2 rail guns now you want beam lasers no you dont train them you train smallmedium to level 5 then level 5 of large caldari missioners have too easy all way
if you had done a search on the forum  yea i know the search tools suck but still  you would have found similar threads like this each one explaining that the skillplans are different but the time spent is actually very similar  hint play with evemon  if i remember right you even spend slightly longer time training missile skills to cover the same amount of options
the missile skill tree is longer than each gunnery one and you want training gunnery to be quicker
bump because its important
i think you should get faction standing at the very least for killing enemy faction ships and likewise lose it for killing your own ships
most realistic would be to simply implement a set of capital shipmodule implants and make all non capital implants not affect capital shipsmodules at all a slave equivalent shield set would make the passive tanks on certain ships totally unreasonable but the shield boost from a cyrstal set would make capital shield tanking nuts
it might take you longer to use t2 guns but when you get them at leaste your ammo is worth itt2 missiles have more negatives then there worth for the little extra damage they do so i would not complain if i would have know this from day 1 i would not have learned 9 million sp in missiles i would be using guns and doing 3x more damage then i am now
i find it silly that someone would think that the thousands of ideas that make up eves ui could ever be considered a single issue and could ever be discussed in one sitting the ui issue could maybe be split up into different categories but probably not
not in the least lavista vista is doing a good job imo even if he did a crappy job it is still better than i could do dont second guess yourself it is not worth itm
lmao actually i must be among the few ones here who as westerner experienced a frontal clash with communism having to fight the general mindset  bureaucracy of a former varsaw pact member country when attempting to secure the relocation of a communist lady who became my wife all this years before glasnost  perestroika kicked in and the wall finally fellhad to stay there over a year and ended learning the language  required if you really want to get things done and you know what  ive moved my ass through enough countries to loose count but i will not forget that except for stupid civil servants ive never interacted with such humane individuals like citizens of these exwapa nationsits that simple when the system puts you in deep poo you help each other no money will ever compensate lost social brotherhood despite my fat wallet and ive since long learned that finances only allow you to fool yourself by buying delusions if youre not wise enough to be happy with what you have big or small no amount of money will do itall that to say that most peeps have not the shadow of a clue when they talk about communism was communism bad  yes in the way it was implemented could communism be a good thing  maybe if individuals were advanced enough not to fall in the trap of replacing the influence of money with the mixed weight of a party affiliation card and a specific position where did i encounter the most genuinely happy people  in these poor countries never found in the usa europe or the me educated individuals who were simultaneously so sincerely aware about the mechanisms governing their societies the limits that were artificially imposed to their development and yet enjoyed their livesive risked jail when smuggling pcs  modems at cost for students in order to enable a few of them to open a window to the outer world and get aware it was my way of fighting communism now in the retrospective all what capitalism brought there are a few guys who became stinking rich  all former exponents of the communist apparatus btw  and the rest is not only poorer than ever but also struggling with an exponential criminality that didnt exist beforeso idiots can continue to  with their empty rhetoric  theories ill stand by my actions rl experience and regrets that i actively fought a system which at the end wasnt half so bad as the procapitalist lobby would let you believegot that from a 70years old farmer whose parents were executed by russians at the end of ww2 because they refused to have their land nationalized before i could talk and everybody would listen now i can scream and nobody pays attentionand when talking about jades controversial personality well at least he has one
why is ccp dragging their feet approving and posting the minutes of meetings not a single set of minutes have been posted unless ive missed them csm please get on their cases about this
the minutes for the may 24th and may 31st online meetings are under the csm headingbut yes ive been anticipating them for over a week now
the argument goes both ways your constant banter against smashnorthern coalition is just well childish and moronic no matter how you cut it
just wait until there are patchnotes that state as proposed and discussed by csm i guess there will be a lot of hate and flame again pjust keep an eye on the feature and ideas or gamedeveleopment boards its probably where everyone is these days
everybody comes out favourably when compared to european union politicians
amen
thank you bane im sure you know more than i do about the theoryreality of these ships and i hope all the other csm members at least attempt to understand things they may of never experienced

a multi billion ship being outdamaged by noob ships needs fixed
i am not flying a phoenix  yet  but balancing capitals is very important because you cant just use another one  there are many bscruiser in for each race but only one dread 
  notify  loading the ammo into the projectile weapon this will take approximately 10 secondspersonally i like the idea of smartbombs killing missiles theyre different from turrets and have advantages  disadvantages trouble is on dreads its all disadvantages theyre very very slow and have limited range making them completely useless in engagements over 130140km and pretty duff at medium ranges phoenixes cant really select their damage type  which is supposed to be one of the advantages of missiles  naglfars can select damage type but they have that oh so hated 5050 weapon type split so you cant use damage mods on themit comes down to dreadnaughts being completely unbalanced for the type of combat thats evolved around them phonixnaglfar are severely lacking we got the nid and chimeras problems worked out now dreads need a look
not sure what happened to this proposal but since we didnt get to discuss it in iceland i think it definitely needs to be on the agenda for the next meeting
good idea
agreed i never understood why you built ships  non packaged  into freightors and i dont see any downside to it
yeah would be a nice addition2 remote reppers dme is a fan of spider gangs
its good to have variety
we need the option of turning off or toning down the background nebulae brightness so that it doesnt interfere with the ui sometimes it is very difficult to see things on the overview or tell what modules are activated due to the bleedthrough of the bright nebulaethey are pretty but some of them are so bright that black space with stars would actually be preferable in fact if i had that option id probably turn them off altogether
frackin a  means i agree with the above 
guess i have to reply to my own post to show my support for it
yes please let us tone downturn off backgrounds
leave cloaks alone theyre very hard to use on non cloakable ships as isthe only real problem here are isk farmersthose need to be hunted and kicked outwhy does some carebear in your space bother you so much you can stay in system for a while he wont be cloaked forever hell get bored and try to run or logthe ones sitting there 237 arent carebears theyre bot users the solution to those is banning everyone who plays actively for 237 because thats not possible without violating the eulathe same principle is applyed on highways  someplaces  if you get to the toll too fast you get a speeding ticket no other hard evidence needed youve had to be speeding to get there that fast
what they need is fuel id suggest heavy water since there seems to be a surplus
cloaks are the only counter to probes not signed if you want to nerf cloaks nerf probes firstnow something to keep a ship from cloaking and going afk for hours at a time i would support a general nerf no way
why is that an issue there are lots of safe ways to make isk ratting in 00 and running to hide whenever someone enters the system doesnt strike me as anything particularly overpowered or exploitive because your isk making activity is so easily disrupted even if your shippod are at minimal riskif there is a problem it is the ease with which local can be used to identify the presence of threatstargets
cloaks need to be changed its really obnoxious to go through tcf  unl space and in every system there is a tcfunl sponsored farmer from asia they fit wcss and nanos and cloak all im asking is that it is made so cloaking is very cap draining and you cant stay in that state for super long or that i have a chance to probe through cloak
no support the op is just another lazy pirate crying for easy killswindjammer
the whole point to a cloak is just that it cloaks you from being detected if it were to be nerfed any further than it already has it will no longer be worthy of the cloak epithet so a big definite no to this
imo having the non cov ops ships use fuel would be a good idea but other than that cloaks dont really need a nerf if the ratters cant use cloaks they just go back to logging off
the ops idea is horrible big no ships need to be harder to find and kill  not less
if you have skilled up to use the covopsreconblackops ships then you should have the benefit of using a cloaking device to its fullest abilities if on the other hand you have trained up your toon to farm isk in your raven and want a system that guarantees your safety by letting you cloak then the answer is no you should not be allowed the same abilities that a specialist cloaking gainsim not talking about cloaked speedslocking times after decloaking or those type of abilities the abilities im talking about is the 100 guaranteed ability to hide from any ships in the system gaining that ability in my mind is fundamentally wrong and is sending out the wrong message about cloakingfor me its simple if your in a specialised cloaking ship then you will be 100 undetectable if on the other hand your in a farming raven then you do not get that 100 undetectability in some way to be determined you would be detectable there are suggestions already in this thread as to how that could be done but at the end of the day something has to be done about all the isk farmers in 00 without impacting on the specialised cloaking shiptypes
fighting around stations has always been a sorry mess
it would probably make my life harder but add fun so sure

well the ammout of gtcs that were sold made eve have this huge popular success and im 100 it was the best cash income for ccp doing so getting bigger priceingz ccp will lose more subscribers and not only that will lose people that had ammouts of alts and now theyll keep main  1 or 2 chars i for one had 6 accoutns  now ill stick 2 one and leave the others unpaid in time ccp will losewow and all the other products comming from blizzard are premium aswell so it aint just eveok we pay more but we still get the hardcore lag in fleet fights still the stupid game mechaincs with pos and titans  it still the old game we started paying 4  5 years ago ccp were forced to evolved and improve quality otherwise they would have bankruped allready just my 2 cents
i gotta say that this was a bad idea in the history of bad ideas gtcs are now up by 200mil for every gtc now which for a carebare like me cannot make that much a month in order to play the game now so the option of using isk just to play i can no longer do and to be honnest the average player wont either be able to afford 400mil every 2 months thats a sht load of missioning and mining non stop and some ppl do actually have lives to live so thats one point thats really screwed me up royaly as a player for me personally2ndly an increase in fee is absolutely retarted in order for me pay to play i have to spend 35 bucks wth and dont tell me thats industry standard thats s im sorry but that is every online game has a 30day subscription fee all of them if i want to pay for 60 or 90 days i want to have the option if i wanna jus pay monthly fees for it well that should be my descision shouldnt it taking away all the options really screws everyone up and not everyone is gonna be willing to do it i love eve ive loved it ever since i first saw it and played it but now im forced and limited in my options to play it use isk just to play it and leave nothing in my wallet for ships or losses or pay more then i was before a totally stupid idea and yes it might sort out some of the farmingscamming to a degree but at what cost you should really take a look at the timecard forums you jus raised the prices by 200 more or less thanks a lot

im putting this on the agenda for sundays csm meeting i think its a vital issue and it needs to be right on the top of the agenda the next time we meet with ccp fw can only be improved by allowing long term rp alliances to fully integrate with the ongoing struggle and i believe its wrong in principle to deny game content to the existing player base
the only people excluded from fw are those that dont have standings with the empires it is you that is denying yourself game content because you refuse to leave your alliance theres nothing stopping you from making an out of alliance corp and moving any members who want to participate in fw into iti dont see what the big deal is tbhnot supported
no way leave 00 to the alliances and 01  space to the fw groups
this issue is something to be combined with rodjs thread on the same subject and will be brought up on sunday
yes yes supported obv if alliances arent active in fw it cant act as a bridge to 00 i really have difficulty understanding why the devs dont see that
faction warfares got more people into pvp now in groups presumably theyre utilizing eve voice for the majority of voice comms theres been recent attention in patches to get things more stable which is a good thing anyone ive spoken to whos used eve voice has mentioned now the integration is great and the quality is about a billion times better than teamspeak  arguably the more common of the third part voip tools used by players isnt it now about time eve voice gets the feature we need and a lot of people have been waiting for since it was first integrated into the eve client the feature that would make it infinitely more useful than it is nowthe external clienti say the external client because this was a feature vivox has touted in the past it exists what does not is the provision for it in eve the idea is that you would run the external client on your system and if eve dies you dont lose your connection to the channel s  you were speaking inis this even in the cards for us here and if so what might the timeline be i know historically the addition of features to the client has taken a staged approach but eve voice has moved along at the pace of a snail moving against an icelandic coastal windi know this still wouldnt make it a 100 replacement for third party services but this would be a huge boost for adopting eve voice as a primary method of comms during ops for a lot of organizationsccp please visit your user settings to reenable images
external vivox client i would dig that
may the force be with you
external eve voice client tarminic like
tsventrilo  eve voice
troll much
love eve voice if we had an external client for it too i might just have a sex wee
iirc ccp wanted to charge for it when it first came out once it becomes well used whats to stop them hitting us with a subscription fee for it  once alliances and corps become more dependant on it
eve voice is actually pretty good fw lets it shine  
you could say the same about the forums or t2 gear i think what youre remembering rather incorrectly was some statements which came out early on that the inclusion of an external client would essentially be like providing a voip service independent of the game in a way thus additional costi guess it all depends on the capabilities of it i dont know if its possible to require the game client to initiate comms to the voice service and the external client can only get a hand off from the game then back to itmy point of this is that theres probably a lot of questions such as these yet theres been no information on whether the options even being entertained if not why not if yes then whats taking so long  there were all sorts of goodies which were possible from the vivox end such as being able to tie in actual phone calls to the service imagine having your ceo dial in by cell to be in a corp meeting that kind of thing  it was even demonstrated at fanfest two years ago all of that is nothing compared to the ability to make a voice session withstand a client crash
actually the voice feature we need most isnt really eve voice at all its a fleet feature an option to let people who get disconnected get automatically reinvited to the fleet upon logging back inthe biggest problem with eve voice for me is that theres no way to say hey i got disconnected invite me back to the fleet after a dcif theres some game reason for kicking people out of fleets upon dc then an eve voice feature to let them reconnect to fleet chat at least would be most useful
i have no idea who youve been talking to blinky any time ive tried eve voice the quality was worse than two polystyrene cups with a piece of string between them i last tried it about 6 months ago i struggled to understand corp mates and they couldnt understand me whereas with ts we have no problems i also found i couldnt work out which of my corp mates was talking despite knowing their voices really well from ts we found it too poor to use for a conversation let lone combat ops
its not really trolling when its true
you should give it a go now the quality isnt bad at all to be honest and if you tick the box in the eve voice menu that put the last person to speak to the top of the list it helps a lot
i vote yes to fellow militias to help out another militia that has been wardec with a click of a button at no cost for the wardec
yes
i agree with the basic suggestion but think that as proposed it would be abused in several ways like high sec corps joining fw for easy and cheap protection it would probably be best to limit the number of corps that can sign up to help make it a function of the victim corps militia standing or some such  and then require the victim to approve joins so they dont get get stuck with a bunch of 2 person corps  i think this would limit the abuse potential because only active corps could get real help from itjust my 02 isk but i definitely support the ops suggestion over the current system that makes fw membership such a liabilityedit then again the entire problem wouldnt exist if the fleet member of war target  war target thing hadnt changed it seems like that change has caused a lot of problems and undoing it might be a better fix  would also fix the non fw remote reppers we cant shoot which is just cowardice 
no fw  alliance
well its going to get more people involved in wardecs in empire and thats got to be a good thing
supported i love the idea of new ships that represent these factions and fill out the rosters  they can add color to the background and variety to the playing field good idea
this is cool and i would strongly support proceeding with this as a top priority it would also be nice but not absolutely required that if your secondary skill then completed before you could login to set a new primary one it would just continue to the next level but if it then also completed without any further login it would stop there and go no furtheragain this would maybe just be a nice little extension to the primarysecondary skill queue but i can see that some may not think its such a good idea as they may think we are asking for too muchsomething else that just crossed my mind and which ive not seen mentioned previously is that if say for instance the sp that your current clone grade was rated for was exceeded by the completed skills there could be a messagenotification of some sort once you logged in again to remind you that you should upgrade your clone to the next suitable levelmaybe this could be in the form of an evemail a flashing on your characters skill sheet clone entry or a dialog box that will allow you to jump into the current stations medlab  assuming you are in a staion with a medlab that is  but basically something that draws your attention to the discrepancy before you go and get yourself podded and loose the points youve just accumulated if you then still go out without upgrading your clone and get podded then tough  you were warned
can you hear those faint voices in the background behind youit says exploitsno to skill queuesorry guys but developing methods to allow skill changing through either the web or mobile phone yes signed
yes god please
yeah right like a wfe or mobile phone method of changing a skill in training isnt going to be exploitable at all get realas it stands if macroers can exploit mining using macro software its going to be pss easy for them to macro the current skill sheet or have some poor sods who are paid peanuts in some thirdworld country to sit at a bank of computers just clicking through the skills as they completeby giving ordinary players the ability to queue up a secondary skill or whatever the implementation will actually be it gives us all more flexibility and will actually give real players more power while giving the macrosfarmers very little advantage if any in relative terms
no
looks like the issue is resolved

cant fault kovids reasoning here i think it would a bad idea to shuffle fw off to its own ghetto forum its supposed to be a bridge for new players to experience alliance level warfare and as a mechanic to allow the eve plotline to be influenced and experienced by existing players eve is a single server environment where everything is interconnected  fw should never get hived away into a little instance all of its owni support changing the descriptions of the categories kovid suggests but oppose setting up entirely new forums for fw
agreedneeds a seperate spot for fwi was yust looking for abit info about fw hows it gooing etc and its a mess when seperate it wil be alot easier to stay uptodate
the more i think about the more i think this is the issuemineral prices work  even when broken like they are now because of drops  because they are tied to player time moon minerals are only subject to the number of towers online and because how sov works you have hundreds of towers that are only there for sov andmight as well throw up a mining array because hell gotta try and cover the cost righti think changing it so that moon minerals require player time along with changing the distribution of minerals or adding alternate blueprints would go a long way towards fixing the broken situation
what a load of bull it is very easy to create that risk just slap in med slots full of shield extenders most likely the ganker will miscalculate assault fail lose his ship but not get any rewardthats what i always do my innocent looking haulers are actually quite as touch as battleships some people even have fallen into it it always makes my day imho you skilless lame newbie dorks should learn how to play the game instead of whiningyeah im sure the gankers that spend hours scanning down ships fall for this all of the time funny how freightors with 205910 effective hp  all level v skills  can be killed by gankers but your maxed out badger with all level 5 skills and 4 shield extenders  due to pg constraints  giving it a 13764 effective hp seem to baffle the gankers a caldari navy raven with a full out tank setup has a 99963 effective hp but still seem to die your hauler must be awsomeeither that or you are known to lie i will go with the latterso why do these ships die so easily quite simple they get full insurance back for the loss of the ship regardless if they are successful or not so they can afford to put a 6 ravens with heat and insta pop anything in their path  2 volleys or use a bunch of domis with drones your choice either way it costs you nothing and the other player has no way around it  unless they somehow get hold of your jove hauler that you must be flying around math is fun isnt it just kind of cuts through all the bs and lies doesnt itnobody is saying remove ganking that would be stupid high sec should not be complete safe but should not 100 favor the attacker either just add some risk back to the gankers ie they had better damn well be sure they kill that hauler  pimp bs  freightor to make it worth while or they gasp run the risk of losing isk as a result  see how the risk  reward works in that equation  all there is right now is reward with really only boredom as a result waiting for a juicy target to show up also the game should not have to rely on 2 accounts to live in high sec
yeah log on an alt  oh this requires a second account  warp to the gate where you are about to get attacked aggress anything draw concord into the area if they attack you they die as concord will have already been deployed to the gridor log on an alt to scout your ship through every high sec system to insure there are no camps setup  oh this requires a second account to i would be 100 fine with these options if they did not require a second person or alt to get around it i dont think we should discourage people being able to play the game solo in high seclow sec null sec is a different story
missing the point completely itt
wow way to prove me wrong
solution move all lvl 4 missions and agents to lowsec there problem solved no suicide ganking because there is no concord and folks can battle in um battleships
firstly whilst solo play options exist eve is a multiplayer game thats just the way it is secondly level 4 missions are very easy to the point where its easily done in none faction load outs you say you want more risk for the gankers while you have none at allthe facts are quite simple it is easy to counter suicide ganking but im not telling you how also there is no risk in level 4 missions unless you try to run before you can walk or youre a simpletonchange the insurance payout ill still suicide gank in hi sec whether its a hauler or a mission runner and why will i still do it because i know theres still stupidgreedy people out there that will insist on trying to do as much as possible alone so they can maximize their isk flow
its not awesome it is more awesome than what they expect no use killing a fly with atom bomb if you think its fly might be or might not be thats the whole point no one really forces you into using the ships you use the way you use them and when you use them tbh there is not enough high sec ganking in the game everyone should get at least free frigate once per week specifically for it to keep skilless players on toes its a shame that very likely all your lame whining will have some effect and well make yet another step towards hello kitty online
agreed trouble is the little bit of common sense that we find so useful which they seem to so desperately to need cant be trained thru a rank 1 skill fck them like you say just another step towards hello kitty in space listen to these b3llends ccp and the game you spent so much time creating will become exactly what you didnt envisage
agreed
total agreement in real life you wont get anything of an insurance company if you damage something during a criminal act
yes i want to make it more like hello kitty online simply because you as the ganker dont want to increase any risk to yourself read carefully i am not against ganking i am against the insurance payouts for them allow transferable kill rights as well but i am sure that you will complain about both of those as you really dont want any risk for yourself btw hello kitty is
another whiner joins the fray i love the ganker tears that there may be risk to their profession while they complain about carebears that have no risk ganker i want to be safe in high sec blowing up whomever i want with no risk to myself stupid level 4 carebears have no risk to themselves  which i agree with incidently rest of the game lets introduce risk to the gankers since they complain that there is not enough risk in the gameganker omg whine no i dont want risk for me i want risk for everyone else i want to do whatever i want without penalty and get the full payout for my ship when i lose iti love the tears
not sure why this is still going on tbh the issue got raised supported and presented to ccp there was agreement from the devs that suicide ganking does need making more difficult with additional sec penalties for participating  non final blow  ships and insurance loss was also on the table its done and dusted people and on the list of priority issues for fixing chill be happy
we just like to argue
the real issue is that there was no issue dont attempt to fix something that wasnt brokenyou know it was made to their attention due the whines  aka democracy  you have to always keep in mind that although 900 billion flies like eating  it perhaps still isnt actually very good even ancient greeks understood it and named it argumentum ad populumhello kitty online seems to rule
until they make it so i can refuse to do business with people via the market system and have my economic revenge upon the military specialists who have forced me to redesign my logistics and business systems suicide ganking needs a serious cost benefit redesign
itt we learn about noob corp alts
i believe that if i am willing and spends more effort than you in market by regulary refreshing my orders i deserve to get my orders filled before you
very good ideas and if things like this got into the development schedule and rolled out for missions it might even tempt me to actually do some its a good issue and im happy to support it
i am opposed to removing agent quality the reason for opposing this is that it transforms the location of mission running to be more of a network effect mission runners will gravitate to running missions in a system convenient to a major market because of the network effects we would have even more mission runners industrialists pirates and day traders in the same systems it would increase lag and avatars in mission systems and make the problem worse dynamic quality would be frustrating given the cyclical play cycles it would be difficult to play during prime times it would turn mission running into a hunt for an unused agent fest which in the end significantly reduces mission runner income and enjoyment it could easily cost the mission runner more time than the current lag currently mission runners have the option to pick a new location they have not until it looks like players are changing behaviors the system may not need changing if fixing the mission hubs is the problem move 50 of the high quality agents to low population systems i suspect that the mission runners are in mission hubs due to network effects and would not move defeating metcalfs law is going to be difficult
i like the idea of the proposed dynamic agent qualities there still needs to be some thought to the way the reward system will work with low sec over high sec but in general i think the system has a lot of merityouve got my thumbs up
agreed link to older suggestion for the same thing with a few additions
you are very wrong ulstan i love my caldari ships for pvp and if i was allowed to post killboard links on the forums id be happy to prove it i voted for the nighthawk issue and im voting for this issue too support
has got my vote
this needs a fix
exactly this
considering jades philosophy and the purpose of sf it would make sense for all four major empires to make sf members persona non grata and targeted by fw navies for him to argue that everything is working as intended is somewhat false his own stated agendas would require sf to be hounded by the same npcs as any militia except hed have no safe haven
now its 199
i support this idea based solely on what i have seen in this threadmost of the commentary jade has made is essentially without base or substance and comes across as condescending he clearly demonstrates a lack of basic respect for the other csm members and players seeming to only care about his ideas and how things affect himhe further demonstrates a lack of concern for how this is making the csm look even more ridiculous than many already see itccp should consider stepping in and tossing him maybe that can help salvage the csm from the failure it gets closer to becoming daily
even as someone who typically tries to avoid the bloody politics in theses forums i find this thread absolutely appalling i admit i only read the first 5 and last 5 pages but the gist of this seems to be one of these 2 things 1 ranting that someone is acting like a troll in an influential position when in fact that person acted like a troll before winning a popular vote of the player base to get there2 ranting that a first time committee chair failed to effectively handle disorderly conduct in the first few meetings of a brand new committeein response to the first type of complaint what did you expectin response to the second have you ever served on an adhoc committee a jury maybe the first few meetingsdiscussions are going to be rough the important part is that the situation was brought under control in reasonable time  yes 4 meetings is reasonable at least it is in corporate america now i am just curious to see how this post will get flamed
i respectfully disagree with your opinion though i respect your right to have and state said opiniondo i win at flaming d
i too agree with you for the most part as its not the whole commitee silencing thing on meeting two that has me up in arms its a combination of that on top of his general attitude to anything that is not on his personal agenda
exactly stop having your own opinion jade afterall youre a spaceship politician
i started readibng this in support of jade its jades responses that prove the point rather then dispute it
201 in support of removal 2 or so
rubbishat release there was no default insurance and we didnt all quit when we lost a shipwe got in the free replacement n00b ship with its basic mining laser and got back out there and earned some iskno insurance is a far better proposal than selective insurance
no support removal of insurance is what is needed
this i look forward to the day when i can afford to fly a t2 vessel but i can see how it will be a right royal kick in the teeth if no sooner than i take my shiny new craft out for a shakedown some rp mode on jumped up little punks rp mode off in a bunch of lowly t1s come and end it at very little risk to themselves and they are the ones to get insurance payouts obviously if i take a t2 out without the supporting skills  modules to properly defend  tank it in the first place thats another story altogetherthis i also like i really cant see why we cant also insure modules some of them can cost just as much as the ship itself and often more i agree that it shouldnt be a full payout but still about 6080 would help towards replacing costly modulesthis if you consistantly go out and lose your ships then you should expect your premiums to increase just as it would in rl whether you keep losing them due to you being a suicide ganker or just through your own darned stupidity in not learning from your prior losses is mootthis maybe there would be an option when you insure a ship that in the event of a loss you either have the payout as it is at the moment or you could choose to have a new ship issued instead there could then be a delay so that if you choose a new ship you wont receive it immediately but there is a 24hr delay for it to be delivered to a designated station hangerthis above all at the very least is needed
insurance is a faucet one which injects the game world with isk something we actually need less of in the game for the market to work correctly adding insurance would only serve to increase the cost of t2 items and components because the t2 market has bottlenecks unlike the t1 market t1 is governed by player time demand increases prices increase for mins those mins become valuable and people go get them in whatever required amounts to bring supply back in line with demand reaching an equalization pointt2 does not have that luxury 80 of all t2 is comprised of 2 moon minerals the rarest of the bunch to be exact moon minerals supply are governed by time and time alone no amount of player interaction will serve to increase the supply and really what we are seeing is actually the pressure of that demand on such limited supplyadding insurance adds demand on an already limited supply and has the added drawback of buffing the isk sink of that ship allowing more isk to be spent in the system basically what you would be left with is a spiraling of prices upward pretty much negating your insurance and increasing the entry barrier for new players since other faucets will remain the sameif you want t2 insurance it needs to be player operated that way no new isk enters the game but only changes hands and when items are destroyed they are sunk out of the game and isk is effectively removed
signed nh is short by about 200 grid anyone with a little common sense can see that it is massively lacking in fitting options compared to the other command ships
it never got to iceland because it was voted down in meeting five
im not sure what else can be done i think that the pg issue is as clear as day abundant modelled fits and comparisons were provided but if the other csm members disagree  or from the transcripts simply didnt care  then what can we doa possible course of action may be to ask for the useless missile precision bonus to be changed to one of explosion velocity if that is accepted then the anaemic pg issue could be subtlely tagged onunfortunately what will probably happen is well be told that the nighthawk is perfectly fine in pve and that the precision bonus is wonderful for hitting tackler frigs in l4 missions
well since weve now met face to face its possible that the other csms might be a little more worried that hardin and i might throw them into the river if they say caldari is only for pve next time  id say go for it
ok at some stage in the next few days ill make a megapost describing the current pvp use of the precision bonus  hitting all those abing scimitars destroyers and frigates  and then modelling the effects of a 50 bonus to explosion velocity on a nighthawks precision lights and heavies against inties and nanocruisersi havent run the numbers at all really but i suspect that it wouldnt be overpowered given the short ranges of precisions and the nighthawks absence of a missile velocity bonus the issue is somewhat complicated by the concurrent calls for a boost to precision heavies though personally i feel that the whole system of explosion velocity and explosion radius on precisions needs a thorough overhaul i posted some ideas here but such a big change would require a lot of work to make sure it was balanced
to be honest i think its optimistic to hope that most of the csms will do anything for the nighthawk or anything that is outside their personal realm of interest a few csms have illustrated an objective interest in addressing isssues however most of them have done nothing but address issues in which they have a personal investmentthis thread  and the original linked thread  are absolutely filled with nearly indisputable numbers and proof that the nighthawk has a serious problem ive challenged people to come forth with setups for the ship that would illustrate it being unbalanced with a grid increase of about 170 pg to this day no one has yet to respond with anything other than an uninformed opinion as ive seen no one present a counterargument against this proposal using actual factsthat the csms could even read this thread  assuming they did which is itself a stretch  and not feel compelled to address this issue is fairly solid proof that they are incompetent andor selfinterested that the devs have ignored this issue and the original thread for this long is utterly astounding i think hoping that you can take a different tack and have this issue addressed by the csm committee through another thread  and more numbers and proof  is unrealistic as they would have to care about the issue and be intelligent enough to understand the problem both of which seem in light of the current evidence unlikely or impossiblein the long run all this thread and its failure to be understood or considered by the csms has proven to me is that i voted for a few of the wrong people i will not make that mistake a second time
oh and yes of course they should be random to encourage people to undock more often static will only lead to more scouts flying around
signage
i see those ports and i want to be able to use them but not just randomly i want to be able to pick the port most aligned with my destination saves me the trouble of flying around the station
i think it would be great if we could define our own songs that will be played in certain situations  deadspace combat etc or if thats too complicated at least make sure that johann straus  the blue danube plays everytime you are in warp approaching a station to dock
very good idea i could use that to get rid of some nonsense skills which i got by mistake1
i thing the tear 2 bc would be cool
someone has the link to this log and the other too possibly searching for it with the search function dont give useful results
id like to see this issue come up for csm vote again would it be possible for white ronin and others posting good ideas in this thread to make a new issue thread around the principle of enhancing the exploration profession in general and allowing it to be something that individual characters can do basically lets rewrite the op and resubmit and this time well make damn sure it gets a fair hearing and open discussion in the csm and all the related issues are fully considered
or perhaps have an annonymous submission mechanism for authors to offer ideas to ccp but not in a public forum i believe at the minimum it would be helpful to get an update from mercury on what their efforts are focusing ondo you think a wiki would be the best way to provide the online workspace to accomplish this connection
please use commas or periods as appropriate to your region to separate all numbers numbers ingame for instance 129000 creditsshould now read129000 creditsin the us and 129000 credits for europeans
supported however bear in mind that the standard notation here in the uk is also 1000000000 so using the  as a separator would create confusion with values that arent full iskalso the separators should be added while you type ratheer than once you stop typing to make it clearer as to what value youve just inputed in a given dialogue box
disagreea lot of work see herefor no real effectin my country it should be 100000 and i dont care if its not regionalized correctly as long as i can read it so 1 00000100000100000are all fine with meoh and in my country if the number is currency then the separator is oposite so it should be 100000iski do however agree that all numbers in game should be thousand separated for easy reading and they are for most part but not all
my idea about selling stuff herei also agree on this topicwe need a beter ui hotkeys are a very good start this issue is raised a lot with diferent focuses and solutionsheres onether was one focusing on the change all ammo type issue  cant find it now ive seen others just dont feel like searching and linking them right now
i support the suggested improvements to the eve backstory in terms of clearing up inconsistencies of the type described in the original posti would suggest to ccp that ginger provide the community with some idea of the work mercury is up to these days are they desperately in need of new volunteers would they consider starting a thread or wiki to enlist the communitys help in cleaning up the backstory thanks
bringing this up on sunday   some stuff about self destruct times from thread on that subject
i like this all the points  and rationale  are very true
i support all of these although to me killmails dont mean much but definitely the dd things are an issue and i for one cant imagine why the game state is the way it is
signedalliancecorp logos on ships hell yes no reason not to and weve already seen screenshots of this working theres no reason not to release itcustom paintjobs could be done one of two ways to avoid lag problems1  do it like homeworld 2 where you have preset areas to paint but you can make those preset areas any color you like for example the thorax is always a solid base color with those raised areas a second solid color so maybe you could make yours black with green trim yellow with pink trim whatever you like maybe you could also pick from a couple color schemes such as the vigilant camo  again with your choice of what colors those areas are  so all youd have to send to each client is something like1255255255125215403737119the first line gives the color scheme then the other lines specify which color is assigned to that area it doesnt result in any more lag than having custom ship names does and that feature is working just fine with no complaints2  allow only a set list of preloaded skins this would include the ccpcreated skins  t2 variants and maybe add some more  or maybe even allow players to submit their own like pirates of the burning sea does or how ccp allows alliance logo submissions if the skin meets ccps quality standards  there are people in the community who could do it  its included in the next patch this adds absolutely no server lag everything is stored clientside and all the server has to send you is a single number to tell your client which skin to display
eh i will support this but i dont know if we should allow custom paint jobs on the ship skins themselves a corporate andor alliance logo would be cool though reason why not to have custom paint jobs could you imagine a goonswarm blob all with black and yellow bands p would give me a headache
great idea  i would love to make my ships more unique especially if you can put alliancecorp logos on them as well
zomg supr lojik ftwkaraktr portritz ar zent by teh servr dummaz unlez u r sugestn tht evrytym u logn tht eve givs u teh pikturz now for those who have spell check andor can speak english and are over 12  if i go and create a character and then you meet me in game and you right click and get my portrait where does that info come from does your client magically know what i look like and whats in my bio or does the server have to include that information yes it does cache some of that info but it has to be loaded the first time we meet are we to suggest that ccp is going to take and premake every possible paintjob out there for every ship in every color and preload it on your client how do you get the this color goes here on this guys ship info from where does that come fromyou load on to the local grid with bob yaketyschmakety and he is in a raven and he has a custom paint job with 10 different colors on the thing where did you get his layout from was it already preloaded on your client of course not because the guy just bought the raven and painted it with the nose of it being silver the wings a bright shade of blue and he put stripes on the side how did your client know thatsure the base raven model which is standard for every raven was on your client but where did you get his custom paint job info  skin  from lets say you have a fleet of 150 ppl the load on grid with another 150 why is it laggy if everything is on your client already the lag comes from character specific into that has to be loaded from the server do we want to add more information to thatnow lets say i just created a corp i also created a logo with that corp do you have my corps specific layout already loaded on your client deadhorsealso as a note everyone who votes here and gives stipulations you are voting on an idea that was made in the first post please read the first post the idea was for custom paint jobs and logosif you say yes and then add on but only if we dont do custom paint jobs youve just voted for custom paint jobs your idea is not counted unless this guy modifies his original post you are voting on the issue as presented if you are not for everything and you vote yes then you have just agreed to everythingwhile you make a good point on the lag and system overhead issues dont worry too much about the being bound to the exact issue text if supporting things thats not really the case if we did decide to support an issue like this then it would be presented in general terms without being bound to the specific implementation ideas its certainly possible to generally support discussion of a subject without feeling obliged to support every single word in the op post
i run an overclocked quadcore systemit still takes forever to load the list of members in an alliance or a list of corp advertisementswhy you askbecause the server must send ids for each layer and color of the corp logo for the computer to smush those together is really easy but the server needs to recall them and send them down no its not just oh lookie 1 byte  42 ships  42 bytes no ever looked at tcpip traffic ever considered that maybe the server would also need to communicate the id of the player ever consider that perhaps we use 32bit color ever consider that there is plenty of overhead in sending and receiving informationelisa day is correct alliance logos is perfectly reasonable because that results in zero extra server calls and the rendering is merely sticking an image  not a generated one just a saved texture  onto a ship in a specific location this means zero change to the server and absolute minimal change to the client as far as performance impact goescorp logos on the other hand would result in way too many server calls and that layering process would add up on the client when loading a grid as for paintjobs seriously do any of you respect the atmosphere and feel which ccp has given to the game theres a reason the revelation is gold the phobos is a dildo and the tempest looks like its rusting through the art department has spent a lot of time making that all look good dont screw it up with llolloloololll my ship is purple
screw technical issues thats not for us to sort out this would be wicked rad id waste millions of isks to get a sweet paint job and maybe custom rims on my rifters
disagreeto get close to the dps of a tachyon abadon a hyperion needs a magnetic stabilizer with his 8 425mm railguns with that it still has lower dps than the abadonand the 8 guns put such a strain on the powergrid of the hyperion that you have fo fit a rcu to fit a repairerso the hyperion needs to use up 2 low slots to get close to the abadon and the abadon needs to use 2 low slots to fit rcus the hyp still has lower dps and dont mention cap usage because with this fitting the abadon can fire guns for 2min 45sec and the hyperion for 2min 58secand the abadon has 5 lows to play with after that the hyp only 4the tachyons are overpowerd and as such its fitting requirements are just finei compared hyperion because im gallente and i know the trouble fitting it but im shure the caldari and minmantar bses would have the same problems the top tier bses should be hard to fit and fly
tach ii has crazy grid requirments only to stop other races from using them this was back in the days when ravens used lasers etc try fitting a geddon with 7 tach ii and a mwd and see how much fun that isthat was the only reason for the big changes to tach ii fittingpeople who talk dps should talk dps over 10 mins or sustainable dps they should also look at dps on real fitted ships and not a 0 resist paper
yep  it would a real shame to have walking in stations rolled out and no way to walk around a mothership or titan in the future
when i am bored i find myself in the help channel helping out but when i start talking current eve events and politics i get shouted down why not institute a general chat channel
yep be nice for fw members to be able to post on caod without being deleted
streamlining overview making it more horizontally compact and efficient i like itonly problem is people identifying a militia even more with an alliance for game mechanic arguements
good idea
good day alli would like to raise the issue of corp standings and the current limit of direct corp to corpalliance standings being capped at 250many would say that this is sufficent and in most cases i would tend to agree but i was talking to some folks about it and it was brought up that many corps that are in 00 and not in alliances seem to have trouble with this amount being 250 and not higher with there being so many new alliances being formed all the time and new player corps i can see their point of view i ask if there is a reason that it can not be increased in order to accommodate such corps as i can not see how it would impact the game in any negative way please do correct me if a am wrong though thoughts and opinion are more than welcome i only ask that they be constructivethanks you
250k for a titan is not enough me thinks not that anyone would do that instead of a dd
yes
i agree that it should cause area damage perhaps they could even have the approach option changed into ram while self destruct is activated maybe even timing the arrival with detonation timeabout the kill mails i dont think i understand what you are trying to say but i think the mails should be sent to the parties engaging the self destructor final blow goes to self destructori dont agree with getting podded automaticallyalso another reason to self destruct would be if your ship is  about to be  boarded but thats not possible either
supported definitely adds to the quality of the backplot and immersion in the storyline might mean ccp has to hire some more content and storyline people and id support that too
yep what we really need is an archive category  and csms could do with limited forum mod tools purely in the assembly hall to move completed issue threads to the archive  either that or just task the forum mods to do the moving where csm reps ask for it at the thread 
absolutely terrible idea please go play wow
i like the general idea and its definitely worthy of discussion and yep  its a big visionary idea of just the sort i think ccp would be interested at looking into support raising this as discussion and id like to see a lot more opinions on this
leave the carriers alone plz may be fix the nidhoggur but other wise
leave carriers alonewe do not know that a nerf for carriers is coming from ccp we do know that the suggestion of a nerf was met with a titanic fire storm of unprecedented proportions by the subscriber base some posters were very inventive in describing various methods of creating pain suffering and death for the poor fellow who made the suggestions ccp zuuluparkccp expressed a concern that carriers were too much of a jack of all trades and has seemed satisfied to nerf the carriers cargo carrying abilitywhat the heck is with some peoples obsession of nerfing everything eat some rocky mountain oysters and go to bedalonewithout your bottle of beerwindjammer
leave carrier alone
yep no problem with carriers  lets concentrate on real issues not manufactured ones please
id love there to be an option on the settings screen to click word filter onoff but the problem is ccps forum software is frankly rubbish they know it we know it its on the list of things to be upgradedfixedreplaced and this will happen over the next year or so but really until thats done dont hold your breath on forum improvements as for simply turning off the filter  i cant see that flying because they do see these forums as a showcaseselling point for the game and some controls are needed that said id definitely like to go over the list with an iron pipe because it is ridiculous that words like gay and theutic are filterededit they unfiltered gay excellent
got my vote i still play with all my graphic effects on im a sucker for beautiful explosions and weapon effects
yep sounds good id be inclined to consider a similar link for the fw channels too
as the title say finding the csm logs with the search function is pretty difficult and getting them buried in the forums is heavily counter productive as they are important to judge if and should be reelectedso add a sticky with the links to all the csm discussions
tbh this section needs a lot of sorting out and stickying the meetings logs here will just add to to the mess what we need is an additional forum category to move the issue threads weve addressed out of the active discussion section at the moment this category is messed up with old issues weve already dealt withif you want to see the logs at the moment feel free to read them at the sf forums public section
as far as the technical side goes we already have some of the tools to already do this the marketas it is the market tracks orders potential profit and even forecastsnow as far as an actual stock market i think we would need to first look at how the real world stock market works as far as analytical tools availablefor an idea of how it would look yahoo financialspersonally i would start small and only do npc corporations to start with the reason being is to basically beta test the markethow would the npc market work profits  taxes items sold facilities used  repair station jump clones etc  losses  items bought operational costs  ie agent payouts the market would start small and a limited number of shares  say 1000 per station owned by the corporation now how this would evolve into player corporations well i would suggest that ccp hire a stock market analysist to make it as close to the rl stock market as possible
im a professional investment banker and from real finance industry point of view you got a couple of problems here1  there is a problem with valuation of shares in real world how ipos are conducted is that companies provide full disclosure of their operations and accounts so that investors can look into that  run valuation models and determine how much the stock can actually worth hecen there will be a problem with disclosing information about alliance i strongly dobt that major alliances like ra gf or bob would be willing to give full disclosure of their operations without appropriate disclosure level what you are gonna end up with is a lot of empty companies going public getting cash from investors then dissapering  dot com crisis in us there is also a problem on how to present it  obviously one cannot use a convetional financial format of disclosure for eve however i see it as a minor concern i think if corporationalliance will be willing to work towards that goal then it is possible to design an oppropriate disclosure format and adapt valuation methodologies accordingly 2 there is a problem in financial mechanics of ipo in eve it appears to be not a fair deal for issuer look at it like this  lets make an assumption that calculation whcih was outline in the first post is correct and does reflect a fair value then ra would recieve cash inflow of 3040b and will gonna have to pay dividends forever that does not seems to be a fair deal my wild guess will be that this kinda of valuation methodology outlined in the first post is incorrect another instrument which can be used as a primer is current rates on depostis in ebank at any given point in time investor has choice whether to invest into stocks or bonds and hence return should be comparable if we assume that required investors return is in the range of 24  equity returns should be higher thatn bonds return due to higher risk  and if we make some reasonable assumptions what the dividens will be  i think that is relatively easy to calculate based on average tax accross coporations in the alliance for example or any other mechanism  then we can calculate the value of the stock again this is not a very good approximation and ideally speaking some much more complex tools should be used but this will do as a rough estimate another problem is on the global macro scale eve population is not growing too rapidly hence on average every alliance ability to increase their profit and hence dividends is contrained by eve population growth  not to metion factors like wars for instance  those issues should be balanced out ie not only the dividends should grow over time but the stock value should also grow over time 3  im not entirelly sure that companies actually need those kind of financial activities obviously if a company wants to go public then this company should have a very clear idea what is it they want to do with that cash ie there should be some sort of business plan how the company will earn superior returns on that money right now probably the only good reason to go public will be to raise money to build a couple of titans to protects its territory and even then i would imagine most alliance are capable of getting sufficient amount of resources with their own efforts etc etc etci think it is a very interesting idea and it will be fantastic if some sort of mechanism can be designed to actually implement ipos however there are a lot of considerations which need to be addressed before anything can be dome in that direction
im not sure id go with your suggestion as written but the shares functionality in eve needs some love this should certainly be considered by the csm
definitely bares discussion and advocacy not sure about the specific details in the op but the principle of a stock market in eve online is excellent
this is really annoying to meim all against exploits and stuff but the following two examples are an indication of suboptimal handlinga  beeing able to evade concord is an exploityeah why not boost concord instead not to the point where suicide ganking is impossible but rather by means of when you use your warp drive or logoffski you explode zomgb  the new warp to plex  exploit  situationwtf flying through space an exploit whats nextccp this is not acceptable reallyyes im all for the limitation of ship types in fw plexes there is no question about it but making a perfectly normal ship operation  flying through space  an exploit is pfff ridiculous fix the distance  no one would go 1 million km or so  or give complexes a shield or whatever
would be even better not to even count them as exploits if youre good enough to suicide gank and then run from concord fine that happens in real life as well the police does not catch all the criminals it should be all just good statistically speaking if i go right now outside to kill someone i will have some 15 chance in this area not to get ever caught in some 3rd world countries its likely past 30 hey thats life waawaa
i would agree but i couldnt stand the carebear whines
the gates are closer than normal mission gates i really dont see the reason behind it if they didnt want intrepid players to slowboat therei agree stop nerfing innovation or at least get your devs and customer support on the same page

strongly unsigned at least for carriers and dreads  titans may need some rebalancing  captials right now are balanced just fine carriers are far from the solo pwnmobiles most people think they are and require a good support fleet to be anything other than expensive comedy killmails dreads are a bit lacking in options but thats the price they pay for being so vitally important in the current sovereignty systemso whats the problem pos warfare  especially the reinforced timer that produces alarmclock ops where everyone knows exactly where and when to show up with the biggest ships they can bring  and the lack of objectives for smaller skirmishes where capitals arent useful take a look at how fw is working theres no capital problem because there are relevant objectives for something other than a 200 man capital fleet bring something like that to 00 and the problem is solved
meh i have said it before but this is a new topic so i will say it againlets eliminate capitals so the battleship players will not complainthen lets eliminate battleships so the battlecruiser people will not complainthen onto cruisersand finally put everyone into frigates i mean everyone should be the same rightjust like bane glorious in goonfleet saysthe divide between veterans and new playersthe stratification between powergamers and more casual playersyeah lets start everyone off with the same skills tolets make every ship the exact same as the other i dont like my gallente tristan a merlin blew me up so nerf the merlinlets eliminate the skill training all together i mean seriously if we strive to eliminate the divide between the veteran and the new players why do we need to train skills anyway give everyone the same skillslets just call this game counterstrike in space lets not strive to create a better player i want everyone to be reduced down to my level yeahnow i am taking around two points of banes and exagerating them a bit as i dont read in his  the ops  post about removing capitals i dont however like to see the divide between veterans and new players as a problem its funny that line is coming from a goonswarm members as goonswarm grew to a major powerhouse in eve with nothing but new players  a few exceptions of course nor do i like the stratification between powergamers and more casual players should we talk about wealth distribution as well how about skillpoints distribution yeah lets put a special skill point tax on older players for every 2 skillpoints they learn they have to give 1 to a new playeryou see heres the problemwhen i was flying a frigate and got killed by another frigate and saw that one frigate was cleary better then the frigate i was flying and it was a different race do you know what i did i went to the forums and whined about it no i trained for that new frigate what you say you can train for other ships even if they do not belong to your race omg yeah crazy isnt it yes eve is not constrainedthen later i was flying a cruiser and got blown up by a battleship oooh battleships are cool so i went to the forums again to whine about them  damn i am a whiner  actually i trained for a battleship what you say you can train for even bigger and better ships yeah again crazy isnt itlater i saw a carrier jump into low sec  a thanatos owned by shrinra to be exact  wow was it cool and i knew instantly i wanted to fly a ship like it but sadly eve had put this restriction on my character which wouldnt allow me to train for it so i went to the forums and whined some more actually i put together a skill plan trained up and low and behold guess what i flew a carrier i know i know your amazed ill pass on quoting you with the omg what speak on this pointyou see what happened there i saw an escalation path into bigger and better ships that gave me a goal and enjoyment in the game so rather then go to the forums and try to get the overall game reduced down to my level i trained up to get into the ships i wanted guess what i fly dreads to omgbut yeah nerf the ships because they are bigger then what you currently fly lets reduce the game down to the least common denominator make everyone the same let the game get boring quick because theres no goals and the oldest player in game is 6 months old because blowing up and flying the exact same ship as everyone else gets boring pretty quickly with nothing to strive forthis post is not against bane glourious from goonfleet but more directed to other responses i see in this forum just think about what path you are going down by nerfing ships so that your own ship is more powerful
i see a whole bunch of solutions looking for problems heresomeone show the ship ownership and loss metrics and then at least we can see how close we are to cap ships onlineseriously we arentclaiming that we will be at any point is speculationeven if people stayed around long enough to train for a capital and decided the total investment was worthwhile they would soon discover quite how overrated capital ships areshow us the numbers then we can see if there is an issue
signage thumbage whatever
i support transferable kill rights how i must stress that good reasearch and testing will be need for the mechanics to avoid exploitssigned
why do i have to wait for it i dont give a damn if someone uses sels slotsand it prevents me alright from having fun i payed for
y not just implement u keep what u killsomeone takes loot from a kill that wasnt their kill then they get flashythen i could kill something and wait for the vultures to land and kill them 2 loot stealing becomes risky cause the pod isnt the only thing that can shoot u
a kills b a goes blinky to b a  b get loot rights to bs wreck c loots c goes blinky to a  bthe parties involved in the fight should have first loot rights to the wrecks produced form said fighitng any 3rd party wanting in is far game to be shot at by the original parties if you are on the kill mail you get loot rights to the wreck you also get blinky to the owner of the original shipthis ownership could have a timer on it say 30 mins after said time it is free for alledit clarity
i have to agree with jvol on this one if nothing else for consistencyif i go in  on a mission  and blow up a gurista battleship the loot is flagged as mine the salvage isnt  although thats a different argument  but the module loot isnow im in a war i blow up a war target and the loot is not flagged as mine huh how does that workif you destroy the vessel the loot should be flagged as yours if you can pick it up thats required for consistency nothing wrong with flagging at belonging to the original owner too  but it should be flagged as yours and some yutz stealing it should go all flashy flashy to youof course i think they should go all flashy flashy for a day or so because 15 minutes is a joke but thats just me  and again another topic 
whine
just started skilling missiles 2m sp now i like the fact that missiles are different from gunnery why must everything be made more equal you complain that you need t2 large turrets to snipe in fleet well caldari cant even use their weps in fleet xo
really thousands of people are going to give a thumbs up to anything i seriously doubt there is any topic at all that can get the over 5000  25 of the people who voted in the last csm election  thumbs up on the forumwindjammer

remember its not 25 of the voters to force csm to discuss the issue its 25 of the voters to force the csm to take the issue directly to ccp without a csm votethat was the purpose of the 5 rule in the first place it allowed an avenue for our voices to be heard if the csm was completely out of touch with public opinionbasically an issue could be taken up by the csm they would vote against taking it to ccp the public could then amass enough popular support to push the issue onto the agenda for the ccp meetings regardless of the csms wishesan example would be the large exploration vessel thread csm voted against bringing it to ccp however if enough people demanded it be brought to ccp by supporting the issue on the thread then csmccp would have no choice but to discuss it
no you are mistakenits 25 of all voters to raise an issue to csm not ccpif an issue do gain 25 of total voters support we will have to discuss it at our firstcoming meetingi think 25 is a bit steep i suggested 10 but do remember that certain alliances can make 25 goonswarm has 5000 members if we assume they make all their accounts vote that would make 25 i believe
have just reread the csm document not sure where i got the idea that the 5 rule was designed to do what i thought it did possibly in one of the earlier dev blogsapologies for any confusion caused by this misinterpretation of the csm process
meeting is at 4am my time  so i wont be there since the meetings all seem to happen around this time i would suggest finding a new alternate to replace me as i will never be able to attendthanksoz
very sorry about this omber we have talked about the situation of timing for the meetings but its very difficult to think of a timing that works for both us and euro csms that also allows the australian tz to participate i think its possible we could do something earlier on a sunday sometimes perhaps but were caught on the issue of making our american reps get up much earlier at the weekend to make it fit for alternate participation and as im sure you can appreciate thats a little unfairwell bring the issue of alternate participation up again this sunday and see what people thinkall the best
jade the op has only been updated with 4 issues does this mean only 4 where submitted with the template or have they all just not been processed yet
why dont you rotate timeslots for euusaussie have two useu two usaus two aueu in whichever time slots that overlap best its dictatorship by the majority if you exclude elected reps to ever attend meeting and seems relly detrimental to the democratic aspect of csmxo
xofi  im only an alternate the timing is only an issue if i have to attend the meeting currently the meeting times suit the people who are on the council so its not an issue
these were the only issues with templated submission before the 1800 hours deadline tonight i guess well have a pretty short meeting for a change  havent had any submitted since the deadline either ill take a look tomorrow and add the top2 supported unaddressed issues from the assembly hall as well
how long until the next csm vote i definately miss not having my vote
thanks for that semkhet sometimes its posts like these that make me glad im playing eve online with some personalities and real people behind the avatars respect for your experience and actions there
you can find the csm meeting minutes for meetings 1 and 2 under eve insidercsmmeeting minutes to the left of this post in the navigation barbuttons these are the only ones ive found posted by ccpyou can find the minutes from csm meetings 1 through 3 at the site serenity iswas maintaining at
csm 4  5 are on jades site in raw form
lmao you couldnt pay for better stuff than that minutes log

itt bob posting continues to rise to unprecedented levels
inanna zuni and goonswtf elucidate please iz
ive always been amazed at the whole gtc thing anyway i havent seen one other game that has this mechanism and it seems a troubled one
xbox live has both subscription and time card like payment options its really not so far fetched and yes without time codes there would be no way to exchange  for isk
i definitely support i saw my first pos a couple weeks ago i thought i was looking at some type of debris field until i actually clicked on the big thing in the middle and it said caldari control towerhowever i also think it might be best to implement this as a supplement to the current system rather than forcing such a major change all of a sudden for example ccp might stop seeding the blueprints for the old style and introduce the new style with distinct benefits to promote a voluntary and gradual change or as has already been suggested here and in the original thread make this design of pos cheaper with defensive drawbacks and leave them both in existencei have been in other mmos when they made sudden massive changes to major game systems and it never goes well an especially bad case was star wars galaxies shortly before the releases of their first two expansions 
100 agree i saw this a while back and thought it was the greatest thing ever
rgr
i would fully support most of whats being said around here i think if the tower management screen were made longer that had a cube grid in green that rotates or assigniable bands ie equatortropicsand poles and the idea of towers being equipped with construction drones and haveing it interface with your anchoring skill rank affecting construction total time so u could concentrate on defending and or fueling would be a fair boon to every alliance the fuel bays are now large enough its no longer a issue seer
i hate the  many  parts of eve when it reminds me of rl hard work instead of having fun but if you insist to keep the boring gameplay at least let us employ 3rd world children to do this for us for 5c an hour
ive lost too many hours to pos management
lol pos only gots do that 
100 support from me
hmm i can currently stick any part of my ui over the brightest nebula and find that it doesnt affect medo you fail yes i think so
he could also be colorblind
fully support this
i have the same problem as the op i have to keep swinging the camera view to see which modules are working etcif ekrid would care to share his settings with us perhaps this wouldnt be necessarywindjammer
as a gremlin would put it bright light bright light explodes
the most important graphic element are the nebulas after gui interface size issues and none of them has been fixedupgraded yetwith trinity weve got nice update when the camera zoomed in but i wonder how many of us plays with half of the screen filled with our shipso yes please update the nebulas and let us enlarge the gui size try to activate your overload on 1900x1200 res its about 3 millimeter smaller than the cursor ffs
oh please yes having to find a dark spot in space to see of modules are on is not fun 
signed
or even just a dark background behind the modules so we can see whats running
fantastic idea background colours are pretty but need to be adjustable
signed
i also have a problem with this some backgrounds are good and dont conflict with my ui but alot of the red backgrounds common in venal make me cry  
signed
signed
totally and if they do that they might as well make new ones that actually look nice
agreed i hate having to guess on which modules are because the background is masking it
im with the drop the whole thing crowd but if i cant turn it off at least let me turn it down
preferably have an option to turn the background nebulae off but if not then at least reducing the brightness would be a big help
absolutely i made a thread about this a long while back as well and back then it was still popularthis is never going to be a huge issue but its a persistent one which should be addressed i think the first time the new bgs were in i thought ooo prettybut yknow they got real old real quick space just doesnt seem so lonely when everywhere you look is cluttered by pretty sparkly lights all the timewatching scifis like firefly when theyre in space you really feel theyre alone and thats because the only thing illuminating the ship is the sun and some lights on the shipthe awesome trippy lsd induced backgrounds are cool but they get old quick i mean seeing a rainbow every single day would just make it seem dull rather than refreshing
i support this i want alien  the movie  space not cotton candy space

agreeand a next step would be to do the different colorsbackgrounds per region
i dont really support this although i think that maybe they should consider changing log off rules for a ship based on whether it recently had a cloak up we cant nerf logoffski for legitimate reasons of fairness to those who suffer network issues we cant nerf cloaks because they really are working pretty fairly atmcombining logoffski with cloakski and it starts to get annoying though the solution i found was to use a helios run right up to him flag him pvp and run like hell while you wait for backup to arrive if youre lucky he logs off and dies easily unlucky and hell warp safe warp safe cloak does cost him time though which is the point i guess

totally disagree the whole point is for new people to learn about pvp in eve and then when they have some experience they can go join alliances in 00 letting alliances in fw will totally ruin it and it will end up just like 00 with caps and all that cp some people  including me  joined fw to go away from the whole alliance thing and all that crap you always see in caod that going on therealliances already have their playgrounds why you need to play in fw also go conquer some 00 space why you want to conquer low sec spaceccp keep alliances out of fw dont ruin something good you made
they added some fixes in ea ye doubters should try it again
which would be valid if it were true
except that the op has nailed one of the exact reasons that it is currently inferior
the op has stated one of the disadvantages it has over vent and ts this does not necessary signify a general inferiority which i think is a matter of opinionfor example in fw today we had a 23 man fleet all of them using eve voice they joined and started listening 0 time was spent distributing passwords and server addresses we didnt have to ask anyone to get access to a channel no one had to install anything and anyone who wanted to speak could do so clearly and without technical problemsfor that specific operation eve voice was a clear winner over ventts
as long as ccps client  and ccp  remains in the loop as a possible specific point of failure it will remain to be inferior to vent or ts me points to ccps billing systemme points to ongoing lag every weekendme points to these forumsme points to ccps demonstrated lack of qaqc capability capability and the list goes on
and yet if it was inferior why did we use it
because you are drunk on ccps koolaid  guessing  you used it because it was convenient and free and because as long as you dont lag out it probably works ok convenient and free does not make it on par with ts or vent if ccp made this external to the game client and allowed a 3rd party to operate it who has proficiency doing so i would 100 reconsider my position when a fleet lagsout and 12 of the fleet has to log its an obvious advantage to be able to tell them via voice where to be when  or if  they can log back on
so you would say that in that particular instance eve voice was the best tool for the job even if it is not the best tool for all or even most instances
actually i think eve voice worked quite well for that fleet i suspect that if ccp were to provide a external voice client that the use of ts and vent for eve would disappear entirely
not having been a part of your fleet i cannot say one way or another but i would digress to say that if you claim it worked flawlessly for you in this specific situation with a small fleet then kudos for the convenienceuntil its external and we dont have to reconnect the game client to make comms work again evoice is not even close to being on par with vent or ts
i suspect you would be right if it was also in fact as reliable as vent or ts are now the biggest hurdle here is that evoice has to support thousands of users  or more  simultaneously whereas a private ts or vent server only has to deal with a minute fraction of those users making the potential for failure that much less
fair enough i think that for 00 ventts will remain popular for quite some time due to both being wellestablished and the fact that in larger battles client crashes are more common and tsvent is unaffected by thembut to dismiss it entirely is flawed because there are plenty of instances where its superior to ts or vent
i only do so based on ccps established longterm inability to make their existing game features scale very well and the fact that they regularly tackle a problem to only 90 completion i am fully prepared to be impressed however should they start demonstrating otherwise
im not so sure tying moon mineral extraction to player time would be such a great idea we already have plenty of boring repetitive tasks in order to earn iskbut then again heck why not  everything else that earns consistent isk carries a small degree of risk and can be very boring tooyou could have the moon mining arrays placed outside of the pos shield and they would need to be manually operated for extra yieldthey could even make use of some less used skills like deep core mining for instanceyou could have them continuously extracting moon minerals at 100 per hour into the silos like they do now in automatic modewhen when controlled by a player they would extract directly into the player ships cargohold and they would extract at 200 per hour base speed and when controlled by a maxskilled player they could extract up to 400 per hour  20 extra per level of deep core mining the risk comes in the form of having the player ship  and all extracted materials  outside of the shield bubble so you would either have to be actually there or risk destruction and materials getting stolen also attackers could more easily disrupt your mining operations by simply disabling the miners  much easier than forcing the tower into reinforced  so youd need constant guarding anywayyeah it could work
its not a whine or tears you just dont get it i wont stop suicide ganking because of the insurance or the sec hitok now listen carefully suicide ganking is a good way of making isk because people are stupid and greedy as ive pointed out numerous times in this threadalso its not my profession its just another way of making iskthe next question is what happens when the sec hit and the insurance voiding fails to stop it and people still come to the forums to complain
i can only speak for myself here and i am sure there are more than enough wowinspace players who would prefer all their activities being instanced who will disagree but after a complete insurance nerf for suicide ganking anyone who is still ganked either really had it coming anyway or required some real effort on the part of the gankers and thus those ganks will be balancedif you are really not going to stop suicide ganking because of an insurance nerf more power to you you are not my target audience then in the first place also makes me wonder why you even argue here then in fact an insurance nerf could be advantageous to you if all the amateursuiciders go for greener pastures there will be more potential victims left for the pros and they might end up being less wary after a nerf too
fair comment tbh my real issue is that its easy to counter that more than anything is really whats annoying but i do think it will make the ganking drop off which as you say is to my advantagethe only real way to stop it is imposing a massive sec hit that s the only thing that would deter me which possibly might happen because lets face it theres more mission runners than gankers and that means more subs per month for ccp from them so its in their interest to look after them not that id quit the game suicide ganking is one of the things i do but its not everything for me in the game
this pretty much reiterates exactly what my point was the point  my point  was to never eliminate suicide ganking as i have stated in numerous posts in this thread i am for ganking i am just not for the full insurance payouts that go along with themexactly correct
agree that missions need and can be more fun
yesbut that only matters when the agentmissions are a finite resource  when it is as it is now in unlimited supply then everyone moves to motsu because thats where the highest ql agent isid like to see dynamic quality level adjustment across all sec levels because thats the only way to have the system load distribute automatically  more desirable will diminish in quality until they stop being as desirable and the population starts to spread outideally this will also include lowsec and backwater agents such that the timeeffortreward in lowsec mission running will reach a point of being a viable tradeoff for time and additional risk of dodging pirates
it would be fair to say would it not that every space station in the game would have a head of security head of personnel head of transport it stands to reason that these guys might be junior or senior depending on where it is but you could assume that lower security systems or in hubs would have better people in the role i wonder if this was the original idea behind agent qualitiesanyway serenitys differetiation comes from mining corps having mining heads industry corps having industry heads etcso the problem as anyone who has run missions has found is either move to lowsec nosec which is an option for some for good rewards and probably a quiet system  you hope  but not possible for all or settle for a huge lag fest in motsu or alentene etc or move to a slightly lesser quality agent in a quiet system and actually be slightly penalised for having done your homeworkthe differentiator in all of these is the quality of the agent noone willingly goes and works for a negative quality agent unless you are working towards a better one this system does not work some of these agents possibly have hardly anyone working for them which is surely a waste of processing resources somewhere in that big ol eve mainframei notice that when i check my agent she has an effective quality far higher that her stated quality so some form of dynamic is already in place but i dont really see it has a lot of impacta few questions got asked err hello thats exactly what they are we wish for something better and more dynamic but for those of us who do a lot of missions they are that grind towards and end  isk standing lp whatever   changing the quality of the agents wont make them more tedious this should not be the case there already is a system of mining and security etc agents offering different types of missions in different corps these should definately remain and possibly become more stratifiedthat wont work because youll just move the clumps they might be smaller but probably only for a whileand finally if you removed the quality lowsec gets another gimp because who the hell will go to lowsec and mission if you can do it better and faster in highsec with a lot less riskso the problem isnt removing quality its measuring the reward and giving it out appropriately based on your personal risk in doing that mission this is classic eve risk goes up with rewardso a long way around the discussion comes back not to quality but to reward if you set all the agents to the same quality you have to do something about the rewards so actually you probably dont want to remove the quality since this is probably a lot of work for ccp to reprogramme what you need is more equality in the high sec agents quality lets face it theyve all been doing the job for years not and they ought to get better or be firedthus you get all lvl4 high sec agents are ooh lets say q15 you get a nice spread out of people as they move to find different agents  though i suspect you will indeed need to add more agents over time  however your lowsec agents move to all being oh lets say q17 and your nosec agents get a q20it doesnt have to be done just like this but the answer everyone is searching for is equal reward for doing the same thing but not having to suffer lag because of it so maybe just more equality in the quality is the answer for highsec
i agree with the idea of removing agent quality agent quality is a cause of cluttered systems and lag and has to go
ill try answering this question yesaside from lag the biggest thing i hear my fellow mission runners complain about is the tedium of moving a base on the rare occasion you move i believe it may be possible  while causing great whining  to use the storyline mission system to capitalize on thiscurrently every 16 missions or so we get a storyline mission from a special storyline agent that is very nearby  seldom more than 2 jumps if operating from a hub  typically we run the missions for the agent by visiting their home station for accepting missions and drop off objectives etc but operating out of our own home station in terms of ammo supply changing modules the salvage ship i propose the system be changed to force a major move every couple storyline missions for this both the agents and missions would have to change as followsthe agent1 the agent should be a normal agent not a special storyline agent2 the agent should be the same level as missions that led to the storyline3 the agent should be within 3 quality points of the average quality of the agents the player has been working for4 the agent should be in the same or similar division as the agents the player has been working for6 the player should meet normal standing requirements for the agent7 the agent should be far enough from the players main agent to be inconvenient no less than 4 jumps 8 the agent should be in space with a similar sec rating   1 9 the agent should be in a system that is less busy than the players primary agentthe mission1 must be long and multi parted  preferably 10 parts 2 must have parts that are worth 10 jumps to salvage 5 each way to get the salvage ship 3 should engage multiple rat factions in the series  different damage and resists 4 should include several mission types  throw in a mining or large courier force them to bring their other ships 5 should have at least one deadspace complex that restricts ship sizes to too small  frigate for lvl2 cruiser for lvl3  6 should pay extremely well and have exceptional loot for its level  hopefully reduce the whining a little 7 should have a more significant standing impact than standard storyline missionsthis type of storyline should not replace the current storyline missions entirely but rather happen every other storyline at the most frequent and the frequency of these relocation storyline missions should be a function of how crowded their current system isthe logic behind this system is to try and force the mission runner to move most of his possessions  or at least ships  to a less busy system where there is less lag and an agent comparable to the one he has been using hopefully the slight difference in agent quality will be less of an inconvenience to him than moving all his stuff back and as a result he will simply start using the new agentin addition the requirement that the new agent be in a less busy system means that if you are already operating out of a low traffic system you should almost never have this happen to you an obvious problem is identifying your home system for this i would recommend just looking at the home systems of the agents that gave you the 16 or whatever missions that contributed to you getting the storyline and choosing the mode  the one that appears most often  the algorithm is not perfect and im sure if this got implemented ccp would come up with something betteranother big problem with this is that it would require a lot of work by the designers and probably programmersfinally the issue that kills this solution is that it will receive virtually no support from the mission running community except for those of us that avoid the hubs anyway and wouldnt be affectedso all that to avoid modifying the agent quality system
good idea i likes

aye reason misuse of given power and childish behavior
i dont have to support this just look at this thread he is so gone next round
i agree completely with the above i am working on a proposal that would allow player run insurance as well as quite a few other things including some  hopefully  effective isk sinks look for my post on information war within the week
just read the notes for the meeting where this got rejectednighthawk so obviously needs a boost utterly no sound arguments as to why no support for it some bloke argued that since lots of ppl use it then it cant be that bad and some other guy said issue too small for the oh so glorious csm they have to be the most plainly stupid arguments ever just dumb ass arguments made worse by the fact that the weak ac argument got throughif the csm exists to put forward grand sweeping game changes then this game might just go to the dogs if these guys get any powerthis csm stuff is an utterly ridiculous farce and judging by the fact that u lot cannot even organise a vote without dreadful bickering all over the forums i am given to conclude that you probably couldnt organise a up in a brewery let alone making reasoned decisions based on a sound knowledge of game balancei just hope ccp doesnt listen to any of you
changing the eve music player to winamp seems like the minimum acceptable solution making gamestate changes to the playlist would be really nifty but unlikely to be feasible

this is tailormade for a setting in the escape options
ccp could satisfy 99 of its customer base with 2 boolean variables and they could be selectable from the esc menu instead of truly regionalized  values coma or period variables currency generic the benefit would be the same as time messages handling the number one correctly instead of seeing this operation should be completed in 1 secondsthe bigger issue though is getting it consistent i have noticed both systems being used  on the same screen one time but i cant remember where  and all to often no separators at all  on the overview for example i support this as a very minor issue
ub
i agree with all the points of the op and this as well
i think eve needs more metagaming in general i leave it up to jade constantine to come up with new ideas to add more metagaming to eve
i do not know what these means but more of anything cant hurt
do you mean metagaming in the actual meaning of the word ie making decisions based on the overall structure of how people are playing the game eg antinano fits  or in the stupidpeople meaning of the word as a euphamism for cheating the former is hard to design the latter is childish
i like thati actualy very supprised those dont existthe whole faction warfare expansion was based around a central thought make the jump from carebear to 00 pilot easyer for new playersfirstly im talking for myself herei would find the transfer to 00 gaming much easyer if i could maybe do a few missions in peace and then jump to help my corp on some fleet op for a few days jump back to missions when i need money and so on and so onbeing a new player in a new corp i had a lot of trouble transfering to 00 i had no way of making any money there if older players werent around to help with ratting so i postponed my switch to 00 until the time i can afford to lose a bs and not care things changed for me a bit since that time but thats not importantanywayz i support this because i know that in the situation i was in this was the turning ponit that made me decide not to go to 00so if moving more people to 00 is realy ccps goal this is a nice step twoards it
i wholly support alliance logos and maybe corp logos but you should be able to turn them off eve has memory hogging issues already and when i am running around busy parts of high sec with hundreds of people in different alliances coming in and out of my grid i dont want hundreds of alliance logos getting added to an already over inflated memory footprint and staying there till i shut the client off  i have found i usually get more lag from memory thrashing than cpu overload with eve and it often seems to be more significant than network issues when running on my laptop with only 512mb in regards to the paint job no see what pactusa said about the art a couple posts ago i doubt i can say it better
im not sure but i think i proposed the exact same thing about 4 years ago or so i dont know what ccp thinks about it but the idea of making our ships more individual is great with more ram and newerfaster processors i would think this would be a lot easier to do than in the old days when eve first went live
interesting idea maybe noah would consider this to be less of a niggling ui thing and more of a sweeping view of the future windjammer
wont happen unless the player can control their own depature for much the same reason we cant scoop peoples pods
like itit should not grant safe passage to war targets or kos in empire people  the whole bus should be attackable but it would be neat to allow players to ferry the pods of others around i could see it making moneytheres even potential for a whole line of ships t1 bus t2 rockstar bus along the lines of the transports bonuses
consider what was possible with alliances and corps before factional warfareplayers could not be part of multiple corporationscorporations could not be part of multiple alliancesallied alliances are allied through the standings systemas fw works right now it obeys all of these systems they did not need to change at all if you want to participate you simply have to be a member of an npc militia corp that is allied with the factions fw alliance player corps just also leave their player alliance and join the factions fw alliance end result all fw players for that faction are under the same alliance a single alliancebasically theres no code to support alliances being part of fw no code to support a corp being both in fw and a player alliance and no code to support a player being a member of both a fw militia cor and a player corpthe reasons ccp listed for not allowing alliances to be a part of fw are bs they gave no good reasons the real reasons are quite simple their current systems simply dont support it
ahh conspiracy theories no ccp mentioned the technical issues in the one dev blog but basically said it wasnt an issue  itd be a minimal amount of coding to let alliances play in fw i agree it was a dumb decision but it wasnt made for this banal a reason
simply untrue
seeing as there is nothing in game that would suggest that im wrong and that youve offered up nothingprove it jade constantfail
read devblogsdevposts around the launch of ea its stated somewhere there by a dev but i cant be arsed to find it
ive read itsometimes companies prepare statements to rationalize away a shortcomingin the end it cannot be nailed as a slamdunk lie as the prepared statements will always be a matter of opinion but they generally are made up as a calculated decision in order to hide any reason that might be viewed as a weakness by the publicanyone whos ever been intheknow behind some kind of project has likely seen this before happens a lot
if you are knowledgeable on a topic and see a conspiracy theory thread about it do not post nothing you say will enlighten these people they have chosen their belief and will deny the validity of any evidence that is feasible to give they may say to demonstrate  in this case implement  to prove them wrong but only after they are certain it wont happen for other reasonsso in short replying to the thread just bumped it to the top and kept it on the first page of the forum where it can more effectively spread its disinformation so dont do it i know i am breaking my own advice but i am minimizing the effect by doing it while the post was already first and i know that counter trolling is a poor response to trolling but i just had to 
it is of course a theory no need to get jaded about it im willing to consider something presented simply untrue go read the devblog and dont reply to this arent very much of a argument obviously i am not convinced by ccps joke for reasoning
just a minor issue to add to the mixi would like to see the camera angle able to be locked in relation to the ship instead of the way it is now locked in relation to i guess the pod in the ship without regard for the ship around the pod i get tired of arriving in a system  from a gate or station  start to warp to the next gate or location then have to rotate the camera angle to let me see where i am going i would like to lock my camera so that i am always looking from the same angle in relation to what ever ship i am flying at the time
so you want a driving mode camera in eveanyone flying with such a camera mode would cripple their situational awareness it would be a bad idea and thus no one would use it making it a waste of developer timei vote no
im in favor of any kind of improvement to the camera system
because itd be way too big for sanity eve general is bad enough on the forums it doesnt need a real time presence
well there is the constellation chat channel i dont know if many people use it but its there there are also a large number of other channels available to anyone who wishes to shoot the breezei think a channel that enabled all of eve to talk to each other at once might be logistically challenging can you imagine a few thousand people chatting on the same channel who could follow that remember there are 20 to 30 thousand people on eve at any given time if even a fraction of them try to chat on a single universal channel the result would be chaotic and for all practical purposes unusablewindjammer
have you ever been on the help channelin all seriousness this feature already sort of exists there are a couple dozen public channels you can get by just opening the channels window and clicking join of those the help channel is moderated and the trade channels are ad spammed but the rest are basically whatever the eve radio channels seem to try to be exactly what you describe and there is no stated purpose or restrictions for the racial channels  as a caldari i find the gallente discussions quite entertaining sometimes  i think there is also supposed to be some way to add your own channel to that list but i dont dont how if you can if you can figure it out you might want to add a general chat one but then you only get the people that are in your same situation which might not be that badhope that helps
lachesis arazu  celestis mainly keres for conciderationissues with damps themselvesexceedingly low range of optimal and low falloff seems to be a major problem with the module itself i gather the use of said module is in keeping with the gallente ideal that blasters and close range is the mainstay of gallente ships however without a rework of the range of dampeners to influance sniping designed ships makes 12 of the dampener nearly useless in situations id expect it be designed for not an attack on ecm however i always thought dampener and ecm ranges got accidentally switched at birth complete jamming as opposed to range reduction should have ranges switched if not atleast dampeners should have a realativly improved range in order to do the job if the module values themselve can not be changed for balance reasons my suggestion is the following give damp dedicated ships an additional bonus to the strength of sensor dampenrs 5 more recommended  and a role bonus to the optimal range of dampeners  80100 optimal range this would put your dedicated damp ship for range reduction with fair skills at around 80k optimal 40k falloff which would put them inline with a dampeners purpose harassment of long range attackerscounters to these ships with bonuses described are obvious shorter range attacksdampeners should be in my opinion the formost ewar against ranged attackers yet much less effective vs mid to close range attackers i hope csm will take this into concideration as i belive this idea and ideas like this are very compelling uses for csms time and recoursesthank you flawliss
so thats why we dont see any more arazus in large fleet engagements well maybe except suicide minded ones
okay so i was randomly musing today on what i would do if ccp fix certain issues that have been preventing me from getting much enjoyment out of the game these days and i decided one of the first things i would do would be to get a second account so i could have an alt thinking about this i realized id have to train a stupid number of skills and have to make sure i didnt miss anything in the process moreover i realized this would be a major pain in the ass  and thats as an experienced player i can hardly imagine what it would be like for a new player these days trying to figure out what skills they needthen i came up with an idea skillbook packagessimply put these skillbook packages would be bundles of related skillbooks that could be purchased all at once instead of having to go through the market to find each one individually here are some examples of what i have in mindengineering support  all fitting and capacitor related engineering skills shield  all shield skills aside from shield transfer and capital modules navigation  afterburners microwarpdrives acceleration control fuel conservation etc gunnery support  all gunnery skills not specific to a specific turret type and not including awu or any capitalrelated skills missile support  same as gunnery but for missiles etcthoughts
if it was easier to advertise contracts id tell you to just put up a contract to that effect since its not you can just buy them individually  theyre all on market in the same stations you can see what all of them are in your skill sheet and there arent all that many that nontripoli players will need an idea but i dont think its needed
this is a kind of neat idea but personally i like the situation the way it is i found it to be fun figuring out what i needed and in the course of looking for the things i needed i found things i didnt need right away but could use in the future if id just purchased a package as you suggest i would not have familiarized myself with as much as i did while looking aroundthere are plenty of lists which show you which basic skills you need to cover core abilities shopping for the individual skills is an exploration which the newcomer should find enjoyable and indirectly informativeadditionally each player chooses a different path and no one package will suit all also the price of a complete package may be beyond the ability of someone new to the gamewindjammer
i rememberd this today and actualy timed myselfi had the loot and salvage from 2 lvl 4 missionsit was a total of 152 diferent itemsit took me 16 minutes to sell itand it took me with some friends less than 40 minutes to do these 2 missionsso the joke i posted in the first post wasnt exagurated i actualy spend an amount of time selling items that is very comparable to mission times
sell less often the stacks will start to add up i make a jita run every couple months with mission loot it doesnt tend to take more than an hour and im actually checking markets when blind selling looks unprofitable
ccp please just unite war target and militia into one checkbox like so when you have a a war target and militia only overview and it happens you dont have standings set to a newly joined corp in the ennemy faction they will still appear on overview
learning skills are vital they must stay career explanations with optimized tree paths  by faction  need to be made available in the faqs somewhere note that these optimized skills paths are not likely to include learning skills for example the optimization for a caldari pilot mission runner provide a list of prioritized skills for mission running ship weapons tank etc but design it so someone following that career path will have nothing but that skill set this kind of path would be very helpful for a newcomer and some of us vets might find useful information for career paths we have not yet picked up  the point of course would be to lower the learning curve
i seem to recall that at one time they were demanding that the euro reps just stay up a little later  ie to 2 or 3 in the morning  so they could attend the infamous preiceland thursday meeting surely it would be no great hardship for them to set their alarms and get up a little earlier more seriously in my corp we have some australian folks who i regularly see as i am coming home from work of an evening and they are just getting up  now they are extraordinarily early risers  like 3 am their time  but adjusting that to a more human time  im not sure exactly where in oz they are or how time zones work down there but the guys i know are at something like gmt 10 therefore a weekend meeting at 10 pm uk time11 pm europe time7 am australian time5 pm eastern usa time2 pm western usa time may be the only time to accommodate all if there are reps on central or eastern european time this might become a little grim though  likewise if the meeting goes beyond a coupleof hours or the difference to oz is less than gmt  10 i cant remember zones for everyone in the csm  on the alt list unfortunately
minmatar capitals are terrible
whats the correct supported templateive been unable to find any template nor can i recognize anything consistent between the 4 accepted issues linked in the op
its an internal csm thing a csm delegate wanting to sponsor a specific subject needs to put the details onto this form to standardise layout and therefore facilitate comprehension for the other delegtes
ohit appears not all of the csm delegates are aware of this
so what you just mute the people you dont believe are real people behind the keyboardand youve yet to admit you made a stupid mistake good luck next round pubby
an apology would seem to be in order this post does not even meet the standards of goonswarm windjammer
not that i would normally comment but is bob turning into the new goonswarm
maybe he just dislikes you both equally and decided to consolidate his posts
so bobs contribution to the csm is as followsstfuthats really helpful

actually it doesnt go both ways im not obligated to interact with members of the eve community in real life  nor would i want to  so i can be as difficult and obnoxious as i pleasei know you were probably quite pleased with your lame attempt at turning an argument around against someone much like the vast majority of lame internet personalities unfortunately it resulted in great failure in this instance i am not a csm rep i am not required to act accordingly

maybe support for this idea is not needed anymore but wow i cant believe i missed the original thread i think its a great idea looks bloody good as wellsupport added anyways  
this issue passed in the meeting earlier today and will be brought to ccps attention in augustwoo

repair citadel torps  citadel torpedos getting owned by smartbombs  give smartbomb immunity or huge hp so it needs 34 hits from a faction sb to take down  presiege torpedos dissappearing  should do at least standard dmg  postsiege torpedos dissappearing  should do full siege dmg

ayei have fond memories about the time when one could still change the backgrounds to black or tone down the brightness by any amount manually when it wasnt forbidden yetblack space is so much nicer just with the stars and the brilliant light of one sun eg compare this to thisviewing angle was roughly the same just different zoom
yes
same issues as everyone else  please let us turn these down or off completely i miss the total black of the elite sky with just a sun and the stars
bright background  fail
ive left systems due to the background when i have to play in letterbox mode just to see if my mods are on or not yeah thats pretty much crap1 for an nebula onoff option

space is a pretty black placemake it so
even though i am not color blind i do at times have trouble to see which modules are on or off mostly when flying with a green nebula in the background
i am color blind too and i have a hard time seeing the health bars on targets if there is any kind of color in the backgroundi usually have to change the camera angle to find a nice spot of black space similarly i cannot tell if a module is active or going to finish a cycle and shut off without a black backgroundeven more worrisome is overheating even with a black background i cannot tell if a module is overloaded or not

dear ccp  csmi am writing today to express some concerns about the current situation in 00 space that is its risk vs rewards as well as the logistic hassles tied to it id like to think that among many others i have given my ideas and thoughts on the complex industrial side of eve i started playing a few months before rmr and a lot has changed since then but i have noticed some recent changes in new eden that i believed has made the game evolve backward i have been carefully reading proposed changes such as removing t1 loot but 00 space also requires attentionmany of the concerns and ideas put here have been discussed seperately but i would like it to be seen from a general perspective and see how all of them together make 00 graver than it is thought to be  current market situation the current mineral market situation mainly the huge highend price crash is most probably due to the drone regions by introducing a very easy way of dropping high end you totally crashed the market there used to be a big difference in pay between empire and 00 which made it attractive evecentral has the buying median of tritanium at 25 last i looked bringing the price of a full can of veldspar at just a little over 2mil isk arkonor currently the highest paying ore in new eden is at a little over 13mil isk we are taking a 730 increase or so still worthy naturally but before the drone regions the pay increase was around 10 times that of empire i see little reason why high ends needed a crash like this thus allowing pvpers to do what a miner took months to specialize intolets not forget the morphite crash that took place postrmr thanks to skiffs which even further reduced the rewards of 00 while the morphite issue is small and has long been forgotten i believe something must be done about the drone regions either lower the payout of compounds or drop the idea altogether and assign bounties there should be no reason a pvper could replace the role of a miner who has invested millions of sp and isk in training and equipmentmy colleague akita has a great post about this troubling issue here which deserves more attention  current 00 issues 1  pos  starbases00 has many issues but ill be looking at those touching the purely industrialists you built 00 sov on the premise of pos thus making pos warfare a very huge part of the game i know you have been looking at this for a long time so i wont even talk about pos warfare here but starbases require some attention as wellin any great alliance there is always an industrial backbone without it the alliance would die most of the time industrial corps take care of the pos network that is setting up all the pos around fueling maintaining gunning etc thanks for listening after two years of begging you finally allowed the use of freighters at onlined towers thank god fueling has become much more easierhowever setting up the towers is still a pain a huge pain and there is no good reason for it to be this way ccp has always favored its pvpers which is understandable as they are probably more numerous than the pure carebears but onlining a deathstar can take up to a full day with the anchoring and onlining together why would you make it so tenuous and difficult
i suggest that a skill be introduced  or the current anchoring skill be modified  so that one extra module may be onlined or anchored simultaneously per skill level if youd like to avoid easy pos spamming by the enemy then allow this skill to be effective only in a system where the alliance has sovereignty having a dread alt myself blowing up a tower doesnt take that long especially not in my revelation activate lasers go watch a movie and move to the next one it might make it harder for enemies to take sov in a system but it wouldnt make it more difficult to erase it either at which point both alliances would face the same timing to online towers and the equilibrium would then be back as it currently is the balance is nonexistent as it currently is setting up towers is simply such a big pain that it literally ruins the fun i am positive i am not the only one that shares this opinion 2  00 logisticahhh jump drives anyone who has ever taken care of logistics prermr will remember the pain fellow exascn capsuleers might recall the 4 hours long freighter runs consisting of a 100 ships escort and 15 freighters traveling across 40 jumps to empire than the next day back home in 00 at that time it was a pain indeed but as pointed earlier the rewards were much bigger if only in terms of asteroids for the carebears then you brought in carriers which saw a use you never intended to happen logistics jump drives was marvelous to us pilots in charge of logistics the ability to reach empire in a few minutes was simply a gift of the gods the trend gave birth to something new mineral compression it existed before but it made way more sense now given the limited cargo size of the carrier like you didnt intend us to put haulers in our ship bay and use it as a big hauler you never intended the use of t1 modules to compress ore without knowing it you gave us a great tool but then you tried to fix it and brought the jump freighter in you nerfed mineral compression as well to compensate for the increased cargo but you missed other major issues that make the jf such an imperfect ship for its role 3  jump freighters  this my most pressing issue i have freighter 5 and jump calibratrion 5 realized it made the moving much easier a good 80 days spent but when you nerfed the use of carriers as logistic ships to oblivion you destroyed one of your best creation one that ironically was an accident to begin withyou might have boosted the jf further but its use is still very limited looking at the hauling capabilities assuming a travel fit of the three capital classes used in this rolethanatos 39000 m3 75yr jump rangerorqual 173000 m3 5yr jump range  assuming you want the hassle of 40 gsc rhea 378000 m3 5yr jump range
now lets have a look at the value of the shipsthanatos 700milrorqual 15bilrhea 45bilthose prices are an approximation but is there something that strikes you a 45bil ship that doesnt even have the ability to cloak that costs 3 times more than the rorqual for barely more than twice the capacity deserves to be looked at simply put if you intended to jf to be the answer to 00 logistic issues it failed even with jump calibration 5 the voyage to deep 00 regions still requires 23 jumps through dangerous space rarely all of it belonging to the same alliance sure its great for the small alliances in territories bordering empire such as catch providence but not ones like deklein fountain cobalt edge branch and the likestherefore you risk a ship worth 45bil with a cargo thats worth perhaps just as much through dangerous stationless 00 space with no ability to cloak whatsoever to wait for cap to recharge and jump againjump bridges when i can use jump bridges i use the vanilla freighters my charon costs 5 times less hauls three times more and has the protection of the towers it travels through therefore i would propose the following significantly increase the jump range of jf at least to carrier levelor give it one high slot to allow us to cloak it and make the trips a little  very little  saferas it currently is the jf is most useful for lowsec operations but again the risks vs rewards ratio of using it for 00  which i suppose is why you brought it into the game after nerfing carriers  is so huge that i dont see why i should use my rhea over my rorqual for the trips4  carrierswith the pos warfare you created and the super capitals you designed you made it so that 00 power is now defined by the number of dreadnoughts and titans a fleet has not covering the fact your server infrastructure was never meant to support huge number whoever zergs the other has the upper hand look at the current situation the russians zerging the entire universe having fought them the reason theyve gotten this far isnt their pvp skills its the sheer number they have enough detouring back to my main topic as i have explained the power of an alliance correlates with the number of dreads and titans not motherships or carriers after nerfing the carriers primary role  again that you never intended but that players chose to make of it  what possible use to they have nowthats right pos shield repping thats pretty much it theyre still useful for hauling stuff around but 39000 is hardly a lot of space so id like to know the reasoning behind the nerf you pushed on us you rendered carriers almost useless compared to what they were before and replaced it by something you thought would actually fulfill the role better in vain as covered earlier its a failure not an epic one by any proportions but its very imperfecteven with the boosted ship bay  1mil m3  you can just barely fit 2x battleships in there how useful are they really
thus i propose you give the carrier back some of its hauling abilities or boost the jf significantly as it is both carriers and jf are most useful to my pirate alt and its corp in lowsec but not my 00 life 5  suicide ganking this does not touch 00 but requires attention as well the current trend started by goons is completely senseless while i agree concord should not be made to prevent the consequences for suicide gankers must be increased your official position that suicide ganking is allowed shows too big of a preference towards pvpershaving two pvp alts myself  and loving it  being a carebear makes me understand as well that no pvp would be possible without the industrialists and something needs to be made suicide ganking has became too easy and availablethis simply a quick nudge towards the subject it is not my main concern so i will stop here and will cover the subject if csm feels the need to conclusion i apologize for the lengthy post but i believe my concerns are valid and warrant at least some sort of discussion among the industrialists of evethank you for reading and i look forward to your ideas and commentssincerelyhalada
i agree to a review of kugs ban  not necessarily an unbanning though this was such an incredibly hotbutton topic that some oversight seems very appropriate btw are there ninjas hiding in this forum 
outing accidentally nohunting for the names and outing several gm on purpose yes kug statement was that he would make hell for hell  paraphrasing but that was the sentiment  for all ccp employeescollaborators as revenge for his ban i would never readmit him in the game after he promised and did that for a period
from what i read and remember he recieved an unjust punishment and the whole issue should be reexaminedunfortunately if we must rely on the csm to promote this we are hosed as they seem rather inept thus far at any rate i support thisthe best part of threads like these is how easy it becomes to spot ccp and bob unmarked charactersalts
i would support a skill queuehave it hold at max 30 days worth of training including the skill you are training at the momentif someone cancels their subscription the queue is cleared
i support this
dev response needed
its not needed at all just a handy extra when you click start training you can see howlong it takes for your skill to end if you cant be there at that time set another one that does enable you to do that

no doubt why dont they either take it off the drawing board or implement it already

i think the first step is fixing how sov works eliminate the need for these hundreds of towers that do literally nothing and yet still mine moon minseither a tower is for sov and defense or its for miningnot bothafter that i would address the distribution of the minerals themselves but adding alternate prints which allow the secondary minerals to create the primaries and allow some elasticity in the moon mineral market all in all adding actual real value to moonsbasically it would allow your mom and pop alliances in 00 space some actual weight in the goings on in in the market and allow them much needed isk flow to carve their own mini empire
aye it at the very least deserves a discussion
i agreee whit this
supported
ill agree with this even though akita t needs to stop posting forever
only if goonfleet pays medrevil voiceone thousand billion isk drevil voice
i think an easy solution to fix the current high end crash would be a total revamp of the drone alloys drops and take it out all together and replace with vanilla bounties just like any other regions i dont know what ccp was thinking with this but it is senseless that a pvper who uses a ratting ship be able to get as much high end as a miner who has invested millions of isk and sp into trainingthe balance of highend was in order before the drones region
you know whtas funny thats the exact situation right nowthe only difference your change will make is that the average target will need to be more expensive to be worth it why do you need to mission in a 1bil ship when a 200mil raven will do just finenot supported
why do people pvp in 200 mil hacs when a 10 mil cruiser will do just fine fun and effectiveness just because you dont understand how people can have fun with the mission runningship pimping playstyle doesnt mean they dont and shouldnt sure beyond a certain point a pimp ships should become suicider prey but right now that point is way way too low imho
no insurance for concord killed shipsbadly needed
i disagree with the original post
fully agree
this is what i see happening in the future 00 is like empire with outposts in every systemthey are all controled buy the super alliances the eve usa china russia and all the rest well they stay in true empire where they belonghow does a new alliance stand up to the old ones when the new alliances will be backed up buy 10 carriers and the old alliances who have sucked 00 for years with outposts everywhere will be backed up buy 1000 titans
i cant believe somebody like this is representing the community fix it
i think its interesting how jade got the most votes but also had the largest thread made about him mind you we had a vote during the last day of csm meetings everybody supported that jade stays as chairman im fairly happy about that
i disagree with removal
ccp please moderate this threadi do not understand why this thread has not been locked the proposal cannot be implemented whatever problem there was has been remedied and the proposal was an over the top reaction in the first place generally im a critic of goonswarm and darius in particular but even i didnt call for dariuss removal unless he continued his misbehaviour he hasnt and as a result i haventthis thread serves no constructive purpose and only exists to attempt to grief the chair of the csm and even in that fails pathetically it has no place in the assembly hall and if it deserves any continued existence it should be in the jita park speakers corner as it is more opinion than a proposalbest regardswindjammer
if this counsil is to be taken seriously then you have to remove the people that are nothing more than a joke
well said
i support the op as edited to be dependent on average mineral prices  
prooving that nano pilots are total idiotsi guess reikoku made you more stupid than me
this sounds like a simple solution then who cares if the vaga goes 6km a second it cannot hold down the target and has to get very close to kill it
bye bye interceptors
absolutely not signed and you could have used the other 1000 threads on it including ones in this forumthe only imbalanced nanos are the pimped ones with snakes and polycarbs the only alteration that needs to be made is there ccp has already given plenty of tools to deal with them use them your refusal to do so is no different than my refusal to put a tank on my ship when i go into combat guess what im not whining that a bs can easily destroy my ibis with its cargo expanders hey its mr a plated rapier with an ab is still a nano nice to see you are still so fixated on this issue youre still spouting garbage

i read the log and seriously i dont understand what people are not understanding i really hope that ccp takes a really hard look at the nighthawk its all been laid out what is wrong with this ship and theres tons to fix the drake is a better ship and easier to fit than the nighthawk is why is thatwhy is the nighthawk so hard to fit should it really need why is its dps so poor why does it have stupid bonuses compared to the other command ships the nighthawk is a joke lowest dps slowest hardest to fit the nighthawk is on par with the drake considering it costs many times a completely insurable drake you have to ask why use a nighthawk to run missions fitting gist modules on a nighthawk and killing npcs doesnt make it a good shipccp please save the nighthawk you dont have to make it better than the sleipnir absolution or even the astarte but can you please at least put it in the same ballpark as these ships i can fly sleipnir and astarte and i can tell you straight up these ships are way way easier to fit and way way better for pvp than the nighthawk the sleipnir especially is an amazing ship i cant speak for the absolution but from what ive seen its a pretty nice dps machine and worth using
the nighthawk needs some more grid for pvp while it is good for pve commandships for clearly not a pve oriented class supporting in the hopes that a future csm will address the issue or that a dev will stumble across the thread
100 agree

perceived problem afterburners are not very useful in pvpobjective to make afterburners more useful than a microwarpdrive when webbedexamples of advantages if two ships of same fitting were to dual within webber range that the speed tank advantage be on the side of the ship that fit an afterburnerif a ship with an ab and a webber were to tackle another ship there would be very little chance of escaping webber rangedefensive advantage who knows what that belt ratter has equiped an ab might make everyday pvp encounters much more uncertainacknowledged imbalance with proposed counterbalanceafterburners may then be used as an escape mechanism to escape enemy tacklers an undesirable sideeffect imo i would not want people to both have an advantage within webber range and also be able to easily escape it if other see this as a major flaw as i do a possible solution might be to have webber resistance be a script and the downside to the script could be a penalty to your own webber range so that your webbers stop webbing your enemy before you can escape your enemys webber rangeproposed implementation some amount of webber resistance w some amount of webber range penaltyive currently measured 3 different values 50 375 and 25 webber resistance the comparisons show in  how an abii would match up vs a mwdii when webbed these all assume 90 speed reduction webbers s ignore all other speed modifiers looking at 100 as having no speed module activated and under no speed reductionnote abii activated  235 maximum velocity mwdii activated  650 maximum velocity50 resist w 50 webber range penaltymwdii webbed speed  65 and 10km webber rangeabii webbed speed  12925 and 5km webber range375 resist w 375 webber range penaltymwdii webbed speed  65 and 10km webber rangeabii webbed speed  103 and 625km webber range25 resist w 25 webber range penaltymwdii webbed speed  65 and 10km webber rangeabii webbed speed  76375 and 75km webber range this is only a moderate speed advantage but consider all of the capacitor and fitting advantages an ab has over a mwd and its actually pretty good this proposed implementation values are open ended and just used as an example i saw this idea a while ago and it looked like a very good idea to mei am also not 100 convinced that a webber range penalty is a good idea as it may very well defeat the purpose  could simply stay in the sweet spot

so ill preface this by saying yes reikoku has a vested interest in this facility  id guess were not the only ones thoughso i would like to request that the csm push for the ability for corporations to delist themselves from the stock market  which of course doesnt exist at the moment  in so much as all shares of the company would be deleted and the original 1000 shares would be deposited in either the corp wallet or on to the ceothank you for reading
some rl data for considerationto delist it requires a 75 yes voteto force a compulsory buyout  another potential feature  requires 95  iirc 
dont like people spying on your stuff dont give out shares or control the shares better i bought my shares fair and square from a person entitled to sell them to me i expect to keep them in the original condition i bought themif you desire privacy theres already a mechanism for that disband your corp and reform under a new aegis onerous but already accounted for by ccp using existing game mechanics you dont need to have the game changed to do what you want you just want it to be easynot signed
my understanding is that most of these story arcs were supposed to be tied to in game events those events have had mixed results and though i was never fully versed on the details nor can i even remember what details i knew at the time but i seem to recall that there was a great deal of drama of the unfavorable kind on more than one occasionshort version in game events with player interaction fell through with the plan for the events disrupted the actually story never got finishedhowever events are not necessary for the story arcs to complete make a few tweaks to npc character attributes and descriptions make some news posts etcsigned
not going to vote since i agree with the majority of the posterslogos yescustom paint jobs nothemes yes only if you could limit to 2 maybe 3 themes per ship
as discussed in other places there are a lot of things that could be added to improve the uii take a different slant many of the activites in the interface cause me physical pain  from too many mouse clicks  every time i playing eve my wrist hurtswe should get ccp to make the common activities much easier  this includes looting changing ammo changing fittings switching targets and tractoringdont put trash it right next to make activeetc
a few observations as i sit here in spacewhy is the rightmost window control sometimes minimize and sometimes close some windows cant be closed but now i can never be sure of the result of clicking on the corner of a window without examining a subtle iconwhy when i right click on a characters portrait in the chat user list do i get show info as the first option but when i right click on their name in chat all the menu is the same except for the lack of show info well you can simply left click on the name to get an info window but as a result my habit of right click then select show info which works virtually everywhere else in the game is now broken and has special case i need to rememberwhy is it i can drag most items into chat but if i have the info window of an item theres no way to drag it to link itwhy can i not drag results from people and places searcheswhy are some windows like the channel settings window modal  they become the only window you can interact with until theyre closed why can i not assign a key to activate a whole row of modules or why not assign control groups much like an rts ive heard mumblings about making macros easier but thats no excuse macros will always be possible theres no point in punishing us to delay macroprogrammers a whole 15 minuteswhy is the analyze button all the way at the bottom of the system scanner window and not in the separator between the probes list and the scan type groups list why is the new scan button also at the bottom and not at the top in the empty space next to the scan progress indicator why must i reselect my probe  even my builtin ship scanner  for every new scanwhy does the ship control interface only show one module rack at a time  himedlo  oh right well we sure have come a long way  and now that im done listing complaintsbeyond the basic requirement that it actually function and meet the specifications for the game design the evolution of the eve ui seems to have been driven by two primary concerns that can be attributed to two professions of developer whats the minimal complexity to program attributed to of course the programmers and what is aesthetically pleasing and follows the eve look and feel attributed to the artistsbut ui is about much much more than that its about consistency its about discoverability its about reducing the number of clicks the distance of mouse travel and so onone must be careful not to mistake ui design with game design and to not confuse simplification with automation it certainly would save us a lot of mouse clicks if we had a button labeled start mining and it would change to stop mining while our ships wandered the belts collecting ore as nice as that might ahem its not what were after in this discussion  i know this is a bit long winded and might sound a bit preachy one of the first  if not the first  post i made on the eve beta forums was about ui issues i wouldnt say youve touched a nerve exactly but ive certainly given it some thought already  in conclusion ccp is very proud of hiring an architect and a costume designer for ambulation when ccp had 30 employees it wasnt feasible to do that and likewise it was unfeasible to have an employee that is responsible for ui consistency and the authority to hold things in the pipeline while tweaks are made for usabilitybut things have changed havent theymy wrists sure hope so
as with nearly every eve ui thread ever signed
no one can provide proof for what you say except ccp this is a simple fact of realityyou dont believe in what ccp has said about fw vs alliances ergo you wont ever get solid proof to prove you wrong so obviously you already won the entire argument
at the csm summit ccp said  according to all the csm members anyway  that it would be a trivial proccess to let corporations within alliances to participate in fw it would literally be a value theyd change from 0 to whatever they wanted the maximum limit to be
there are some significant reasons alliances are not allowed in fw and none of them have anything to do with coding or hardwarewindjammer
to put simple physics in mind if a titan creates such a massive gravity well then why cant it begin to be attracted to another titanimagine this scenario 3 titans begin slowly moving towards one another warning klaxons go off smaller ships get sucked into the gravity torrent and finally the 3 ships collide exploding simultaniouslythat would prevent a multisupercapital fleet
enough titans to dd a cap fleet will also destroy each otherit is a self correcting situationlike the previous thread on this i would like to see some ship ownership metrics before we run around crying about capships online
capital and titan roaming gangs my  
titans need a review but im not so sure your solution is a good onewhat we really need is a full review of 00 empire building that also includes the role of titans i dont think this is a problem that can be fixed without considering more than just that ship but with the tendency of csm to break things up into smaller issues i dont think csm is the forum to really discuss 00
im sure someone as smart as yourself can see this blatently isnt true 1  a blob of 30 titans is almost certain to include some erebusleviathin those two titans give an immense hp bonus to the rest of the gang seeing as how erebus seems to be more common than leviathan have levi as fleet commander and an erebus on each wing now everyone has 30375 more tanked hp over allyes the enemy dreadfleet can have titans in its gang but not only does this mean groups without titans online cannot deploy capital ships but the chances of having people with titan 5 in a group of 30 is far greater than if you only have 23 titans2  titans have more hp anyway t2 fit with dual cap reps an archon has just over 15m effective hp a revelation a little under 22m and an avatar at 38m no dread can get more ehp than a revelation with comparable fit and no titan can get less this is without the amplifying effect of leviathans and erebusin any case comparable fits are unlikely  if you are doling out 30 titans at 50bn each its quite cheap to spend 1bn on deadspace hardeners and 2bn on a slave set while full officer fits are unlikely with a titan blob on that scale you can maximise ehp relatively cheaply especially on armour this is not going to be the case with every dreadfleet in the gamea deadspace hardener slave avatar with an erebus in gang has 10m ehp even a dodgy badlyfit armor tanked ragnarok can achieve 55m while a rev with the same treatment only 47m even without extreme fittings a correctly setup titan blob can take down infinitely sized fleet composed of any ships but titans they will all survive and most will still be within their tanked medium not in structure are you seriously of the opinion that nobody will ever be able to put together that many titans considering that more than enough are already in the game to do this and growth is accelerating
mission salvaging live mission for people not in the gang is not right it mission belongs to the player it was given too and it should be up to that person if he wants to salvage it or not  other should not be able to warp in and salvage with out being a target just like stealing out of a can its a live mission no free space
you are absolutely correct knives are overpowered and forks and spoons need a boost to compensate
everywhere in space is free space just because you happen to be running a mission somewhere does not make that area of space yours as to salvage concord have stated that they place no value on wrecks therefore they are not classed as property so anyone can salvage them if they can find them without concord interventionif it bothers you that much that people do this then i suggest either a  sacrificing a few points on agent quality and moving to a less populated system or b  loot and salvage as you go

ok come on cp a little late no you havent posted anything so far
the cynic in me is saying that now that the delay has allowed eon to be released including what is pretty much an exclusive article on the iceland meeting ccp might actually post up a few more minutes
if ankhs been having trouble why hasnt dierdra done it i thought this was the exact reason for having a vicesecretary to fill in when the secretary cant do the job for whatever reason
ive been having some personal issues but the minutes were completed a week ago not sure why they have not been published yet
can you post them on some other site and provide a link or maybe get serentity to host them on the csm site even a cheap blogger account would be plenty to sate the ravenous hordes of csmwatchers aka me 
we do really need ccp to sign off on these since we did have to sign ndas and its possible they might not be happy with some stuff in the minutes sorry about the delay but we have to be responsible and ensure ccp are content for this stuff to be released
bump for maestro  this thread has the minutes  all but the iceland trip  locations you seek
lockednonconstructive
nvm i missed the primary focus of your post my mistakehowever to the qualms expressed by other posts i dont see a problem with being able to effectively buy isk for cash players still have to skill up
by allowing outside real world money into the economy of eve eves economy is artificially influenced when that happens its not a closed in game economy and the player driven aspect of the economy is weakened since one of the strongest means of pvp is economic you can see how this is a problembeing able to purchase isk for cash removes a dynamic from the game by allowing a player to ignore for the most part the means by which isk is earned inside the game essentially allowing a player to pursue a line of play that might be unsupportable in any other fashion also there is the strong potential for people with large amounts of real life disposable income to simply purchase their way to a dominate postionyou also have the problem of people using isk to purchase game time some are far more able than others to pursue this for instance they may belong to a large 00 located alliance with high income per pilot and be able to easily play eve for free using 00 assets this tends to balloon into people having multiple accounts and not really paying anything for them this is a disproportionate weighting giving them more power than people who pay ccp real money for an accountessentially this gives more power to people who play for free than people who actually pay ccp moneyim sure ccps economist has a lot to say on this matter both in terms of in game play and in terms of ccps real world cash flow ccp might be able to use a bit of extra cash to put into developement and fixing bugsregardswindjammer

citadel torpedoes really suck the smart bomb thing is really really sad it should take several smart bombs to wipe out a citadel torpedo they should have a lot of hp this is a huge issue for the naglfar and phoenix its not just a caldari issue so you dont have to ignore it ccpalso why no capital cruise missiles i think for pos popping the citadels are fine but for capital engagements where range is a factor i would very much like to see a swift moving capital cruise launcher a nice 812kms missile for fleet fights you dont bring torpedoes to fleet fights and being stuck using capital torpedoes in fleets is rather meh
rockets  10 hp 25 damage  04 hpdamhams  30 hp 100 damage  03 hpdamtorpedoes  240 hp 450 damage  053 hpdamcitadel torps  650 hp 1800 damage  036 hpdamct in siege  650 hp 13050 damage  005 hpdamsolutions either a flat increase of citadel torp hp to something like 13001775 hp  or  grant the siege module a missile hp bonus similar to the damage multiplier bonus to bring them up to an even higher hp  but only when in siege mode 
ill try to stay polite  but its hard to grasp the extent of stupidity in this thread how can you make demands like these when you have no clue why the torpedoes dont do damage to titansno its not because they arent tough enough and no its also not because phoenix pilots are slow at shootingthe problem is explosion velocity in siege mode  140625ms  combined with the fact that supercapitals cannot be webbedcitadel torpedoes need to have an explosion velocity somewhere between 30 and 50 in siege mode in order to be useful for hitting supercapitals but this is a nano whine all over again
pan if the explosion velocity was the problem  and i do agree with you that their effectiveness against anything not sitting still is crap well it is a problembut in that example log you didnt see your citadel torp hit for 0 damage which would be indicative of the above you didnt see any status at allmeaning the torps never made it to their destination they were popped by smartbombsits kind of funnycitadels being so slow mean they can conceivably get several rounds of smartbomb love applied to them so while other missiles may not be popped by one due to timing or simple speed the citadel is more likely to be destroyed even though it should arguably be the hardesttoughest misl out there
oh dear firstly this doesnt explain the minimal damage done to capitals and secondly it doesnt explain the absence of any damage message at all  ie hits for 01 damage stupidity indeed
agree
ive already rolled this into the discussion on buffing minmatar capitals  ie naglfar  but heres a thumbs up for you anyway
excellent idea
this
i actually dont think this is a good idea heavy logistics bcs would be a lot more useful being able to do heavy remote repping in a bs gang while absorbing a lot more than their cruise counterpartssimilarly and viceversa there should be a command frigate

posting in a chribba thread  he gave me shineys
good enough for me
imagines chribba flying through an ateroid belt obliterating asteroids with massive mining lasers
as a miner myself i say that only good things can come of this you have my support
yes indeed a dread should be have capital mining beams
yes capital mining lasers oh god yes as for phoenix maybe give it torpedoes that drills inside a roid and blows it up leaving the ore scoopable in spacein the future mining ddds could be introdouced theese would blow up any roid on grid and leave the ore scoopable in space for balancing maybe make is so that only roqual can scoop blownup ore in space
it should be just a really big claw that reaches out and eats roids
agree 1400mms have needed a bit of rebalancing for a long time
increased jumped range and jammer immunity would be so wonderful i cant actually see myself going into battle though

kugu is a waste of carbon banning him was a service to the rest of us no matter what the real story behind the hacking gig really was
hell yes
as long as training is paused for cancelled subscriptions i fully endorse this idea
given the rate at which sinks work that could be a possibility soon enough
exactly if people would look at the historical data youll make a clear note that megacyte zydrine and noc in particular since this makes a large portion of the midline ores  low sec not null  were all tracking much higher than they are now while your low end ores were tracking much lowerthe only difference before the introduction was that mex was tracking higher than normal this was do in part to the absurd amount of the stuff required for capital ship production  why this is the second most used min instead of pye for the bulk of production is anyones freaking guess 
you dont even have to removeem  just balance them out in a typical shipbuilding ratio
a fix to the crazy price of dysprosium and promethium should have been done long ago already
if you dont want suicide ganked in highsec dont be a high profit target in the case of freighters dont be an unescorted high value target bring friends with ecmas soon as they open fire on you they become global criminals your friends can ecm or damp at will most ships wont survive the first jam cyclenot supporting this
unless youre running like 4 officer mods or 8 faction mods i wouldnt botherare you doing thatcause in the eve universe that would be a notbright thing to doespecially given that lag in a mission can kill you just as dead
how about ecm modules anchored in high sec near gates this would have 2 results it would allow the ganked to possibly escape due to lock loss by aggressors
you may be exercising sound economic judgement and thats all well and fine however at the moment it seems suicide ganks occur primarily for the lulz effect with ooh look shiny as the secondary effect  cherry on top  suicide ganking should be a highrisk daring undertaking in high sec of which at the moment it is none see jihadswarm for proof
wrong suicide ganks is a way of making a living noone spends hours scanning missionrunners and the effort of getting half a dozen bses together for the lulzso basically what you are fighting for is the right to fit mission ships overly expensivewell guess whatdoing so comes with a risk
socratesznot true you can suicidegank a ship with one ship alone  and another nonaggressed to scoop up the loot again see any of the numerous jihadswarm threadsdont misunderstand im not for completely nerfing suicide ganks nor am i fighting for the right to fit mission ships overly expensive i am however against suicidegank being riskfree or minimally risky if you have assembled a dozen battleships and have spent hours scanning for the right target at the right time then good for you you deserve that juicy clumsy target coming your way that is not what i am againstimho it is way too easy to suicidegank in high sec the consequences are just a slap in the hand and the rewards are extravagant anyone can do it it doesnt take much planning character skills or player skills hell i can use a couple of alts to suicidegank a mining ship in high sec and i dont think the solution to an osprey pilot is to have escorts in high sec so he can mine veldspar there should be a possibility to be blown up but i would like for the perpetrator to think it twice  or better yet three times  before ramming his disposable ship into the osprey
some idiots tried to suicide my af the other night carrying a whole 8m in datacores 8 million isk in datacores no officerfaction mods jut plain t2they didnt succeed  tank was turned on i get nervous at times  but the point is that the practice is far too common when you cant pass through any gate in certain regions of eve without seeing a potential suicide group or getting scanned there are obviously not enough drawbacks to the profession
heres my 02 isk on the subject1  maybe but youd have to make a counterset right now some npcs are extremely tough to kill  zor kayzum mother drone and one other where they are in a middle group of 5 groups and fire missiles 2  only if you increase the bounty on ships accordingly the difficulty of missions usually equals the rewards and removing all t1 loot will only reduce mission payout  smartbombs and such can sell for a lot 3  incorporate that into fw missions pveers have setups that we like and the last thing we need is another module that needs to be used  minmatar usually have to fit webbers amarrgallente fit cap rechargers and crapdari fit shield mods 4  agreed but only to an extent having all frigs would be too easy or hard depending on weapons used maybe have a chance of some ships being upgraded to t2  webscrametc  but keep the overall layoutis missions grinding sometimes yes however when i come home from a tough day of work i enjoy taking out my aggression on such enemies maybe making missions more tricky would work  as 4 above  but what about different mission types  like cargo delivery except that you have to put something in a container etc 
mission could take some love agreed especially random spawns would make it more challenging im unsure for the t1 loot some give nice isk  like the mentioned smartbombs fe  and others generate rare minerals like zydrine which you usually dont get in high sec

i dont know if it has already been discussed but i propose thatagent quality becomes directly proportinal to agent standing in other words all agents start out with low quality towards an individual but as you grind missions with them their quality goes up along with your standings toward them so agent quality would be based on individual standings toward the playerthat means i can pick any agent anywhere and eventually work standings high enough not to worry about switching to a higher quality agent say in motsu or saila now rewards and lp would still be significantly higher in lower security systems but agent quality depends on how long youve run missions with that specific agent
signedcaldarip pvp needs a little love yes i use ecm but ecm doesnt get the final blow lolsauce and the precisions are good place to start dont give a crap about pve tbh  
agree fixing t2 variant missles to combat nanoships or at least making them more effective would go a long way to rebalancing the nano issue given the large population of caldari and missle skill based characters in game
i dont believe this thread is still going i stopped caring about the issue a long time ago once i realized that this first meeting is a test if the csm can survive with jade in charge it can survive just about anything so while i still despise almost every little hypocritical thing jade does in eve i still see this as a very interesting sociological test for the csm body i hope it survives rock on
avon things are a little rougher than they were even when i started back in 2004 when i started you didnt get gatecamps and suicides on miners  although ore thieves were around by then i support the idea and suggest two other possible ideas decrease in the cost of insurance based on concord secrat and a decrease in payout for all pilots based on the security rating of the system that will stop 00 pilots from benefiting  whether that is a good or a bad thing is up to you  it could be argued that you are beyond concords monitoring and so cannot be confirmed  coupled with the t1 payout adjustment  leave t2 as it is or possibly remove it completely  and the removal for piracy  a true pirate will simply adjust their profitloss figures to find the new bottom line  you will see better piracy and less ganking  there is a difference  it will protect empire miners and the like who stick to highsec  they wont be safe but theyll not be as badly hit by a suicide  and those who delve into lowsec will have a little more danger but not lose the safety net altogetherright now as said earlier you have the weird system where ship cost  insurance cost is very close to the payout meaning the ship is very cheap to buy and insure this should not be the case for pirates  they need costs for their business just like the tradersmerchantsbuilders they prey on  nor for those beyond concords protection  and engaged in active fighting on another nations behalf usually ive been based in 00  im exdmgi and exfix  and fought there ive flown alongside bob and mc and have lost plenty of selffunded ships and didnt insure any of them as far as i know pvp is too unpredictable  you might lose it or it might survive as long as it takes for the insurance to run out ive also got a t2 production character so i can see it from both sidesso yes i agree with the noinsurance for piracy and adjusted insurance for t1 but i disagree with insurance for t2 id also like to see adjusted insurance for security rating of the system the ship was lost in and also cost for the pilot taking out the insurance with discount for careful pilots perhaps also for security rating increases based on time for positive pilots as part of this  to a set maximum avon a little more to your liking or no
i agree on the part for suicide ganking but t2 is somehow controversial simply because me thinks if one cannot afford loosing a uninsured t2 he would probably switch to the t1 which is in fact a sort of balancing on the other hand when flying a t2 ship you would have to take a t2 fit as well which makes this whole thing very expensivemy solution would go like this no insurances at all except t1 frigates for the new eve citizens fly what you can afford to loose end of story

nice pvp you just killed the industrials building ships but i agree with the fact insurance needs to be looked at
t2 ship agreement
i dont agree with this as the proposal is not only based on flawed assumptions but is also open to massive abuse
supported the way insurance functions now id rather see it removed completely

this is an issue im bothering with for a very long time since there is only the usual crappy comments on the numerous thread on the forums ill give the csm a trymy intention is simplei want to close the gap between the standard tier 1 ships to their tier 2 counterparts actually everybody uses t2 stuff if he has the skills for it leaving t1 non competetive faction vessels could close this gap partially if their pricing and stats would be updated to a level where flying them would make some sense to underpin this you just have to take a look to the killboards  or gates you travel by  to realize that nobody actually flys them well except some collectors and the bunch of lvl4 cnr runnersconsidering the fact that you dont have character classes in eve a wide variety in ships is all you have and the gap between t1 frigs  assault shipsinterceptors is huge not only in terms of stats but value and skills same goes moderated for crusiersi would like to encourage the csm to vote for a reduced lp requirement for the standard navy frigates  firetail hookbill comet slicer  they should fit right in the middle between t1 and t2 both with their price and firepower something between 5 and 10 million isk should be adequate the pirate faction frigates should have some pvpewar bonus pricing around 15m as a result we would actually get 9 ships that would be used and not only stand in some hangars and yes dramiel needs a major boostfor cruisers its a bit different as there are allready some that fit in terms of firepower and pricing see the navy caracal or vigilant most of the others fit in value but lack balancing see gila navy exequror or navy ospreybuttom line is i would like to see faction frigatescruisers beeing reasonable affordable and useful for pvp to give the new pilots a grip to somehow compete with the veteran t2 capabable pilots i would like to see more variety and different roles for t1 faction to somehow get a grip to the huge variety of t2 compare for yourselffrigates  assault ships electronic attack frigates interceptors covert opscruisers  hacs hics recons logisticseverbody complains about to few newbs in lowsec to bash wonder why if it takes months of training to comtete faction vessels would and should perfectly fit here and reduce the huge gap between t1 and t2 a little
theres problems with lowering the lp costs namely devaluing them how do you compensate all of the mission runners in the loss of lpisk also this would destroy their uniqueness as anyone who cant fly tech 2 or afford it would fly them i guess it comes down to whether or not you want to keep them unique rare and with a very special niche or just have them be runofthemill combat ships  of which we have plenty to choose from  frankly i understand the issues with faction ships and that they do have something missing but you should also see how difficult an issue it is as to what to do with them same could be said for assault ships but to a lesser extent
i get your point but i dont see the devaluing effect on lp if you need 2500 lp and 25 million isk to get a comet out of lp store and sell it for 5m you would still have your 1000 isklpfor the uniqueness issue yes they wouldnt be unique anymore but the pirate faction frigs would still be rare at least anyways i dont see a general benefit of a uniqueness basically unique means they are database corpse at least if the pricetag does not match their abilities in any way as its used to be atm i can understand that it would not be inline with ccps plans for faction stuff and i have to admit that i tend to see faction over t2 over t1 in this case the problem is that t2 is actually better than faction ships and many modules buff the faction stuff over t2 and leave the pricing as it is  i mean like a lot more expensive than t2  i could well live with thatedited for typo
i thin troy with devaluing of the isklp mean the devaluing of the isklp spent in the past to buy the ship ie if ship a did cost 25000 lp 25 millions in the past and after the change it cost 10000 lp and 10 millions all the ship in players hangars move form a value of 50 millions to a value of 20 millionsnot a big problem as players owning faction ships usually arent poor maybe an alternative could be to make the current  or most of the current  faction ships the equivalent of named  metaitem 14 like for the modules  ships introducing some true faction ship  better than t2  the state issue ships could be a example of true faction ships the named ships would have good prices at around t2 level easier skills but less good than t2 true faction would have huge prices like all the good faction stuff this could even partially resolve the high end isk sinks for players if those faction ships are only available through npc they could sink a lot of isk out of the game
well yes why not but that would overshoot the mark a little   actually a slight rebalance would allready deal a great benefitas for your idea of the state issue vessels agreed its a shame that merely less than 0000001 own one but its only 4 bs if i count correctly i think these would perfectly fit as a reward for the factional warfare which is actually missing any reason for even participating of course only one per player who reaches 99 fw standing pretty much the same as the highest cosmos missions
absolutely positively agreed here

agree there should be parity among t2 ammo types and close range and missles could definitely use a rethink
this
nice idea
whatever can be done to balance ammo would be good one way or another go ahead and change on or the other or both faction and t2 ammo cost and demand is one thing but it doesnt balance against what some t2 ammo is
this thread just killed my inventionproducion plans for t2 short range crystals plese boost them so i can make some isk lol
signedi remember all too clearly the complaints from ccp about superfast speed modded raxes using twin bs class mwds that would only run for a while before running out of cap this lead to the nerfing on mwd and the only one burnermwd per ship ruleto me 13kms is far too fast it needs to be dropped a bitsolution to me would be to remove snake implants and any other implant that gives a bonus to speed for one thing looking at adjusting the stacking penalties for nanos may be another to encourage less extreme modificationsedit i would also add that improving missiles  increased speed flight time and explosion speed would all help to counter interceptors and nanoed ships right now unless the vaga pilot is pretty useless heavy precision missiles  the intended counter to these ships  just doesnt cut it i managed to kill one vaga with a cerberus that was rigged up to do so and using precisions and that was a damned close call and from the sound of things that guy was slow compared to others usually as soon as you open fire they just open the range and laugh you cant even use covops to warp to them since theyre always moving fastsomething needs to be done to hit the superfast hacs and rein in the interceptors a little to make them more sane speeds while still letting them fly faster than anything else
the biggest issue i see with nanos is that they kill the tank or gank idealism of most of the ships many ships are fit solely for one of those roles and a nano doesnt need to fit a tank since its speed is its tank and the gank can be fitted in there also since their tank is their speed they dont need to use up all their lows fitting an effective armor tank  and shield tankers have it easier  3 ods and a nano is usually the best you can do with polycarbs fit the rest just becomes unhelpful that often leaves space for 12 damage mods which dont usually get fit on a fully tanked ship
its whines like these that are killing the game nerf this nerf that minnie is crap cause of  amarr is crap cause of eve is a hard game with a steep learning curve learn to deal with it ecm boats damp em or get close on themneut boats stay out of their neuting rangenanos web emall these stupid whines killed the damp effectivness ruined nanophoons and so onits time you learn to play the game as it is supposed to be played instead of whiningif its too hard go and play wow at least that way the lag in jita will lessen
i support this idea either the nanos should be nerferd or the should be more counters to it sitting in a neutbs is another fakesolution
so say your enemy does a capital hotdrop that means hes just put at risk a lot of assets and manpower whats wrong with them gaining the upper edge with it what prevent you from having your own cap fleet in reserve to do a counter hotdropabove all what twisted logic make you think that if youre not willingable to put as many players and isks on the line you still should be immune to losing a fight against those who dohow do you kill a nano ship im not speaking about driving it away but actually preventing from running it require either a huginnrapier that is nanoed itself and as such just as overpowered than any other nano ship or several people simple logic say nano fits encourage blobing not the contraryexplain this to mean alliance is willing to put all the stops to answer a threat  massive mobilisation  has a strongly fortified position  bubbles cynojammers  is willing to put at risk the expensive toys  cap ships and you dare suggest they shouldnt be able to have an effective defenseno defense is 100 effective you can still penetrate one such like that with interceptors cloakers destroyers and the like use those or use brute strength and get your own bs fleet with capital support instead of wanting what is for all intends and purposes an interceptor with 9k halfhardened shields and 300 to 500 dps
dis
i am against a general nano nerf but if nanos are the only countermeasure vs nanos countermeasures should be looked at imho
the game already offers all countermeasures neut ships with ranges up to 60  70 km if you have the right setup skills and support ships present rapiers with webbing range over 100 km with the right setup skills and support counter nanosand dont tell me neut ranges of 60 km or web ranges over 100km are impossible i do them daily if its impossible than you are 1  fitting your ship wrong 2  not skilled enough yet 3  lacking a significant gang boost 4  missing an important ship in your gangthe game has all it needs to counter nano gangs people are just too much focused on speed raw dps and km whoring instead of thinking about the survival of their gang
and that is exactly why nanosspeed fits need to be in the game varietygank is always greater than tank hence wins but against nanos you need your tank otherwise their pitiful dps will wear you down and your gank setups cant track or reach them you need to compromise your fittings to kill themthat is the real reason these whines even exist to effectively counter speed fitted ships you have to deploy smaller faster drones lighter missiles and smaller fasttracking guns you have now severely hurt your gank ability leaving you less likely to be able to kill a tank ship or outdps a gank shipspeed fits are the 3rd part of the rockpaperscissors game their presense actually rewards tank ships as they cant break them and tanked ships can fit lighter armaments because the stuff doesnt take as much grid they are the bane of gank ships because those ships sacrifice tank and are actually potentially in danger to the nanos weaker dps but the highdamage guns cant track themmissiles cant hurt themat the end of the day you either fit to kill nanos or you fit to kill ganktank chose the wrong one and you are likely dead chose the right one and the enemy is thwarted and if more people fit to counter nanos there would be fewer out there
ships in eve need to slow down current speed stacking is netting ships that are way too fast interceptors have lost their role due to the power of nanocruisers its very much imbalancedccp why did you nerf oversized afterburners dual mwds ect ect it made ships too fast you nerfed all of this stuff in the past because it broke the game mechanics so why are you allowing these setups to ruin your gamenanos are the new wcs but worse since they help you offensively and defensively and keep you in the fight unlike wcs which only allowed people to flee combat nanos let you flee engage fight disengage and avoid damagethe counters to nanos are either impractical or ineffective good nano pilots can avoid them easilyso i support you wrayeth even if the masses wont no one wants to lose their precious nanopwnmobiles i guess wuteva ive trained up to fly nanopwnmobiles myself and i still wouldnt cry if ccp swung the nerf back right into my vagabonds face
i agree nanos ruin the game time for another nerf with rigs boosters gang mods and implants nanos are insanely overpowered add to that the new overload and heat and please stop the madness its not about tactics counters its about the clear and dominate overpower and imbalance speed tanks have over all over tankingif you want a universe of speed then go play need for speed eve is far bigger and the path its going down is a sad sad one
imagine if you could get 99 resistances by stacking enough modules it would make you immune to damage common sense says we should never reduce the window of vulnerability to less than maybe 10 percent and the game elegantly provides for this no combination of plates resistance mods ship bonuses or implants can effectively give you 90 or better resistances and thats a good thingnow the problem with speed is the mods are additive and not factorial in other words there is no 100 percent limitbecause of this speed is out of balance and frankly is an exploit of the mechanicsthe solution is not to nerf anything but to rebalance maybe there should be a recriprocal detriment of some critical factor  sig radius  to compensatethe devs should rebalance  but not a full nerf  the system
the long bio length was the only thing i had left in life  the nerf has left me flaccid and depressed i can no longer fit a small short story in my bio my dog ran away and the icelandic mafia made my girlfriend wear concrete shoes and threw her into a convenient geothermic power plant
yes please do untill you do a great quote form me cant be listed i really cant believe that the bio length can add much iof any strain to the serverif you really ant to combat lag stop forcign peopel to make most contracts in jita
i love itanis
bio length evemail length and perhaps even chat message length all need to be lengthened dramatically like by a factor of 100edit why do i always forget the thumb
they nerfed it for a reason i would be okay for unnerfing it if it didnt cause more lag andor was exploitable but im willing to bet that its no the case
yes as long as it doesnt cause lag problemswindjammer

proposal for escalation to ccpthat the future storyline of eve be impacted by the outcome of factional warfarewe ask that the factional warfare mechanics be tied to the development of future storylines to reflect the victories and defeats won and lost by the players themselves on behalf of their faction militias while rumor has it  and if a csm member could confirm this much appreciated  that ccp initially had no plans for the outcome of factional warfare territory control to impact the writing of the faction storylines we propose that these two elements should in fact be directly relatedregular victory conditions could be set for the militias and upon the achieving of those conditions new storyline elements could be introduced based on the outcome and a new set of victory conditions implementedon a basic level this could be once faction x controls y space victory is won and z result enters the canon then rp organizations could fight for a specific outcome  such as the freeing of minmatar slaves or the crippling of the gallente economy  this would lend additional weight to the daily battles of the faction militias and give a chance for eve players to have real control over where the storyline goesany additional ideas are appreciated
i dont know how ccp plans their storyline and how much they stick to it as time goes by the opening of factional warfare was billed to come some day and finally has arrived it would be nice to see the effects of player efforts in terms of space occupied on the storyline immediate effects of recognition in news stories as the tides of battle change or push forward not just an embedded reporter mentioning a battle here and there but a larger view of the conflict also a response from npcs empire officals and others that are directly tied to the matterat the current time amarr are having a bad time it would be interesting to see minmatar beat their drums and maleatu shakor use it for as a rallying cry it would also be good to see a response from the amarr jamyl sarum surely has something to sayand finally there would be an greater consequence to the whole matter and something to shoot for if a faction ever dominated the whole of another faction or even got close it would deserve some notice and affect things you can see right now the progress of militias through the wonderful work of verite renditions factional warfare influence map i would like to see ginger and company do the work they do best and make it for people who get their hands in factional warfare achieve something they can substantiate everyone dreams of affecting the game i believe that 00 empires are a result of this people dream of putting up outposts and large invisible borders giving the empire crowd a way to affect the game directly would be something special and with its roleplaying nature giving people an outlet to achieve something through factional warfare that everyone can see would be greatfunny how someone against territorialist expansion would want this but it just makes sense
actually theres nothing really wrong with the nighthawks dps  but only if you are able to fit the classic caldari triple bcs but as everyone now the nighthawks pg is so stupidly inadequate that you end up fitting triple rcu instead
anyone else annoyed that the csms are willing to address balance issues with mimnatar cap ships even though they shot down the idea of looking at the nighthawk because they didnt want to get into the realm of ship balance issues yeah cant say im a fan of the whole csm thing thus far
all comands have this problem not needhawk only
minmatar fanboiism unfortunately certain elements of the csm seems to reflect the worst parts of the community  placing caldari in a lolpve rolethat isnt to say that minmatar capitals and large projectiles dont deserve some help  although it must be noted that capitals and bs simply dont mesh well with the defining minmatar characteristics of speed and agility  but in my opinion the nighthawks pg problem is so obvious that denying it is tantamount to sticking your head in the sand and shouting waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhits not even as if any of the naysayers have offered any reasons why the pg shouldnt be boosted unjustified opinions are worthlesssince the precision heavy issue was voted through im going to hold off on a proposal to switch the nighthawks precision bonus to explosion velocity since itll make balance very difficult to judge
i kinda like this would fix assault frigs maybe too
interesting idea i like how you foresaw that criticism too certainly worth discussingi assume that for all those distances you meant meters not kilometers
oops good catchi honestly dont think webber range penalty would be an appropriate downside its full of holes itselfmaybe a script that nerfed the ships maximum velocityhrmm this is kinda hard to explain50 script 12925 webbed speed 1675 max velocity375 script 103 webbed speed 184375 max velocity25 script 76375 webbed speed 20125 max velocityi dunno

noticing a trend in the arguments in features and ideascare bears tend to play the game because theyre interested in the story they read the mission text they follow the storyline lore some have even been known to roleplay the differences between the racespirates tend to play the game because its a psychology experiment ccp has used the backdrop of futuristic spaceships in order to see just how vile and nasty people can be to each other if given half a chance they like to flip rookie miners bait can outside stations and suicide gank anyone who doesnt set themselves up to be shot legally they dont seem to like fighting each other since it might end up resembling a fair fightis this game an mmo with a lot of pvp elements or is this game pvp with a sad and sorry excuse for storyline to give a setting to the bloodbathhow long is ccp going to cater to the pvp crowd and when will the care bears receive some attention tooorca  interbus  skill queues anything mentioned on the old and dust covered in development pageplayers have come and gone when they saw the state of eve not everyone is out for blood but those are the only ones who receive any attention
nicely writen mate 910
nicely put
so what do you want changed exactly you have asked questions for discussion and smacked the pvp comunity but other than that could you expand a little bit more what you are looking for
i was hoping that some of the care bears would crawl out from the woodwork and make some suggestions perhaps in time they willhmm where to start put simply more space stuff every system has the same basic background the never ending and ever distant cloud if eve truly is a space game then lets see some more space stuff heck id be glad to accidently fall into a black hole and wake up in a new clone at least then i could say i did it how about passing comets possibly mineral rich but hard to keep up with so miners can chew away for as long as their abmwd can keep them in range might even give an excuse to make a t2 navitas how about that everpresent cloud actually have a use which more than one idea has been suggested for that as well mining is a big pastime for care bear folks there are tons of requests on features and ideas asking for various boosts and modifications the orca fabled to be a high sec version of the rorqual or at least thats how the stories go because it seems that someone mentioned it once upon a time in passing and since then theres been no mention whatsoever going back to the comets or the storms just something more for industrial types to do besides read a book and occasionally switch target rocks jump clones which seem to be both a means of expediting transport as well as an alternative to losing valuable implants during pvp seem seriously neglected from the stories told it would seem that were being heavily restricted on their use where others are not notice he jumps for breakfast lunch and dinner at least and that fact has not gone unnoticed again plenty of pages worth of requests for some modification either shortening the timer or adding new mechanics to assist players who want to fight but dont want to lose millions to a stray blast skill training is another popular topic which hasnt received any attention on the in development page it mentions two options either setting a single skill to follow the current or having two skills train simultaneously at reduced rates personally i favor the former option if a player should want to start cruiser i and set cruiser ii then he can walk away for an hour or so if a player should start a level v and set another level v then they can take their vacation without trying to find wifi on the beach interbus  an ingame delivery service people constantly complain about jita and the lag that is so fierce that some cant even manifest past the gate because their computers crash beforehand  like me  and yet the same people who complain about the lag are the ones causing it because they insist on buying and selling there now imagine being able to buy something off market and pay a little bit extra on top and in a short time say minutes to hours depending on distance the item shows up in your local hanger sure you could say thats what courier contracts are for but no one is willing to brave jita first off to then continue 20 jumps having paid 200mil collateral and receive 2k upon delivery couriers arent working and its time they either got fixed or just went awaythis is just a few ideas that come to mind im sure there are others floating around in there and im sure there are many many more that other players could suggest as well
for corps that take advantage of the blueprint locking facility we end up with page after page of redundant votes can we please have the facility to remove thesethanks
sounds reasonable to me
signed  sometimes its hard when a corp has billions in resources and dozens of offices to get shares back off one or two people in order to unlock bps or otherwise run the corpid actually also like to see a stock market in eve tbh but thats not covered by this vote
reason 234789 why you should allways as ceo maintain no less than 60 of all company shares
i bought my rkk shares fair and squareyou can purchase them back for a sum as it would be totally wrong to just delete them as people bought them fair and squareyou know your rich enough you can offer a price to those having rkk shares and make everyone happy by playing by the rules and buying back your shares
signedannoying especially when bitter exceos and whatnot hold a majority of the vote preventing the corp from doing their funky groove thing
i support this as well there should be a way to fix problems that were screwed up in the first few days of eve
this
exploitable unless a significant change is made to the process of creating sharesrequiring a 95 vote in favor need only be proceeded by a motion to increase the number of shares 20x the motion to create shares only requires the approval of 50 of votesthe motion to create shares can be repeated until there is a 24 hour window where only a minority of opposition to the creation of shares is able to log on ie 1 minute before a 24 hour downtimesuggesting that shares can be recalled by the arbitrary will of the corp removes any value that the shares might have this proposal runs completely counter to concept of trading sharesperhaps alternative management methods might be structured so that corps can be managed without the need to propose votes for each action ie allowing the corp to vote to give the ceo free  or limited  reign to pass sactionable actions without the need for seperate votesthe ability to revoke shares would be vastly over powered as such i firmly oppose this proposal
there have been proposals earlier to change the way the stocks are working and are being traded for example this onei think if the stock market and the stock handling is undergoing a change anyways this specific feature could also be designed into the new stock mechanics without opening a new exploitable area i think this problem is worth to be considered if the stock market is undergoing a change anyways
please for the love of god yes
every time ive said anything against xaen i am immediately supplied with a thorough wellthoughtout thread describing the issues and how to fix them i do not dare disagree with him now
im in 100 agreement
the pilot with 5 sec would have concord respond faster to save himher from a suicide gank than the 1 sec pilot the security status of the victim is what determines the speed of response not the attackerhowever beyond that i agree generally with your statements that the cops should defend everyone equally within their jurisdictionsomething that may be worthwhile pursuing is tying in the ability to gain a deputy charter from concord if your corporation has an average concord standing  security standing of something like 3 or higher   is an example and would require a further look  this deputy charter would allow the deputized corporation to actively seek pirates in low sec without the loss of security status this might also be limited to a region of empire space for each charter
now thats an idea id like to support put it up dex call it bountyhunter
wow i thought this one was dead and gonemy original idea was to have the standing both the victim and attacker that would normally trigger concord modify the time it takes for concord to show up but always fasterpositive standing on the victim or negative standing on the attacker would decrease the time for concord to show up positive standing on an attacker or negative on the victim would have no effectthe idea being a criminal  lower standing  would already be on concords radar so concord shows up faster same idea in reverse with a positive concord standingwhile concord may be watching the criminal they are not expecting them to get ganked except perhaps by another criminal thus they are going to react at their normal speed
well yes gsc are pretty useful if you fly a navitas i guess its working as intended to protect newbs from theft while not being in corp or have hauler alts however there could be a solution imho for my understanding things that you jetison  litteraly throw overboard in open waters  are not yours anymore they are floating cargo in fact nobody should be flagged for taking stuff out of a jetcaninstead we would just need a non secure giant container with 50000mUFFFD or a secure container which one could actually open using hacking skills
not quite rightfrom marine salvagetechnically as the ship that is doing the jettisoning isnt actually in danger it is questionable whether any of the above really applies but the jetcan should really be called laganligan as that is the closest name for what is actually happening
 emphasis added say are we using the same hulks dont know about yours but mine doesnt have a huge cargo bay unless you think less than 2 cycles is huge
expander ii optimizer i gsc hsc i can fit 22k m3 in my hulk you cant afk since you have to shovel into the cans once in a while but i know it takes about 10min to top off
these are good values but they dont say much about the cargohold of the hulk itself i dont think its good design if an item only has good values after you use every possible method to improve it
i cant possibly support a motion proposed by a character whose name means boys

saw this in a post liked it and decided to post it hereim sure many of us can say that weve all been blown up by another player at least once sometimes that particular player is a little more than a match for a 1 on 1 confrontation and our chances of retribution are slim to none imagine if you could trade the kill rights you have on him to a more pvporiented individual who could exact the revenge for youhaving the opportunity to trade kill rights gives merc corps even more juicy targets as now they can attack gankers in and around highsec also the bounty hunting profession could finally get a firm foundation in this game prices would be set by the individual who has kill rights via contracts or what have you and the person who accepted the contract would have one month to take out the target once the target is destroyed the merc or pirate hunter would receive a bounty  priced by the contract issuer  and that would be itanother idea could be that when the target is destroyed they receive a little eve mail with a message from their original victim so they know it was them who hired a merc to kill emthoughts ideas criticisms
nice thought suggested many times before but this is the wrong forum
doh i shall repost
no offense mate but if everybody will post his ideas here itll render this forum useless this should remain for real issues to be taken to ccp not 100000 suggestions for new stuff
i recently had a friend comment  negatively  about the lack of personalisation of ships in evei would support logos on ships as well as the ship name mapped onto the side in a prominant area if it wasnt too harddecals you could choose depending on ship hull would be nice but hardly crucial  sharks teeth for a rax coloured stripes on wings etc  that could be ignored if requested by the client but could also only be viewed from a certain distance from the model  so you wont get 100 downloads instantly but spread out a little in jita but only if you look at a ship up close it would generate more emotional attachment to your ship if you spent ages on adjusting it to your liking  only to see it reduced to a wreck  but could also be used to generate a little more identity in eve  imagine an alliance squadron all with red stripes on their wings and another with blue for example full colour changes id say no we need hull colours to quickly identify ship types or else youd end up with coppercoloured phobos or redhulled incursus flying around  although scouts should have ship types on their overview already 
heres my ideacorp logos only rendered when you look at the subject or he flies very close to your ship its composed of roughly 64 different images in 3 layers which takes 192 bits or 24 bytes of info to sendalliance logos even easier than abovecustom paint jobs i dont mind if we only get 8 colors to choose from to paint each of our 2 areas of the ship  base and detail colors  this is 2 bytes maybe 3 of information to send since the wireframe and layout areas would be stored in the cache of eveheres the big thing make ship visuals able to be turned off in the escape screen graphics tab if you dont want the personalization dont use it heck you can even make it unclicked by defaultin summary please implement this devs with the new eye candy of trinity theres no reason this shouldnt have been implemented sooner bandwidth is higher and gpucpus process faster and more than they did 5 years ago  using moores law the player id is already sent as normally and sometimes their portrait this number can be exceedingly large  considering ccp never deletes their player database  so i dont see a problem here
and corp ceos should be able to create a few logos in the corp creationedit panel
amar battleship 3 laser grid usage level 
1ive had people refer to the rcu2 as the amarr module for a reason  its rather hard to fit many amarr ships  even pure gank ships without slapping on a few of themby the way 425 iis have a higher base optimal range  and falloff  than tachyon i
yes but you dont have much choice about using them despite their horrendous grid usage because heavymega beams lack optimal to be really viable for a sniper setup in any ship that doesnt have an optimal bonusif mega beams ii had 8km more optimal the issue would be relatively minor as it is most amarr pilot wanting to have a reach equivalent to other sniping bs are focred to choose between losing 2 lows which make them the hardest bs to fit or leaving one or even 2 guns slots empty
great idea awesome fab do it now please would be a great feature to have deployable player craft from carriers perhaps this could finally be the niche for assualt frigates ie the only class of ship deployable from a non mothership carrier would be pretty cool if a carrier could deploy say 5 assault frigates in addition to normal carrier drone  fighter capabilities
tbqh they could just balance capital boost implants with cycle time as well as boost amount it doesnt take much neuting to completely shut down a capital shield tank
is the template format publicly available if not why isnt it it would surely help the csm if people would present their issues using the template from the getgo
no need to mail me regarding alternate positions count me ini was wondering how the submission templates work for issues that just make the 7 day requirement on the day of the meeting can a representative bring up an issue in a meeting without having to submit the template  i assume this right is still available as per csm document  do you have a any other business section for meetings as is usual for formal meetstake carebruce hansen
what right is this you speak of i can only see the csm document speak of the right for elected representatives top 9  not alternatives who arent from what i gather from the discussion in iceland representatives from what i understood its just a matter of the council being able to call in alternatives from the total pool of those who ran so if nobody from the top 4 of nonelected members cant make it we can go down to the list as long as we have contacted them in advance saying they are liable to being called in should it be needed
interesting post let me answer your questions  using the csm document you refer to all representatives have equal right to raise topics during csm meetingsa 5 voter support is however not required for a representative to bring up a topic to the councilnow it seems you agree with me herei can only see the csm document speak of the right for elected representativesi was wondering what your point wastake carebruce hansen
maybe you are discussing another issue being privy to information we have yet to see that alternatives when present for a csm meeting arent considered representatives for issue raising purposesthe csm document is a little unclear therethe recommended guideline for meetings is at least once per week with a minimum of nine representatives presenta meeting is not considered valid unless seven council members in any combination of alternatives and representatives are presentin addition to topics brought up by the representatives themselves issues marked for resolution are considered by the csm for determination on whether or not they should be brought before the ccp council after each csm memberpresents their opinion to support or disprove a motion the matter is brought to vote a majority rule passes the issue for escalation it would seem to imply that representatives and alternates are different but when at a csm meeting are both members  so the last part of the csm document above applies to representatives and alternates equally discussionvoting issues  since we have yet to see the minutes from the meeting in iceland is it your understanding that representatives can bring up issues in a csm meeting  without submitting a template etc  but not alternatesthis would make sensetake carebruce hansen
no its my understanding that alternates does not have the right to submitting an issue i dont see why they should have neither does the document seem to suggest it there are quite a few issues and things that would have to be taken care off should that it be possible to alternates to raise issues first of all being an alternate does not count for a termsecond you will need to submit a submission template like everybody elsethird it will require that you are at the meeting where its being discussed as you would need to chair the issue as per our agreement that the owner of the issue chairs the discussionbut because the alternate position is not an actual membership of the council other than when a alternate is called in for a meetingi personally think that making this difference between representatives and alternates is a can of worms and to some degree a bit respectless towards the alternates but we need to be 7 people at a meeting so we need alternatives
okay so you do agree that only representatives can raise issues at csm meetings but not alternates this is what i was saying the alternate gets full discussionvoting rights at a csm meeting they are present at on issues on the agenda or raised during the meetingor are you saying that only representatives can submit a template etc  which i agree is the case but not what i was aksing am i right in saying that you disagree that issues can be raised during a meeting  by representatives  without being submitted on a template etchow about the any other business section of a meeting is there currently onetake carebruce hansen
dont you and the rest of the csm have somebody you can ask at ccp to determine what the holdup is i meancsm meetings 4 and 5 have been over for a long time now if there was a problem ccp has had a lot of time to communicate with you its also been awhile since you were in iceland though the bulk of that information may slow down the release process just speculation on that last theres not much to work with from our perspectiveregardswindjammer
hi allfirst i must apologize for the lack of communications that can be written on me you see i ran off to vacation  and i dont have an internet connection in the tent im sleeping in  i know crude techtent i should think about upgradingi did barge into a place that does have a connection and have now put things into motion so the minutes should be up later today or early tomorrowthe things discussed in the meetings between the csm and ccp are in the pipelines as discussed that weekend  it was just the minutes that were stranded on our end
just out of interest dont you guys have people that can cover your delegated tasks while youre away on vacation seriously though its good to hear that the meeting minutes will be available to read in the very near future
itt starryeyed eurotrash attempt to champion the supposed merits of an inherently flawed and demonstratably impractical social system
that has got to be the most farcical set of minutes for a meeting that i have ever read20 minutes of discussing eve and 4 hours of bickering futile willywaving turgid and tedious arguments on semantics and a thrilling debate on whether abstaining counts as a yes a no or even a vote at alland it took them 3 meetings to get to that pointi think ccp might need to order a lot of beer for themselves when the iceland meeting happens because if that set of minutes is anything to go by itll take them 3 days to finalise the vote on what colour the name badges will be red  blue  if a name badge is green is it really a name badge at allyou couldnt make it up

id love to see a complete shift for the naglfar to have 3 turrets
im going to have to support pure minmatar spec who never bothered to train cap skills because ours were so poor
wrong in the vast majority of supercap take downs the supercap in question is bumped and surrounded and thus cannot move due to being stucksmartbombs are why citadel torps do very poorly same reason why fighters do so poorly as wellits a complex issue though because there really isnt all that many useful modules to fit on supercaps if smartbombs were to become useless
i support this its stupid that you can shoot a super cap for 10 minz and do less damage than a bs at the same time dreads are meant to do kill caps
smartbombs would still have utility as antiship and antifighter measures but this proposal is limited to their effects on citadel torpedoes im not even suggesting a blanket immunitythough i wouldnt necessarily object to thatjust some sort of chance for betterany survivability
dreads are meant to kill structures i dont remember anything anywhere saying a dread was supposed to take down another capital  just coincidentally its good at it  i posted in a fid forum thread about this missiles do massive damage to everything without any real penalty just the fact that you cant hit a titan is of little consequence bump it do other stuff whatever the day my blastersrails stop doing glancing blows against a pos tower that doesnt move for only 1k damage while my phoenix counterpart does 14k then you can talk about it a boost to something like explosion velocity isnt a bad idea but demanding that the dread with the biggest tank and capfree damage should get an immunity bonus to something basic is silly try staggering your missile volleys or taking out the offending smartbombing ship first
i believe the point is the dread pilot is trying to kill the offending smartbombing shipas for missiles doing massive damage without real penaltytheres a delayed tohit time  which can be very significant for citadels  and if the target is moving above a specific speed they are immune to damage even if hit for light missiles this is very fast for citadelswell if youre moving at all youre going to get mitigated damagethis isnt a discussion on guns vs missiles they both have their drawbacks and strengths at the moment however the citadel missile system is useless against stationaryslow targets who have smartbombs equipped guns cannot be stoppednegated in a similar fashion
in the current 00 sovereignty system perhaps but ccp will be implementing more and more features that are only accessible to smaller ships from here on out i think that a smaller logistics role is something desirable to be honestt2 logistics bcan interesting idea but my problem with it is that heavily tanked logistics bcs would either be instantly primaried in any large engagement and too powerful in smaller roaming gangs especially if you used 2 working together start up a topic on it and we can discuss the various pros and cons on it

issue passed the csm vote 63 so its going on the next agenda with ccp where well be asking for this to be implemented with the all corps in alliance joining fw militia need to be on the same side optionthis is a vital issue for rp alliances in particular  and its also a very important principle to me personally that players should not be excluded from new game content because of previously encouraged organizational development choices  alliance establishment arguing that players should abandon longterm established player alliances with history and friendships and long camaraderie to take part in new game content is something i consider is simply wrong
fw was released by ccp as a way for people who werent familiar with pvp to gain experience with pvp without having to enter pvp full bore they described fw as a sort of introductory pvpit is impossible to see how fw can fulfill this promise and vision if large alliances are pounding around in fw with all their amassed pvp experience numbers and already established lines of communication they will simply absorb fw and dominate itthe attempt by ccp to use fw to get people out of high sec and into the pvp arena will fail and at best it will become nothing but a recruitment gimick for the large alliances want to enjoy fw join the big alliance or die fastkeeping large alliances out of fw is not an attempt to deny game content to those in large alliances it is an attempt to familiarize people with pvp so that they transition to low sec and 00 and join in the fun that large alliances already enjoy as such alliances should welcome the current situation as it is designed to alleviate one of the most persistent complaints from dwellers of 00 ie not enough people in 00windjammer
proposal csm ask ccp when these two drone bugs are scheduled to be fixed and ask if they can be fixed sooner rather than latercurrently drones have two big bugs both bugs reduce firepower from drones and they can even occur simultaneously which really makes things interesting i and others have filed petitions and been told to file bug reports weve filed bug reports and been told the bugs have been attached to a defect tracking were given no information on what that effectively means or when the bugs are likely to be fixed these bugs have been out at least since the release of trinity and perhaps before though my personal belief is that one of them was a result of trinitybug one drones switching targets independent of instruction andor against instruction this happens randomly and can involve all drones at once or just some of the drones this is especially bothersome when using sentries as you cant always tell immediately if only some of the drones have switched target if you dont have the target theyve switched to target lockedbug two drones clumping together free flying drones have a tendency to pair up and fly together frequently this results in one pair that are flying so close together  clumped  they interfere with each others flight similar to a couple of ships bumping each other while trying to get into warp the clumped pair of drones lag far behind the other three drones when moving to a target or when returning to the ship which launched them in addition to reducing firepower this sometimes causes the loss of one or both of the clumped pair if the drones have come under enemy firethese two problems affect all drone users and particularly the drone boats im sure drone users would consider fixing the two bugs to be a great improvement to evebest regardswindjammer
anything that make drones work as intended is good

sorry but i have to disagree i believe alliance shouldnt be allowed to join fw and here are my reasons1 alliances will dominate fw if they were allowed they have more isk and more experience than any of the fw participants some of you will say that this way ccp is alienating a large number of eve players i say ccp would alienate even more players by allowing alliances to join just look at how many players are in the caldari militia they are more than any existing alliance do you want to lose them 2for those of you who fear alliances would ruin fw i dont believe this will happen so far most alliances have acted responsibly and avoided getting involved in factional warfare to the extent of ruining it  although showing support for the militias by providing ships and modules and pvp experience is something that is very welcomed  besides i doubt ccp would let alliances ruin their product3dont most alliance members have alts already in militias so whats the problem 4as for rp alliances i can only say i understand your suffering and i sympathize with you but the only thing i can say is this is eve adapt or die 5i havent been in an 00 alliances but i have tried once taking down a pos and i have to agree if that is how 00 warfare is it must be really boring but that is no reason for alliances to join fw eve is a big game and its all about choices and the way i see it alliance have to make a choice you either stay in 00 space because that is what you like and demand ccp fix it as it is your right or leave 00 break the alliance and join fwanyway that is just my personal opinion on the subject and why i choose not to support this notion
no alliances should be kept out of factional warfare
well csm voted 63 for the alliance corps in faction warfare militias fix to be implemented with as much urgency as we can manage i personally feel its very important and its fortunate for the rp community we got 3 rp friendly csms in the mix  
does that mean the request to allow alliances into fw is to presented to ccp or that it already has been remember we still dont have the csm meeting minutes from csm meetings 4 and 5if its already been presented to ccp what was their responsewindjammer
i wholeheartedly agree with ccps already existing policy on the issue i mean honestly alliances are there own faction in themselves are you spending your time supporting your alliances goals and defending its space or out fighting faction warfare and leaving the homefront undefended  i really dont see these 2 goals coexisting if even 50 of an alliance military force is off playing faction warfare when an invasion begins how will that leave the state of the alliance i could see this used to overthrow some powerblocs with the right intel question shjouldnt be can alliance members join fw many have moved whole corps out of major alliances already to pursue fw but rather should our alliance join fw would you open your alliance to invasion all in all i think the devs took care of the issue for us honestly
in iceland we asked what the problem was with alliances and fw and got told the technical details  ie that it was entirely possible for alliance corps to remain in their alliances and still join militias ccp told us they were still deciding whether or not it was good idea to allow this function hence now well be resubmitting the issue and saying yes we think its a good idea please do it
soooyou guys discussed issues with ccp in iceland that were not on the agenda prior to going to icelandwindjammer
in my opinion this is a perfect opportunity to elevate the service to to the level it should be at they got voip support in made it free now make it functional for serious use in this case though your 90 argument sure stands   its almost there just needs to be dragged across the finish line
eve voice works good for me since it runs on a separate network server lag doesnt affect it so even in the middle of a fight the commands are easy to heareverybody underestimated how useful it would be except ccp and a few other people if they would have listened to their player base we would not have it today
i am a big fan of eve voice it has really made voice comms for fw much easier than ventts ever wascould be imho however the lack of an external client or more specifically the inablity to use it from the character login screen makes it very hard to plan a proper logon traperrrrfly safe
am intending to bring this one up next week
something else that needs to be address and in the case that i missed the topic somewhere else miltia members should not be allowed to wardeck other militia members of the same militia it should be some sort of crime against the factionmilitia it causes way to many problemsnow memebers not of the militia wanting to wardec memebers of the militia is another story on to its self and if that happens they should become enemies of that faction and militiaand sorry if this is posted in the wrong forums area
i disagree with that one too exploitable a militia is not an alliance and doesnt function the same way where wardecs are concerned i can definitely see reasons why 2 corporations within the same militia might want to wardec each other
amen its the best thing i have heard in a wile
well constructed arguments
agreed

agreed
can i get an amen

there are more issueszerging is a massive issue quite frankly and needs to have its own discussion right therein general this is agreement though

tbh most of the carrier changes where fine it was too easy to haul stuff from one side to the galaxie to anothera jf isnt so big but with the support of carriers or ms a jf can be a good addition for your logistics department also its easy to anchor some small tower en route to your destination when you are do it on a regular basethe biggest problem in 0 isnt the game mechanics its the player base with 10 thousands of ppl having nappend each other there cant be any movment in the big picture of 0 space pos warfare would be fine when ppl wouldnt have decided that they want to minimize risk by napping as much ppl as possibleso basicly what ppl need to realize is that there isnt any mmo where you can have a 500 vs 500 in real time when you dont wanna play some text adventuremost problems you mention have an easy solution at hand so basicly what you are doin here is doin some carebear whinage about topics that have been beaten to death already
you smell of inexperience id like you to link me to well together put threads discussing some of these issues evesearch didnt turn up anything recent youve obviously never had to endure logistics nor has spent 45bil on a ship that has no way of protecting itself through dangerous 00 space you cant setup towers in enemy space and yet more often than not you need to go through it in far away systemsthis leave the use of cyno alts only and unlike the super cool covert cynos youll either have to be very lucky or do your runs at ridiculous hours to rish your jf not getting caught once you jump you need at least a good 57 minutes for cap to recharge before jumping out again youll get probed or need to war out every 14 sec give me an easy solution to the above problem and other issues mentioned rather than call me a carebear whiner or be forever silent and do us all a favor
i have to admit i agree with 100 of the ideas posted here you win a cookie
when i got into mining haladas mining guide quickly became dogeared and worn when i got into hulks i followed his fittings and mined in null space the hulk tanking  still have my gisti a small booster sitting in a hanger somewhere  and 2nd acct hauling just as i started looking at carriers to haul my mins to market along came the nerf this was about the time or there after that nos got nerfed and torps range got nerfed i kinda gave up on planning anything long range because now i dont really trust ccp to not make far reaching changes that will trash what ever i am working towardshaving said all this i have to whole heartedly aggree with halada without the industrialist the pvpers and sovereign holding alliances are screwed if you think not next time you are in 00 space and open the market screen and imagine if nothing was there or when you cherry pick the rat loot and go to sell it imagine those nice 100mwd that sell for 500k being worth zero then imagine having to haul all your ships and mods in yourself starting to get the picturewhile ccp seems to value the pvper overmuch understand that allowing the haulingindustrialist access to improved gear makes pvping for the pvper that much easier so unnerf the carriers hauling abilitydrone regions need some attention as halada points out i can understand ccps initial idea of getting great mins from drone drops which was to get peeps out to the drone regions too bad they did not use this reward idea with lvl 5 missionsjump freighters was a good idea but not at the expense of nerfing carriers the 45 billion price tag effectively keeps it out of the reach of most pilots and downgrading carriers to promote it just seems wrong somehow so far i did not see dreadnoughts take a giant nerf when titans came out so why should carriers be munched on because jump freighters became available
good well thought out post
splendid post i agree
maybe if you had a support gang rather than just a cyno alt in system you wouldnt feel so nekkid pretty sure it was intended to be a team activity rather than a dualboxed onethe rest of what you said is fine
sometimes you cant even get 5 people to help with the haul op so youre forced to do it solousually its because everyone else is too busy taking down poses with their dreads and probably talking on ts to pass the time
then your jump freighter deserves to get plastered across an asteroid belt im not sure how your corp or alliance being willing to lol away a couple billion in assets is a counter argumentdont get me wrong they need some love on the design end but if youre alone in a system with just your cyno alt youre doing it wrong from top to bottom
well was raised to the csm discussion but failed to get enough votes to be escalated discussion can be seen from the chat herewell i tried  
this is an excellent idea given they are in the game already flying those ships
agreed boosting the usage of the other two rare moon minerals would go a long way to balancing out materials
excellent presented
a difficulty overall value of loot will decrease over time by eliminating unnamed t1 loot  which is frequently melted down by mission runners rather than sold whole  and substituting a roughly equivalent value of named t1 loot you will slowly drive down the value of named t1 loot as it becomes more common that has upsides too of course  making named t1 mods more widely available and bringing their prices down  but it will over time decrease the overall rewards of missioningthat said i still think this is a good idea
although fun is relative and varies from individual to individual i personally like these ideas and would love to see them implemented
there are additional strategies that can be used to defeat npcs  energy neutralizers for example in addition i think that it would be a good thing for a few missions to be very difficult to solo as it would encourage a bit more cooperation  now that the lofty scam is no more reread my proposal  named t1 loot would make up for the lack of unnamed t1 loot so this is a nonissuei disagree requiring another modules is almost exactly what pveers need it brings missions a little bit closer to pvp and also makes missions a bit less of a snoozefest as well in addition you dont actually need the module either it just hurts your bottom line not to have it deciding to sacrifice that slot for extra profit or leave it for extra trackingdamagetanking ability should be a decision mission runners have to make because right now their only real decisions are which hardeners to fit based on the npcs theyre encounteringobviously  my proposal suggests that there would have to be some form of limit to keep missions from having 80 frigates or 10 battleshipsinteresting suggestion though a bit outside the scope of my ideas perhaps you should propose something to that effect
very nice  
as ive posted a couple of times about varying mission content i am taking the next step and actually working on some mission outlines with a variety of different tasks and win conditions than currently exist unfortunately work is currently being a female dog so its not as fast as it could be have tomorrow night to kill in a hotel room with no internet  no company though that might help  
a comment to your pro and consmore viable t1 market  less competition from missions i dont see why someone would buy t1 items when there are better named items in market ad a practically equivalent price i dubt t1 market will get better the only exception are the items that dont normally drop from rats and already sellfewer nonmining sources of mineralsgrantedfaster mission looting timesnot really you salvage while looting more empty wrecks dont change the time spent salvagingincreased mission profitsnot unless the quantity of named items is increased but then the named item prices will drop and the t1 market will still suffer even more from named item competitionpotentially laborintensive to implement  ie lots of time making changes to each mission most rats share loot tables i think so it will not require to change all the missions only the lot tablesnote that the current lot mix is more like 7590 crap t1 249 crap named items 1 high end named equipment i routinely buy crap named items for refining and they sell for less than mineral content
but it will not change unless a lot of other things are changed how often you use a t1 set upgetting the items at a higher price form manufacturers will not make t1 gear more used
1 fewer npcs better npcssupportedno more unnamed t1 lootneed a lot of work to be implemented it will have very far ranging secondary effectsmission leaders that retreat unless scrambledtentative support maybe only for level 3 or more missionsmore dynamic npc spawnssupported
i fully support removing agent quality and making the level of reward a function of social skills and your standing towards that agent
was successfully voted through the csm so its going to be on the next formal agenda for discussions with ccp  and tbh id love to have a second run at that nighthawk vote if somebody can find a way to address the issue again 
totally supportedshow some pvp love for the caldari ccp
we did
talk about your tight votes 
agrees and there should be a confirmationdialog with name that will be petioned
no support for t2 ship insurancet2 ships are elite ships and thus expencive to lose them fly t1 if you want to lose lessedit i acctually feel that insurance should be removed from the gameit instantly removes the huge suicide problem carebears have you can t fix t2 ship insurance anyways as those ships are mostly sold for alot more than their build costso lets see i build a vaga for 25mil sell it for a 100 so in other words you should be able to insure it for 100mil or so what would happen if that was possible id build a vaga for 25mil sell it to my alt for 10 bil isk as insurance is taken from build cost i pay like 10 mil for 10 bil coverage i go and get killed in that ship netting me just under 10 bil proffitid say remove insurance at all from t2 ships  the one you get atm is pointless anyways p

nerf nanos or boost webber ranges or imporove turret tracking and explosion velocity of heavy missiles i dont care as long as this nano craze is tuned down a bitor make each race have a specialized ship for catching nanosas far as i can see nanos might be the only solution to avoid capital hot drops and bubbles in 00 but eve is not 00 only and in low sec and empire nanos are ruining the game we are not talking about a nano ship versus a blob we are talking about a nano ship versus another ship or a group of nano ships versus a similar group of non nano ships and whats worse is even if the non nano ships have the means to do damage the nano ships can simply run awayi support this notion
sorry but not supporting this
have to agree on the tracking thing for turrets on the other hand what boost you need for your webs when a rapier can web between 50km and 245km
do you people actually know anything about game mechanicslook up the explosion velocity on cruise and heavy missile sometimeseven a precision cruise fired from a golem  which has an explosion velocity bonus  and explosion velocity rigs will not do any significent damage to nano ships work out the explosion velocity on itprecision heavy missiles are actually worse than precision cruisethe only thing that even has a chance is precision light missiles and thats not much of a chance
new midslot modulemissile mwd launcher creates a mwd field around launchers giving a massive boost to their speed at launch available in small medium and large sizes affects capacitor the same as a mwd with the same cpu and grid requirementsalternatively  or additionally  change nanofibers and overdrives to be shipsize specific with smaller ships gaining a larger bonus to speed or weight reductionkeep the sandbox keep the flexibility
sorry i dont fly minmatar ships and tbh i dont think i am interested to fly them for a while does this mean i am screwed in eve
cyno jammers game play its not about immunity its about options and forcing people to autodie to superior numbers 100 of the time is simply not good play and will do nothing for the future health and success of eve online many people have told you how to kill nano ships in this and other threads but since you are arguing from the fixed territorial debate actually killing these ships is irrelevant to you they cant threaten your infrastructure why are you worried and if its just that you want more kill mails to be harvested by your overwhelming defense trap then im not going to be sympathetic skirmish warfare is important for eve and the game begins to die when larger forces automatically kill smaller forces they have a near 100 effective defense on their fixed assets that isnt the same as automatically killing everything any other player might bring on a roving patrol if the opposition ops to skirmish its going to do well against an enemy in a fixed defensive line thats warfare and its good that eve represents this no capital support only the defender has that  remember those cyno jammer things right
sometimes i wonder how you got in that chair first of all superior numbers is just that superior second obtaining numbers is an outofgame task in other words theres no mod or bonus that will increase player numbers and why do numbers play a role to kill shieldarmor tanks more efficiently yet speed tanks are far superior against numbersyou have a mindset about the little nano guy who wants to solo own a dozen ships and be immune to dying sorry but i think you are a hypocrite you want something for one side but yet are opposed to the changes to your side you say its out tactics that need adapting when there should be a nerf to your tactics because you shouldnt be flying around freely among a dozen hostile ships period if you want to solo roam then go against solo ships adapt your play style why should we all adapt oursthe future of eve is not speed and immunities to nanoweenies once you see that youll realize the direction this game should not be heading if we all have to fly nanos or nano counters then that is a far more unhealthy environment than the latter no they game is dying when larger forces cant kill a single immune nano ship if you claim they dont threaten any infrastructure then once again you are naive nanos threaten a lot for the sole fact they can pick and choose targets at will the problem with that is when you do bring a force they cant be caught thus its a problem they have far too much freedom of gameplay while 95 of all other ships have to deal with the same circumstances once again jade you solve nothing but manage to spin words and scenarios that are far fetched and lack luster at best why are nanos ships the most used pvp ship in all of eve is it because the rest of eve is too stupid to counter them or is it because they are simply overpowered if you value your seat i hope to god you dont call the rest of eve stupid you know damn well the only ones for nanos are the bulks of nanoweenies already flying them i guess the rest of eve just isnt skilled or smart enough to kill them oh great one
by actually having an opinion based on fact experience and general nonfailure unlike you so that should mean that in a game it should simply come down to the fact you can call your friends join a super large block of players to feel safe from your own failures nano is fine people who fail are not fine plenty of tactics you must use your brain and not expect to be able to undock 400 of your closest friends just because 10 or so nanos come to your home system blow up your isk making ravens pee on your door step and take off because you have brought 150 drakes 50 caracals 50 blackbirds 2 rapiers and a ton of t1 frigates
and you are basing that off facts rofl you have more to learn if you think nanos are balanced in line with other tanks theres a reason why the majority fly nanos cuz they are overpowered and easily used to engage andor run at will no other ship has that tactic along with the best tank in the game i suggest you reexamine yourself before another unrealistic post your idea of eve is flawed greatly its kinda like you dont even play
people fly nanos because they are prepared to invest their skillpoints isk fittings and general play skill against superior numbers of inferior opponents with cookiecutter setups is the harsh truth of it if you are comparing nanoships with nonnanoships as two different grades of tank you are completely missing the point a nanoship is akin to a historical horsearcher very well trained very well equipped the horsearcher is a supreme skirmish combatant that is literally unkillable by inexperienced levies standing in a shield line or holding makeshift pipes and desperately wanting to return to their village before the harvest is in is this balanced well sure since a nanoship costs more than a tech2 fitted battleship at the entry level and dies like any other target if its held into the press and slaughtered but thats not the kind of balance you mean is it what youd like is for the autoblob to always win by pure weight of numbers and whoever has the biggest talentless levy gets to hold the field real warfare isnt like that historically in the present day or at any time in history outside of the appalling fiascos of ww1 france and see while a guy like you is whinging on the forums about how unfair it is that nanos get to play a skirmish role on the eve battlefield ive been there done it got the teashirt played nanos played against nanos ive developed particular strategies to use and oppose these things and played a part in some excellent battles involving nanoelements on our and the opposition side case in point couple of months ago we  sf  deployed alongside cry havoc in a pos takedown  capital ship bait operation the plan was that wed bait the enemy with a few remote repping carriers have our element  sf provided a large number of rr battleships for anti cap work  engage the cap fleet the bad guys brought  then cry havoc would drop the hammer with interdictors and dreadnaughts  all this danger close at an enemy deathstar pos  so the plan rolled out and it started fantastically  we got the bait down right and the enemy dropped their capital fleet into our midst and we got busy killing killboards show i think we downed 89 caps and completed routed the enemy then pandemic legion turned up as a third force with a nanogang and came in attacking both sides and skirmishing like absolute pros for the next 60 minutes we had a fascinating game of cat and mouse as the war ideologies clashed pandemic were obviously completely outgunned we had around 30 rr battleships with around 15 cap ships but we were still taking losses every time somebody broke ranks warped to the wrong point drifted out of rr range they died we shot down some pandemic ships sure but the battle continued and it was the classic confrontation of a heavy shield line vs elite irregular skirmishers and i tell you what some people on our side still cursed damn nanos but the commanders just watched a team of professional horsearchers deploying bait and lure traps with interdictor bubbles using their own discipline to punish all lapses on ours and it was a masterclass in the form seeing it from the other end for a change and i feel privileged to play the same game as some of those skilled pilots and battlefield tacticians we facedresult we won of course meaning we held the field and accomplished our objectives but they won in terms of casualties and kills inflicted and pure fun had by all
you ask how i won this chair pithecanthropusim guessing its because ive got experience and love for this game in spades and know more sides of eve conflict that you are capable of understanding with your penchant for complaint at every least upset and your patent inability to understand that variety is the spice of life and eve and that not everybody plays this glorious political space battle simulator to stand in neat rows at the stargates with the other drones some of us are born to shine and stand out from the crowd and we like our 200m isk hacs that let us fight 10 to 1 odds and play on skill and talent and inspired leadership rather than simply watching the lag bombs and mindlessly clicking f1f8 while talking smack on the forumsyou are very free to roleplay a barely trained militiaman holding a pike and wetting himself at the sound of our hooves pithecanthropus me ill take the horsearcher role every day and enjoy shooting you in the throat from the gallop while your comrades look on with terror and disbelief and break and run like the dogs they are
horse archers had their day ruined by rain doesnt seem to rain here muchin closing youre a tremendous idiot
congrats on your page os wishywashy text but this is all i read and im still laughing at it like you oh great one know exactly why people fly nanos claiming the harsh truth when in reality nanos are the cookie cutter standard of pvp i recommend you hit the reset button on your eve game and try againand it is valid to compare speedtank armor tank and shield tank as they all exist for one purpose absorb damage oh oops wait speedtanks do more i forget that a lot
in context i guess rain  lag since both can kill archers and yet i can debate on the internet without puerile namecalling funny that
wow long sentence full of colorful yet meaningless words not to mention flat out assumptions a selfish ego trip and lack of eve knowledge  1  ive played this game longer than you  2  that 20030601 doesnt make you worthy of anything if you have a selfish agenda and cant accept the greater good for eve if it doesnt follow your personal path  3  your use of words is a travesty to come from the mouth of someone in your positionso the rest of eve is just dull in your little world sad day to hear that from a csmthats exactly why nanos are overpowered you can fight 10 to 1 and still have near zero risk the best tank the best evade option the premier interceptor  in a cruiser  and ride off waiting for others to copy your overpowered tactic and turn this game into the most unhealthy form of muppets and their cookie cutter nano ships thereby eliminating 95 of other ships to be effective in your world of speed yes thats the eve i want great thanks for calling anyone else without a nano pretty much a dweeb you should really chose your words more wisely you only dig yourself a grave for your selfish needsgreat a totally irrelevant metaphor once again proving you have one agenda and that is to not lose your sweet sweet sound of uber overpowered nano freedombtw a nerf to nanos wouldnt kill the nano maybe you shouldnt force your nano eve on everyone and consider how the new nano could adapt but why should you adapt youre the almighty great one

yeah longer bio length would be nicemaybe they could keep the current bio length and then have a button if you want to read the full bio so the current was like a teaser or preview to the full bio
not supporting this becasue bio has a lesser role in game i see no point having a few thousand people fill their bios to maximum and adding a little bit more work for the servers internets
supporting this the bio definitely needs restoring to its former glory at least
it would be nice but unfortunately ccp have consistently shown that they can talk the talk but cant walk the walk in this regard
very important issue this and well rodj lets keep our figures crossed we can get this through the csm and presented to ccp next time around they have asked us for vision issues and this is definitely in the category why put up with a single static plotline when we can tell ccp to hire some more storyline people to cover the bases on multiple outcomes based on dynamic player conflict im for this 100
im sorry but im with rodj on this one as well not having much hope myself
just like to point out one more time here that not only did this issue have advocates on the csm its had some passionate ones who got outvoted last time try it again and now the time crunch for discussions prior to iceland is sorted well give it a proper go and as much attention as we need im still very much convinced this is a serious problem no way on earth the tech2 version of the ferox should have less grid than the tech1 version its crazy
jade i dont have a problem with how youve addressed this and other issues my generalized csm comments were not directed at you in fact my thanks goes out to you for being an advocate for the nighthawkthree major excuses were given by other csms as to why this measure wasnt passed 1 not enough support however other measues have passed with less support so thats a lie2 csm shouldnt micromanage small balance issues this is a copout they are addressing other small balance issues so why not this one3 other races have crappy ships so the nighthawk shouldnt be fixed this was truly one of the most ignorant and idiotic comments ive read in a long whileyouve asked that this issue be readdressed somehow wtf does that mean in this thread there is nearly indisputable proof and evidence of a glaring problem and you want someone to start a whole new thread on the issuemy frustration and anger isnt directed at you other than you want to can this thread and simply start a new one instead of taking this thread to the csm again if someone wants to start a new thread and cut and paste the numbers from here then thats fine by me however im not going to be involved in a plan to dress up a wolf as a sheep so that we can spoonfeed a bunch of idiots some basic math in hopes of getting them to realize that 224the evidence is here no one has yet presented proof to dispute it if you want the issue addressed then use the evidence presented here

in reply to this i think the answer is quite simpleto make all of the fc ships inline with eachother the sleip should loose some pg to balance it with the requirement of an rcu that all other ships must use while the nh should have a pg increase to only require 1 rcu and maybe a pdu to fit hams so each fc ship can use their close range variants with similar setupsedit also take notice that the sleip is the only ship able to fit 3 weapon mods it should have a rcu required to keep it in line with the others however as for the battle for the nh if you got enough pg to fit hams what would you put in the low slows more bcus no each ship should be able to fit approximately 2 weapon mods what else would you put in there so they dont make its dps superior to others
dont overlook the crane all we need is a touch more grid and we will be happy
i vote yes
ill entertain your troll for a moment you seem to agree that caldari have terrible haulers and by your sarcastic remark you also seem to think the best course of action is just not to train for them forget feedback to ccp just dont train caldari industrial correct if your attempt was to belittle this thread youve done a horrible job in fact youve done quite the opposite just saying
agreedeither a better corp interface or a better evemail interface would be great until that happens please stop the mailbox spam
definitely like to see this one come up again  especially after i got through reading the tonyg novel last night
if you create 2 scripts then you just recreate the problem listed honestly i see the advantage of a 6001000 ms assault frig becoming worth while if this change came through it also removes the 100 effectiveness of webbers and the overwhelming desire to choose mwd over ab
dont know about the implementation and general opinion of the opbut i feel the ab needs a bit more love as one above me said af  ab would be cool maybe simply add an ab bonus for afs like thorax has for mwd cap
this is totally unacceptable and should be fixed somehowthe introduction of carriers brought new ways to move ships around in 00 they play a key role in rapid deployment and fleet logistics two or three patches ago ccp introduced a new limitation which made it impossible to put ships into the carriers ship bay if it the ship contained items other than ammo this change was intended to reduce the cargo hauling capabilities of the carriers and worked pretty well unfortunately it had a side effect the exotic dancer which is almost as important in your cargo than the towel on your shoulder can not be kept inside the ships that are being hauled by carriers they could be hauled separately of course like in the cargo bay of the carriers however in the heat of the battle when taking out fully kitted ships from the carriers ship bay one easily forgets to put the exotic dancer into the combat ships cargo bay i think i do not have to explain what serious consequences such a mistakes have everyone knows how important exotic dancers are when it comes to achieving significant military goals my corp alone has lost countless ships because of this human error triggered by this newly introduced limitation we are talking about tenthousands of crew lost because of this and about mega possibly gigatons of unsalvaged scrapmetal floating around in space causing significant environmental pollution so i would like ccp to make it possible to load ships into the cargo bay which contain exotic dancers i leave it up to ccp how they implement it i think the elegant way is to explicitely allow exotic dancers to be in the cargo bay when storing ships the quick and dirty way would be reclassifying exotic dancers to be in the ammo category

you are soooooo serious as we are
you have your exotic dancers doing the filing
that and everything else exotic dancers are the ultimate accessory for every combat pilot i heard that 42 was also a synonym for exotic dancer but honestly having an exotic dancer in cargo was a requirement for every pilot in the corp before this carrier change happened and it brought us a lot of luck i would like to be able to have such luckbringing items in my cargo a lot of people were using things like dancers some were flying with tobacco in cargo some with a copy of pax amarria or pillaging 101 i think little things like these bring color into the game and should be allowed again i could imagine a solution where carriers accept ships with trade goods in cargo if there is no more than one single piece of each trade good type in the cargo come on rp alliances back me up  
the capsule is in essence an escape pod as such it should be subject to the dynamics of a frictionless enviroment and a massive force exerting explosionto make this simpler a pod should travel at several thousand ms slowing down gradually at the ejection of said pod during the destruction of a ship this of course would be influenced by the mass of the ship that is explodingthis would have the effect of propelling the pod several thousand kms from the site of the explosionnow for a detailed explanation from a customers povthe number of elite players on bothall sides of conflicts are very high as such inplants are needed to bring the much needed edge to a pilot in battle however with the advent of warp disruption bubbles and hics etc pod are not likely to survive many engagements this renders most clones with implants impotent many people have invested billion in implants and are not able to use them for anything other then npcing the suggestion that a pod would be hurled far away from the combat site may be the impotus that pilots need to return to using implants in battlefood for thought
supporting thispodkillin should be a ceptor job and not that of bubbleshicssmartbombs
agreed
taking a look at any of the above mentioned ideas would be welcomed the industrial side of the game has taken a backseat to the flashy pvp stuff for too long i realize that combat is part of the game but so is manufacturing you have an economist on staff because its an important facet of the game right
good postim also saddened that people playing the industrial side of the game  mining manufacturing research and market  are looked at as second rank people and laughed at when they propose new ideas on how to improve the game experience for theese peoplei have a few proposals for change myself mostly about can flipping which i see as griefing since most miners doesnt have the skills to fight back the flipper but so far it seems that eve endorse griefing other peopleive learned to adapt but i still find alot of aspects about mining for brokenfor example when i lived in stain it gave better mins to just rat in the belts and reprocess than actually mineanother example is the giant secure container its not giant at all because it holds only one cycle of ore so its more or less useless for miningi could go on but i wonti hope posts like this keeps reminding the devsgmscsms that there are other players than the pvpers in the universe of eveas a last note i would also endores more support for the rp community in eve its in my humble opinion what gives this game its soul
regarding missions please see this threadand also my own thread on missions
pvp could get some possibilities concerning player provided security as itUFFFDs discussed in the transferable killrights issue concord does not really well in providing security i guess there are lots of players who would like to do this job but they are hindered by the game mechanics getting honour in a thousand ways is a high motivator for playing and this way should be accessibleon the interbus thing this would be an unbeatable competition for haulers please donUFFFDt hauling is profitable if you get a little into this business you can even make more than a little 2kk if you just buy stuff which is only sold in the trade hubs of a region and spread them on a place further out for a suitable price or other way round with different stuffthe idea with the metroits is fantastic space could have morespace in general getting away from the just points thing nanos are a good step in that directionasteroid belts could be enriched with these serpent shaped roids you also get in missions but lots more so that you maybe have to navigate through them to get to the best roids of the beltand please couldnUFFFDt we get away from this carebearpvp dychotomie itUFFFDs just game mechanics which for example would disappear if all was nullsec except the starter systems i donUFFFDt think itUFFFDs really the people theyUFFFDre just posers collectors selfsufficient boasting looking for the hug of combat like people are
im a proud carebear of the most fuzzy description but im afraid that i disagree with the premise of your post neither carebears nor pirates can be characterized in such blackandwhite terms and there is plenty of gray space connecting themim all for stiffer penalties for suicide ganking and im all for more attention to the carebear community but i think the csm has demonstrated that were not underrepresented im confident that a majority csm delegates and a majority of voters are carebears themselves or are sympathetically receptive to issues affecting carebears certainly pvpers rely on carebears more than they care to admit but lets not forget that carebears rely on pvpers as a market for their goods just as muchpvp issues are very important to the game and improving the pvp experience helps carebears  more destroyed ships and equipment mean greater demand for new ships and equipment from industrialists and better support allowing pvpers to fight each other  such as factional warfare and a revised 00 sovereignty system  means fewer pvpers becoming pirates for lack of obvious targets
except a great deal of those destroyed ships are the care bears because pirates get bored and start bait canning in front of stations or can flipping in asteroid belts so your stimulated economy is actually care bears trying to rebuild from the havoc wrought by piratesfactional warfare seemed to take a bit of stress off for a little while pirates were entertained by killing anyone foolish enough to enlist and undock however like a child with a new toy the fascination is beginning to wear off pirates are still chasing a cheap thrill by terrorizing care bears and writing in about how it should be made easier for them to find a soft targetmost recent topic ive seen on fi is forcing players out of npc corps discussion points include limiting the types or sizes of ships a rookie corp member can operate and regardless of skill training or vessel ownership a pilot must have a living breathing ceo before they can activate and undockso the distinction is very real care bears are those poor hobbits just looking to enjoy a game they pay monthly for they like to run missions they like to mine  and evidently watch movies or surf the net  and they contemplate joining fw or heading for lownull secthen they remember that pirates are gruff angry folks who insist eve isnt fair so go back to wow they cheer when a ship explodes they are giddy when they receive a killmail and they demand nerf this and boost that so long as the endstate is more carnage and destruction
while pvp may lead to the need for more ships the profits are thin at best for the t2 ships and modules it is very hard to compete  invention vs t2 bpo building t2 parts  moon minerals  vs buying the parts punishment for evildoing  suicide ganks  is almost nonexistent other grief play  not to be confused with play that is against the rules  is praised  again unpunished  where the victim is hounded and picked on i dont want a handout i want to be able to compete i am a carebear i do not care to trade shots with someone that is not my area of expertise i want to be able to compete with them in my profession nothing more
no theyre not battleclinic keeps an evewide killboard i glanced through the 30 most recent kills only 17 were in hisec only 13 were carebear ships  mining barges mining frigscruisers rookie frigs or industrials  the substantial majority of ships destroyed were serious warships fighting in loseclook at the sales volumes on the market i dont have an eve client on my computer here at work but if i were a betting man id bet you anything that the total number of noncarebear ships sold vastly outnumbers the total of carebear ships sold in the same time periodyoure making a lot of sweeping generalizations based on your own experience but theres a much bigger picture here i am a carebear but there isnt an obvious line separating carebears from pvpers many carebears use the wealth they amass as industrialists to fund wellheeled pvp or pve alts many carebears rely on pvpers in their corporations to defend their operations i know dedicated pirates who are friends with peaceful empire corps transferable kill rights and an updated bounty system will go a long way toward making carebears safer and pvpers happier at the same timewhy would it matter what the hardcore pirates are saying in fi worry when those features might be implemented someone from csm correct me if im wrong but i understand that ccp is working on transferable kill rights and stiffer penalties for suicide ganking already were doing okayhamfast you make a good point about griefers  but griefing as you point out is indeed legal and griefers can be defeated hire mercenaries or if its really unbearable temporarily leave your corporation to avoid being a valid war target ive been there before and thats what i did it worked fine
marcus your post about the jcs skill que and such seems to be a fairly decent idea it applies to all players both pvp and bear type however i was waiting for the others to see where this was actually going and yes it went down the road i expected this is turning into the request for a no pvp zone mantra i am sorry but what makes this game fun is the edginess and the fact you are not safe anywhere with in the game now as far as carebear losses being the majority of what is being lost in the game is a little erroneous me thinks i can look up the various kb sites and see whats being destroyed where and by whom and it is not supporting your claim if you have a different source that proves your statement then fine i would very much like to see it and i would then concede to the fact you have a valid point as far as nerfs the pvp crowd has been hit the hardest out of everyone ships training modules rules mechanics and so on are being whacked by the nerf bat at a regular rate on the other side of the coin i do not see a lot of additions to the bear community either but at least you are getting something half the pvp additions are either broken when introduced or nerfed beyond usefulness but when the pvprs complain they are told to adapt even by the same community they are apart of bears on the other hand have not had much in the way of nerfs really hammered the ore compression thing carriers got hammed and so on but not so much it is detrimental to the point you have to cross train into another race of ships because your ships you have specialized in sucks twinkies now if you were to stay within the realm of your post about the skill ques and such i could get behind that but not tearing down the game mechanicsbut as you might already know this is probably seen as niggling any way by some of the ccp crowd
tesseract  perhaps one reason your most recent killboard report shows low sec kills is because of factional warfare and the multitude of participants there will mathmatically dwarf the care bear deaths by those pirates who arent involved in fwive no idea about recent ship sales but again id imagine the sales are to replace ships lost in fwto farrqua  i realize that some may ask for a totally free zone where they can run and prance and giggle all day without fear of death or dismemberment in fact it was a topic at one pointbut we all understand that eve isnt totally safe of course someone could shoot you right outside a 10 tutorial station theyd be punished but it could still happenim not saying that pvp needs nerfed what i am saying is that pve needs more content more flavor there needs to be some substancial justification for ccp to call eve a space setting besides the wallpaper background there needs to be some dedicated attention paid to the portion of the populace that arent totally obsessed with larger guns more bullets and epeen stroking killmailsthats all
i think the real issue dian gets at is that there was never policing by any corporation of stocks bc honestly for 5 years theyve had no value they were never implemented into the game effectively and therefore when a fix comes there should be some way to fix past historyits easy to say oh well you should have been more careful but if you truly look at the value of any stock over the history of this game up until that slip up 45 years in theyve had no valuei understand the people who have paid have a concern in this but honestly you were pawns in a bigger scheme that really took advantage of a flawed game feature itd expecially be different if having 1 share didnt grant such intrusive access into the company keep in mind if rkk were to try to buy their way out of this mess theyd be so heavily exploited it be a joke and to ask them to give up a name of such history over this is so far beyond belief that you cant truly justify itit be like asking microsoft to change their name bc 1 stock holder is exploiting them for 20 billion to regain that 1 share
sounds like a sensible proposal to me
gimme isk as i paid isk to buy them you get your shares back done
the value of shares can go down as well as uphard cheese me old mucker
over the course of my time on eveonline ive seen various discussions pop up time and time again with valid and not so valid arguments about ship balance not all of them are valid as i clearly mentioned earlier but one bug as i consider it to be is the belief that you should be required to train in another races ships to get the same effect from what your own races should already providethe most common complaints this response is given to is nanowhine just train for one of two ships a hugiin or a rapier i believe it was said however people shouldnt be forced to train for other ships to combat a specific playstylei believe this just train outside of your race to be able to play the game response should be a bannable offense its clearly attempting to instigate fights and is borderline insulting to players who shouldnt have to train something else its like the constant wow whine saying just roll another class and forget the investment youve poured into this one instead of balancing itup with balance down with morons who dont know what balance means
sorry m8 but i have to disagree you are suggesting that every race should be the same have the same kinds of ships with the same capabilities so that everything is fair and balanced yeah sure eve could go with a single race but it would really suck diversity 4tw if you wanna web 30km learn matar if you wanna nos 30km learn amarr if you wanna jam anyone learn caldari
i dont mean make everyone the same i mean in a lot of ways the races are not balanced when it comes to dealing with specific scenarios i shouldnt be forced to take 23 months to train to fly minmatar after putting so much investment into gallenteim merely stating that all those people who tell me to fly another races ships are harassing me into shying away from the real issues of the game balance
you want to carry a big banned stamp for all the times someone tells you l2p noob
well i think ccps idea was to have a mmo that players worked together to compensate for weaknesses so each race brings a strength and a weakness to the party you can only undock with one ship and from what i am trying understand your saying you want to be able to address any specific situation that you run across in that one ship you undocked withis this what you want
there is nothing stopping a caldari from training minmatar cruisers so if you really want to fly a rapier it doesnt really matter if you train for minmatar cruiser 5 or the new caldari cruiser ships we stole from the enemy 5 skill you are not supposed to be able to fly all ships at once but you are supposed to use teamwork

fixing the ui both bugs and inconsistencies should be ccps top priority move a dev from new features and make it their sole responsibility to go through xaens listthe ui in eve has driven away two people i tried to introduce to this game it hasnt kept pace with the rest of the gaming worldallow full ctrlshift forwardbackward text selection and deletion in dialogs fully implement sane and consistent tab field order move the uiwindows to the accelerated gpu layer rather than the old cpu layer absolutely move to threaded windows its atrocious that the market window takes so long to updateuse
please for the love of god yes the ui in this game sucks and while most players can deal with it why should we have to just deal with something that is supposed to be fun make the ui more functionalheh forgot to check the support boxyalso would be really great if you could get a scroll box that read off the combat log basically you could put this in the already existing chat box or make it a separate box up to the players preference and dont get me started on the drone interface it is in dire need of a complete overhaul maybe listing the drones by type automaticallyone more thing i thought ofwhy not use the rotator menu  i bet most people have never used this but find a ship then click and hold and a nice picture menu shows up  on the station items cargohold and overview items using pictures and not words is really much better
idea create a few new reactions or blueprints these blueprintsreactions would have the effect of combining the current pos fuels into 1 or 2 fuels say all the chemical fuels could be combines into a new item gallente pos fuel and pos repair partseach day a small tower would use 1 unit of fuel and 1 unit of parts a medium tower would use 2 of each per day and a large 3 per dayyou could make it so poss could run off either system the old components or the new fuels all this change would really do is simplify pos fuels so traders could combine the materials into an easily marketed comoditythoughts or does everyone like running all over the place gathering up different items to fuel their poss
easier pos fueling ftw
this was actually proposed a few months back with fuel pellets but was hit by considerable whines by those with one or a couple posses those of us who managed a couple dozen posses hit the knees praying for the changeanyway bring back this idea because us hardworking logistics guys would greatly appreciate this over spending an hour filling out fueling schedules before actually transferring the proper quantities of pos fuel p
i only manage 1 pos and i support this ideaas it stands now i have to select and move 8 different fuel bits in different amounts from the hanger we store it in to the tower as one gets low i need to aquire and restock it if i could buy a bpo perhaps research it and instead of all the different parts just haul in gallente tower fuel then it would be awesometower fuel could also be a commodity for sale on the market
the horror of helping our logistics guys back in the day
hehe i could have sworn i supported my own idea
fuel pellets are great what i want is an upgradeable station fitting that dispatches drones to do it allvirtual serfdom is not a fun game
such a drastic change would definitely be mishandled in the worst way no thanks
well in the end the csm decided the issues needed to be split up prior to voting there was a fair amount of discussion and the chatlog can be seen discussion from 1910 onwards in the end the ccp voted against escalating the dd through pos shields issue and against both killmail issues  damage past gates and sd avoiding killmail creation  but voted for the pos standings  alliance derived toggle  and aggression clearing past stargates issue all the best
so how about suicide gankers get the option to buy off concord officials say for like 10m a minute  by security system rating  by individual standings with condcordcorruption rulez ok
agree with op wholeheartiley
hg crystals good for solo golem pvp  lol  andlets face it its not crystals that are broken but shield tanking hell come to that active tanking full stopcrystals are quite easily fixed hp  recharge time this makes them identical to slaves which while a step in the right direction is the exact reason theyve never done it
1  you dont lose training time you have the option to use those small turrets its not wasted skilltime2  turrets are easier in some aspects for example you only train the specialisation skill for rails and blasters the normal skill  eg large turrets  counts for both while in missiles you have the division already for the normal skill  eg torp and cruise  and for specialisation  trop spec and cruise spec 3  you can use your turret support skills if you train other weapon systems eg if you switch from hybrids to minmatar and train artillery missile skills are for missiles only and missiles suck at pvp because of nano ships so you train lots of sp only for missions and cant use that skills for any other weapon systems
assembly hall concernwhat is the csm doing in regards to organization of the issues raised in the assembly hall forumssome keep getting bumped as if they arent on the front page then they might be ignored we really dont know some issues have lots of concern from the players and span many pages with lots of votes and stay more in the spotlight or get bumped to front page more frequently other issues are smaller of less concern to more players yet still valid to some these fall into the depths of the forum dont get bumped and assumed forgottenif csm delegates approach the assembly hall the same way i do then you check the first page 2nd page 3rd pagy etc but we all have lives we cant just view forums all dayso basically what if anything might be done to organize the chaos of the issue proposed in the assembly hall
i assume the csm has an organized solution to this already but none that the issue raisers can seeif i may be so daring to make a suggestion for issue processingtabled  prioritized  scheduled  addressed  resultstabled addressed and results are steps that we the voters care abouttabled  we present issues we want to know that our concerns are recognized or rather tabled in a big list of issues that csm delegates will one day address this could be an status icon next to an issue thread to indicated that hey you dont need to bump thisaddressed  we are most interested in hearing about when an issue is actually addressed by the csm this could be yet another status icon next to thread indicating that the issue has actually been raised by the csmresults  obviously we want to know the results on an issue perhaps a csm delegate could copy paste all the relevant results into the thread and click a checkbox that indicates that this is the results of the csm addressing the issue then perhaps clicking the addressed status icon of the thread could bring you straight to the results postprioritized  this is a step for the csm should be totally up to you how you choose to prioritize and you already to this only thing that i could suggest is that the csm have a public list of tabled issues so that we the players can see how issues are prioritized for the sake of full disclosurescheduled  this should be totally up for the csm to decide same as prioritizing but again for the sake of full disclosure made public
sorting through the assembly hall forumsbuilding on my previous suggestions im sure all of you would appreciate some organization of the forums as well in order to sort through issues tabled issues addressed new issues issues most discussed issues most supported etcunless you guys know something that i dont you dont get any help from the forum with sorting through all of the threads nope you gotta sort through them by most recently createdbumped to oldestso this suggesting is fairly simple thread sorting

a  in a lot of  lowsec systems you can trade an npc good just from station a to b in the same system once with a middleupper industrial and make over one million profit semi afk npc hauling gets you even more isk per hour compared to lowmidlevel mining  around 810 mil isk at least  with less afford as i guesscourier missions level iv get you around 0305 mil isk plus lp for far less jumps than lower level missions on my experience often itUFFFDs just one jump in a shuttle back and forthb  almost none open courier contract on the player market have comparable volumedistancecolleteral ratios  there are shiny exceptions   the good thing is that they are shown in your profile to get some reference for often more lucrative private contracts laterin case a  the haulers wallet says thanks in case b  the haulers wallet and the whole player driven economy gets some out of itto strengthen the second one some suggestions would be  cutting down margins from npc hauling taking all taxesfees from courier contracts  freeing them from the contract limit make that you can see the distance between location of the object and destination on the contracts overview get the industrials faster warp speedbut most important itUFFFDs an interface thing giving the haulers an ingame possibility to announce their routes and something like like bidcourier contractsthis would make it much easier to bundle shipments and that means much better isktime ratio plus the better possibility for all to get smaller shipments in mid and long range donethink of it annoyed again when you need four namend guns but these are spread over three placesyou could just look if a hauler will be on this route to save you one trip or maybe reduce it from eight to two jumpsand you can be sure that your staff is in place in time  obvious exeption hauler is shot  which you canUFFFDt if you give up a courier contractor you pay really lots or give it an endless expiration timehow does that soundui over this post i forgot my mammoth at a gate in lowsecnothing happened was npc stuff anyway edit typo

sorry to boil your post down to one sentance butdoing mission gives you far far better isk per minutenpc trading helps new player traders geting their starting isk imho
there are alot of mmos out there and in my opinion none of them come close to eve but i am a little upset about the lack of noningame controll options all im talking about is the little stuff the ability to read evemails from the evewebsite i dont care about sending them but reading them would be a good start also it would be awsome to have a way to change your skills from the website rather then having to actualy log on to the game there are alot of times when i am away from my desktop for work school or family activitys but because i dont have a computer with the client i can not change my skills i understand this brings up some third party program issues where programs could atomaticly switch your skill but i know there are ways to eliminate that almost compleatly even in a browser based switching scripti think there are alot of little things like that you could add that would make eve more availible to ppl with low end computers or limmited computerinternet access they would not be hard and it would greatly improve eveonline flexability

i dont see the point  logistics frigates would have the same effectiveness of afs  they just dont scale well small remote reps are short ranged and weak  consider that logistics cruisers have a powergrid bonus to fit large remote reps they can be either tanked or nanoed  so that they can shrug off single attackers reaching them or avoid getting caught entirely a logistics frigate would die to the first rifter looking their waya role fitting for a t2 frigate is electronic support  remote sensor booster  eccm  tracking links long range abilities that do not attract the attention of enemies too much  but can lend significant help with enough of a bonuswho needs rapiers when your medium guns can track interceptors  remote sensor boosters are very dangerous offensively  and bonused eccm would be a welcome counter to falcons
anything that adds a new ship is a good idea in my book im not sure about the specifics but i am willing to be that even though they will be primary often and not survive for very long people will use them more since they will be fairly cheep they would also make a nice addition to small gangsperhaps give them enough pg and cap bonuses to mount the med sized ones like the cruiser sized logis can mount large remotesack forgot the support check box again
i support having 30 and 90d codes
the second bug i havent seen myself but the first one is insanely annoying  i order my drones to attack one ship and five seconds later three of them split off to attack something else entirely drone ai has gotten a lot better since ive started playing but theres still some bits that need work
first ive suffered the second ive never seen yet
signed and my domi thanks you
regarding the second bug you mean they still have not removed collision detection from drones well it contributes to lag at least  
i think we have too many drones in the game in fleet fights noone can even monitor them in the overview since they would mess it up i think most of these bugs derive from the fact that the server has to calculate the relative positions of so many 3d objects i would suggest to make some changes in drones to simplify the processmake one light drone that takes 25 bandwidth and is able to run as fast as the current light drones but hit 5 times as hard signature and all would remain the same hp would be 7 times   i suggest to be 7 times and not 5 times because 1 drones is much easier to be chosen as target and it is not my intention to nerf the drone users in any way  the current single light drone etcsame for medium drones the 5 medium drones bandwidth ones would be replaced by a single 50mbit bandwidth medium dronesame for heavies replace the 5 25mbit ones with 1 of 125mbit that would hit 5 times as hard have 7 times the hp but maintain the cirrent signaturethat way we would have less objects to calculate therefore less lag and would add new tactics in combat since hiting the drones would be easier but tanking them using remote reps would be easier as well additionaly we would no longer have the colliding bug and possibly would be easier the single drone to do less mistakes in target choice
very annoying bugs indeed needs to bee fixed
there are ships that dont have multiple of 25 as bandwidth or drone bayall the gallente and most of the other races t1 frigates have between 5 and 15 m3 of drone bay remove the drones and they will lose a good percentage of damage enlarge the drone baybandwidth and they will become too powerful
so many other more pressing issues for csm to address i hope this one is well down the list of priorities alliances will simply destroy fw in my opinion by dominating the space and making the fights even more blob centric than they are at present with the additional numbers alliances will bring to fights comes lag and diminished pvp experience
no the pvp experience and organisation of alliance pilots is far grater than those of the regular empire dwellers which are participating in fwa pvp corporation will get tired of shooting noobs for shizzle in about 3 weeks tops and will focus on the other pvp corporations in the other militia in these 3 weeks many noobs will avoid combat and many more will die without a chance and all be disapointed why because there is little place for them in the sand boxafter the pleasure of shooting poorly fighting back targets is gone alliance pvp corporations will be reluctant to take on noobs aboard becasue they lack pvp skills and thus do not help fighting the otther alliance pvp corps plus they could be spiesmost people are selfish and most act like it without thought i believe it is best to let alliances where they are besides noobs killing noobs is fun unlike vets bbquing noobs they get teh taste of pvp and as fw has no set candy once you win they will look into pvping somewhere else somewhere with more rewards mercenary corps pirate corps 00 corps
1 lower posanchorablesstation services hp drastically less to take down less people to do it with less to repair back if you are a defender moar fights less lag leave current sov system alone as it keeps thing simple 2 limit friendly status for alliances based on size and have those limits translate over to overview settings less friends for larger alliances  as many enemies as you want  further limiting super power napfailtrains3 consumable and randomized moon minerals4 do not touch suicide ganking outside of missions nothing wrong here scout it out warp core stab it do not fly afk
3 and 1 would not fix the moon min problem and would likely only make it worse changing sov so that you can either have a mining station or a station for sov one or the other not both coupled with changing the distribution of minerals within the reactionsthat would pretty much fix the moon min and sov issueslowering hp thoughmaybe smaller more specialized ships for disabling the stations or parts of the station though that could be an idea
supported excellent idea always used to see eom as amarrgallente crossbreeds but hey thats my opinion would love to see ammatar ships in an amarrminmatar or minmatarcaldari skillset p
id love more pirate faction ships there is one problem with your logic though there are only 2 pirate factions that use gallente and minmitar factions at least from an rp perspective the ships received through serpentis arent serpentis ships but rather guardian angel ships which are a subdivision of angel cartel
current combosminmatargallente  angel  serpentisminmataramarr  blood raidergallentecaldari  guristaamarrcaldari  sansharemaining combosamarrgallenteminmatarcaldariseems kinda odd that the minmatargallente combo would be used twice id think angel would be better off as a minmatarcaldari combo  judging from location tank type and supposed jove origins friends of minmatarcaldari races  serpentis works well as a minmatargallente combo due to the friendly relationship between the serpentis and angel factions that would leave the amarrgallente comboeom ships would be sweet but the way they work they are amarr ships that use hybrid guns and armor tanking they should be an amarrgallente mix  which is currently missing  since the amarrcaldari skillset is used by sansha problem is they dont hold any space and are solely mission rats doesnt stop me from wanting to fly a sleek bluesilver hull though  new space to play around in minor factions i think should be one race only thukker would get minmatar mordu would get caldari sistersintaki would get gallente khanid   would get amarr who else am i leaving out only issue with this setup is that gallente gets two sets and khanid doesnt need faction ships since they are already incorporated into the amarr t2  half the ships are of khanid design thereabouts 
if they do add an alternative means for acquiring t2 materials that currently depend on super valuable moons it should be along the same vein as invention it could even involve rd agents and make them useful for more than just datacoresfor example you give a reaction bpo to an rd agent and they will discover bpcs of an alternate reaction that can yield the same material but require different  ie cheaper  inputs these reaction bpcs would be good for maybe 50000 units at bestor better yet the rd agents could somehow provide reaction bpcs to combine the common moon minerals into the uncommon onesmy personal choice would be an exploration site with some special object that you can mine  ie a comet  and obtain a limited amount of moon materials this would be the most funbut regardless of how it works it will have the same results as with invention and t2 production being able to somehow create those t2 materials without owning an actual source would normalize the prices of such materials and then of course those cheaper t2 materials would cause t2 equipment to be cheaper toobut probably the greatest impact such a feature would have on eve would be the reduced income of all the superalliances that largely depend on those isk fountain moons to support their fleetsso balancing moon minerals would also bring balance in other areas and i can only support such a suggestion

if thats what is worrying you then you should be thanking us instead of trolling us as were trying to make this game less like hello kitty online by making you earn your lunch instead of getting it for free most of us here dont want high sec safer i personally want the rewards to justify the risk which at the moment isnt the case
no insurance for renegade pod pilots who engage poorly defended ships known as rats since concord does not immediately obliterate all these ships in hisec how can they be criminals there needs to be a lawthousands of blatent legal violations occur everyday yet the agressors can have their ships insured oh the madnessthe bottom line is a vocal minority wants a riskfree empire space and that i cannot endorse and making suicide ganking more difficult will do absolutley nothing to this effect but hey if it makes completely ignorant people happy  including devs   it knock yourself out
where is the freaking thumbsdown sign ccp get on this
so what you are saying is that you want to nerf highsec missions
with the latest official database dump now nearing its 7th month of being outdated i think it would be nice to have ccp commit themselves to giving this information sharing a bit higher priorityand while something was done from around april where t20 and prismx started to make the dumping process slicker it still makes me fear that even though the process might be faster now the datadump process still need to be prioritized and assigned to someone during the launch of a new versionit would be nice if ccp would commit themselves to say the db dump will be released with the clients or something similar achievable just so we know what to expectan alternative would be to expand the current icon generating functionality of the webtools command so that it could generate a set of datafiles with the starmap items and data this should be something the client already have in its files the rest of the static data from ex mapcelestialstatistics andor mapdenormalized can then be published normaly if they would generate too much trafficthe datadump process need to be prioritized higher and assigned to someone during the launch of a new version of eve
alot of people dont get why we feel this is important so i wanted to add a note that maybe people will understandthe datadump we so eagerly want is used in the killboard software without it we dont have accurate information on newer ships or fittiing slot changesjust one example
arent they working on new system that allows them to easily publish the data so for next patches we should get it much quicker i hopeshould release it already for ea tho
i think this is a very important issue that ccp should address
yes the data dump needs a much higher priority than what it is currently given
the fact is the datadump should be released in advance of expansions not months afterwards this applies also to updated apisif ccp is going to support developers it needs to apply the same level of professionalism it would to any other aspect of the developmental process the rule that traditionally companies should focus on what brings in the money and keeps people happy does not hold true or can be deceptive when working with thirdparty developers while a small group of people there are few groups of people who hold as much sway over the happiness of other players killboards and evemon are two great examples of programs that have really added something to the game if ccp continues to neglect developers the rest of the community starts to feel it ultimately anything that affects developers affects the majority of the community in timei hope ccp will see through the mistakes they have made in the past with managing the api and datadump projects and place these two projects along with further supporting tools ahead in the priorities list communication also desperately needs to be improved i find it sad that while our old api developer  ccp garthagk  is still in the evedev channel in coldfront months after his departure from ccp we have yet to see our new api developer even join once to converse with developers this lack of communication has hurt the process of development and the morale of third party developers hard and pushed the relationship between the developer community and ccp apart like a wedgeccp needs to address these issues before the problem develops any further people seem to take it for granted that applications like the evedev killboard used by most corpsalliances just keep themselves uptodate and working developers work long and hard on applications  ive spent around 10 hours today on eve metrics for example  and to some extent ccp are just shunning all this work thats being done for them the sensible move from a business and crm perspective here is to prioritise the api and datadump with another developer if needed and to get developers in better contact with the devs working on the tools
i aggree with ix thirdparty developers have a huge sway on the way people interact with the game and priotiseing them into new client updates will help keep the community as a whole much happier
agree entirely with this to have to wait several months to update 3rdparty applications that rely on a lot of the static data is just frustrating especially when you see that garthagk managed to release the last export before the trinity patch i can appreciate that some work was being done on the export procedures but in all honesty it shouldnt take anywhere near this long to release an update
i agree theres no reason that an updated datadump shouldnt be released with each new patch and while that may be ccps intention already its important enough to be formally addressed
missions definitely need more variety
and if your in your trader carrying 100m in goods tuff luckno thanksif you want those guristas to jump into another mission sure  and a lot more deadly  but mission running is not a part of mining trading or other types of playi can just imagine my corpmates while ice mining a bunch of gurista bss jump in and start shooting up everything and everyonewtf what  caused thatuhm sorry guys i run missions towell great then you can at least afford to buy us new mining ships btw we also lost 40 sheets of ice i assume youll mine those on your own the rest of the ideas i do like though so except for the part mentioned above tumbs up
to the top
the truth revealed  advertise that new players can enter and prosper  bull what you have done is to set it up so that no matter what direction a person goes he is either destroyed or must join a factiion or corp alredy in supreme existance one could play safe and be board by doin level 1 missions till hell freezes over or join a corp level 2 creates more set backs over and over to force one to either be board or join a corp the point is that you advertise falsly to keep people paying for your game and no matter what they are forced to join corps with mega bucks and pay this monthly fee for a few years before one can really expand on his own why cant you just tell the truth and get the players that want6 to pay for that kind of crap instead your greed as a company called eve on line is hoping that many will pay for the game and a few months of playing time you get your money and to hell with the players that you lied to there will be more new people to lie to and rob i am very sorry i bought into this it is totally misleading and i for one do not like being forced to be ruled by bull have a nice day
thats definitely some good ideas right there
support this wtf is wrong with that ghan guy  seek help man 
exactly what i was thinking about a bit mor fun to missions a lot less unnamed ti loot since i too think that industrialists are somewhat laughed at from ccps side

i think the ultimate factor here is not that there are a few places where there are the best quality agents but the fact that the best quality agents have such poor distributionfor example take a look at the amarr imperial navy they have a lot of level 4 agents a lot of them are also quality 20 the problem around 812 of these agents are distributed between two systems not constellations not regions two systemsinternal securityhamen banela level iii quality 20yahyerergahta zahashir level iii quality 20yahyererahvasa aradoh level iv quality 20yahyererjabha dinuhar level iv quality 20yahyerermelmaja gaku level iv quality 20yahyerersazaktid nafir level iv quality 20yahyerernow ask yourself why are there so many high quality agents in a single system all in the same branch im sure there are other tends out therei feel that dynamic agents may only cause other issues in the game namely agent hub griefing a lot of players run missions because they enjoy doing so and its a nice way to make isk with a limited amount of risk but the risk is still there if dynamic agents are made what is to prevent a corporation to login just after downtime suck it dry and continue to do so to prevent players from making iski think the way to help with lag is to simply distribute agents over a wider field there are a lot of agents that are far too close to eachother i think there should be a balance of agents especially level 4 agents between high sec and low sec as it is now high sec is laggy due to the very poor placement of the limited number of level four agents if there were more level four agents spread around with varying levels of quality  but nothing too high thats for lowsec id like to think  then people will stop flocking to the best agent and instead go for the second best after all 510 points of quality wont make or break an agent for missioninghowever if you must have dynamic agents then do it along with this idea of better placement of agents for mission runners and have it only lower the quality by a small number for examplelets say agent a in system a is widely used because hes a quality 10 agentagent b in system b isnt widely used because hes a quality 2 agent and obviously people want more bang for their isk so they go to agent a the dynamic quality shouldnt take agent a all the way down to 20 quality but it should take him down maybe to 0 at the most or if you must 5 or so making agent b more viable as traffic lets up agent as quality rises and agent bs doesnt fall due not having as big of a draw as agent a thus their qualities even out being more attractive to players and allowing things to balance out
ive also discovered a trend that a few other corporations have also followedthe ministry of war has three level four quality 20 agents on the same station as well all of them internal securityi dont care if theyre all in 01 systems just put them in different ones
and if all agents have quality and all npc corporations have agents in all divisions then doesnt that make all npc corporations generic 1 i believe lvl and quality should be based on system security status  not new i guess  hehe  but differences in quality should be greater  system 2 also spread the agents more into space 3 we should have no lvl 4 agents in systems above 05 no lvl 3 agents in systems above 074 the diffs between agents should be great lvl1  lvl2  lvl3  lvl4  lvl5while5 skills and quality should make the path from lvl x  to lvl x1  more linear
this would reduce a lot of lag with basically no downside
supported
their rating like much of the information granted for free in eve should be hidden and if possible dynamic
removing qualitiy signed
i suspect your 3 would be one way to reduce a lot of lag all those mission runners limited to level 2 and 3 agents because they have no desire to be targets for low sec piratesmission jumpers will find other things to spend their time doing i know it would help me move to another game all the fasteri could see limiting max quality  with dynamic quality levels  based on the posted security level of a system but not beyond thatas for the serenity steele comment giving all npc corps all agent types would make no sense why would transtellar shipping need a mining agent while some agent divisions could or should be found in all npc corps  admin security a few others perhaps  there is no viable reason that all corps would have all divisions but a spread of agents over many systems of varied  or varying  quality for all appropriate divisions would be good

i cant say i agree 100 with this idea but i will say that its a change and a decent one at that so i support ithowever the ideas my friends and i came up with were somewhat different but still rather close to the ideas you presentedessentially assault frigates should be considered minicruisers at this point in time they seem to be a joke for two reasons their mass is far larger than their tech i variants while hacs are the same and can achieve speeds faster than their tech i counterparts their severe lack of midslots andor lowslots severely limit their viabilityi personally dont think assault frigates need more dps more tank instead i think they need more speed to bring them up to par with heavy assault cruisers over their tech i variants and give them more midlow slots one example is the retribution it has a single midslot considering the current nanocraze this is incredibly disabling for the shipconsidering their role should be as minicruisers they should be allowed more versatility and thus be able to fit more than a single module in any one slot heck they probably should have closer to what most cruisers had for medlow slots
i made some calculations on the speed of afs myselfthe same mass for the t1 counterpart of the af  thumbs up proposed change to the retribution  no thanks proposed change to the vengeance  yes to a velocity bonus no to a slot change proposed change to the harpy  no  proposed change to the hawk  no thanks proposed change to the enyo  no  proposed change to the ishkur  yes proposed change to the jaguar  no  proposed change to the wolf  no  erik
sorry but gotta agree with mighty on this atm nano is the do it all wonder and as far as nanos adding variety i dont agree with that statement at all i miss the days of giant slug fests with big ships interceptors and frigs tackling like mad etc now your either nano fit counter nano  which normally involves a couple ships nano fit themselves  and thats about it there is no variety when most of the gangs you come across these days are nano and thats it
slugfests are easy to find if you want them
i think it is safe for me to say that ccp has a healthy viewpoint on nanoships that the op would be comfortable with not saying any more than that thoughheres a thumbs up for you anyway sonny
nanos have many weaknesses i encourage players to explore all their option before calling this a lost cause because this argument simply implys that players should drop risky dangerous fittings for safer slower fittings  nanos are risky and dangerous they allow fast escapes but at the expense of true tanking and firepower the nano ship comes pre nerfed nanoships simply are for people who like fast and deadly combat by saying nerf it you asking ccp to alienate a sizable portion of the community and a entire race of ships to satisfy the frankly unskilled and unimaginative people out there pvp is about combat and tactics not spider tanking and blobbing
to quote dubanfpill also make note of the fact that its extremely easy to kill nanoships ill even make a stepbystep guide on how to do it1  name your character garmon 2  3  profit
nanoes are fine here is a example from the python cartels big book of epic battles us 1 gank celestis  me 3 light neutron iis 2x lse mwd 2x damps magstabs and pdus  1 blackbird 1 griffin 1 arbitrator 1 moathem 1 7kms vagabondlocation rancer pipe some system on the hek end some planetvagabond warps to the planet and starts running around us at a good distance i dont warp the gang because i want to make sure everyone is aligned first the vagabond makes a pass at us i order all the ewar to be put on it and people to web it if it comes close the vagabond makes its first pass without even being able to lock we warp off to another planet the vagabond follows the griffin gets seperated from the gang vagabond kills the griffin the vagabond keeps trying to get the gang but horribly fails because its tracking distruped ecmd and damped eventually our gang warps off to a gate and jumps outnow this vagabond which probably cost around 200250 million was only able to kill a single t1 frigate worth less than a million the whole gang put together was maybe worth around 3040 million all that was required to avoid it was sticking together and putting ewar on it nano ships arent overpowered you just have to know how to deal with them if you think a gang of pure battleships without any of the counters fex heavy neuts can kill a ship that got around 100150 million isk invested in the ability to run away you are delusional nano ships got 100150 million isk invested soley in the ability to run away their offense comes from being able to attack from out of gank and web range their defense comes from manuvering and staying at the right distance at the right time as well as escaping when schitt hits his only fan
ccp should concentrate on other items first instead of listening to the whines of people that dont know how to fit a decent counternanoas has been stated numereous times before the game offers enough countertactics and if you do want to change something at least improve something instead of nerfing thingseve is different from other mmporg as it really demands skilled pilots or organised groups to achieve something if you want an easy game go and play wow instead of the constant nerf this nerf that whine by joining wow youll probably please both games by increasing the average iq level
right because you cant roam in a system that doesnt have a cyno jammer can you you the attacker chose where you bring the fight dont whine if you have a disavantadge when you do it in the heart of the enemy territoryfor roaming even there adapted ships already exist interceptors interdictors cloakers nonnanoed has and recons but of course ganking with those ships is a tad harder and more risky than doing it with what amount to 9k assaultresist shielded 300500 dps interceptors isnt it this logic is so wrong its mindboggling if it is true then no outnumbered side ever won a fight against a larger foe before nano became largely used it is the case rightif you have the courage of your opinions about not autodying to superior numbers 100 of the time  read removing the necessity of commiting to a fight you start  then i expect you to advocate a removal of the warp core stab penalties at the next csm meetingthe rethoric spouted by the nanofans is always the same yes they are ways to fit your ship to drive away a single nanohas but to actually get to kill a competent one that reduce things to only 2 choices minmatar recons or superior numbers that is clearly not enoughlarger forces killing most of the time a smaller force if the smaller force let itself be caught within attack range when all other parameters are equivalent is a fact of life and pure logic if you dont accept that youre better suited to a game where you only fight npcsyou are trying to kill roaming by making it pointless for the defender to mobilise to defend againt an attack if they cant hope to catch more than one or two of the attackersyou know that little ship called interceptor the one that has been more or less obsoleted by nano cruisers thats the ship of choice for roaming behind enemy linesi voted for you because you seemed relatively bright and capable of reasoned argumentation but i see you prefer to defend your favored play style over the general balance of the game that or you really are blind
im sorry jade your argument doesnt washyou say nano ships are a good counter to the blob well whats the counter to a nanoblobwe on a fairly regular basis see 30 to 50 man strong nano gangs running aroundhow are people supposed to skirmish against that the only counter is to bring for example 50 battleships  but then the nanos wont engage because of all the usual problems of fighting nanosand you had better hope those battleships arent missile ships  yes yes i know  missiles suck for pvp anyway  cos if so they are doing 0 damage etc etcim sorry jade but you are flat out wrong while it was the occasional typhoon or specialist vagabond doing it nano fitting was kinda cool when everyone does it then it just sucksand everyone is doing iti see a hac or recon on scan i basically assume its nanod  in fact i can only remember one occasion so far this year we have run into a nonnanod hac  it died i formed a gang a few days ago and when i asked what ships we had in gang of 9 people 3 had brought rapiers  because we know its going to be nanos yes we can counter them but its still crap its no fun to play against so you end up having to go nano yourself to have fun so the variety and options and possibilities in eve all vanish because you are basically left atnanosniping bs  for specialist uses capitalas the only real options for 00 combat
oh and there are other options to counter the blob that people used to usefor example snipers with snipe spots skirmishingburn eden style tactics with interdictors cloaks  picking your targetspacks of reconsetc etcbut all of those have been obsoleted by the swiss army knife of eve  the nano ship
dude he was alone there was five of you including 4 ewar boats how can you use a fight like that to discuss balance isk cost has never been a valid argument for discussing balance 15 pilots in t1 frigs could easily kill a marauder etc
yes nerf nanos nerf the ability to fight alone and favor the mighty blob nerf player intelligence for zerg tactics we dont need roaming gangs into our nullsec ratting opperation without nanos it will be easy to make a megablob against anyone and kill them if they dare to venture into our space of course they will have the option of megablobbing too nerf nanos for easy gate camping traveling through nullsec well make a blob if you want to do itits so amazing how people ask for more tactical options and the ability to use ones wits but cry for help when someone else use these things
that is not the point the point is we had the tools to make sure he couldnt touch us despite the fact that we couldnt kill him he was unable to kill us unless we slipped up the point was that there are counters to nanos  counter as in rendering them useless not killing them as far as the 15 frigs could easily kill a marauder do you think 15 bantams with mining lasers could easily kill a marauder i dont think so because the 15 bantams with mining lasers wouldnt have the right tools point beeing thatif you dont bring the right tools for the job how can you expect to get the job done
youre wrong when speaking about balance you have to consider an equal amount of players on each side because theres nothing that say in the game mechanics that this side has xx size limit and that one yy if theres no 1v1 balance theres no way a 30v30 is going to be balanced and so onso alone against a single nano ship what options to kill it do you have theres only 2 nano yourself and be even faster or fly a nanoed huginnrapierhow to fix nanos first a nerf to the mwd module the very fact that its an absolute musthave mod in subcapital pvp is a clear proof that its overpowered with it mwding hacs can reach back a gate they just used even with xx interceptors to web them and do the same thing on the other side rince and repeat which is pretty ridiculous nerf them from 550 to say 350 and it will still be an usefull mod just not a musthave anymoreif you look back at all the overpowered ships and setups that got nerfed over the years mwd were in cause in most half the casesthen replace the sig radius penalty on large shield extenders by a speed penalty to force players to choose between speed tanking or buffer tanking but not both at the same timelast nerf pylocarbs so theyre more in line with other rigs that is about 6070 as effective that the module theyre supposed to replacewith that speed tanking will still work at least on hte ships that are supposed to do it but it wont be superior anymore to conventionnal tanking and pylocarbs wont cost 50m anymore and afterburners  who could use a boost too  will start being an alternative again
this is what jade should be sayingof course jade doesnt speak like that instead its more like
3 power blocks mindless sov system unbearable game breaking lag due to the ability of megafail alliances to field 500 gangs node crashing nonsense all of these problems are far moar important than a few newbies getting their arses shot off because they havent figured out game mechanics i tend to fly rapiers and falcons i have no problem with ze nano since my webs go 40km t2  and my jams sit at about 15 how do you do what you do so poorly fixed that for you now it makes sense last time i checked non capitals can de aggro and jump nonsupercaps can dock and hug stations and fast ships do what fast ships do run away now if you believe there needs to be a contract for pvp where both sides must stay on the field till total hell death and cannot disengage your a very confused child of warfare from the enlightment age hardly the type of role play for internet spaceshipsis this char pithecantropus a main char or just a forum warrior i can always set up a demonstration for you on my very realistic character if youd like
missles bad for pvphmm seems be is doing like 99 of their killing in missle boatsanti nano  limited to minnie shipsi dont think sotry engaging a sesnsor jam and neuting fitted bs and you nano ship wont be able to do a thing on the other hand ill guess that will offer an opportunity to nerf caldari for their jamming and domis for their neuting capacityinstead of whining people should  fit their ship decently think more tactical instead of iblobsoiwin start working as a team instead of looking for individual killboard honour whoring
once again the nano fans proves their amazing capacity to fill their ears with their thumbs and shout the same craptastic arguments to avoid having to anwser what they have no argument to defendthe issue is not with preventing a nanoship to kill you the issue is with actually holding down long enough to kill itremember the days of the 95 resist scorpion shouting that it was fine because it couldnt kill you if you had a good tank only made you an idiot that hasnt changed
now tell me how a vaga would run if you can keep it webbed for like 100kmimo that is more than enough time to kill it or are you lacking skills that bad i agree with needa and some of the others cut the whining and play the game
sweet jesus you put cyno gens on vagas and you hawt drop 45 carriers onto the nano gang lagwebstupiditydead nanos comeon now i thought you knew that already
welp
disagreed
your perception is greatly flawed and far overblown lolthis community has had enough with nanos its not about the ships we all fly the tactics used the counters the blobs or the costs its about the pure advantage big nanodweebs have over the rest of eve period why are you so afraid of a nerf afraid of changes eve has changed time and time again and that is what keeps the game going the pot has settled and nanos are on top its time to mix it up again rebalance and make this game yet again best for the entire community im all for constant rebalances otherwise well lean too far to one side and topple do you want an eve with a majority of nano ships and nano counter no no i hope youre not that naive
i just wanted to quote this because it made me laughi disagree nanos are powerful but like jade said tactically youre fairly limited with a nano gang if you have a well balanced nonnano gang against a nano gang of the same size the nano ships are pretty much relegated to picking off stragglers with nonnano blobs bringing appropriate antinano defense nano ships will generally run the only reason nanos will get decent kills is because they exploit holes in planning and defensenanos really only have the advantage in that its way easier to put together a homogeneous fleet that can do one thing really well nonnanomixed gangs however require a lot more organizing to achieve balance so naturally their ripe for being exploited by very focused gangs of nanosstealth bomberssnipers or whatever their particular hole is
if nanoships hacs recons  had the same disengagement possibilty of battleships why would anyone fly them
i agree with this because it describes very well what happens novadays all around the universe if you know that a nanogang is coming you have a varity of options 1  you cant build up something that nanos would fearso you stay docked2  you build up a even bigger blop then the nano blop which is coming so they wont engage you or burn away from you after a few secs3  you build up a gang of nano ships yourself which is though possible not realy an option for the every day use in defending your home systems  and even if you can build up something like this the original nano gang will maybe not engage at all or if they engage you will get only singel shipswhat is this leading to at the end  in some cases you wont get a fight at all and if you get a fight the you can kill only one or two of them until the rest burns away or warps offim not realy sure what to do about this just nerf nanos is not a good option because its fun flying them and they are a good strategic option on the other hand it is absolutely no fun to defend against them  and this is the point when i think that ccp should look at this add some counters or make the ones already existing more effective or whatever because the people on the defending side have in most cases just no fun with this at all dont get me wrong there should be no anti nano iwin button but you should have the possibility to takle the whole gang down and kill them all if you do it right
so long as its not a prize for who can blob the hardest and the most often im all for it
i support more discussion in respect to thisi believe there is presently a gap between the storyline published by ccp and the results of player actions it is a disconnect between the massive power of the capsuleers and what actually goes on in the empiresnote a small part of this gap was closed with the recent fw chronicles showing more of the impact of capsuleers on the empireshoweveri endorse closing this gap even more i leave the how up to future imaginings of ccp and our community but i believe having an impact on the world is a vital way to provide a goal more captivating than a bay of shiny ships or mountains of isk lets take the potential collaborative outcomes of corporations and alliances to the next level
supportin
i agree its a tall order but these are the sorts of things ccp is saying they want to hear from this process and its certainly something that would take eve in a new and good direction basing the story on the actions of players would really energize the player pvp conflicts as well as interest in the rp storylinesthanks for the supports
i dont think youll find anyone willing to support a nerf to the sleipniras for what goes in the nh lowslots  whatever combination of damage mods damage control nano mods and lowslot sensor boosterseccm you want dc triple bcs and lowslot eccm would be my generally favoured choice but im sure some people would want to counter the high mass and low speed of the nh

to increase the use of the nighthawk as a viable pvp platform this change is requiredthe comments of certain members on the board were idiotic lazy any nonrepresentative of a vast majority of players while other items are passed with a smaller positive reaction usually spread among certain groups this issue is too important not to be passed up to ccp over the top of the csmif important issues can not be brought up direct to ccp and can be changed really during the next down time then ccp is only using the csm as a pretty thick buffer of white noise while the mods at ccp can continue on their own path without having to a  tell us what theyre doing or b  tell the csm if issues theyre debating are already being looked at and being redesignedokay one caldari issue has been voted no at a csm meeting with pretty poor excuses for saying no in the first place and this issue can not be brought up again in this iteration of the csmoh well i hope the next board will be more representative of eve as a whole including the professions and racessorry for the rambling nature of this post ive been reading the whole thread while the account has been inactive but this issue and rejection has actually convinced me to start my account sooner than expected so i can post in this threadships of the same type across the races should be equal but only in terms of capability to perform the role they are designed to fill otherwise whats the pointhaving a lame duck ship that costs over 100m isk is a pretty fat lame duck even if with a fully trained pilot it can go through level 4s very fast it still would be nice to see it on the pvp battlefield
problem there is no indication whether a locked target is a friend or foe i reckon that this problem might not be one which disturbs a lot of people as most people only lock hostiles with the intention of bringing doom however i used to fly combat fitted logistic ships and it happens time to time that both the offensive modules and the logistic modules are running at the same time preferably on different targets of course there is nothing more annoying than figuring out that you have been shield boosting the primary target all the time this problem is the most serious when the enemies are flying the same kinds of ships your gang is flying which happens a lot nowadays with all these nano gangs so i would like to have an overview color indicator on the target icons on top of the screen either take the targets overview icon and display it in one of the corners of the target icon or take the targets overview background color and use that color to make a border around the target icon
being one of his wingmen i fully support this idea he keeps shooting meg and repping my enemies 
i agree make it flash blue for incoming offensive weapons like shield transporters repping drones remote sensor boosters ect ecttheres a lot
excellent ideaand while the devs are working with this section of code to implement this excellent idea maybe theyll also be able to fix the very annoying situation where locked targets change order when another is lockedunlockeddestroyed
the op makes a good point but this is a great one this bug is horribly aggravating
i could support an overhaul of the evemailperhaps it could have different divisions like our hangars and wallets with the ceo controlling access to different divisionsi realize it would mean some additional programming but would be well worth it
support thisi used to run a corp and this was an issue mind you we were a small corp so i can imagine how big an issue thsi is with large corps
supported
i am in a relatively small corp but even our pos mails are a pain fully support this one
agreed
atleast the damn thing shouldnt flash every time you get automatic message
i completely agree drones are a main source of damage and it would be great to have mods to increase their damage just like other weapons and their tracking speed itd be exactly like fitting on damage mods for your own turretsthough i think the 25 bandwidth mod needs to be looked at a bit consider the smallest ship that should be able to benefit from it  cruiser  and give it a pg requirement inline with the highest level weapons it would allow players to add up to 125 bandwidth while completely sacrificing their own weapon systems allowing them heavy drones on any ship while severely limiting their own capabilities perhaps even consider making versions of it like afterburners frigate cruiser and battleship versions so you cant have a battleship apply two to be able to use heavies while taking almost no pg hits at all while this also allows frigates to increase their abilities as wellas for the increasing drone bay i recommend a rig as well as lowslot module kinda like the cargo expander modules and the cargo optimization rigs
to further expand on my ideas to make this a bit more viable for all shipslimited auxiliary control link irequires 9 pg 15 cpu high slot5 mbits bandwidthrequires advanced drone interfacing inote this is a frigate class moduleauxiliary control link irequires 175 pg 25 cpu high slot25 mbits bandwidthrequires advanced drone interfacing iiusing the limited auxiliary control link i on the ishkur iirc the only drone boat frigate with the largest drone bay and the most bandwidth with its 4 high slots this would only give it an additional 20 bandwidth at max thus enabling it to field 4 medium drones and a single small drone while completely sacrificing its bonuses to hybrid turretswith 3 150mm railgun iis and a stab ii this thing fits 94 dps without its 5 light drones at all skills level 5 193 dps w droneswith 4 limited auxiliary control link is its dps is 147the reason for allowing cruisers and above to fit a 25 model is simple a few hacs can already achieve 125 bandwidth such as the ishtar allowing other ships to match the ishtar while significantly lowering their own dps via sacrificing their own bonuses for weapons seems like a decent tradeoff for this to take up 23 high slots for battleships its the same youll be unlikely to see this used for many ships though but for drone boats like the arbitrator myrmidon and vexor this is a nice little module can also be useful for a lot of battleships which are only able to field light drones however theyd also require losing a lowslot or rig to be able to use this properly by increasing their drone bay capacity
suportedalso webber drones should be able to catch nanoships
supportedmore drone modules are needed
why do you think i included light and medium webber drones ideally speaking you could launch a rack of light webbers slowly swap out the drones for mediums individually since the ship is now slow enough for medium webbers to catch  and then do the same with heavies itd only be viable on a serious drone boat domiishtar  but you could get the equivalent of an x5 web on anything slower than a ceptor
aye
drones are my least favorite weapon platform but i definitely support thisas far as the auxiliary control unit i think it should have 3 sizes one for each ship size 5mbs for frigatesdestroyers with pg requirements in line with small turrets  probably lower than a turret but comparable  10 mbs for cruisersbcs and 25mbs for bss id like to see these have drone baycargo capacity equal to the bandwidth with the t2 version having double the drone bay increase
i was thinking of having three sizes as well and having the cruiser module be the 10 but then i looked and realized that this would create a lot of problems mainly youll be able to have cruisers with 130 mbits bandwidth it isnt even while 5 and 25 are far better options to deal withfor example the arbitrator has four high slots with four 10s that would give them 90 bandwidth a rather terrible number you can field 3 heavy drones 1 medium and 1 light to use it completely but looking at how cruisers and above tend to have their drone bandwidth it just doesnt fit in properly a 25 module would be far better especially for battlecruisers a lot of battlecruisers have 25 50 and 75 if you increased these by 10 youd get some rather weird numbers if im in a drake and want to use medium drones i have to sacrifice 3 slots dedicated to these as well as a lowslot drone bay expander or even a rig slot and thatll give me 55 bandwidth a 25 version would help prevent a lot of strange numbered bandwidth as well as useless amounts left over you still need to field a drone bay expander so this wont be something ideal you put on every ship out therealso we already have a module that increases drone bay size its a low slot module that is similar to a cargo expander and should work the same way it severely limits what sort of ships can actually benefit from these increases to bandwidth but its a balancing act 10 modules would just make for wacky bandwidth while 5 and 25 are far more eventhese should not increase the drone bay by a percentage that works for cargo holds but for those you have any number of items that can be put inside for these it should be 25 and 50 because drones always come in sizes of 5 10 and 25 if you increase it by a pecentage you might come up with 175 which is half of a light drone

i always see this as part of a reply in a thread like this and as the full fledged carebear that i am  i as a player have no interest in pvp combat  i can tell you i am right there with you in saying not only no but hell no to a no pvp zone if i want to be totally safe i will play solitaire but there needs to be punishment for bad behavior transferable kill rights is a good thing as are some of the other ideas that have been put forward here and in other threads but just like the death penalty in wow  wife plays it  is minimal at best it is still greater then the punishment in eve for many criminal activities i want to see the punishment require a heck of a lot more time and effort to counter can flipping for example a minor change steal from someone elses can and you currently get flagged for the owner of the can instead how about a global flag more often then not the can flipper is looking to pew pew with someone why not others that like pew pew oh wait then the can flipper may have to fight with someone that can fight back bad idea we cant have thatsuicide gank someone the bad guy gets a security hit they pop into low sec  or 00  and rat a while and their standing is right back up there perhaps if the security changes  as it relates to concord and only concord  should be multiplied by the posted security level of the system  00 to 10  so no amount of ratting in 00 space will fix that security loss make the security hit  punishment  harder to counter and make it big enough to be punishment and not a wow style you feel bad for 10 minutes
see what happensi had originally meant for this to be about pvestoryline content a way to make eve more fun for the care bear populationbut you play word association with a care bear and they hear pirate and the posttraumatic kicks in and ideas for preventing harassment and terrorism spring forth
im a pirategrieferfaction warrior and love to can flip but im all for making the more peaceful side of eve more interesting the thing that draws me to the pvp side is the infinite variability and ability to match wits with others it would be more interesting if there was more to the carebear than mining and misisons which are just too repetitive for me maybe the ability for hostile take overs ability to build more customized items kind of akin to second lifeanything that adds a little more creativity and variability to the game is good for everyonecheers to you carebears from your biggest fans
agree there needs to be a nice expansion that provides things the builders miners scientist haulers etc be more appealing up front and provides tools farther down the roadan industrial character should have more than a few options open to them as a characterthe end goal of the industrial character shouldnt be a hulk freighter or rorqualas jade has said where are the converted freighters that are factory shipshow about truly mobile labs or being able to establish personal or corporate labs in npc stations where they establish an office  make it cost a bit more isk  so that the new corporations and players dont have to wait weeks for the big boys month long projects on titan  battleship bps to finish
stfu im tired of carebears crying you could givemars a in ocean with the ammount of tears you cry ccp gave carebears cloaks you dont need any thing else
i dont make approven of this hi my nam is adam i was to be make enter of this topics cos i wana see carebears fixd cos dum carebears gots it 2 good imo i mean where da fibbs is the risk in misiosn tradin buildin all dese carebers gets fat of isk cos they not los ships this is not balancewhere is honor of to be do play game with not be the risk where is honor in do play of npc and manufcuterthere no honorimoimo ccp shud boost pvp and piratin cos it men risk 4 carebears imo imo thye shud chang highsec so u can still kill peeps imothis would be honor keep your replies to a single post 8 consecutive posts of 1 line spam replies is not necessary navigator
giving my own thread the thumbs up
necromancy much
get the hell out of my thread cheese
well that explains that
it would be nice is ccp had a system to allow use to see that the bugs are reported and either in queue or assigned to a team for fixing them this visibility would help in reducing multiple reports of the same bug and allow us to see that ccp is actively engaged in working on some issuesin example the invention implants have been broken for over a year  is ccp even working on these is there a plan to compensate the people that have these nonworking implants if there was a central place to track issues them we would know that they were either being addressed or where to go to trade these back to ccpeven the most basic of project management software can output the basic items needed to easily post on a page and publish that would show the issues are being addressedit would allow for the basic principals of customer service to be met  they would show that they have listened to the customer and have taken their input to investigatecorrect the issue
this would go a long way towards alleviating frustrations in the subscriber base and increasing customer satisfacitonbest regardswindjammer
think about how many fewer bug reports would need to be looked at if we knew about the known issues and how many testers would be available if the reproduction steps for a bug were hard to figure outreproduce
sounds good to me
especially considering rkk has been doing so poorly in the taking over eve projecti vote to sack the ceo
sorryif you want your shares back you should payrefund those who have themother way to do it go broke close shop make rkk2big no
lets make a comparison to rl stock markets the company cannot forcefully recover the shares they have sold however another company can acquire enough shares on the open market to force a hostile takeover which once conditions are met does force the remaining shareholders to give up the shares they ownthere may be some merit in seeking better market options here but the op suggestion is not to my mind an acceptable one currently sidebar would eve need to create a takeover panel sec etc  piz
the presence of alts unfortunately marginalises the rl analogy for in eve all i would have to do is transfer my current shareholding  999 of the company  to my alt and claim a hostile takeoverthis idea whilst i look forward  one day  to eve having a fully functioning stock market is not one to complement that  it is as i said in the op as a mechanic to rectify mistakes made way back when by people not currently even in game anymorei certainly appreciate a response based on the facts cheers
so what youre saying is nerf forum idiots i agree heartily but i dont think thats really up to the csm to decide
the op needs to stop posting
the op has a pointit makes no sense for any individual empire to completely lack any sorts of counters for a particular strategy the enemy can employand the nanoissue is just one of the problems but the greatest one at this time so its overused as exampleps op  you forgot to support your own idea
i was mainly being a sarcastic arse by typing up this post and expected to have a lot of trolls come on and eat it up didnt get as many as i thought i would but still the problem solved itself those who understood what i was trying to say deserve recognition so thanks akita tand pssh you trolls need to l2troll
i dont think its about balance this is about lowering the barif you train off race for a specific ability and so on you get that ability as a return on your time investment there are no insta skills in this game nor should there beeve allows much more freedom that wow because in wow certain classes are trapped your huggin pilot is a huggin pilot and nothing else  eve allows players to be anything so long as they put the time in  if a player has recons 5 then he has recons 5 for any race cruiser he trains to 5 so you do get a bit of a freebie there minus weapons training of course  its not like you have to train minmatar recons or gallente recons on top of cruiser 5so no  also this system makes players realize how precious there time is and not wasting it on non essentials  all your really asking for is for ccp to lower the bar and effectively erase the time investments of many players to make life easier on a few too many people who buy chars all of a sudden find out omg if i want anything new i have to put in the effort  sorry train it like everybody else did 
again not the point im trying to convey which seems to be beyond your comprehension i guess ill try to dumb it down a bitevery race should have a counter to every other does that mean that every race needs a bonus to webbers to stop nano no but currently not every race has a viable means to take out another races primary strategy there needs to be a bit more balancing as far as some select areas gobut again this post wasnt made in all serious ness so let sleeping dogs lie
i am amarri want a nanoshipi train a hac and invent a setup that works for the application im attemptingthis is not a hard theory and ok fine i cant web from 40k or jam from 190k with my recons but i can erase your cap with a recon and you cant fact is with a bit of creativity and intuition you can configure a ship from any race to excel in any almost any role and if you want the extra recon hax abilities well its an investment in time to train for no support
i agree with the op each race should be complete in its own right when it comes to the ability to pvp train another ship if you need to fit role x should be validbut only within the same race it would be great especially with factional warfare seeing entire fleets of same race ships some races such as caldari have problems doing this effectively atm and bear looking at until then ill keep flying mostly matari
your trying very hard to make the point that you should have the counter to everything in one neat little package and that goes against the very fabric of the game  sorry  no even if we gave curses every recon bonus possible you would need to train the relevant ecm skills to employ them or should we do away with them toothe point people are trying to make is if you play one race then you have to learn to employ those strengths and compensate by tactis for the weaknesses 
i see your point but i do not agreethe issue is that once everybody has a viable counter to any situation then people will cry about the one that has the most effective one and you are again at the starting point just you wasted some game changes without effecti think there should be crossbred ships introduced like a shield tanking drone boat because caldari stole some gallente tech etc but that would make one hell of balancing them in the end and also remove the race distinction we have now
dude he said it was not a truly serious post so most of us citizens shrugged and moved on but damn apparently you have a point to make
have to disagree here the races are well balanced in my opinion not all races share the same advantages but the overall balance is fine the more standardised the game becomes the less dynamic pvp experience and the less vivd the gaming experience thumbs down
most people who have run a corp for a long time will have a sickening number of old votes in their sanctionable ened  actions that can only be likened to trying to open up your assets list after buying one item in every station in the gamewhile my ocd likes a little bit of vote history i dont need to know that i unlocked my rifter bpo in february 2006so my proposal has two possibilitiesthe ability to delete each old vote manuallya timebased autopurge
manual deletion im all for automatic deletion im against i like being able to look up my first war however old it may be
similar to my suggestion here so definitely gets my vote  manual deletion not auto 
hiim playing eve about 3 months already mostly missions and some mining recently i read the stuff about the functional war and the militia operations what bothers me it is the rewards of going to militia which i think it is not a real compensation on the inconvenient of traveling via other territories and exposing to hostile actions also  which kind of soldier is bring his personal weaponwhen going to the army   militia force should give the pilot a fully fitted ship including all the ammo he needs there should be a special army skils to fly an army ship which is u get them when u join militia  but u cant use then outside a reward system needs to take place like a weekly fee or other kind like lps or bigger standings raise this reward system need to be more clear for anyone who consider joining the army this way pilot who join the army will feel pride of serving and more will want to join btw  i heard some ware about a megathron navy issue   
no1 factional not functional2 militia  army3 the main rewards of the participating to militias is fun fun for sneaking by enemy in a crappy t1 ship completing the mission for the agent and getting the hell of there fun for blowing other stuff up because the purpose of the fw isa not to add more missions but to add a chance to pvp to those who are interested but at an easier lvl than mercs pirates and 00 and b to spread people from high sec space towards low sec space and 00  pvpers joins militia and fights traders brings items to the area builder makes items etc 
im down with rewards for fw but this thread is doing it wrongideas id supportoccupancy benefitsstations in system are claimed by occupying factionfaction losing occupancy doesnt get benefits from standings they normally would such as refine rates jumpclones etcfaction winning occupancy gets benefits such as refine rates jumpclones lowered repair costsmarket orders modifiedvictory points storesimiliar to lp store modified to be more geared to pvp modsimplantsaccept amarr tags gained in amarr plexsand any similiar nongame breaking mechanic to give a slight edge to an occupying force i might even go so far as to propose that certain pos modules be allowed for the occupying but i dont know if i want the nightmare that is jumpbridges coming to my lowsec in fact yeah no forget that all together keep 00 out of my counterstrike in space
the first part is a bug i think if im in fw and set the overview setting to show all in war with my militia but dont show neutrals than the overview is empty even if im swarmed by wartargetsi think thats a bug and need to be fixed but maybe that should be so than is a bad idea and should be changedthe second thing is the chats local or any otherit sux if u enter into a busy system like jita what is laggy too and than u need to scroll trough 600 peoples to get an info about if there are wartargets the list of players should be able to be sorted by statuses standings  and maybe in ideal case even filteredthird thing is the inbuilt scanner it takes the shipclasses if i set that should use overview setting but not the standing filters so that should be changed toosorry if i wrote not too clear my english is not the best so pls correct if u think so
personally local everywhere shouldnt be instantly populated  i mean the chat window not the actual local space on the overview settings bugs i fully agree in fact there are some combinations you cant have because it affects everything else even if their own box is ticked prime example  neutrals gates and stations if you dont want to see neutrals in overview then you wont see gates or stations eitherso you can turn off alliance corp and gang members from overview but then you may not see your wrecks on overview eitheri wish it could differentiate between ships and pilots properly for example i want to see neutral wrecks and wrecks owned by neutrals but i dont want to see neutral pilotsso far though weve been living with the foibles of the overview for so long id be surprised  pleasantly so  if they got it right next timeedit support your topic as well
i may despise xaen for the condescending manner in which he speaks about ccp but when it comes to the ui ill definitely take his side
faction ships are essentially named ships they are not superior to tech ii versions but are not inferior to tech i versions therefore the price of these should reflect a middlepoint between the two shipsas it is now there are various ships out there that are faction though adding at least faction battlecruisers would be a wonderful idea though before that is done it would be a good idea to lower the price of these ships to be more inline with their purpose named modules
i would endorse this but with the provision that ccp make contests to write or flesh out the eve universe by the players i dont mean that i can write how dirtee became galente president or how she killed the amarr solo in a navy comet  but select writtings could be used to fill in the gaps so long as they dont affect ccps major plans  there is a talented user base here that is a huge resource for creative material maybe even give players the option to write detailed origin stories for theyre chars and a database for them  like how dirtee girl once the quafe girl was replaced when video surfaced of her nvm
i agree and disagree agree learning skills are boring but contend that this is the equivilant of grinding any other mmo they have likely ever tried if they have an experiance of grinding relentless hours killing the same spawn over and over again to get the really cool weapon that drops 1 in 1000 tries then learning skills should not be a problem no matter what mmo i have personally played i always looked in aww of those experianced and older players whom have the coolest stuff hell i have been at this game for a year now and still surf the sell orders wondering how in the hell people have 30 bil to drop on a crappy tech 2 bpo to balance this void ccp has continued to raise the starting sp lvlkinda like a middle class tax cut so there is not a great casm of time between grinding lvl 1 missions and super passive fitting a drake over heating your tech 2 webber and watching a 12kms mach pilot cry life is not fair niether is eve get over it
how much are 60 day time cards going for at the minute
re replacing alternates  im happy for arithron to take my place if needed when i cant attend we seemed to have similar thoughts while campaigning personally id rather be involved but asking the csm to have a meeting in a bad time for everyone on the off chance i am needed is ridiculous the only reason i brought it up is as i am the 2nd alternate there is the possibility that 2 csms may know well in advance they cannot make a meeting and a suitable time for the meeting could be organized with that in mind
while i agree that locking threads that have already been answered would be a good idea im not so certain for ideas that have been taken up and rejected they are obviously issues of concern otherwise the issue thread wouldnt have been raised or received as much support as it did to come to the attention of the csm in the first placeideally what would be required would be a pair of new forums one locked down so that only ccpcsm could post in them  though anyone could read these posts  in this forum you would have the issues that the csm have agreed to pass onto ccp for discussionfor examplethread title  skill queue functionalitypost 1  csm template that was submitted to ccp for the issuepost 2  official ccp response to the issuethe second forum would also be restricted to csm for starting threads  like the announcement forum is restricted to ccp for thread starting  this would be where the issues that didnt make it past csm would go again there would be a standard template for thisfor examplethread title  large hull exploration vesselspost one  voting results explanation as to why issue was rejectedfrom here people would be able to address specific concerns the csm had about the issue and possibly with solid constructive arguements convince the csm to look at the issue againonce this was in place then youd be able to lock the original assembly hall thread with a link post to the new thread this would also make it easier to tie up duplicated issues as again a link to the relevant thread could be posted and the duplicate thread locked
you have in fact effectively stated what we asked for however the current forum software does not permit it thus we are stuck with what tools we have available to us currently for the foreseeable futureiz
two things one we already have such a forum  eve information portal right at the top can they not replicate that functionality two this is yet another reason we need real forum software see my sig  i was using phpbb boards before eve was in beta and a 14 year old forum admin with no coding experience could set up a limitedaccess forum on that without difficulty a multinational company employing hundreds of computer geeks has no excuse they should have used real forum software from day 1 and its opensource too so its not like itd cost them anything  but to have not changed it over since then is an embarrassment and its costing them functionality yet again
after reading the meeting chat its quite clear how jade is on a mission with only his alliance in mind he claims this about alliances in fwhe acts like rp alliances are lining up around the corner to get into fwhe presses to have this issue pushed to be fixed asap by ccp hes in his chair to play for his own alliance quite selfishno lets not wait for fw to work out the kinks lets get this done so he can join his alliance and pewpew noobsoh and to all the nano lovers out there check thisthey know ccp is going to do something looks like a nano nerf is already here

2 days later maybe they run in a different timezone up in iceland 
i thought about this last night as game time was 21xx  late night  and figured id give them this morning as it appears its now end of day wednesday in iceland anyone want to take odds on thursday or friday sigh
of which week
have you all looked in the csm meeting minutes on this site i have its not there but i wanted to make sure i was not missing something 
eurotrash is a term almost exclusively used by us conservatives you are probably very proud of your flavor of capitalism which is so exquisitely sound that your economy needs a daily injection average of 2 billion usd of foreign funds in order to avoid your sand castle to fall apart but you would have known that provided would you enjoy any experience about operating with decent amounts of  what automatically places you in the overcrowded realm of peeps who talk about societies money  politics yet are too poor to abstract themselves from any of these at any given time and dont have the means to try something else somewhere else even if they wished to for example your military budget is bigger than the military budgets of all other nations on earth combined yet your troops still intermittently lack services  gear a significant portion of this budget is allocated to rd projects which in the purest outsourcing tradition end in the wallet of the military industrial lobby and its plethora of privatelyowned businesses so you can get back to me trumpeting the virtues of your system the day you find out for yourself which is the  of combined direct  indirect taxes your people pays which directly contributes on short or medium term to your daily life quality fyi scheme like these are called indirect subventions so talk about socialism the post you refer to was deemed to explain that nowadays you can get a bullet in the head for peanuts as easy in the us as former wapa countries when it wasnt like that before since most individuals dont have the luxury to wander around with bodyguards or armored cars its the majority who suffers from precarious social conditions the difference between the systems under the perspective of individual physical integrity was that in wapa countries as long you didnt mess with politics you were safe unlike the us and other capitalist nations where it all boils down to being in the wrong spot at the wrong momentfunnily enough the country which enjoys the best ratio of wealth management vs population is switzerland a tiny country managing 33 of the worlds assets did you ever visit switzerland  its a nice country where citizens enjoy such a wide array of state benefits that from a us conservative perspective you could as well tag them as communistsget back to me the day your capabilities extend beyond the local kfc
the two csm forums need a sticky with clearcut stepbystep information on how to get an issue raised by the csmex make a post in the assembly hall with the topic containing issue and then what you want ex issue faster skill training of the test server now the forum goes wild and discusses the issue at the next csm meeting we go over all the issue posts and vote on how they show be prioritized so that we are ready to discuss them at the next meeting with ccp then we go to iceland for bree and discuss the issue with ccpsomething like that just how the process really is  
another sticky would also be one with all the meeting minutes
where is the mention of this issue in csm minutes  you said that it was brought to ccp did you lie to us did all the csm who said they will bring this issue to ccp lied to us or am i confusedi think that some explanation is in order
i realize manny of you think this is without merit at all but i feel this should be added alsobackstory inconsistencyscaner modification
noah  ccp  indicated that ccp was aware that battleships with jumpdrives would become the ultimate ship and to this end black ops ships were prenerfedandrew  csm jade constantine  noted that the range of the drive and the presence of cynojammers made the jumpdrive capability virtually useless another problem is the limited amount of fuel that can be carriedbane  csm bane glorioius  added to this that due to the fuel taking up large amounts of cargo space loot from successful operations often cannot be hauled back to friendly territorynoah  ccp  commented that a fuel bay can be added so that fuel no longer takes up cargo space or that specialized haulers could perhaps be used to haul the loot back or bring in supplies ccp will also look at the issue with cynojammers jump range might be looked into but is of a lower concern otherwise black ops ships might become too competitive with capital ships
if covert ops cynos could be lit in cyno jammed systems then the black ops could have a role they are supposed to be the ships that can jump in behind enemy lines but cannot right now
i concur as long as the new fuel bay idea doesnt allow too many ships to bridge in one black ops should not be able to bring in enough ships to drop the system it should require a group
shouldnt we be looking at using less capitalsim all for people using 800 million isk ships with less tank and firepower than a real battleship what exactly is the problem
and the cyno jammer would still not allow normal jump ships to enter thus protecting from total invasion and yes limit the number of covert ships that can bridge in either via fuel or just a set number
just a thought but if you include a fuel bay why not have one type of fuel personal jumping and another type for bridging it would mean having to manage your fuel rather than just filling it
to expand on this part with the loot recollection issue i recommended that deep space transports  eg impel mastodon etc  be able to use the covert jump bridge specifically and not blockade runners deep space transports are generally underused and blockade runners dont really need any more help when it comes to evading people wasnt originally my idea though
i thought it was a great idea though  deep space transports being covert jump bridgeable via black ops would absolutely rock
agreed this would give those ships a role much like the kc135 tanker in use today by many militaries
having recently spent some time on singularity to get a feel for blackops i strongly support taking a look at them the cargo space is a problem if you are not using a sin  or redeemer  due to having to carry ammocap booster charges isotopes and loot a slight increase in fuel bay size andor making deep space transports indeed capable of using the portal should be looked at as well concerning allowing covert cynos in cynojammed systems  i cannot decide on the one hand a cynojammed system should in my opinion favour the resident  defending  alliance and bridging in 30 falcons before the fleet jumps into the defenders camp could make it a bit too easynot an easy balancing task i look forward to seeing black ops being more attractive for sure
im absolutely in favour of both the seperate fuel bay and the covert cyno change the fuel bay is self explanitory but as someone has already said the black ops is supposed to be a ship capable of jumping behind enemy lines but with the proliferation of cyno jammers its nearly useless plus people are unwilling to train the cynosural field training still to 5 atm because it offers no real tangable benefits that are worth the skill training timeif you simply make it so cyno jammers do not affect covert generators then you have given black ops a new lease of life you then have the ability to move ships behind enemy lines but you are still unable to move ships capable of affecting sovereignty into the system
how exactly is someone meant to fly a black ops even if it has fuel bay while it sounds good and anything that improves the cargo capacity of my hauler redeemer is a positive i still cannot conceive why i would want to fly a black ops in1 large scale warfare2 mid sized romaing gangs3 small scale hit and runs etcthe fundamental issues with black ops is that you got a droneship a ew boat a laserboat that lacks cap to mwd out of a large bubble etc its too spread a random mix that its best to redesign these ships with a pvp role in mind and not some theoretical stuff that sounds good on paper but in reality nobody will usegive these ships a proper real world role that actually encorages people to use them in pvp
this
im positive about these as i think the widow looks like sex on a sticki fully agree that the all singing all dancing pwnmobile is not what anyone wants id still like to see a ship that isnt just outclassed by a t1 equivalent though thats a bit depressing not sure what the fix is  id settle for some scan res though i like the idea of improved jumpingjumpbridging capability as an aside how about actually allowing covops cynos in highsec
this is a wonderful idea simple opens the game to stealth missions deep into enemy territory and gives carebears another way to actively help with tactical issues
i fully support the inclusion of one of the two types of transport being able to be covops cynoedlogically it should be the blockade runner one of the arguments against the normal dst being that the cargo bay you can get on one of those is extreme and may render a black ops squadron as a whole over poweredon the flip side a dst being zipped around by a black ops would really bring new meaning to combat logistics
the fuel bay and deep space transports using black ops jbs is an excellent idea and would solve 90 of this issuewe should change this discussion to verifing that exploits of this mechanic are not currently in someones mindme points at bane and his goon cohorts
will be raising this on sunday 13th
when you do  we need a tug class shipwhy worry about cargo when you can just push the things through space the amount of mass you can move could be dependant on skill level where each level is equivalent about 100000000 kg or roughly one average bs
noah  ccp  indicated ccpUFFFDs awareness of the player frustrations with the 6 hour duration skill trainings however ccp strongly believes that switching skill training is an activity that encourages players to log into the game and play a skill queue would be a possible solution if there would be limitations such as a limited amount of skills being trained or that only skills of a total up to a certain duration can be stacked into the queuealex  csm bane glorious  noted that players have also suggested a dual training mechanic where players can pick a primary and secondary skill which both train at half speed as soon as the skill with the shortest duration is finished the other skill will train at full speedit was concluded that ccp will look into a solution for this issue
i really have to object to the notion that having to change skill training encourages people to play it encourages them to log in sure but only to change their skill people play but only because they want to play not because they have to switch a skill training giving us a shallow queue  12 extra items  at least solves the problem awkwardly timed skills whilst still not giving many people the ability to just set up their skills and leave the game for months
i agree if ccp want to pad their server load graphs go right ahead but if im playing eve its regardless of whether ive got a skill finishing spending 30 seconds logged in in a station really doesnt count as play does it
single most inexplicably missing feature in evei can only speak for myself but forcing me to log in to switch skills does not encourage me to play if i need to switch skills i do it then i go about my business alternatively i train long skills when i dont have a choice trying to force me to play by making me log in to continue character development only infuriates me my real life outside the game should dictate when i play not the game itself such a stance is misguided at best but just presumptuous reallyi do not like the dual training mechanic idea i want the fast ones to finish fast not slightly more slowly it would make planning skills nightmarish i dont even see a reason for limiting the length of the queue either based on time or number of skills there are use cases that prove either limitation would defeat the purpose of a queueand i dont buy the character farmer argument they can already farm characters without a queue its like banning automatic transmissions in cars because it allows people to shoot pedestrians out the window because it frees up one of their hands technically its sound reasoning but it punishes 9999 of people  legitimate players  for the potential crimes of a tiny number the greater good should win out
it would be a nice feature to have
ok sorry to be rude but i am failing to understand what was achieved by csmcpp reunion here its a simple problem not requiring heavy balancing andor heavy programming  i think  we knew why ccp was hesitant and they knew why its an important  even if purely practical  issue for the players from the dozens of pages of forum discussions and they are supposed to be working on it for years  it was in an official todo list somewhere a  long  while back iirc and what do we have a summary of those years of discussion and that they will look into the issue with a moderate priority huh yay great thats a real leap forward taking precautions on important issues impacting the balance of the whole game is a good thing but here i was hoping for the csm to have a bit more decisive answers at least for some of them  rant sorry p 
yes i agree with much of what has been said here especially the above this subject has been talked about all the years i have known about eve and is one of the things that has bugged me an aweful lot i have always thought this could be a problem that it would be abused as people could sign up set a long queue then leave the game thus training long skills for free however as said the 6 hour skills7hours are annoying to say the least i liked the idea that you could chain a skill eg have two skills one after another never thought too much about having more than 2 as that would be overkill for long skills  but i also like the time limit idea so why not mix it eg two skills chained to a certain time limit instead of just a set amount of skill time to build to it would still mean that you have tp tactfully think about time and just a personal note i do agree with the point that skills arent only what make me play eve but it is useful as a reminder to get me in game sometimes i go in game only for a skill and it so happens that something is happenign and im glad i logged in for the skills which im sure many will find has happened whether they would like to believe it or notdaks
i like that partno comment on the first i cant feel it affect me much in any way just set a longer if you cant logget too stressed about it and do the shorter while youre ingame but thats just my thought on the matteras the second case itd make a nice feature dont feel its necessary but itd be nice to have sounds like a solid solution to the first example as well
some great arguments above which i agree with a skill queue would not have the adverse affects you think it might ccp it might actually mean more people making alts since training small skills would be less of a chore hell i would start a new character but the thing putting me off is the amount of time required to change all those stupid small skills i just cant be bothered with it
ccp needs to rethink the way they do things if they make changes that encourage more logging in as the above users have said a forced skill change doesnt encourage gameplay it encourages late nights waking in the middle of the night missing study time and the likes its long past since i bothered changing skills the second they finished but i know a lot of people still dologging in for the trivial task of changing a skill is a negative for ccp in many ways  its a nuisance for their customers it takes completely unnecessary server load during peak periods it can cause delays for people wanting to playnow i have not really been a major supporter of the ability to queue skills the real reason i believe ccp dont want this feature is because it promotes people taking extended periods without subscription whilst their training progresses thereby has a negative impact on incomei would propose that queued skilling come into play however on the condition that skill points only accrue when an account is active if your account isnt subscribed you shouldnt be learning its a pretty fair compromise imo
i do not support a skill queuei stand by the idea that players who are willing to take the time to micromanage their training should have a benefit over those players who do not sure you might lose out on a few hours of training if you choose to sleep instead of changing your skill at 1 am but where does that logic stop should players who choose to sleep get isk deposited into their account because other players got to ratmission all nightit might seem like an extreme example but it follows the same logic of getting something for nothingthumbs down
yeah of course it is yes i fully agree with thatwhatever in fact length of one extra skill would be enough for example 6 hour skill  38 day skill this would solve most of the problemsfair solution great i like that and want to encourage this specific ideafinally thank you very much
true just quit my third account because micromanaging all those annoying short skills to get her able to do some work for me in a few months was such a  in the 
the lack of a skill queue is very very frustrating and fixing this glaring omission should be ccps highest priorityi dont want to live my life around eve i have 1001 other things to do in real life and just logging on to change a skill is just silly i know that a lot of people live for eve i dont faction warfare is wonderful in that i get to play pvp pretty much on demand the lack of queue spoils that enjoymentit disrupts corp life  the oh hai i cant talk or join an op i am just changing a skill syndrome  as welljust give me the ability to drag a skill to a queue let me queue up a dozen or so skills
the skill queue was presented with people who work 8hour a day jobs who have many 46 hour skills to train in mind not people who vend altsalso the skill queue description in the op isnt entirely accurate of what i recommended but its close enough
if there is a skill queue something needs to be done to prevent people from doing something like the following1  create alt and pay for one month2  set indemand long skills3  stop paying4  sell new hac pilot for 1 bil in the character bazaari see several options to prevent this skill queue becomes inactive if the account is not paid for  only the current skill will continue training  queue cannot be larger than 12 skills total skill training time cannot be longer than n days  7 maybe a combination of all of these is perhaps best
i support the idea of a limited queue something like being able to add skills to it while the current queue length is still under a certain amount to a specific maximum depth  2 or 3 skills 
yes to dual training or skill queue of 1 skill deep no more deactivate dualtrainskill queue when account becomes inactive
which is what i prefer as well one is enough two would possibly be already too much and would encourage farming maybe also limit the first skill to be no longer than 24 hours yay
solution only apply the skill queue if the account subscription is active if it is inactive the queue doesnt apply but the currently training skill continues to train until it reaches the level it was training towards
it shouldnt be that difficult to implement a queue that gives a minimum completion time of 12h10 if current skill queue  12h permit adding another skill20 goto 10this will prevent people from setting dread v  carrier v and then leave the account disabled for half a year
my preferred suggestion is a skill that adds some number of hours 624 depending on how good you want it to be  of queue length per level you can stick whatever you like in a queue but itll only let you train off it for maybe a couple days before it stops also make it so that it can train new level 1 skills if the book is sitting in your hangar or cargo as of when the previous skill finishes and if its not itll skip it and go down the list to the first one it can train  gives you the ability to put together a raft of short skills or one long one without having to be awake at any given time of day and without causing any real issues with unpaid training because really an extra couple days is hardly gamebreaking when the usual length of an offline skill is 2040  also make sure the queue timer is included in the api data so that people dont forget it on evemon but other than that itll pretty much take care of itself im for any kind of reasonable limitedlength queue but the above is my preferred variant
here is a solutionif players are only able to queue up skills based on an amount of time allotted by their attributes then players would be able to set limited skill queues to prevent time wastage while still requiring players to log in reasonably close to the last skills finishing time for each attribute the player gets 1 hour of queue time when the player is setting up their queue the primary attribute costs as much allotted time as the skills current duration to finish and secondary costs half as much as the duration to finish there must be at least enough time allotted to cover the duration of the current skill before the next skill may be started in the queue by using this method the player may queue a skill to train that is a higher level of the current skill the drawback is that the player is unable to have a 30day skill automatically switch over to the next skill until their allotted time exceeds the current time remaininghere is an example of how it works  the following skill numbers are not exact or even ballpark it is just an example  suppose the player has an attribute line of 20 across the board that means that they have 20 hours allotted to each attribute the total max allotted time is 100 hours which splits to 666 hours spent on primary attribute in the skill training and the 333 hours taken up by the secondary attribute giving an true maximum of 666 hours allotted to the queue the player wants to train gunnery  perception  willpower  skill a few levels the first level takes 30 minutes the second level takes 2 hours the third takes 8 hours and the fourth takes 18 hours the player also wants to do the same with leadership  charisma  willpower  the player then chooses to train drones  memory  perception  which is at level 3 alreadygunnerylevel 0  level 1  30 minutes  reduces perception to 1930 and willpower to 1945level 1  level 2  2 hours  reduces perception to 1730 and willpower to 1845level 2  level 3  8 hours  reduces perception to 930 and willpower to 1445since level 3  level 4 would go beyond the allotted time it cannot be queued charismalevel 0  level 1  30 minutes  reduces charisma to 1930 and willpower to 1430level 1  level 2  2 hours  reduces charisma to 1730 and willpower to 1330level 2  level 3  8 hours  reduces charisma to 930 and willpower to 730droneslevel 3  level 4  18 hours  reduces memory to 200 and perception to 030the player currently has 39 out of a possible 666 hours of skills in the queue at this point the player has the following time still allotted for the queueintelligence  20 hoursperception  30 minutescharisma  930willpower  730 memory  2 hoursi believe that this is the solution that is fair and would give players enough time to keep skills constantly training without any lost time if a players pod is destroyed the player wants to insert or remove an implant or the players account has expired their queue is eliminated automatically otherwise the player may edit or clear their queue at any timealso in the case of learning skills they do not reduce the estimated queue time for skills set after them but will automatically begin affecting them after the learning skill has completed as for the way to set up the menu i leave that to you i envision something that looks like an objectoriented programming window where skills can be dragged and dropped or even a list to that extent i would be more than happy to provide more suggestions for how to set this upit may seem like alot of math and calculations and trouble for the player but alot of it can be solved by the layout and information provided by the interface for the skill queueanyhow i hope this idea seems fair and appealing to all thank you for reading
interesting suggestion but way too complex imo keep it as simple as you can  theres no need for skill queuing to turn into a minigame
i also agree that these bizarre time limit math problems are too much extraits as simple as  current skill  and  queued skill current skill could be training a skillbook from 0 to 1 queue is from 1 to 2 then youre set for about 20mincurrent from 1 to 2 queue from 2 to 3 set for about an hour or soall of these will slowly advance you in simple processes which would have otherwise required you to play the game for about 10 seconds worth of switchingorcurrent is spaceship command 4 to 5 queued is racial industrial 4 to 5 youre set for a couple weeks at least during which time you can take a care free vacation without having to hunt down wifi on the beach when you return youre just a few minutes away from climbing into a freightera skill queue scares too many people because they believe you could create an entirely new character supply them with the books and return a year later to find a titan pilot trained to 5it doesnt need to be any more complex than 1 skill following 1 skill sure if a player happens to chain another skill a few days later theyve only played the game for 10 seconds just like we are now
im quoting the lot as i happen to agree ad verbatimid like to stress this bit though now i have not really been a major supporter of the ability to queue skillsbut ive also ended up with its long past since i bothered changing skills the second they finishedso im starting to lean towards beeing pro queue skill  never thought the day would come it should however be kept really simpleno more than 2 days in the skill queue  ie last skill in the queue has to start before that  regardless how long that skill takes to finish itself if you cant be assed to log in at least every 2 days well then you dont care enough abotu your sps in the first place2 days should be plenty to get around those pesky odd hour skills and leave a day of for a party or whatever and then some to spareno more is needed
we will have to agree to disagree im afraidas mentioned im originally against a skill queue however ive been convinced otherwise due to the odd hour skillshaving to get up in the middle of the night or similar to not lose skillpoints is kind of silly  is silly because people will actually do it  and its not a healthy thing but thats also the only thing that has convinced me to change my mind on having a skill queue or not  and ive then added a bit of extra time in my proposal for good meassurebut if you cant play the game for extended periods of time due to military or illness or vacation or otherwise then im sorry for you but i as ccp believe in logging in regularly to play the game or youre out of luck  sp wise  even if its just to change a skillwe obviously disagree on this fair enough no harm
as said above a simple 1  skill in training 2  skill in queueall training stops when a subscription is inactive i love to login when i feel like playing i hate to have to login because i need to change a skill i also hate that my current skill will run its course about 1 minute after down time starts so i will have another partially trained skill waiting for the time when i can spare the time to finish it where if i had a skill queue i could set up the next skill to start when the current skill completes
yes yes yeseven a 12 hour 1 skill que would be a huge boost allowing players a small window to log in and que up a second skill really helps people like myself who work 12 hour shifts  with 3 hours commuting on top of that  nothing is more frustrating then setting up a skill to finish in the morning before work waking up and finding that eve is unexpectedly down trying for 45 minutes or so helpless waiting for the server to come up  but it doesnt and knowing im losing 15 hours of training through no fault of my own please implement some improvement
i have to say this would be quite nice this way i wont have to guess if ill be up in time to change skills if i want to get a ten hour or so skill done during the night or i can have a two week skill queued up behind my normal skill just in case  this would have been very useful to me recently when i unexpectly had a hospital stay and wasnt able to set long skills beforehand having to stay in the hospital for a while isnt fun but knowing all the time youre in there that youre losing a week of skill training time on each account is just plain annoying
agreed just a 1 deep queue to protect against power outages  server crashes  stuck at the office  etc thanks
wow so the csm managed to confirm that a issue that is on the drawingboard  
ccp is aware that there are no drone implants the reason behind this is that there are only a few skills available to drone users and that implants are often tied to skills due to the demand they will look into this and are likely to implement these implants in the future
this is good news in particular please pay attention to the drone mining issueone thing frequently forgotten in calculations about drone mining yield is the waste factor when mining the heavier ores due to the size limits on the drone capacity and the large size of the ores youre not getting a yield which fills the drone capacity i know that partial mines are not possible but please look at the yields when you evaluate implants and see if there can be a way to fill a mining drones capacity
since most other implants serve to increase specifics related to the moduleweapon used i hope that drone implants are treated the samedrones have damage tracking speed durability and range implants that address those criteria would be a welcome addition to the gametoo long have drone lovers had to sit by while their laserhybridmissle loving counterparts are provided with implants to increase their chosen weapons abilities along with numerous modules that add additional increases as wellthe very few dronerelated modules that are available were a great start to showing the love to drone usersthe only real imbalance if it can even be called that between drones and all other forms of weaponry is the lack of drone related implantswhen the nerfbat was used to limit the number of drones fielded at any time it was proported to be due to lag issues now that we are basically restricted to 5 at a time hopefully the lag issues have either been addressed as fully as possible through drone reasoning or some other target for the nerfbat is being identifiedmy 2 cents
very much agreed but i think you forgot to tick the support boxthe implants are not skill based wrangler have you looked at the implants for other thingsthey in crease all missile damage or all turret firing rate or heavy missile damage or all missile rangewhy arent there drone equivalents like increase the damage of all drones increase the hitpoints of all drones increase the damage of light drones increase the damage of medium drones increase the ewar strength of dronesthere are direct parallels to drones from the other weapon systems more drone mods should be high slot mods except for the mining drones theyre weapon systems
warhead upgrades rapid firing heavy missiles and missile bombardment
drone interfacing combat drone operation scout drone operationor did you have a point
you said the implants werent skillbased i pointed out that most implants directly replicate the function of a skill i think wranglers comment was silly because there clearly are drone skills but your comment was even less accurate and im hardly opposed to drone implants  i fly domis and ishtars among others  and posted a comment of some length in the original thread on this topic i wasnt attacking your point just your comment
this is good news i wish the csm would have presented the drone module idea as well though as it would have tied in nicely with the implants and would have been important in considering balancing issues
hii personal think u should improve the drone baylike adding drone racks to the game which can be placed inside the drone baydrone racks should have bonuses like implants  increasing dmg or autorepair increasing range etc the actually size of drone bays would limited there useso u can setup these drone racks with your personal favourite drones inside stations and set a name   this would help sorting it before u scroll down a long list of drones inside space and simply helpfull to organise the market would have some new items which will be needed and needs to be replaced  i personal loose more ships then implant clones against overpowering the gallente droneships u should add penaltys in using themsome thoughts on itbreg mac
in my opinion faction equipment of all types are needed for drone users faction drones are still almost impossible to get compared to other faction equipment there are no faction drone mods and no faction drone ships and with the nerf bat beating the eos to death unless you fly a 30man falcon fleet  the only 2 ships worth getting are the ishtar or dom
removing 30d time cards is acceptable from the standpoint that some users were playing the game without paying for it by setting their longer  30d  skills and not paying for that monthhowever the price increase is affecting all of us quite adversely it is extremely difficult to make the isk necessary to play this game now meaning a good amount of the player base is being left outthis is not acceptable ccp

hi i only just started selling time codes when they announced that it was going to change and i pay by cc so i was not affectedi agree that these changes sucked but from various posts i have read ccp will not be changing there mindi cant find the post but there was a dev comment about this issue selling time codes does not make them money in the long run they sell them in bulk to the other websites that sell gtcs at a discount so they dont make money and as a business that is not a good thingas a business you have to make a profit to be able to run things need to pay for electricity wages development software security costs etc etc i am sure if a dev posted the actual cost to run eve online for a year most whiners would think again about complainingfrom what i read in the other post unlike every other mmo in existence we are the only ones to get two free expansions a year so that is a extra UFFFD20UFFFD30 quid in our pockets every 6mths i believe the cost to develop each expansion is over UFFFD10 milliondont forget ccp is a business and they are in the business to make UFFFDUFFFDUFFFD keeping us happy is only needed to keep it rolling inraise prices for 30 days is fine with me if thet are bought back

noah  ccp  believes that the current wardec system amounts to a paytogrief system and that ccp is interested in making war declarations deeper by adding mechanics such as victory conditions that would eventually end wars valentijn  csm dierdra vaal  commented that under the current system the defender has no control over the war and the attacker can keep it up indefinitely as long as they keep paying the bills he also observed that there currently is no determined end goal to the war itselfmatt  ccp  stated that wardecs are necessary so corporations can attack each otherUFFFDs logistic chains in empire but that there are often wars started without reason simply to get random victims to gank and grief the system should be balanced so that the first aspect is not hindered while the second aspect is deterredeva  csm ankhesentapemkah  said that in any mmo players should be allowed to group and organize in relative safety while in eve this is deterred as grouping up makes you a target to attack there is no safe way for players to get started in small scale groups this way sean  csm darius johnson  suggested that it might be an option to scale consequences based on the sizes of the warring corporationsvarious csm members suggested to allow corporations to auction off the war to mercenaries who would from that point on participate in the war ccp understands that the current system needs work and thinks that involving mercenaries shows promise no solid solution has been come up with but the issue is on the agenda
i especially like the idea of auctioning off war decs to allow mercs participation without fronting the bill it will certainly make things interesting in high sec
i do hope auctioning off wardecs to mercs means an auction system where mercs can outbid each other and not that a target corp can actually get rid of their war dec by selling it to a merc because that would be insanely stupid
well the wording suggests mercs to participate not get rid of the war
i agree that wardecs are currently pay to grief but eve shouldnt have any areas that are 100 safe even in 10 there should be at least some risk
definitely support more complexity in the war dec mechanic than the current pay to grief mechanism as described
i think this will create more pvp in high sec not less and you will still be allowed to grief just be prepared to have your wardecs auctioned off to willing merc participants i wouldnt expect griefers to like this but then again its not like they care on whether their targets are being griefed either so they really have no moral authority in this case
i definitely like the idea of war decs to have an end scenario where the entity declaring war has to make a choice as to what situation constitutes a victory for them possibly making the total cost of ship losses and mods a strategic goalfor example corp a declares war on corp b corp a decides a monetary value of loss they would need to obtain thru corp b to declare victory corp b can pay some of that thru isk transfers or simply lose their ships which get added into the sum corp a has an x amount of cost per week for war based on  1  how big corp b is and  2  how much isk loss value they are declaring for victory corp a gains war victory points with every successful war won and they lose victory points if corp b reaches the isk loss total first or corp a stops paying for the war victory points are based on how much isk you are demanding corp b to lose or pay of course ill leave ccp to work out the kinks
this might help to discourage large established corps wardecing new small corpsmake the cost of declaring war proportionate to the difference in size and age of corp ie large corp a  150 members  declares war on small corp b 15 members corp as wardec costs are multiplied by 15015  10where the corp declaring war has the same number of members or less then no multiplier is appliedan additional multiplier could be applied to do with the difference in the amount of time the corps have been in existence ie corp a  established for 24 months  declares war on corp b  established for 5 months  will incur an additional wardec cost of 245  48this is a very rough draft and i know this would be complicated by the fact that you could avoid this penalty simply by setting up a new corp every 6 months but it might go some way to protecting small new corps
i agree that the mechanic needs to be looked at people who wish to lolgank need to be more restricted to lowsec
after months of work and losing it all dont you lose player base as they quit the game
if you can draft out a series of scenarios that woul be used for warterms than this will have my full support
interesting thought i agree with you mostly because i think that it is too easy to grief new players and make this game unattractive to themquestion is what can ccp do to avoid this bad situation i have to be honest not the slightest idea
do this you solve anythingall corps need to have a pos at least as command center otherwise they cannot declare war  but can be war declared  if the command center get destroyed the coproration is automatically disbanded and all the players involved cannot join another corporation for 1 monthexplanationthe true problem is that all empire war are guerrilia war where attacker pick up random targets just for fun and threat the weaker when they want just for fun if they have to defend a pos  that they have also to keep secret  things change and no more grief wars because pos cannot be logged out and cannot hide forever if odds come
what about corps who cannot maintain a pos andor just meant as holding corps for larger alliances
i sense he was being a bit facetiousbut lets not make pos more of a bottleneck in eve than they already are
i like the idea of having a command center but i dont think it needs to be a pos it needs a lower barrier of entry
command center tower may have it fuel requirement halved or even 13 of the normal price the point is to give a target to the defender instead of be vigilant forever  impossible for an industrial corp or research corp in this way griefer can still decalre all the wars they want but if they cannot defend or maintain concealed theiur command center they will be ed up no more kill for grief you will have to declare war if you truly need itan alliance can declare up to 5 command centers for example so alliance war will not be a command center searching just some ideas anywayedited and yes if command center is in high sec it can be only small tower and cannot be armed or very low armed just because dreads cannot come in high sec
the problems that exists in the wardec system now are1 wardecs are used for larger corps to grief smaller corps2 the wardec system really goes against the eve security system that is in place when you are wardecced 10 is not even relatively safe if youre a highsec industrial corp  for example 3 wardecs are endless war just rages on foreverthese are the specific issues in the wardec system i would like to see the csm look at
very pleased to see this on the agenda safety is a tough issue in eve and one i regularly argue about on the forums when people start talking about forcing people out of npc corpsthis to me hits the nail on the head there should be no guaranteed safety ever in eve but theres nothing wrong with some safety whilst still being in a corporation and plenty wrong with the current system where rich bored experienced players can just permanently wardec and roll over new corps trying to make a start in evemmos function best when its a carrot that gets you into content not a stick people should want to be part of corporations and feel theyre going to get something useful out of itthe favourite line trotted out when this issue comes up is that a bunch of new players shouldnt stick together they should form up with older players there is much wisdom in this sort of synergy as i have observed in the amarr militia with new and old thrown together  even if it flies a little in the face of some of ccps statements about old vs new  unfortunately its still not very feasiblei for one wouldnt join a corporation unless i knew the people involved felt i could trust them and had fleeted or fought withagainst them at least once how do you get npccorp members to do that the most popular form of new startup corp that i know of is a bunch of npccorp members that all start around the same time grow together and decide to start out on their own inevitably quite a few die off after one or two wardecs from griefer corpsfor this reason alone i applaud the factional warfare initiative because it is throwing new players together with old in a way that never occurred before however it doesnt address those for whom pvp is not the first goal in eve  industry mining research and so on all are vital parts without which pvp is not possiblefor that reason i support the notion that the new startup corps without older player aid ought to get a decent chance to grow whilst not being immune to the harsh realities of eve changing wardecs to have limited scope or goals in some way may well be a good way of doing things
i wish there was something to support here but there is no proposal being made im pleased that ccp is aware of a problem i thought them resigned to im pleased with the observations and comments by members of ccp and the csm though some of them are vague and as written open to a variety of interpretationsim not sure why this is in the assembly hall section of the csm forums its more of an announcement as its apparently already on the agendabest regardswindjammer
if implemented it would need refinement but wow very interesting and i can envision indytype corps rallying up for a fight to end the war it gives them a wellworth reason to fight other than just to survive another day of grief i would love it if ccp considered your idea
i kinda agree with this type of method of figuring out a war dec cost also why not have some reprecussions for not reaching your war goalso lets say ccp has a preset list to choose from for your war goal each item on the list has a preset time limit on it along with the goal so only way to end the war is obtain the goal before the time is up or reach the time limit preestablished on the initial contractput a 3 month or 6 month timer after war is complete where they cant be war decd by the exact same corpallianceas far as the reprecussions of not meeting your war goal impose a 100 fine of the contract price upon a failed war dec so if you pay 150mil for the contract you owe 300mil more on a unsuccessful war dec  make the 300mil a deposit when contract is signed so its paid upfront so if failed no isk back if successful you get the isk backnumbers arent solid numbers but these are just some suggestionskhonn
how about this in terms of win or loss  look at war like a business gamblelets assume that we have ways of establishing victorywith that done  turn war into more of a business if a wardec fees were put into a virtual escrow then if the aggressor fails to achieve his goals then why not give a small portion of that wardec fee to the target of the wardec
depends on what youre after though the precise terms would have to be worked out plenty of those who grief are just after a fight because theyre bored  an industrial corp selling the wardec to a merc in that case gives them exactly what theyre afterby comparison a wardec used the way it was intended as corpcorp wars over resources or territory or that sort of important thing on an industrial corp well you definitely dont want them getting rid of itperhaps what is needed are classes of wardecs  cheap ones that the wardecee can sell off and so negate the war and expensive ones where you really mean it and though the other side can auction mercs and so on they are equally committedwhatever is there can still be abused if you have enough money and the only determining factor is money so i still think the notion of declaring war for a goal and a time rather than just two sides declaring each other targets for a week is importantfor example a war could have numerous conditions that the declarer can pick fromnumber of combatants killed  rack up enough kills and the war automatically endsisk damage inflicted  you want to make a financial pointpos destruction  you want that highsec locationsystem clearance  you want them out of that systemwhichever you pick there should be equally ways for the opposing side to end the war by achieving equivalent objectives  thus encouraging them to step up and do something as wellmatching unequal corps is a difficult one a 200person experienced corp wardeccing a 20person new corp needs to be discouraged the cost of the wardec could skew according to total corp sp for example on active players  undocked within the last week etc im just throwing ideas out theyre not meant to be definitive answersedit the above notions of escrow and command centers are quite intriguing too corps already have an unassailable headquarters perhaps if they are required to have an assailable one to engage in war that could make things more interesting
another random idea  if there is one thing that puts new players off engaging in pvp its losing their implantsso if you want a cheaper wardec you can opt to declare it but no podding that way the new players are encouraged even before the harsher world of factional warfare to get out there and fight in a slightly more sanitised way podding results in concord and loss of insurance and usual penalties to make the point sticksure you can still have wars that involve podding but theyll cost more im just thinking of ways to get new players into pvp and corps as early as possible without pushing them down that steep learning curve before theyre readyi think there are loads of options to enable the sort of highsec slightly sanitised warfare that gets both sides fighting instead of hiding in npc corps or playing docking games
here is a system i thought over a few days ago if you have questions feel free to askfixing wardecs in features and ideas discussion
just a thought all corporations have an area of operation  aoo  that they usually all stick to as obviously corporations band together into solar systems where the corporations hq andor office s  are resided this goes for pvp industrialist and mission running corporationsso why not have tactical rally points  trp  in and between these aoos of the two or more warring corporations like boarders where the players engage each other using the command posts as these trp for both a point of defence and a point to attack from example attacking force first has to assemble at theyre command post team up and take flagmust be present at command post so that only those at the command post can be in the attacking fleet others will then have to patrol boarders or defend theyre command post s  and then they will be able to engage the defending forces command post upon occupation of the defenders command post the flag bearer must then hold the position for a certain amount of time once the time elapses the command post changes hands into the attacking forcecommand posts could be in deadspace zonesalso the size of the corporations participating in the war could determine the size of the aoo and the number of trps for each sidethanks beani kliadi
as a merc i do believe that the current system needs to change 3 major concerns come to mind1 voting 48 hours is some times too long for the defending corp to wait voting needs to be changed so that when all the shares are accounted for the vote ends2 as far as the merc bids i think it would be a good idea but how would mercs find out about a job maybe the contract system all in all i dont believe this to easy to implement or be useful a better solution would be a ccp endorsed mercenary channel where mercs and contractees can find each other the only problem with this is mercs finding out other merc jobs and maybe going for the other side and other such back door deals but i think those can be handled on the player side3 victory conditions and command posts both great ideas major points involved to those who suggested it but i have questions a could victory conditions be added upon for example i have a contract to do 2 billion isk in damages to corp a corp b informs me that corp a also has a pos that they want taken down also would it be possible to change those victory conditions b command posts fuel requirements as a combat corp i dont really have haulers and industry guys so how would fund this basically your telling combat corps that they need to pay more to have the ability to declare war i dont like thinking about that mercs are not the most well paid individuals so either no fuel requirements or plan c c i propose a different solution that could be considered fair to all sides corp a attacks corp b corp a has whatever victory condition corp b being a small corp is unable to match the numbers or firepower of corp a corp b camps corp as headquarters andor offices hq would be worth 2 points offices 1 for every hour camped corp b would acquire 1 or 2 points but for every  figuring out what would be fair 2 3 4 or 6 hour intervals  interval they would lose a point the objective would be say 24    points to be fair i think that to avoid the obvious counter of having a 00 hq and no offices the command post idea could come into play corp a has to declare a command post in the same region as corp bs hq or office the command post could be found in corp as corp info this is a very rough idea i hope to think more on it over the next few days
thats how i would do itthe new systemfirst we have to distinguish between a cold and a hot war which differ in the possibility to actually shot each othercorp a wardecs corp b but unlike in the present system it has to choose at least one reason it is actually fighting forthe following reasons could be selectedmoney with a maximum of half the corps income in the previous 30 days and a minimum of 1 millsystem control corp a wants corp b out of a certain systemmoon control corp a wants a pos of corp b removedmember removal corp a wants a certain member of corp b expelledthe war fee should be determined by the numbers of attacking corps and the member numbers of these corps1 war declaration 10 mill base fee2 war declaration 20 mill base feeand so onif the attacking corp has more members the base fee is multiplied with the according ratio 3 to 1 for example would result in a 30 mill first war decthe following restricitions apply to the waring corpscannot recruit new memberscannot form fleets with non corp members unless the war has been declared to be openleaving the corp takes 7 days  up to discussion corp bs optionsdeclare mutual corp a cant retract the war but can also issue the options belowdeclare open both corp members can form fleets with other playerssurrender different for the individual war reasons except that the war cannot be retracted anymoremoney  once the amount is paid the war turns into a cold warsystem control  war turns cold and corp b members become blinky red to corp a members in the system in questionmoon control  war turns cold and the tower offlines and cannot be onlined until it is relaunched for corpmember removal  war turns cold once member is kicked which takes place immidiately  only with applies for ths member should the member rejoin before the war ends corp b members become blinky red to corp a members
a 2 set is about 12mil other than that jump clones
really nice to hear of changes to this system older established rich corps shouldnt be able to grief and generally smack down newer corps for all time just bc they were there first its definitely an advantage being a more established corp but ther def needs to be some parameters and victory conditions that would enable the smaller corps to still remain functional and in existence and not be so discouraging to newer players
there could be 10 3 years old player in one corp that can declare war to a corp formed by 15 3 moths old playersi think that it will be better that every corporation and alliance need to have a net worth the net worth will be calculated based on the members skill points assets isk and how old is the character having a net worth you have 2 choices1 allow a corp to war dec only corps that have net worth in the range  x of the war declaring corp  i think that this will not be a good thing 2 make the price of the war proportional to the difference of the net worth of the two corps
a friend of mine made several bil isk within his first 3 months of playing eve purely out of really organised playertoplayer tradehe had less than 5mil sphis assets alone ranked in the multiple billionshis character was brand newnow he could have been generous and spread the love amongst the 9 members of his corp that have 3 year old pvp centric characters at the same time theres nothing stopping one corp from supporting another corp financially

0001 skill queue functionalitynoah  ccp  indicated ccpUFFFDs awareness of the player frustrations with the 6 hour duration skill trainings however ccp strongly believes that switching skill training is an activity that encourages players to log into the game and play a skill queue would be a possible solution if there would be limitations such as a limited amount of skills being trained or that only skills of a total up to a certain duration can be stacked into the queuealex  csm bane glorious  noted that players have also suggested a dual training mechanic where players can pick a primary and secondary skill which both train at half speed as soon as the skill with the shortest duration is finished the other skill will train at full speedit was concluded that ccp will look into a solution for this issuediscuss this topicback to table of contents
0002 bombs need a boostnoah  ccp  informed the csm that it was the intention for bombs to be used to break up ongrid blobs ccp is aware that the current system is not entirely balanced out but that it was better to introduce bombs in a prenerfed state and boost them later rather than implementing them in an overpowered fashionalex  csm bane glorious  suggested that one of the main issues with bombs is the cost of these weapons and that the cost should be reduced while the required cargo space should be unaffected so that people cannot carry huge amounts of these weapons another suggestion was to increase damage done to large targetsandrew  csm jade constantine  pointed out that stealth bomber vulnerability was an issue as well and that it might be necessary to improve the range of bombsnoah  ccp  agreed to hand this issue to the ccp balancing teamdiscuss this topicback to table of contents
0003 problems with aggression timerccp is aware of the issue and noted that there currently exists a whackamole type of play where players repeatedly undock fire a few shots and redock this is undesirable but will have to be carefully balanced to account for various situations and possible exploitive strategies ccp addition this subject is about the UFFFDdockjump after aggressionUFFFD timer  60 seconds  not criminal flaggingthief timer  15 minutes alison  csm inanna zuni  observed that ships of all sizes have the same time limits and that it is generally harder to destroy a large ship opposed to a small one alision  csm inanna zuni  and valentijn  csm dierdra vaal  suggested that the timer should be changed based on ship typealex  csm bane glorious  was also concerned with removerepair alts whose actions currently have no impact on the aggression timerccp is aware of the issues and heard the csm concerns and will work towards developing a solutiondiscuss this topicback to table of contents
0004 black ops improvementsnoah  ccp  indicated that ccp was aware that battleships with jumpdrives would become the ultimate ship and to this end black ops ships were prenerfedandrew  csm jade constantine  noted that the range of the drive and the presence of cynojammers made the jumpdrive capability virtually useless another problem is the limited amount of fuel that can be carriedbane  csm bane glorioius  added to this that due to the fuel taking up large amounts of cargo space loot from successful operations often cannot be hauled back to friendly territorynoah  ccp  commented that a fuel bay can be added so that fuel no longer takes up cargo space or that specialized haulers could perhaps be used to haul the loot back or bring in supplies ccp will also look at the issue with cynojammers jump range might be looked into but is of a lower concern otherwise black ops ships might become too competitive with capital shipsdiscuss this topicback to table of contents

0006 destructible outpostsccp made it clear that there are technical issues in the way of destroying outposts  running scienceindustry jobs market players and property in station etc  and that it would require a major overhaul to a lot of aspects of the game to make destructible outposts possible therefore it will not be feasible to destroy outpostsandrew  csm jade constantine  said that there should be more risk associated to 00 presence and that it currently is too hard to remove an established 00 entity it is too hard to inflict lasting damageccp replied that the csm should look at other ways to accomplish what destructible outposts wouldandrew  csm jade constantine  continued that instead of a total removal of outposts they could be put into a derelict mode where normal processes would finish and all items and players would remain onboard but no new services could be initiatedvarious csm members said that there currently are a lot of useless outposts littering 00 and that it would be nice to destroy or disable the outposts and raid them for supplies so that land could be left fallow and a reward is gained from pillaging these outpostsdiscuss this topicback to table of contents
0007 00110015 0033 various ui issuesccp informed the csm that they have a game designer and 3 programmers currently dedicated to implementing ui improvements and cut down on the excel in space appearance of the ui ccp is also interested in making the inspace view more usable as currently almost all spacebased interaction is done through the overview listthe standard behavior for doubleclicking avatars is something that can easily be implemented and will be looked into regarding electronic warfare icons in the overview ccp indicated that they would want a more dynamic solution where information is only displayed when it becomes relevant to the player and does not take up space otherwise as for the minimum size of the various windows in the game it will be hard to change this in the shortterm individual windows can be changed one at a time but changes across the board will not be possibleccp will look into changing the skill page to clearly display the currently trained skillthe personal assets page was set up as it is by design the data is not available locally and loading everything would be heavy on the database this will probably not be changed sorting items by subcategory and general category will be something ccp is going to look intoregarding the display of pilot avatars in the side bar of the chat channel ccp will look into making this a toggleable feature the csm noted that the reason behind this is that people want to see as much names as possible in the list and that avatars take up a lot of spacemaking icons stand out better for people affected by colordeficiency ccp is aware of the concerns but it will consume a lot of resources to replace the current textures and thus it will likely be surpassed by issues with a higher priority they will keep it in mind to make future icons stand out better to people affected by this conditiondiscuss this topicback to table of contents
0009 alliances and factional warfarematt  ccp  explained that ccps goal of factional warfare was to introduce more players to pvp and that it was not intended as endgame pvp which they believe is 00 warfare factional warfare is to prepare players for 00 warfare alliances partaking in factional warfare would open a can of worms to them for instance that factional warfare would move interalliance conflicts out of 00 where they belong and into sovereign empire space and that experienced alliance pilots would gank new players that want to learn about pvp in factional warfarefrom a technical aspect it is impossible for an alliance as a whole to join factional warfare it is possible to allow corporations in an alliance to sign up as this feature is currently blocked and this block could be lifted andrew  csm jade constantine  reacted that there are disadvantages for a whole alliance to sign up as their industrialist part could no longer enter certain parts of empire space and that they are free to shoot at by the enemy militias while griefers that want to gank new players in factional warfare easily get around the limitations by just setting up a separate corporation on the other hand roleplaying alliances which might not have 00 assets are currently left out while they would benefit greatly from factional warfarematt  ccp  argued that if corporations in alliances would be allowed to join factional warfare individual corporations might sign up with opposing factions making them each others enemy through factional warfare and each others ally through the alliance which would result in a logical paradoxccp said that they would rather want to make the shiny features of factional warfare available to alliances and 00 combat this would include a rank system for corporations  and make 00 warfare more interesting by having strategic locations to fight over like in factional warfare rather than using the resources to make factional warfare available for alliances andrew  csm jade constantine  noted that just quickfixing factional warfare and allowing corporations in alliances to participate would be enough to please a lot of people matt  ccp  replied that ccp will first look how factional warfare will develop in the future before making any rushed adjustments but that they will look into making factional warfare available to corporations in alliances with the limitation that corporations in the same alliance can only sign up with one and the same factiondiscuss this topicback to table of contents
0010 5 voting issuespUFFFDtur  ccp  explained that the current 5 amount of players to bring an issue to the csm was to ensure that not a single alliance could force their issues through but that 5000 votes would be a more practical number at the moment ccp wants to keep this democratic mechanism in place but understands that either the percentage will be too high so that it would never be obtained or too low so that a single alliance can force all its issues throughthe csm conferred on its own and changed the required percentage to 25 of the amount of people that voted in the electiondiscuss this topicback to table of contents
0008 cargo hold size of ships in hangarcurrently ships in the hangar do not display the effects of modules rigs and skills this did occur in the past but was removed due to people exploiting the mechanics by offlining cargo expanders so that they would not suffer the drawbacks but kept the passive bonus of the module thus the cargo space increase is now an active effect which required the module to be online when not boarded all modules on a ship will go offline resulting in less cargo space being availablealison  csm inanna zuni  indicated that the 30 second time delay between swapping ships was the reason behind the frustration that this issue caused ccp is currently looking at decreasing this session change timer but cannot change the cargo hold issuediscuss this topicback to table of contents
0016 switching ammo for all weapons at onceccp said that this issue has been brought up in the past but has been rejected due to performance reasons moving items around causes a heavy load on the servers and making guns easier to reload might encourage players to do it even more frequently there are concerns that during large fleet battles all ammunition will be changed at the call of a fleet commander which would cause an enormous spike on the servershowever due to the popularity of this feature ccp will confer with the serverdatabase teams to see if this feature can be implemented and how it would affect performancediscuss this topicback to table of contents
0028 forum issues and fixesccp recognizes the issues with the forums and devs suffer from them as well the problems originate from some serverside limitations because of the use of asp instead of aspx but there are also session limitations in browsers which cause problems there are also issues with the load balancer which occasionally sends people to a different node which does not recognize the users authentication which is an issue that can be looked at ccp would like to move the forum to another database and will change the entire forum in the long run but a final decision and plan has not been finalized yet the csm and the players will be kept up to date on the developmentsregarding the forum not being readable in the ingame browser there are no plans to address this as the current ingame browser is no longer being developed there are plans to replace the ingame browser with different softwarediscuss this topicback to table of contents

0018 00 sovereignty issuesccp has been discussing 00 and sovereignty internally for the past year and discussed many issues already they found that player owned station  pos  warfare is a very limited mechanic and that it revolves around the amount of dreadnoughts and other capital ships in the fleet while small ships only serve as support instead of being able to accomplish small objectives on their own the longterm plan for 00 warfare is to have multiple layers of goals and objectives instead of all fighting occurring over stations this would allow small groups to have an impact on the game instead of needing hundreds of ships to have influence in 00nathan  ccp  said that he does not believe that current largescale fleet combat is interesting for the participants mainly due to focus fireandrew  csm jade constantine  commented that current 00 pvp is siege warfare people stick to established fortresses and do not venture beyond the gates his suggestion was to include mechanics that encouraged sovereignty holders to patrol their space and have ways for roaming gangs to peck at undefended systems and steal resources therethe issue of logistics was also discussed alex stated that current pos logistics required an alliance to have powergamers that managed them around the clock he proposed to make 00 appeal to a wider audience by removing these repetitive activities that required powergaming shayne urged ccp to consider mechanics that would provide more synergy between the industrial and combat aspects of 00ccp said that they would have to balance short term achievements to the long term empire building if people could easily destroy in a day what took months to build up this would be unfair but on the other hand it should not be too hard to smoke out established entities they agreed however that the current time sinks in pos warfare are too longthis issue has been put on the rolling agenda and ccp asked the csm and the players to come up with concrete suggestions how to improve 00 warfare and sovereigntydiscuss this topicback to table of contents
0019 contract improvementsccp stated that they have a dilemma where contracting can on one hand be more effective where people have more options and better deals or can be a backalley trading system where people can scam each other in the worst case on the other hand ccp believes that the contract system could use some more utility but should not grant players much more information as a fully transparent and effective system would also limit the opportunities for players to make a profit they want the csm and the players to think about the direction the contract system should take and are open to suggestions and improvementsthe 10 increment in bids is agreed to be too high a percentage but it should not be too low either otherwise it would turn into 001 warfare the csm is tasked to determine the appropriate percentage and relay it back to ccp who will analyze it and adjust the percentagediscuss this topicback to table of contents

0022 shares dividends and stock marketeyjUFFFD  ccp  understood the need for improving stock trading but setting up the underlying infrastructure would be complex he strongly believes that financial auditing and reporting should be dealt with by the players however this would result in problems with alts and accountability as it would be hard to provide consequences to fraudulent charactersin eve trust would also be a problem as players are discouraged to trust other people with their investments as precedented by other game mechanics this might mean that the whole stock market would ended up to be controlled by only a few individuals with sufficient reputation while it would be impossible for new parties to get any kind of position in this system ccp does not plan to build this system if only a few people will benefit from itccp encourages the csm and players to think about these issues and how players can be held accountable for financial audits and records as well as come up with possible mechanics and solutionsdiscuss this topicback to table of contents

a spaceship type that is somewhere between an industrial and a freighter is currently in development abilities may include the use of cans and capital tractor beams but design features are subject to change
the important thing is that it has at least one welldefined role and has the necessary capacity for that role and that it doesnt displace anything else from its own unique role at the moment it sounds as though its aimed squarely at mining ops for people who want to move lots of ore at once without having to deploy a rorqual for 10 minutes
i used to be in favor of a minifreighter but not anymore just fix the suicide ganking problem so that people in empire can safely fill up their freighters again and the need for another ship goes away put a single slot or a builtin tractorsalvager and youve completely eliminated the need for another ship type
agree my freighter alt didnt need to spend much time  rather isk which is a smaller factor for an industrialtrade character  to get access to the freigther from industrial 5if theres going to be a ship inbetween its quite important its role is welldefined just like kazuo mentioned the rorqual has a unique role miningrelated a minifreighter with a capital tractor beam would lean towards that department id be more interested in either seeing different versions of this minifreighter for different purposes or something that is more related to pure transporting a bigger brother of the blockade runners perhaps that can mount a small tank andor have the possibility to selfrepair  until help arrives or it reaches the gate  or give it a separate cargo space  like the carrier have cargo space corp hangar and ship hangar  that purely can be used to store fuel in that example say it has a base capacity that is equal to a rigged iteron mark 5 but it has the potential to carry a few hundred k m3 worth of fuel isotopes liquid ozone and only thatsomething along those lines give it a role
id like to see it be skill intensive needing freighter 5 amongst others but be useful for corps mining in high sec making it skill intensive means there will still be plenty of people jetcan mining for those who enjoy that particular grief but there would be an alternative for those who are more organised is this the same ship some have discussed as a minirorqual would be nice to have a mobile base of operations for miners can mount capital tractors or something between capitalsmall with a relatively large cargo hold but less than half a freighter at least
i think ccp is referring to the orca in one of their previous posts they described this as something between a freighter and industrial and its been stated this will be similar in function to the rorqual meaning it will aid in mining ops and provide a large cargohold
this suggestion could go down in flames but it appears there is an opening here for something that has been discussed and that i personally think would be usefulin the universe of eve there are those who can afford both in isk and skilltraining time to fly capital ships  and those who cannota ship capable of bridging these two opposites is potentially a new hauleras it sits the only realistic ways to get cargo past an enemy force or a gate camp are to go around wait until later prepare a larger opposing force or hopefor corps with few players trying to get established in 00 is a chore in itself ccp states that they would love more players in 00 yet the more there are the harder it is for smaller corps to get in  and get outit doesnt matter if you have a 20 player corp all determined to head to 00 to make their fortunes if theres just going to be a 30 ship gate camp to contend with every time you want to move products into more lucrative selling systemsthe larger alliances have a monopoly on lowsec space since they can afford to camp every route that is popularyes there are jump freighters and other capital ships that can greatly assist in avoiding these situations  but for the small corporation just getting started another option could be made availablea new ship that bridges the gap not only could be a hauler but should be a haulerthere is such a wide variety of warships available and so few haulersin reality we have the standard t1 haulers the t2  cough  gate camp busters freighters and jumpfreighterst1t2 haulers dont stand a chance at a gate camp freighters might fare better but that is because they either a  jump past the camp or b  manage to absorb enough damage to get awayfreighters have a cost associated with them that is beyond the abilities of newer players both in isk and skill training timei propose a new hauler that has a mixture of both a midsize ship with the ability to carry as much as a t1 hauler maybe a bit more but with the ability to cynoa lower cost combined with lower skill requirements could make this ship a suitable inbetween step between standard haulers and capitalsit would have the same capabilities of being destroyed at a gate camp as a t1t2 hauler but would have the added ability to avoid them by cyno jumpingbasically a cyno hauler that isnt a capital ship a bustard with a cyno so to speakno fancy warp bubble proofing or immune to electronic warfare just a small hauler with a jumpdrivethe black ops ships are a midway bridge between t1t2 battleships and capital ships if you cant afford the isk for a cap ship or the skills a black ops ship is a suitable step up the transport pilots deserve a similar optioni like the fact that the hauler class pilots in eve are getting some much needed attention here i just hope that a true step up type of industrial ship is createdmany of us had high hopes for the potential of the last industrial step up for the poor i for one couldnt wait to get into a bustard and finally have more of a chance to move past those 10 ship gate campsthe bustard appeared and the gate campers adjusted accordingly by becoming 203040 ship camps bubbles didnt help eitherim not suggesting that a new hauler be created that has the ability to skip past all danger because if adding a jump drive to a hauler allows that then the new jump freighters must fit that description as well  which they dont im sure there are pilots who would be willing to pay well for such a ship hauling no matter how boring many pilots think it is can be as much fun and profitable as any other profession transportation of goods is half of eve yet imho it gets less than 1 percent of the attention it deservesplus the billions it costs for jump freighter right now is far out of reach for mostmy two cents
as it is now rorquals and carriers are cheaper than jump freighters and are capable of fulfilling the same role having transport ships that could cyno would likely render the jump freighter useless sure they would not haul as much but for the price difference you could have a few of these going all the time and being much smaller and having the ability to cloak would make them quite survivable meaning an alliance could keep these ships running all the time and always transporting with little to no protection required as much as i would love it i do not think it will happen not to mention a ship with a jump drive is considered a capital ship and therefore can not enter empire space i think if there would to be any bonus to transporting it would be through ore compression with the proposed orca allowing ore compression in high sec would mean blockrade runners could carry more and be more effective in terms of quantity carried
this is of course assuming that ore is what is being transported selfsufficient corps have the capability of building anything in 00also you mentioned major alliances running the small jumptransports  to give them a name  in quantity instead of the freighters please do that gives more targets to shoot at in the long runtheres really no big difference and no imbalance that i can see either have 1 big expensive ship carrying a lot of stuff or multiple less expensive ships carrying less stuff in reality it would be costsimilar pay 6 billion to haul 250k of stuff in 1 ship or pay 600 million to haul 25k worth of stuff in a smaller ship in the end its still 6 billion worth of isk in balancethis is just a way for the pilotscorps who dont happen to have 6 billion isk laying around that they can throw at a single ship to have the opportunity to partake in 00 a little easier
oh man are we there yet are we there yet are we there yet
i would love to see a haulermini freighter with about 100200k m3 hold personally my mk5 fully expanded serves me pretty well but there are times where i would like to move my productr from the building system to the selling system and then the mk5 is not enough and buying a freighter with 900k m3 is just not effective for me so i have to wait on some of my friends to log on and get them to haul for methe jump from haulers to freighters is to great as it is we need a ship in between that can serve us small scale builders
a subfreighter sized hauler would be nice especially if its a stealth hauler  a hauler that can make use of the black ops covert jump bridge  this would also allow covert gangs to go on extended missions with enough fuel while being able to bring back the loot from those missions note im suggesting a different ship than a minime rorqual for highsec mining ops
i support the idea of a middle range hauler this shouldnt be a ship with a high sp requirement instead this should be aimed at a different market players and small corps that need to haul 100200k m3 of an item but without the investment in a 1bil hauling ship 100200k cargohold a few highmid slots 01 low slots and a build cost of 300400m would be great it could be modestly tanked use tractors for corp mining ops and be accessible to more players
medium sized freighter isnt an issue better do something with freighter gankers and problem solved besides we already have freighters with smaller cargo bay called jump freightersbut yes there should be a ship with bonus to tractor beam  and salvager  but not a freighter more likely a crusierbattlecrusier sized ship
ccp started off that they currently have plans to improve the interface for the science and industry windows and that they are seriously considering more skills being available for the industry and manufacturing character types they also plan to add skill requirements to blueprints the new skills will allow characters to specialize down several branches and yield benefits to specific areas of manufacturing hopefully we will see some of these features being implemented this winterlater on ccp wants to have more item customizability and bring metalevel into the equation where special components could be included in the manufacturing process to give a boost to the produced item fully dynamic items are a problem because all item stats are static in the database so variations are impossibleeva  csm ankhesentapemkah  said that to have variations to ships the special ship variant could come standard with a rig that influences the stats a rig which cannot be produced separately and cannot be removed from the specific ship this avoids a lot of balancing problems as specific rigs would only have to be available on specific ships and would solve the database problem as all these rigs can be precreated and then applied to the ships to give them variable statscharlie  csm lavista vista  was concerned with the introduction of new skill requirements the barrier to entry might become too high and suggested this to be smoothened outccp also considered to break up t1 manufacture into individual components as creating all these objects out of raw minerals is unrealisticeva  csm ankhesentapemkah  commented that research should also be a lot more dynamic as research is currently too static and predictable she suggested having a more variable outcome as well as unique and special rewards that could be obtained through researching an example was to add tech 2 blue print originals as a very rare outcome of an rd process as well as other new and unique itemsccp noted that a large percentage of players never leaves highsec and wants to know from the csm how these players should be approached and if they should allocate more resources to create content for this type of player
i like all of these ideas particularly the t1 come from components these components should be easy to make have very low skill requirements and be cheep to make  this helps the barrier of entry that lavista vista is worried about  this would give new players a great place to start and since it would be quite a hassle to make the large number for a sizable t1 ship building operation they could be sold on the market to advanced players who need an enormous amount to build t1 bs and bcone question i have is whether the variable stats ships would still have the normal 2 or 3 rig slots i would say that t1 ships should have 1 slot taken by the variation rig and 2 available slots and t2 ships  if variation is even possible on these ships  would have 1 available rig slot with 1 taken by the variation rig id like to see variable mods too but as you say that could be difficult to implement im not really sure of any solutions
i think theres space on the ui for up to 8 rig slots if its ever needed and this would be an excellent way of creating item variants especially if it could be extended so that modules themselves could be rigged i suppose itd have to be done via a massive calibration cost and a role bonus for ship thatd make it the only ship able to fit it
although i applaud the initiative of ccp to ask about this im uncertain what kind of action is being takenis this one of the cases where the csm is tasked to discuss the matter and report their findings to ccp or was there an actual answer during the session or is this all well ever hear about this ok i seriously doubt that part  thanks for any answersranges
i strongly disagree with the idea of t2 bpos even a very small chance of getting one would give the lucky individualcorp a huge financial advantage however it would be nice to be able to get t2 bpcs from research agentsi really like the idea of building t1 items from components as long as it didnt affect the finial cost of the item by too much a component that didnt cost very much to build would be a good place for a lowskilled industrialist to start currently smallmedium ammo is the only place a nonmaxed skill industrialist has a chance and there is very little market in that
i like the bpc idea although i do have a problem with the risk of dumbing down invention  its not that clever right now  by providing out of the box bpcs to datacore alts because seriously how many people actually play the characters that provide their datacores im very concerned about this part if those components are not constructed by players from minerals it would be a serious blow to the miners those people  god help me if i have to mine  are active subscribers and i dont see a need to screw them over oh anything i didnt quote i agreed with 
i think that the t1 components would be built from raw minerals thus the actual cost remains about the same but there is just an extra step
also i dont think that the barriertoentry for industrialists is all that high except that you must max your production efficiency to compete but once you have that you can pretty much make anything you wanti would like to see something that encourages industrialists to specialize skill requirements and component requirements would help to diversify the market and thus encourage industry in general
i find the component aspect interesting as well as those above stated as long as the components were manufactured from raw minierals miners will still be in the picture  i mine a great deal in addition to manufacturing however you may now have manufacturing slots in hisec even more jammed as they can become from time to time with people running build jobs for the components as well as building actual t1 items id think some serious thought would need to go into adding more manufacturing slots or maybe even a seperate line of slots used only for the manufacture of components
good to hear that the industrial side of things may not go neglected for much longer i particularly like the notion of t1 components but please address research  build slot issues first getting blueprints  jobs done for existing items is timeconsuming enough without adding more load to the number of npc slots  to think about the lone or smallscale research  build groups obviously id want to see the stats after fw has been out for a while to see if this percentage has remained the sameim going to assume that given the placement of this question that there is an implicit assumption here that not going into lowsecnullsec implies not engaging in pvp  whether directly or as a target  given the industrial slant of the rest of the topic granted you can pvp in highsec but clearly the risks are different and more importantly perceived differentlyas an aside id be interested to see a comparison between that and npc corp membership  ie how many in the npc corps excluding militia do or do not enter lowsec etc  that gives you true data on the riskaverse membershipseems to me you have three choices  provide more incentives for them to pvp which fw began and potentially risk alienating the more hardcore players who already cry that eve is being dumbed down or cater to those that just dont want to get involved in the pvp or provide more nonpvp reasons for them to go to that space and potentially be a targeti know numerous players including my partner who got bored and quit eve who like nothing more than the industrial side of eve which is vital for the pvp part anyway they dont mind the notion that others put their products to good use in blowing each other up but it doesnt appeal to them id go so far as to say this is a good thing in that if everyone was obsessed with pvp and killboards whod mine and build stuffultimately having a combat game and an industrial game merged into one is going to set two fundamentally different playstyles at loggerheads  assuming black and white of course not everyone is purely one or the other  id like to see real recognition of the industrial side by ccp not just in updates but in wording marketing a promoting of that part of the game instead of it being relegated to bunch of carebears by the pvpers that dont get where their ships come from treat it as a first class citizen and the birthplace of pvp and you might just get the attention of those youre trying to reach
why dont a large portion of industrialists leave highsecthey dont need to there are people willing to do that for them they can sit in an npc corp and remain immune to wardecs minerals and the market come to them why would they need to leave hisec let alone undock
i think if a large part of ccps paying customerbase never leaves highsec itd be foolish not to create content to cater to them either that create more content to induce players to leave empire space and try lowsec00 and perhaps change the perception that exists in a lot of players minds that goes something like this00 is pointless it is 100 dominated by a handful of huge alliances who have no interest in new members if they catch you in their territory theyll pod you to teach you a lesson to never come back  and for laughs 
the sas dont bake cakes please excuse me if i seem to go in circles i have trouble explaining things the only problem i have with industrial skills is that it take alot less time for someone to be in a position to perform manufactureresearch than it does to join a fleet and go hunting it took me 2 or 3 weeks to learn how to use a gun in real life  im ex forces  im sure it would take me a hell of a lot longer to learn particle physicsimho i think a huge great wedge should be driven between the industrialists and the combatants skills for industry should be made longer to train and should also match the prices of skills required to pvp for examplea modulated deep core strip miner takes just a month to train for however a 425mm rail gun 2 can take about half a year to train comparing a rorqual and a chimera for example the rorqual takes half the time at around 160 days than its combat counterpart the rorqual should have cap ind ship skill with a long list of prereqs and the chimera should have cap ship with long list of combat skills the rorq should not have to train cap ships first but instead cap ind ships being its equvalant for players on the industry path the 2 skills together cost approx 800mil which also means the chimeracombat pilots only have to pay half the cost than those struggling in the industry arena which mean a rorq is twice as more likley to go pop than a chimera  no stats to back that up agreed the early stages of mining  as with early pvp stages  should only take a few days just enough to get people on their feet while deciding what route to take once decided the skills should become longer to train what would this do to eve although there are probably many factors that i may have missed i believe that by clearly defining the different trades eve will achieve its goal of moving people out to 00 into the allainces and would make for a much more interesting game players would have to activly escort their indutrialists instead of the old were gonna go mishgriefgive us a shout if you get into trouble thus bringing those that choose industry over pvp in order to provide a well needed service will not just have the dull grinding sound of high sec to log onto but will be able to participate in the action and excitment that exists elsewherethe fact that industry is specialized would also make for better marketing the skills required to manufacture would become less common among players and would allow those that spend hours on mining ops and more months training si to actually make a good amount of profit from the sale of their manufactured goods as do the combatants currently who are rolling around in cap ships running lvl 5 missions at present i only know of one person in the game who has never gone below 05 and has a full blown indy corp with a few bil in her wallet compared to multitude of combatants who are a plenty who have carriers and billions the point im getting at here is that industry holds not profitthis would also mean that industrialists could afford to run a pos for research and manufacture thus lightening the load on the npc si slots both because the industrialists have their own poss and also because it will take a combatant a substantial amount of time to also train for si thus again reducing the number of slots in use in summary it would increase the strategy in eve  protection logistical strikes  would allow the market to become more real  for example if every company in the world made online games eve may not have so many subscribers or at least it would be harder to compete  it would draw players to get involved in the allainces00 wars and strategies it would promote teamwork and tactical play reduce the waiting time for si slots reward those who choose industry trade agreements for example and maybe lots more
i like the idea of skills for various blueprints i worry about the idea of componentizing blueprints for the most part mostly because itd screw with everyone who took out me research on them but if they made sure that the top component was at least in a group of 300 or so that should mean that most of the bigger blueprints would still be underperfect its rare to see battleships with me50 for example  titans with 550 of a kind seem a much better model than carriers with 11 mostly because points of me dont take months on smaller ships also i dont want to see this applying to gear  ships only t1 gear should be easy to make for anybody with the skills for it
sorry for double postthe stip miner and 425 are what i consider to be each others counterparts for their particualr trade routesthe times for training were calculated by saving my toons xml file in eve mon editing it to remove skills and making each attribut at 5 then reloading it as a fake toon into eve mon
t2 bpos are probably a very bad idea they can be hugely influential to the marketas for removing t1 modules from npc great ideacomponents for production check there as welldifferentiation in produced modules woot
i missed the bit about t2 bpos the only way i could support them is if you implemented a rp store to buy them in but in all likelihood the costs would be far too high to be justifiable  rp is currently worth maybe 4000 per and a good t2 bpo is worth as much as 20 billion nobody can put together 5 million rp even if its pooled inside a corp the way lp is selling t2 bpcs in a rp store might be interesting but the inventors would be very unhappy with such a scheme and justifiably so if i wanted to come up with a crazy scheme id suggest the ability to do some really hardcore inventionstyle process to turn a t1 bpo into a t2 bpo but i cant think of how to make that work sensibly perhaps even an auction scheme if inflation ever becomes a problem but thatll just serve to make the rich richer which isnt a great goal either sadly the lottery might actually be the best way to introduce t2 bpos to the market and given that we all know how that worked out its probably best not to touch those ever again
agreed bpo were just not that great and i think they really take the work out of actually doing any t2 industry invention really makes building stuff fun at least is does for me
i was very happy to see this commentccp noted that a large percentage of players never leaves highsec and wants to know from the csm how these players should be approached and if they should allocate more resources to create content for this type of playeryes  more resources should be allocated to create content for this type of playeri dont know how much of eve this player type makes up but i assure you that it is a massive proportion on the entire mmorpg player base outside of eve personally after 2 years and 2 accounts ive hit a wall with eve where i cant advance any further or train any higher in high sec there is nothing exciting to train for all the missions are too easy as it is and im boardlike a lot of the highsec crowd im interested in advancing collecting and growing more powerful but there is nothing much to dolike most im a solo player with fiends in a small corp i enjoy cooperative play but the missions are too easy i have no interest in pvp unless its just for fun among friends with no real consequences i enjoy social networking im an adult and i cant commit to anything ingame that takes longer than a hour or so in one sitting i think that the most difficult challenge for the eve designers is going to be in the balancing between the highsec and lowsec player typestbh id be happy with a pve server and more content at the moment i feel as though im a secondclass player in a pvp game
what he said and yes i would like a chance at a tech ii bpo again and yes more high sec content i like pve and i will never go to low sec to be blown up up the gankers and pvpersi have never played wow so i can not go back therei have played eve for over 4 years and no you can not have my stuff
this is by far the single best solution to dynamic ship creation ive heard
i dont see what the problem is with producing the rig separately as long as only the intended ship s  are able to fit itpeople would do more production in 00 if the margins justified it this would happen fairly quickly if it became too expensive to produce most items in empire space  im strongly in favour of escalating fees for using npc manufacturing slots in a similar way to how offices currently work so that the fees become a significant part of the costs of empire manufacturing  perhaps almost 100 of the costs for ammo or modules say
noah  ccp  informed the csm that it was the intention for bombs to be used to break up ongrid blobs ccp is aware that the current system is not entirely balanced out but that it was better to introduce bombs in a prenerfed state and boost them later rather than implementing them in an overpowered fashionalex  csm bane glorious  suggested that one of the main issues with bombs is the cost of these weapons and that the cost should be reduced while the required cargo space should be unaffected so that people cannot carry huge amounts of these weapons another suggestion was to increase damage done to large targetsandrew  csm jade constantine  pointed out that stealth bomber vulnerability was an issue as well and that it might be necessary to improve the range of bombsnoah  ccp  agreed to hand this issue to the ccp balancing team
i dont have a good suggestion other than reducing the price tagadd in the fact that you cant use them in highsec or lowsec and theyre almost completely useless theyre a novelty weapon for a novelty shipmaybe if stealth bombers could actually bomb steathily  warp cloaked  and the ammo didnt cost more the ship and have a 10 day training time on a skill that doesnt provide any bonus to the bomb people would use themthey were introduced prenerfed so hard ive yet to see one ever used
o
i was tempted to create a new subject on this but decided that it should be under bomb boosts however it is a radical proposal  im in the bombs needing a boost plan more damage  less cost it is apparent the 00 blob warfare for better or worse  worse really  is a part of fw which was supposed to encourage smaller gang warfare objectives since the bombs were originally designed as a tool to help breakup on grid blobs ccp should considerallowing the use of bombs in lowsec with a proviso or two1 only faction warfare militias should be allowed to do this from an rp perspective since concord has sanctioned combat between militias the use of bombs would seem a logical extension of this  it could be argued about interdiction spheres but i think those have made combat worse not better  though i would still disallow them in high sec the greifingplay probability is just too high2 sec status hits for hitting non combatants and fellow militia pilots should still apply  it would probably be too difficult to implentment an exception for friendly fire  unless you made bombers specifically immune from bomb effects  and im just throwing that out there  orremoving sec hits for members of the same gangfleet when using aoe weapons  a bigger issue  this theoretically could apply for smartbombs as well since fw rules severely limit their use as wellof course if the bombs arent boosted then the above is moot but its just a thought now that i dont play in 00 too much any more it saddens me that that one more thing that gimps the use of one of my favorite ships  i also think that bombers should be able to warp cloaked but that is another can o worms 
i love the idea of bombs have seen them used  completely ineffectivly by the way  and have trained and built a pile for myself to trybut i gotta admit it all seem like a total waste of time and isk its a great concept which could actually reduce the tendency to blob unfortunately it is a totally impractical implementation at the momentthe present concept is similar to the wwii dive bombers with accuracy and speed totally dependant on the stealth bombers trajectory perhaps making them more similar to a rocketpropelled bomb where you could fire it off in a general direction and have it home in on a ship or shiptype with a selfpropelled velocity increase would make them more usefulwarping when cloaked would infringetoo much on the covert ops ships but perhaps a signature reduction to the stealth bomber or another means to make it harder to lock would work
reduce their pricetag and dont force the sbs to remain uncloaked before the bomb hits
indeed the damage should be boosted as well as it states the bombs only take out frigatte size vessels for sure  in the times of hp buffer tanks most cruisers could withstand a hit  we do not even talk about t2 resists also the stealthbomber itself always has to see that he survives the attack  increase useabillity
qft the survivability of the stealth bomber is all about stealth its about decloaking firing a volley then cloaking before youre locked a stealthbomber cant survive an impending battleship fleet even for those crucial 15 seconds unless its difficult to lock
as there are several different kinds of bombs i find the blob removal gimik hard to envision under the present method of delivery a bomb should behave like a bomb ie it should make a mess of anything in its imediate vacinity i dont think cost is an issue if the thing works and gets the job done then the cost is justifiedbombers are definitly another topic and i firmly believe that they need some serious make over right from the skills on up stealth where one good thing though  repairs are cheap all you need is some white glue and a roll of tissue paper
ive said it from day one bombs will never work  as intended right now they are worthless  but make them not worthless and they are instantly overpoweredbecause if they can split up a blob they can also kill a small gangsomething other than bombs are needed  on paper a nice idea but in practice you either get useless or overpowered
eyjUFFFD  ccp  understood the need for improving stock trading but setting up the underlying infrastructure would be complex he strongly believes that financial auditing and reporting should be dealt with by the players however this would result in problems with alts and accountability as it would be hard to provide consequences to fraudulent charactersin eve trust would also be a problem as players are discouraged to trust other people with their investments as precedented by other game mechanics this might mean that the whole stock market would ended up to be controlled by only a few individuals with sufficient reputation while it would be impossible for new parties to get any kind of position in this system ccp does not plan to build this system if only a few people will benefit from itccp encourages the csm and players to think about these issues and how players can be held accountable for financial audits and records as well as come up with possible mechanics and solutions
could start by just allowing shares to be able to track through journal and the ability to contracttrade them securelyat the very least ccp could maybe consider this functionality
some simple ideas that may help make all corps that sell stock have their financial records open to the public the way real corps do also have all stock pay out and selling set if the corp says they pay 10 of their stocks value make the corp pay 10 even if that means that the corps account go under also dont allow members to leave a corp until the corp balance is back above 0isk or possibly draw from any member that has financial control in the corp leaving them with more responsibility to their stock holders  or have it draw from all the corp members personal accounts this will also push corps that sell stock to work together  this will deter corps from pulling their funds from the stock holdersalso stock value should depend on profits from sells on the market and through contracts not player run audits it wouldnt be that hard to make a financial algorithm that totaled the values of items made and sold based on in corp players skillsi would also like to see more in the area of accountability i am a stock holder in several corps and i have found that most corps dont even pay dividends so stock value is basically what some plays says they want to sell the stock they own in a corp which means that corp stocks are being sold from player to player and the only person that makes any profit is the corp because even if they only get 1 iskper stock without some kind of payout they make all profit
contracting shares would be all that is required to make a more secure method available the community would then be in a good position to make externally supported stock markets using the api key much they way that ebank does now with isk the potential for scams is still there which is a good thing too
corp shares are one of my pet peeves at present there is only one form of corp ownership total solo dictatorship whoever owns 51 of the shares effectively owns 100 and those with less own nothingfor example in the recent disbanding of my old corp vendetta underground i owned 23 of the total shares yet the ceo was able to take all of the corp assets as his personal property and my 23 had no value at all since i had decided not to follow what i thought was a corrupt and inept leader i wanted to cash in the shares accumulated as rewards for years of service to the corp instead all the share ownership did was allow me to see the theft being committed by my ceo but not to challenge itit shure would be nice if there was a way that individuals could invest in a corp and be secure in their investment trusting anyone in eve is the stupidest thing you can ever do so thats out we need a gameenforced method for share ownership to be a tangible asset invulnerable to theft
turn shares into something that we can contracteverything else will sort itself out
this is already the case as embodied by egse brokers as stock market itself is far to complex even for real life professionals to police thus i agree that it should be off the agenda however not being able to transfer shares in a method secure for both parties is a crime that continues to this day shame on you for not even admitting to your negligence on thisuntil secure trading includes shares all discussion is pointless and you ccp empower only few with reputations at the cost of everything else
im not sure how much itd help but one thing id like to see a welltrusted character do is become an auditor for public corporations you dont need to run it just monitor the books itd probably help stave off a lot of scamming
where have you been its been happening for months dude and there are multiple characters who do it pop your head into the market discussions forum one day its a whole new world in there
not a part of the game i play sorry i stand corrected
ccp made it clear that there are technical issues in the way of destroying outposts  running scienceindustry jobs market players and property in station etc  and that it would require a major overhaul to a lot of aspects of the game to make destructible outposts possible therefore it will not be feasible to destroy outpostsandrew  csm jade constantine  said that there should be more risk associated to 00 presence and that it currently is too hard to remove an established 00 entity it is too hard to inflict lasting damageccp replied that the csm should look at other ways to accomplish what destructible outposts wouldandrew  csm jade constantine  continued that instead of a total removal of outposts they could be put into a derelict mode where normal processes would finish and all items and players would remain onboard but no new services could be initiatedvarious csm members said that there currently are a lot of useless outposts littering 00 and that it would be nice to destroy or disable the outposts and raid them for supplies so that land could be left fallow and a reward is gained from pillaging these outposts
victory in 00 wars is never partial victory one side is completely beaten and kicked out if you allow outposts to be destroyed then a superblob  such as max or mcs northern adventure  will simply destroy all the infrastructure over entire areas picture bobs 300 capitals making a roundtrip of 00 there would be no stations left in 00 when they were done and no reason to be in that 00 space thats badi would support however the repair of the station and station services via npc consumable items instead of just remote repairers for example a damaged outpost might need goods like hydrogen batteries or electronics to be returned to operation this would prevent free repairs of stations once the big bad blob moved on and provide a marketsmall gang opportunity to supplyinterdict the needed repair itemsin extreme cases i could even see people abandoning stations as the costease to repair becomes prohibitive
just curious but what about the limit on one per system this would allow some outposts to be abandoned and new ones built perhaps a system to allow an outpost to fall apart over time and be salvaged i remove adding an unanchor function to them because i think it would be too prone to abuse
outposts  op  destroyable by players is simply too prone to abuse  see above posts the ideal  but most likely impractical  solution would be dismantling it due to disuse  same as vacant buildings eventually fall in on themselfthe ways to meassure op disuse is definatly not trivial though  and probably moot for that reasona quickfix to ensure that space doesnt end up with ops all over the place would be to simply put in a hard lilmit on how long an op stays in spacesay two years as an examplean op is an investment and if you cant see it paying of in two years dont build it in the first place  that might in itself cut down on the numbers build   theres of course other reasons than just isk to build outposts  but the argument still holds are those reasons worth the outlay if yes itll get build else not
ccp said that this issue has been brought up in the past but has been rejected due to performance reasons moving items around causes a heavy load on the servers and making guns easier to reload might encourage players to do it even more frequently there are concerns that during large fleet battles all ammunition will be changed at the call of a fleet commander which would cause an enormous spike on the servershowever due to the popularity of this feature ccp will confer with the serverdatabase teams to see if this feature can be implemented and how it would affect performance
must put in my two cents on this one being amarrit would be nice to see the feature implemented as currently trying to change crystals can be a pain in the arse where by changing from one to another plus tryin to avoid the annoying unload to cargo option and various others is a painthough i can also see the problem with the spikes the server would suffer from so heres only a suggestionis it possible to have a shortcut for the change of ammo or a form of devision in the cargos of ships for it so you can put your ammo into a form of catagory eg slots for ammo then via short cuts you can chage it even if you had a sort of multiple slot layout for ammo eg every gun being loaded with two or three types of ammo and the player must click on the type for each gun to choose it only a suggestion but it could work ddaks
a staggered reload would be ok with me as long as i clic switch
if this database excuse was really true then why can 1400mm artillery only hold 10 rounds of emp
a very welcome featurethis will affect pve  i guess  more than it does affect pvp because in pvp you always have a very specific role while running level 4 missions often really calls for two  or in my case three  types of ammunition long range t2 short range t2 for taking out those nasty battleship rats and standard  faction ammunition for removing the blobs of cruisershow about some update  where   
ive given an idea of both reducing client and server overhead in my post here on the features and suggestions section
i am so supportive of this i just dont have words even a staggered reload all would be nice
hmmmpphhhi love the idea but maybe they can slightly adjust the idea with an added time but not quite the full time it would take to normally switch ya know instead of 10 seconds for switching per weapon maybe 20 total for all weapons
sorry but no most pvpers carry more then 1 type of ammo i personally like to carry 34 different types
sounds like theyre confusing the results with the implementationwe can already switch manually one at a timewhy not make a function that does that right clicking every highslot the meticulously selecting the the new type is a tedious usability problem the client could simply request it on the behalf of the userunless shortening the time between change requests would actually cause a performance problems but im already pretty quick at kicking them offnot to mention its infuriating to mis click the wrong type and have to reload that one againbut not surprisingly usability takes a huge back seat to everything for some reason
umm this already happens during fleet battles the fc will commonly announce guys were warping in at 20km range load your antimatterempmultifrequency the only difference is that currently we have to click each weapon individually to swap out the ammo types and surely its more of a server load if each player is going through the process of click gun 1  swap ammo  click gun 2  swap ammo  click gun 3  swap ammothrough a whole rack of guns rather than a single select all  swap ammo option
i understand the concerns ccp has but frankly i dont care making a simple common action take as much as 8x as long as it should to cut down on lag slightly is a terrible solution and userunfriendliness should never be encouraged the single most overdue ui fix which is saying quite a lot
weapon groupingone button to fire all weapons grouped together one button to reload them one button to change ammunition typebutfor turret groups of the same type calculations could be run for one turret and multiplied by the number of turrets in the group resulting in 67 times less load in many cases when loading ammo only a single transaction is made the group grabs x ammo for its y turrets all of whom will have fired the same number of shots meaning only one transaction takes placeone issue i can see here is with t2 and faction crystals this should be solvable by having each crystal loaded to the weapon group take damage simultaneously  balanced to provide the same number of shotscrystal on average as now  crystals with the same amount of damage could be made to stack and a weapon group would only load its turrets with such crystals if there are enough crystals in one stack to load all turretscurrently turret firing eight turrets is basicallyfiring and damage calculation and application of stat changes for turret 1firing and damage calculation and application of stat changes for turret 2firing and damage calculation and application of stat changes for turret 3firing and damage calculation and application of stat changes for turret 4firing and damage calculation and application of stat changes for turret 5firing and damage calculation and application of stat changes for turret 6firing and damage calculation and application of stat changes for turret 7firing and damage calculation and application of stat changes for turret 8id have thought server load would be decreased if when all turrets are the same to havefiring and damage calculation multiplied by 8 and application of stat changes for turret group 1tldr add weapon grouping and have it essentially make groups of the same weapon into one big gun with one big ammo hold
i could live with that too
just multiplying 1 turrets result across all 8 is a horrible idea do you want to be on the opposite side of the bs that manages to get 8 wrecking hits all at oncehowever reloading all 8 at once is a great idea
nope but id love to be facing the battleship who gets 8 misses 1 km into falloff ive got nothing against making damage burstier  its a good counter to the successive hp buffs its not like even 8x 1400mm artys wrecking will actually kill you
ccp has been discussing 00 and sovereignty internally for the past year and discussed many issues already they found that player owned station  pos  warfare is a very limited mechanic and that it revolves around the amount of dreadnoughts and other capital ships in the fleet while small ships only serve as support instead of being able to accomplish small objectives on their own the longterm plan for 00 warfare is to have multiple layers of goals and objectives instead of all fighting occurring over stations this would allow small groups to have an impact on the game instead of needing hundreds of ships to have influence in 00nathan  ccp  said that he does not believe that current largescale fleet combat is interesting for the participants mainly due to focus fireandrew  csm jade constantine  commented that current 00 pvp is siege warfare people stick to established fortresses and do not venture beyond the gates his suggestion was to include mechanics that encouraged sovereignty holders to patrol their space and have ways for roaming gangs to peck at undefended systems and steal resources therethe issue of logistics was also discussed alex stated that current pos logistics required an alliance to have powergamers that managed them around the clock he proposed to make 00 appeal to a wider audience by removing these repetitive activities that required powergaming shayne urged ccp to consider mechanics that would provide more synergy between the industrial and combat aspects of 00ccp said that they would have to balance short term achievements to the long term empire building if people could easily destroy in a day what took months to build up this would be unfair but on the other hand it should not be too hard to smoke out established entities they agreed however that the current time sinks in pos warfare are too longthis issue has been put on the rolling agenda and ccp asked the csm and the players to come up with concrete suggestions how to improve 00 warfare and sovereignty
perhaps a mechanic like the factional warfare one could be introducedlets say you can add a new level of sovereignty called constellation sovereignty that would be based on the sov level of the systems in that constellation now each level would make the pos in that constellation harder to kill in some way  increased resits more hp etc now in order to lower the constellation sov an invading force could take compounds as in fw each might have a gate that limits cap ships from coming in though not anything smaller then bs  this is 00 no need to limit the gangs  each can be taken by only a single ship if he says in the area for the right amount of time this could give black ops a role without changing the ship and force defenders to roam and patrolof course the specifics could be changed but i think the general idea would work to force players to escalate the conflict rather then just invade with capital ships
i like the idea of layers with each layer being somehow interdependant on the others  like small gang objectives making pos logistics easierharder or pos networks enhancing the ability of subcapital gangs to do their thingoverall the benefits of sovereignty need to be spread out so instead of just being based on an alliances pos network they are also derived from small gang pvp action that way when you go to attack an enemy it isnt just about sieging poses but also about dominating subcapital pvp that could even be further divided into small gang vs subcapital fleet objectives so that when you assault an enemy you have small gangs achieving disparate objectives a large subcapital fleet attacking something else and capitals sieging poses
first remove soveraignty effects from pos altogether for nowchange this to a soveraignty points type of system similar  but not identical  to the factional warfare victory points systemsov points  sovp  gained or lost past a certain treshold in a system would be used to enable an increase or a decrease of soveraignty level in that certain systemthe methods for which one can gain or lose sovp change depending on sov level  from 0 to 4 for instancesov0  no owner  could mean anybody can gain sovp for their alliance in that systemsovp would be earned by completing exploration complexes  most points value depends on complex size and type  destroying belt rats  depending on rat size but less overall than complexes  mining ore  even less point gain  and extracting moon minerals  negligible pointsm but still some points whenever any alliance reaches a certain preset treshold  which could vary depending on truesec of system  some eventtype complex is generated there next dt if they manage to keep the area clear of any intruders for longer than any intruders are present  on top of occasional local type of npc spwans which usually show up when intruders also show up  they gain sov1 next dtsov1 and so on will keep the same methods of gaining sovp as sov0 gains but in addition to that one would also gain sovp by destroying alliance war target ships in that particular system neutral ships have no effect on sovp gainsthe only way to lose sovp would be if any war target ship gains any sovp  and they gain them the same way as they would with sov0 on top of gaining some more for destroying local sovholding alliance ships if enough sovp are lost the previous sov0tosov1 event complex is spawned again next dt but only sov1 holder alliance and their wartargets matter in determining presencewhenif the sov1 holding alliance reaches the next upper treshold in sovp they need to put up at least one pos at random one pos in system is designated as primary  sov2 event and needs to be defended  ie no reinforced mode  for a certain period of time sov owners can not reassign primary pos status to any other pos manuallyif the primary  sov2 event pos is not put into reinforced for a certain time and sovp treshold is maintained sov 2 is gainedonce in sov2 each dt if the primary pos is still up and was not in reinforced the last day a decent amount of sovp are gained on top of all the other sovp earning methodssovp will be lost if the pos was in reinforced mode and even more sovp will be lost if the primary pos is destroyed or manually dismantled by the sov owners a new primary pos will be automatically and randomly be designated on next dt if sovp balance is positive and any pos remains in the system  if none remain sov level automatically gets reverted to sov1if enough sovp are lost the sov1tosov2 event will be held again at the primary pos failure reverts system to sov1sov3 is only gained if sov2 is maintained in at least 75 of the constellation systems on top of maintaining a sov2tosov3 sovp treshold in at least 50 of the constellation systems for a certain period of time while also owning an outpost in the constellationsov3 grants small amounts of sovp in each constellation system each dt even if unoccupiedonce sov3 is gained it can only be lost if sovp treshold levels get reduced below sov3 requirements in all systems in the constellation  even if all but one of the poses of the sov owner get dismantledonce that is true individual systems become vulnerable for sov1tosov2 type conditions at their primary posif the events are lost in at least 66 of the occupied systems  ie 66 of primary poses get placed in reinforced mode  sov3 is lost on next dtsov4 reached on treshold sovp levels in each system of the constellation no events needed extra sovp in all systems per dt granted
im not sure removing poses from sovereignty is a good idea i still think that poses should be the final fortress they just need some form of escalation and should not be part of the escalation your idea is also really complex i think a simplification is in order but once pos is removed from your idea it is quite similar to mine and not near as complex just to take final control of the system you have to use the current pos mechanicsthis also allows players to spread out why have 100 bs in just sitting there when you could roam around and start capturing the next constellation
the poses are only removed from sov1 conditionssov2 conditions only require one pos from the sov1 owners even if the enemies have placed dozens already  they have to remove sov1 first before getting their own sov1 instead so they can gain sov2 via possov3 conditions include sov2 conditions but on a wider scale and also promote more significant usage of outposts  it only makes sense that an outpost would be required for the cynojammer network to operatesov4 is basically just a sov3 thats maintained and reinforced for a while  you gain it by simply being active in constantly patrooling and defending your sov3 constellationit only sounds complicated its really simple  most of what you see above is just technical detailsit basically comes down to this  sov 0  no sov   first one to establish a presence gets a chance to grab the system sov 1  basic presence   only people that declare war on you can take that sov 1 away  if you can maintain your presence against wartargets you get a chance for sov 2 sov 2  base of operations   in systems with stronger presence if you can defend your base of operations  one pos  you get the next sov level sov 3  constellation superiority   you have longtime uncontested bases of operations spread out across most systems and a significant asset  an outpost  in the area  you gain access to the cynojamming network making defence easier sov 4  constellation soveraignty   your constellation superiority has gone unchallenged for a good while and the overall presence level  patrools to fight wartargets etc  has improved  you get to upgrade your base of operation any way you see fitso really it is simplenot only that but nbsi policies really have no sense anymore  one can not take sov away from you unless they wardec you first in which case theyre red neutrals could be not only tolerated but downright welcome if you wanted tosure you can still operate a nbsi policy but it doesnt make all that much sense anymoreyou can have as many pos you want without ever getting any soveraignty or you can gain sov1 without any poses at all for sov2 you only need one pos and so on as described abovehowever you dont need to actually lose a pos to lose the sov  all you need to do is not patrol your space and get a team to push your pos into reinforced use too many poses and randomness makes sure you get the wrong pos as primary besides it only becomes really vulnerable if you dont defend your space  just defending it so you have at least one more pos and enough sovp means you get to keep itonce you get to sov3 you dont even need to keep each individual pos  but then again if you dont you risk losing all back to sov1 if sov3 gets contested due to activityroaming gangs of wartargets can become a nuissance  they just chip away from your sovp totalits all about presence and superiority not about fueling poses and hotdropping capfleets
how about a wider variety of poss scaled like shipssmall structures are hard to hit with big guns but provide localized intelligence fed back to hq easy to build and destroymedium structures are more durable and provide resources of some kind like an ammo depolarge structures are capable of one or a few specific functions like providing ship repair servicessuper large structures could be like current possencouraging alliances to set up lots of smaller structures means they need to patrol larger areas and encourages roaming assault gangs as well
ill comment on two items within the opsmall groups could have goals if there were smaller targets within claimed systems that provided some effect on ownershipfor instance if a system is claimed by a single corporation  nonalliance  there could be some type of beacon that is required to be placed in the system to signify that ownership other than a stack of possthis beacon would require some type of fuels to exist  balanced against lower fuels for the poss in the system so the pos owners dont blow a gasket  that fuel should be some type of expensive material  something that is worth takingthis way a smaller group could have a target that gains them something and gives the owning corporation something to defend  thus a reason to get out there and patrolif it were me i would make this beacon something that could be shut down and pillaged but never destroyedthis beacon would need a purpose other than being used as a deed for property of a system that purpose could easily be a cyno field a constantly on  provided its fuels are not pillaged  jump target for the owners of the systemit would probably have to be something that did not register on the overview but would need to be probed out by enemy forces that way it would not be an instant bring your blob here signthree trillion cheers on this onei was involved in some of the first pos activity in the game i ran multiple poss along with my corp and i eventually quit doing it completely i also quit playing the game for nearly two years because of itwhen any aspect of a game changes from something that is fun or interesting to having any similarity whatsoever to a real life job the game loses all appeali was spending most of my time running poss there is plenty of activity that revolves around poss enough to make anyone a fulltime powergamer the fun issues of a pos are setups making deals for marketing the products gained setting up trade routes mining operations or fuel purchase agreements etc etcall of that is work it takes time skill and resources to accomplish it alladding continual tedium to the mix by having a constant need to babysit a pos is what pushes a lot of operators over the edgesomething as simple as a special fuel bay a cross between a silo and a corp hangar where additional fuels can be stored something to reduce the amount of handson time needed for fueling it could even have a penalty involved something like for every 150 units of x fuel that is transferred from this storage unit 50 will be lostthen if you wanted to get really creative a specialized skill could be used to reduce that amount by 5 per level  effectively reducing the fuel penalty to 25 from 50there will be pos owners who will object to a fuel surcharge in those cases it is a simple answer to the problem dont use the fuel storage systemfor those pos owners who are willing to spend a bit more on fuel to gain some time for other activities it could be a blessing i for one would have continued my pos activities  probably increased them as well  if there was something like this availablemy 2 centswheis
this post is much clearer i like the idea but perhaps make several poses able to hold each level or have the level escalate the number of pos you could use to keep say up to 3 for sov3 and 6 for sov 10 this allows a dug in alliance to hold space more easily and still requires the capturing of smaller installations to reduce to sov2 thus the escalation
see edit you dont need more than one pos per system to hold sov2 and if you manage to get to sov3 you dont even poses much anymore as long as you keep patrooling your space against wartargetsof course if you fail to patrool it having many poses is an advantage  but its no longer a necessityalso just having poses is no longer enoug to gain and maintain sov levels  without a constant presence and activity level wartargets can simply erode your sov levels by making you lose sovp  even without actually destroying any of your poses
i like this perhaps smaller poses could be cloaked if you just warp to a moon but could be probed out and maybe have no stront bay they might serve as a listening post not too easy to find but once you do quite easy to destroy they could be a nice place to start your covert ops from and to start a small gang from once you get small gang objectives not so sure of the roles of the others though
no what i was saying is that if you had only maxed at sov2 then the enemy would only need to destroy that one pos once you get up to sov3 they would need to destroy 3 poses to reduce you from sov2 to sov1 etc i think this will help alliances dig in since once you only need to cap beacons from sov4 down to sov2 you could basically power rush when an alliance is not really ready there needs to be some way to slow down the attack and give the defenders a chance to regroup thus my simple minded you get extra poses approachaccording to your edit pos really serve no function then which i dont like i think you should have to destroy some poses that is the final fortress but from sov 43 you must cap some plexes that require only small ships then from 32 you need to continue to cap plexes then from 21 you must destroy some of the flagged poses then from 11 enemy controlled  you must cap the flag of the system if it were which is a plex with no gate allowing cap ships ini think you should have to destroy poses they are the final barrier to the flag and require many dreads and cap ships thus the final escalation
i personally really like thishowever if not implemented very carefully you will still get a situation like thiswhere an alliance that only has members in a certain  rl  region will be at the mercy of the pecking from alliances with members in a different  rl  region
forgot to mention that i love the idea of having to be at official war with the alliance in order to start taking the compounds this might make freeports actually viable
i think we need to do away with sovereignty levels via only pos and instead compartmentalize the benefits of sovereignty into multiple layers of objectives that can be constructedattacked independently by different sorts of forces  one layer of which can still be the poses 
yep thats pretty much what everybody else has said in the thread we seem to agree maybe it will make it easy for ccp to get on the ball then
supporting akita ts suggestions in principle  sov stuff makes my head spin  make sov more like faction warfare with multiple layers and victory points disallowing certain ships types form performing captures etc im lukewarm towards the idea of 00 alliance wardecs to allow sov but i do like the possibility of freeports

why bother destroying it  just keeping it in reinforced for a while with incursions would be enough to erode your sovp additional losses to sovp for engaging your forces or farming your belts etc get enough sovp out of you and next time you put the pos in reinforced poit sov2 gone and youre back to sov1 and to get it back up o sov2 you have to actively patrool your territory again to get sovp total back up again then defend the pos long enough again without having it fall in reinforced f it does sov1 is the best you can get and eventualy you might end up losing sov1 too in favor of the roaming gangs of enemiesonce sov3 is reached it becomes very hard to lose  not only because of the cynojammer network  you dont care much about caps anyway pos destruction is no longer mandatory only pushing the pos in reinforced is which would be hard to prevent if the enemy is persostent and mobile enough even if its just a battleship fleet   but also because you need to lose a lot of sovp all over the place in the constellation first too  while sov3 grants a constant trickle of sovp everywhere to begin with  and any engagements that dont end in the attackers favour only reinforce your sovp total so basically once you gained sov3 you just need to hold the constellation reasonably secure and not much elseonly if you fail pretty much all across the entire constellation at keeping the upper hand afterwards you can start risking to lose sov3 if too many of your existing poses get pushed in reinforced mode  then you go back to sov2 all over the place which is in itself also hard to lose  but to gain sov3 back youd need to retake and hold control of the consteallation they serve the purpose of being your bases of operation and providing you with some degree of free sovp if not succesfully disabled  on top of additional free sovp from sov3sov4 control and the regular sovp gained by daytoday operations like beltratting mining and so on basically they give you a little bit of advantage in sovp gains  not huge but some  a place to withdraw from destruction and wait for reinforcements  if you get destroyed your alliances loses sovp  but by baiting the enemy while reinforcements arrive to beat them or using the pos to help you destroye them you gain additional sovp  and last but not least form the last line of defence to help you maintain the higher sov levelshowever you can not just hide behind the shields  if the pos goes in reinforced when the sov decrease is due its gone you have to fight both before  to not get to the point where you can lose sov  but also when you can lose itwell eventually you will want to destroy all enemy poses anyway as they give them safe points to launch assaults on you  but the control is not decided by pos amount instead on activity levels sitting behind pos shields and never coming out to play doesnt give you much
forest from the treesproblem with sov is that1 too many things can claim sov easaly  this means people use npc structures  pos  to conquor systems whilst avoiding pvp2 sov claiming poss are too cheap so people avoid risking dreads to defend them and in many cases use them as a speedbump to try to bore attackerskeep it simple have less things in a system that can claim sov  eg planets perhaps even a star  have a struture or xlarge pos or whatever that overrides existing sov in system in the same way a large tower overrides a medium towers sov claims if that costs a huge amount only then will it force people to defend iteither way  everone has their own version of a perfect answer the technicalities of the perfect solution needs to take note of the key issues with the current system which i noted above i do not care what the solution is but it should address the two key points i mention
i have an alternative suggestion i feel merits discussion regarding this issue remove link between pos and sov level gain make sov level  based introduce small civilian structures to give you sov  insteadexamplejust like now if alliance a have more large pos than alliance b they get sovereignty over the systemwhen you take sov you start at 0 and you then have to build small and medium sized deadspacestyle structures like schools and hospitals orbital farms etc to cater for an npc populations needsthese in turn give you sov  which in turn gives you bonuses and shiny toysthis then gives the following benefits which i think solves most of the major problems of 00 sov small and medium sized attackers can hit civilian infrastructure to reduce sov  and do damage relative to their size and skill even if they cant take a system industrialists get to put effort and skill into managing systems rather than mechanically fuelling pos large empires in deep 00 can still exist but require more than just 5 weeks of no one attacking them to get powerful tools like cyno jammers and jump bridges dreads and pos still required to actually take system can practice scortched earth retreat or leave civilian infrastructure intact for future return can raid weaker neighbours territories to stop them building up infrastructure
basically id argue getting rid of steps in the system and make it sliding scale make it so the effort and skill an attacker puts in is relative to the damage they can do to a defenderalso decouple pos warfare from the sov levels that way you still need the epic large scale battles to actually take a system but to make the most of a system you own build an empire you still need sov but you also need the industrialists to come in and develop a systemedit  lord waratron id say you need more npc structures but to spread the value attached to each across all of them atm far too much is placed on just one or two pos  cyno jammer and jb pos  and no one will risk their ships defending anything elseedit 2 reading above replies sounds a lot like capture the flag im thinking something more like culture points in civ iv
at spoon  lord wid say its not even about structures or no structures  its about what sovereignty actually grants you stripping the individual benefits out of the sovereignty equation and figuring out a new way of awarding them that is based more on player action and combat is the way to go i think the flaw in sovereignty is that its just a build more to get more linear system instead we could have each benefit governed by discreet mechanics so you can attack say the fuel efficiency of the enemy poses or their jump bridge network or their cynojammers without having to deal with poses and seiging
any solution is perfectly valid as long as it1 simplifies sov warfare  ie not make the whole thing more complex and time consuming2 forces people to fight to with ships insted of a chepo pve structure to tie up a attacking pvp force as a delaying tactic or even used by attackers to spam faster than the defenders can remove them
myself and some alliance mates have been discussing this issue on and off for a long while now and have fairly similar conclusions to akitamechanic system is currently neutral any corp or alliance can anchor structures in systemcorp a wants control of system corp b wants the samecontested system will have a calculated sov value  points are calculated by assesing the resource value of system 50 points for a gate 50 points for a npc station 10 points a moon 5 points a roid belt etc in this case the system has a sov value of 500  example corp a and b both declare they want sov of system  maybe similar to the war dec mechanic although declaration is made against the system in question each active member of either corp a or b present in that system will earn sov capture points  active being undocked and uncloaked points are allocated for every 15min being active  example each pilot will get 5 points for each full 15min active in system each system should have a hard limit for the number of pilots per corp that can gain capture points  example system with sov value of 500 would allow only 5 pilots per corp to accrue capture points sov value of 1000 would allow 10 etc each system should have a hard limit for the time between sov level changes  ie sov can only change once every 510 days the first corp to achieve a clear 500 capture points will gain system sov lvl1  ie if corp a achieve 750 capture points and corp b 250 this would give 500 clear points system is currently at sov 1 by corp a only corp a can anchor in systemcorp a will now receive some system wide benefits reduceds office rental better refine greater bounties reduces pos fuel reqs etc etccorp a want sov 2 in system for even more benefits the same mechanic would be used with a points multiplier so 750 clear points are req for this lvlat sov 2 the system benefits are greater with more being added  lvl4  cyno jammer cap ship yards etc at sov lvl 2 all anchored structures in system will default to the sov holders  this is to provide an alternate to pos sieges from sov 1 onward all pos in system will add defensive sov points to system   ie base sov points  500 at sov 1 corp a anchor 2 x large pos which adds 2 x 250 points  1000 defensive sov value now corp b are back and really want sov in this systemcorp a have sov 2 and 2 large pos meaning that corp b need a clear 1000 capture points to lower the sov to 1corp b can choose to attack  put in reinforcedremove  the 2 x pos thus removing the defensive bonus and thus only need 500 clear capture points or they can choose to control the system corp b dont have many cap ships so decide not to attack the pos but manage to completely control the system and thus achieve 1000 clear sov points and sov drops to lvl1corp b maintain this pressure until sov goes to neutral then lvl1 then lvl2 in favour of corp bduring this time corp a have been unable to get access to their 2 pos and thus owenership is transferred to corp b  spoils of war some other ideas that we threw aroundpos hitpoints should be adjusted downwards  drastically  at the highest lvl of sov the controlling corpalliance can control certain npc mechanics restrict docking at stn restrict jump clone use etcat varying lvls of sov newbetter anchorable modules can be deployed 20au cloak jammer cyno jammers etctldrsov should be about controlling a system not the number of pos present  stop pos spamming there should be hard limits set to discourage sov blobbing and repeated sov flipping  reduce blobbing there should be far more benefits given to sov holders  get more people into 00 there should be far more disadvantages to attacking forces  not just omg 10 pos to kill there should be a method to capture a system without removing enemy pos  reduce the need for large scale cap warfare there should be a method to capture enemy pos when sov has been gained
akita i still think that actually destroying several poses would really help keep dreads and poses from being obsoleteon a note of using poses as staging points perhaps make it so that at a certain sov level neutrals and enemies cannot anchor poses within a constellation this might make a real front appear since you would have to fight your way up to the particular main system rather then just invading the main system right away
i wrote the following back in jan 2004 judging by the file timestamp and actually send it of to ccp as a proposalnote that this is before pos where introduced to the gamewhile 45 years old eve only just beeing 6 months old most  not all  of it can stand unedited so ill simply post as iscliffnoteslots of cheap and easily killed structuresthe idea beeing to have alliances deploy many of these if they want to dig inconversely it means that an attacker will not need a 500 man blob in order to take out each targetand also that there will most likely be so many targets that its unfeasible to defend all at the same time giving small roving gangs a chance to weave and dudge the defenders while still nibbling away at the defensesit has the potential for giving more fluid frontlines instead of a few must kill big targetsheres the ancient textproposal for territory claiming structures  tcs the fundamentals of this idea is to have frontlines constantly moving back and forthto accomplish this tcs should not be overly expensive so that the loss of one would not be a devestating blowrather they should be fairly easy to replace  but still take some effort the basic idea beeing that an alliance  maybe even a corp  would scatter these structures all over in order to claim a territorythat way alliances would have some physical object to defend rather then the current  kill all you see and the territory is yoursthe structure itself should be undefendedthe structure should have enough hp to withstand say 20 bships for 5 hours  thus give the defenders time to responsea price for such a structure should be in the range of 50m isk  remember a lot will be needed and most likely constantly replaced id also like to see 2 cheaper versions of the tcs which would cost less and have less hpsay a 25m and a 10m version  with respectivly fewer hps it would then become a tactical decision which lvl of tcs to place where  as long as you have the majority of tcs hps in a system  its yours also  the larger an area you wish to claim  the more its going to cost youassuming alliances are implemented tcs should be deployable by both alliances and corps  maybe only alliances in a given system tcs can only be placed near stargates and stationsthis would mean that some systems would become strategically more important as they would be easier to defend as it would take longer for an attacking force to wipe out all the tcs  and indeed new ones could be placed in place of those destroyed while the attackers attacks the next tcs also means that an attacker wanting to place tcs of their own has to take out existing tcs if all slots  gatesstations  are already occupied by tcsit should also be able for more than one party  alliancecorp  to place tcs in a system  as long as there is a free gatestation whichever party has most tcs hp  3 types with diff hps remember  in a given system will be said to be in control of the systemi suggest that the current hp of tcs is counted towards this total  and not its max hp example  alliance a has 2 50m isk tcs in a system but both with less than 50 hp  because of prior attacks  and alliance b has only one 50m tcs but its at 100 health  and thus alliance b has more tcs hp in the system and is thus declared in control of the system
a tcs should repair itself over time  but it should be very slow  as they have a lot of hp a tcs should be able to repair itself fully  from 1 hp to max  over a period of say 3 days  or something similar tcs should ofc not be deployable in the middle of empire space as those systems are claimed by the empiresaywhere outside empire controlled space should be finethis includes  npc  pirate claimed space  its after all free for all in those places  and the residing npc rats just might decide to pay the player deployed tcs a visit every so often those are the basicsnow for all the possible features with this  and theres alot 1 to make the tcs actually having a purpose  apart from signifying ownership of a region  except beeing some very expensive bulls eyes for roving pirates whishing to grief the alliances one idea would be to bestow some kind of bonus on the alliance corp  having the control of the system  when fighting in that system it makes sense afterall that the defenders have an edge as defenders are usually entrenched in one way or anotherattacking is usually more expensive than defendingthe possibility of bonus is almost endlessa  bonus to damageb  bonus to rangec  bonues to tracking speedetcetcetcd  one intersting bonus could be that of  defenders  owners of the majority tcs hp  can warp to safespots where others are hiding  they are after all the defenders and should know the system well  very vague rp reason i know  or simply because the tcs have some tracking gizmo build in  triangulation  making it possiblebottom line is  there are a ton of different possibilitites open for adding one sort of bonus or another to the defendersit could also work in reverse ofc  ie giving the attackers a negative bonus of some sort how about the inability to warp out from battle around a tcs if you are the attacker  the tcs have long long range scramblers  pretty radical i know but just to show that anything can be thought up really2 say a tcs gets knocked down below 13 health  it no longer is able to repair itselfit needs mineralscomponentsisk in order to get vital repair facilities up to speed again before it can begin its self repairing againthus puts an emphasis on the alliance to get that done if at all possible and not just let it sit there taking care of itself ofc most likely an attacking force able to knock down a tcs to 13 hp will most likely finish it of anyhow 3 unless an alliance corp  has declared war on the alliance owning the tcs it can not be attackedthis would somehow inhibit roving pirates to grief the alliances corps  owning the tcs opens up the whole can of consentual vs nonconcentual wars debate 4 tcs has an upkeep that has to be paidcould be isk andor itemsi prefer some combination  because if a tcs once a week requires some materials in order to function it means that aliances cant just deploy it  and then just leave it there for good without bothering more about itif the materialsisk is not supplied on time the max hp of the tcs drops by 10  or something and it would take double the normal amount of materialsisk to get back those lost 10 again5 lots and lots and lots more details can be thought upthe above are only suggestions  im sure there are pretty many other good ideas that could be put in to actionsome of the suggestions might even have flaws i havent spotted etsso  its nothing more than a deabate starter
yes please  top of the list would be a poll option for these issues instead of going by broken post counting
first off horay for the standard fallacies about all alliances being huge and automatically overwhelming everything and also i like the idea that this is going to keep big experienced groups of players out with the way things areright now as however many naysayers have suggested its perfectly possible for an alliance to group into a corp and go join up i dont have numbers but i rather suspect this has happened quite a bit except hey theres these rp alliances that went and formed a collection of likeminded corps each with different viewpoints who have no ic reason given to dissolve their separate identities so the group of people who in a lot of cases icly would be most about signing up wontas for keeping the experience level down i dont know if you guys have noticed but 0utbreak went and signed up among othersi mean id be perfectly happy if it were restricted to nonsov holding alliances and i suspect most others would too but alliance doesnt automatically mean huge nor does it mean nullsec
i support this with 2 stipulations  both already proposed 1 multiple members of 1 alliance should not be allowed to sign up with opposing factions2 a corporation should not be eligible if they are in an alliance that holds sovereignty this would help stop the goons and other large alliances from dominating fw
ccp stated that they have a dilemma where contracting can on one hand be more effective where people have more options and better deals or can be a backalley trading system where people can scam each other in the worst case on the other hand ccp believes that the contract system could use some more utility but should not grant players much more information as a fully transparent and effective system would also limit the opportunities for players to make a profit they want the csm and the players to think about the direction the contract system should take and are open to suggestions and improvementsthe 10 increment in bids is agreed to be too high a percentage but it should not be too low either otherwise it would turn into 001 warfare the csm is tasked to determine the appropriate percentage and relay it back to ccp who will analyze it and adjust the percentage
theres no single flat percentage that will be any goodit has to be reasonable for an item that costs 1000 isk as well as one that costs 30000000000 iskim sure theres some sort of function that would come up with a reasonable value but its not a simple multiplication by a fraction
does it have to be a percent why not a floating value with minimums and maximums
why not have it tier based rather than percentageeg001  10000 isk  100isk charge10001  50000 isk  500isk charge50001  100000 isk  1000isk charge100001  500k  5k chargeetc
the only problem i have with contracts is not being able to bid on auctions  or accept another type of public contract  from a region other than the one where the item being auctioned resides  the other day i had to travel 25 jumps oneway to get to the region that had an auction on which i wanted to bid is there a gameplay reason for this or is it just a technical issue any chance of this being changed
add an option to allow the one setting up a contract to set the bid increment its the way it works on the forums and it works fine as the seller im not interested in 001 isk wars but in relevant incrementsif you auction something in the 1 billion range where the price is rather stable say fluctuating within a 100 mil spread you might want an auction that starts at 1 bil with buyout 11 bil with 10 mil static increments if you have a cool faction item but no price awareness you might want an auction starting at 1 mil still with 10 mil incrementsi want to be able to set those fixed amounts for every auctionstarting bidreserve  only public ones buyoutbid incrementif the reserve is set and not met the contract system should give the seller a choice to accept or reject the highest bid if it is met the auction works as now
not gunna happen but supportedabout as likely as unnerfing the sinbut supported
given that ccp has just said that the sale of pos researchconstruction slots publicly is simply not in the cards ive come up with an alternate proposal for how to do the same thing its a bit bizarre but i think it addresses a lot of the issues pretty effectively corporations already have station space all over highsec in the form of their offices why not allow players to upgrade their offices to give themselves research and manufacturing lines and then allow those to be sold publicly theres no real ownership issues and it would dramatically alleviate the current severe shortage of lines without requiring ccp to put players in the pos slot market out of business entirely and itd be marketcontrolled which would mean it could deal with future shortages without developer intervention my idea would basically be to have some sort of item youd take to a station similar in principle to an outpost upgrade though playerbuilt instead of npc supplied and install it in your office youd pay some amount of extra rent for it and youd have some sort of interface probably through the corp management screen that controls offices to allow you to reserve the spots for internal use or for you to sell them externally also to prevent chaos the 30day limit on research length would instead be a limit equal to the amount of time you have the office rented for and of course youd allow offices to be rented for long periods of time in advance  though you could also set it to be shorter if you wanted to this also has the nice effect of allowing capital ship bpos to be researched in npc stations since their research time is far too long for the 30day limit im being deliberately hazy on the details of how the ui would be implemented since i havent ever been ceo for long enough to wade through the current corp management ui so if im wrong on a detail i apologize but the proposal is generic enough that my point should get through even if ive bobbled a minor aspect of it
nicely saidalso 00 space in general needs a buff  in any given region  in terms of ratting nonnpc space  there are a handful of systems where you can make more isk than running missions in empire  if someone or multiple people didnt get there first  not just speaking as a goon  happened in ascn and huzzah as wel 
i am by no means a veteran to game or to 00 logisticsbut isnt the problem that logistics are actually too easy jump bridges carriers jfs and all that jazz makes it possible to jump across incredible distances within a minimum amount of time which again makes it possible for a few huge entities to control vast amount of space at the same time losing ships are a not an issue as more can always be brought to 00 with a snap of the fingersi am not saying that logistics werent boring but frankly having ops such as those you say ascn had would have been epic fighting arenas where you needed a big support fleet and an enemy fleet could rip a hole in the alliance wallet however small a hole it might be  if they caught the logistics train i realise ofcourse that the freighters were far too weak to stand up against such an onslaught and that should be fixedi know alot will probably disagree but i find the easy logistics to and from 00 to be doing more harm than good in terms of fights consequences of losing ships and the control of regions by single entities
well i agree with most of the rest but the drone parteven if we get the refineable we still need someone with ok refine skill to get the mins besides that the drones are annoying and they dont offer security status bounty faction modules etc there needs to be something that makes the region worthwhile except for using the moons to make caps
i disaggree currently you have 3 super blocks soaking up all the nice moons all over the galaxy if you make it so small groups can affect that ability that would require different strategies like staying home soverignty could be tested without getting game breaking gangs together to crash nodes all things in 00 would change based on not allowing the overviewhuge hp sinks dictate the course of action
well written and well thought out post whilst im not totally convinced that the mineral crash can be directly attributed to the drone regions or that that was necessarily a totally bad thing the remainder of the issues are important enough to merit consideration
agree with all of this  but particularly the points on pos anchioring and carriers
would not change the issue that out of the 4 rare moon mins two of them make up 80 of the entire t2 reaction line yes thats right you heard it correct 80 of everything t2 comes from only 2 of the rare moon minsif you leave everything alone with sov and pos the distribution model for reactions has to change
but thats why they are special and why people care the simple fact they are so precious is why people go to great lengths to aquire those moons if you change the ratio then who gives a flyin rats a i want to change the pos system for moar fights with less lag biggest problem in 00 not moar carebears
its not read my post again jb requires sov from point a to point b which isnt possible for many regions very far empire  that includes cobalt edge logistics werent meant to give fights directly they were meant to supply the fights up in 00 i wouldnt call setting up secret towers in hostile space and spending billions of isk on a ship to facilitate logistics and still being limited easy
a ah drone using faction ship would be nice
note that theres already 2x minnie  gallente combos allow 2x caldari  amarr combes tooblue sleek hull is nice make them armor tanking ships with split railmissile weaponsoh and apoc for bs blood is already using geddeon
pUFFFDtur  ccp  started off by saying that the csm should come up with solutions if the existing rules do not work and write a guide for the next csm how problems were overcome it will be allowed for the chairman to stand down and as a side note pUFFFDtur  ccp  noted that changes will be made to the way alternates are handled under the current system so that their participation does not count as a termandrew  csm jade constantine  wished to have the chairman role electable as he believed that all the roles should be agreed on by the majority of the councilsean  csm darius johnson  said that he had no problem with the current way the chairman is elected but rather with the roles and responsibilities assigned to the chairmanccp also indicated that there were concerns with the continuity of the csm and would like a system put in place where the next csm can easily pick up where the previous one left off knowledge and experience would need to be passed on and everything would need to be properly documented current csm members should advise the next csmeva  csm ankhesentapemkah  expressed concern with the lack of a proper medium to record knowledge and urged for a csm forum subversion or wiki to be set up as soon as possible to contain and preserve all information and make it easy for the next csm to continue running projects
im still annoyed that this one had to go this far jade should have stepped down on day 1 and rerun and used precedent to keep his successors in line the issue being brought doesnt bother me to change the rules and put harder limits on the position but it being relevant does
ccp realized that even though they do not plan to remove suicide ganking completely todays suicide gank mechanics are too biased in the gankers favor and they have set up a task force to look into suicide ganking and crime and punishment in generalfor the short term they plan to increase the security hit for crime in highsec space and make sure that all ship kills will be counted as kills with the matching sec hit for everyone that participated ccp also considers influencing the sec hit penalty based on the security status of the victimmid term the plans are to look into suicide ganking and the insurance payout once they have made sure that new players are not impacted by this too much and have extra security in place so that accidents should not be punishedin the long term they plan to have criminal records for players with the appropriate consequences tradable killrights are also on the table to let players deal with criminals instead of just concord being responsible for securityalex  csm bane glorious  said that most suicide gankers already thought of ratting to regain security status as painfulbecause a lot of suicide ganking occurs from npc corporations it was considered to move criminal offenders out of the npc corporations into pirate npc corporations if they committed too many crimeseva  csm ankhesentapemkah  reacted to this that it could be standing based like factional warfare where a player would be ejected out of the militia if their standing with the faction became too low various people added to this that criminals could lose standing with the faction where they committed their crimes in addition to the security status hit as for the bounty system it was suggested that the bounty could be paid out in parts with the amount being paid out at a moment depending on the damage inflicted on the criminal so that a criminal could still have bounty remaining after the first time he was killed
how can ccp realize this how can any sane person acknowledge this its the same mechanics as before caving in to whinesedit as there is no way to graphically show disagreement with a topic ill post an image insteadplease visit your user settings to reenable images
this should curb somewhat the gankforlulz incidents nice to see youre atleast working on making it more interesting for the aggressors good writeup  
great news
simple stop insurance pay outs for ships destroyed by concord
fixed that for you
this might be a nice addition but with the extra that this would only apply to people with a positive sec status to begin with two pirates shooting each other back to positive sec status does somewhat defeat the principle
this please
put a cool down of hours before a player target counts for status updates
excellent the players of eve thank the panel for addressing this problem stronger and longer pentalies for this must be applied thank you
did they realize they have two heads as well how do you just realize this is right up there with carriers the swiss army of evecloak scout dont afk wow pretty hard i never realized that can i have a titan now
tradeable killrights sounds promising as long as ccp is able to track the biomassed exalts and make the contract carry over
sorry but hav we missed the obviousness of dont give a ganker insurance because obviously he has been shot by concord meaning they obviously commited the crime it takes forever to get your sec status back up in th game if your low so having an increased it is just meaning that gankers waste more time by bringing in the insurance lost due to concord idea then gankers are not only ratting their sec up but also their isk at the same time so its a double whammy therethis sounds much like a biased we have too many players who dont like fighting and think the game should only be industry and good sorta the forces of good vs the forces of evilthe criminal records is a nice idea and is ralistic really and will give a slightly nicer edge but bring in the sec hit part and it will turn eve into a crunching game much the same as any other mmorpg out theredaks
it doesnt just sound like we have too many players who dont like fighting and think the game should only be industry and good it is like it most of the people who gets ganked has the means to avoid ganking  they are just lazy whiners who come to the forums to whine en masse and then have the game mechanics bent to their will
from an isk stand point the ganker has no   risk insurance pays for nearly all of it now look at the risk involved from the side of the gankee they risk not only their cargo but their ship which in the case of a frighter is hundreds of millions basically i think you should have to risk more to gank more then just a small insurance payment were saying that the barrier to entry to ganking should be higher why should my hold full of trit but a viable target note i said viable not most attractive you could in theory make isk by ganking haulers full of trit and make isk which is very dumb
how about an actual bounty hunter designation and maybe new sheriff in town too how thats achieved up to you but i suggest he can appoint deputys too
how about fixing the bounty system first   as is stands now you put bounty on some one you might as well be transferring it directly into his wallet
unfortunately i think this topic is skewed by emo posts on all parties with out really looking at this from a far i would really like to see what the numbers are on how many ganks  concord response  in a certain area are in relation to how much traffic in a given period what this should tell us is how much risk the freighterhauler pilot has by moving there stuff is it a 20 chance of being ganked 30 or is it fairly lowi understand that there are a lot of posts stating that the ganker does not face really that much risk but what is the risk for the ganker what is the time  which is equal in money  to grind sec status back up to reenter high sec and is the proportionate with the loss of the gankeei have always heard that the reward has to or should be equal to the risk are the parties involved sharing equal risk what is the true cost on both sides in real isk and time with the current mechanics i think if we can finally establish what the true risk is on both parts i think we can then proceed to balance the current game play but as it stands now it is just an emo whine fest
exactly i think when a person gets a bounty put on his head you dont just get it for pod killing them what should happen is you have to go into the bounty system and accept the bounty contract this not only allows you to hunt this specific person anywhere but entitles you to the rewards of the bountymaybe make a bounty hunter school or something for you to be able to do this some sort of work should be required to become a bounty hunter imho i dunno but seems like fun to be a true bounty hunter in game and not just paid for situational opportunitysuicide ganking make empire non war target aggression criminal aggression   14 dps output on your ship have fun trying to kill a fly after thatkhonn
the problem is that insurance makes the gank nearfree its fine except for the fact that the ganker loses next to nothing fix insurance and this problem goes back down to reasonable levels
for your equation it is  0 as he is getting isk doing the grinding and very good isk if he is grinding in 00so the proportion iscost of suicide gank 510 of total ship and fitting value  thank to insurance scam   cost to ganked pilot 510 at least of ganked ship  often more as they are riggedt2freighters full cargogains of suicide ganker survived cargoganked  0cost of sec loss fairly long time ratting to recovergain of sec loss bountiesdrops of the rats killed for recovering the lossdont seem so hard for gankers
is this wrangle talking or the puppet master ryanddskunk
as long as this doesnt consist of more modal fracking dialogsive been a suicide ganker ive been the victim of suicide ganking attempts and i support transferable killrights ill go be a bad boy just so some targets with some teeth come after me for some 1v1blob warfare sucks even small gang warfare is generally very one sided i fully support anything that allows me to 1v1 moreits extremely painful it takes about four dedicated hours of ratting in 00 to regain the sec hit from a single ship kill and theres no guarantee you even got anything from the ship killgood ideathe bounty system is completely broken any time the bounty becomes worth collecting a friend or corpmate collects itkill rights need to be transferable for isk or for free i would happily buy tons of kill rights just for the pvp it would bring me i would happily gank people just so there more kill rights out there for mefactional warfare as ive experienced it is a giant stupid blobfest its not the answer transferable kill rights will go a long way
wrangler im going to buy you a new dress to go along with your new pretty vision of a warm cuddly universe what size are you
excellentvery niceagreed as wellthe only thing i think needs to be added is to make sure that even the worst offender has some way of crawling back something besides ratting or missioning preferably something dealing with pvp rather than just grinding rats forever
another point where i think i will get a lot of support how are us good miners supposed to deal with macros in empire reporting does not work anymore as there are just too darn many  take a look at any system in empire with an ice belt some day or all the isk for cash spammers in the rookie channels  so i and several others i know have resorted to the only option we have and that is to knock the macros ships out cost them some isk and mining time  hopefully more mining time than the ship is worth  and wait for them to come back rinse and repeat making the sec hit even tougher just balances things in their favor i honestly think it already is a pain in the butt enough to get your sec status back up especially if you are an empire hugger like myself  yes i do admit it hey maybe theycould knock all players out of the starting corps who get above a certain level of skill points ie they corp decides they leave the nest that would leave us the avenue of war deccing those corps on our own and going after them
if the sec hit is just the hit for the kill applied to all and void insurance i can live with that but if the sec hit goes beyond that its a case of pandering to the bigger subscriber base cash flow always wins in the end
i am going to assume that xaen is correct and 4 hours  average  in 00 space will clear the hit of 1 kill my question is why would any amount of ratting in 00 space raise your security standing with concord that totally ignores security hits in 00 if killing and podding another player in 00 space will not lower your standing with concord  a correct function i might add  then ratting in that system should have no affect as wellmodify all security hits or bumps by the posted security level of the system  for concord only  now those who commit criminal acts will be paying with more then a few hours of ratting in  with sovereignty and control  relative safety to counter the security hit on suicide gankingas concord showing up is a function of suicide ganking if the attacker s  are in a npc corp  unable to be wardeced  lets have concord show up faster so that odds are they will not get the ship killed in time
currently suicide ganking is the only way to attack large numbers of podpilots who intentionally join npc corps where they cannot be wardeced this includes logistic alts for nearly everyone whose main is in 00 as well as large numbers of industrialistsinventorsminers who primarily reside in empire the npc corp mechanic allows these characters to avoid wardecs indefinitely making it impossible to legally interfere with their activities suicideganking has become the only way to interdict empire operations  making it even harder makes empire more of a safehaven than it already is major alliances at war with each other shouldnt be able to conduct their logistics and other business operations in complete safety despite ongoing hostilitiesany change that makes suicide ganking more difficult reduces the risk of any empire logistics and commerce with no recourse for the people that seek to disrupt said activities the counterpoint being of course that there is currently very little financial risk to suicide ganking and that riskrewardeffort is not at all balanced for the ganker and gankee there are a couple problems with some of the proposed solutions adding faction standing hits would be insanity as there is currently no real way to repair that damage  which breaks our delicate riskreward balance completely  increasing secstatus hits or reducing insurance gives everyone carte blanche to move though empire in 100 safety  on an alt by themselves these arent great solutions either  they make it to easy to sidestep legitimate attacks in order to keep things in line it would need to be possible to issue wardecs against these pilots there are numerous ways to encourage people to leave npc corps for wardecable pc corps almost all of them would work just fine the goal of course is to allow player groups to specifically target and attack each other while at the same time making randomopportunistic attacks less profitableeve isnt supposed to provide ultimate safety and it seems the goal of most of the antiganking crowd is just that while i can freely admit that suicide ganking is a little too cheapeasy at present the problem remains that it is the only option available for attacking a huge number of characters taking away that option leaves far too many pilots operating in complete safety and reward without risk is a broken game mechanic the reality is that over 90 of suicide ganks can already be easily defeated using existing game mechanics the effort and investment necessary to do so is out of line with the difficulty of ganking in many cases though which is why things need to be tweaked slightly however making empire space too safe brings its own set of problems and would ultimately lead to a much less interesting game
well the rats are bountied by concord that reaches through out eve same as a player that has a bounty sanctioned by concord getting podded in 00 the player that pod him will receive the bounty your line of thinking would cancel out the opportunity in podding a pirate in 00 and receiving the bounty because in 00 concord does not applyyou receive a sec bump once every 15 minutes and it relates to what rat you kill at the time it does not matter how much and how big the rats you have been killing it just pertains to the rat you kill during the time you are able to bump your sec statusso in one hour you will receive a slight bump to your sec status and it is also dependent on how low you are a 10 will take weeks if not more of solid ratting with doing nothing else just to stick there head into a 5 system so using 4 hours to erase one kill is kind of wrong it is based on a lot of different factors
seems fairif eve wants to be realistic  treating criminals like criminals is a good place to start
goon makes some valid points here but one is just ridiculous and im sick of hearing about itquote taking away that option leaves far too many pilots operating in complete safety and reward without risk is a broken game mechanicno one wants to be harassed by other players thats why they are in highsec to begin with
i cant remember who im quoting here but one of my favourite eve sigs is something like by clicking this button pic of undock button  you consent to possible pvp its an accurate statement  you fly you risk death again quoting a sig  concord provide consequences not security  only you can do that thats eve  highsec just raises the costs of harassment it doesnt eliminate them
why must bounties and security bumpshits be tiedi have no problem with bounties places on a target by an enemy of that target to be paid to the pilot that fills the contract on that bounty  i support the trading of kill rights also i just want to see the security bumpshits changed adjusted by the security level of the system pirates and antipirates could blast away at each other on 01 space and the security hit would be 10 of the current amount 10 times the attacks for the same security loss you get now but as xaen pointed out taking a clone trip down to that area in 00 space wjhere your alliance rules with an iron hand and popping rats for a few hours and you are right back to that security rating you had before and from what i have read if you can pop between 2 systems you can get twice the security bumps while ratting  this tactic may have been what xaen was talking about with his 4 hour estimate i would also point out there are not very many people sec level 10  or even under 5  doing suicide gank type attacks
they fixed that little trick about hopping systems a long time ago so it no longer applies also i am not sure how many losec pirates you know of are a part of an alliance that reside in 00 most pirates i am know look down at 00 type alliances so are you looking at them in this equation goons are not the only ones doing this because i do not think they care one way or another who this impacts are the pirates from the lo sec regions that can not have that warm fuzzy iron fist alliance ratting parties you are speaking ofso you can not bump you sec status by jumping systems it no longer works the 4 hour statement based on assumption is wrong so now we need to really look at what the true penalty is and instead of levying a penalty based on an assumption we now should be able to increase the penalty reasonably with out destroying game play so now we can say ok it takes approximately 16 hours to increase your sec status by 5 so how much longer should it be
technically it is 9939 and takes a cyber v implant and rank 4 or 5 skill at level v to hit it for the best ores just saying technically
i actualy love the rd agents idea 
matt  ccp  explained that ccps goal of factional warfare was to introduce more players to pvp and that it was not intended as endgame pvp which they believe is 00 warfare factional warfare is to prepare players for 00 warfare alliances partaking in factional warfare would open a can of worms to them for instance that factional warfare would move interalliance conflicts out of 00 where they belong and into sovereign empire space and that experienced alliance pilots would gank new players that want to learn about pvp in factional warfarefrom a technical aspect it is impossible for an alliance as a whole to join factional warfare it is possible to allow corporations in an alliance to sign up as this feature is currently blocked and this block could be lifted andrew  csm jade constantine  reacted that there are disadvantages for a whole alliance to sign up as their industrialist part could no longer enter certain parts of empire space and that they are free to shoot at by the enemy militias while griefers that want to gank new players in factional warfare easily get around the limitations by just setting up a separate corporation on the other hand roleplaying alliances which might not have 00 assets are currently left out while they would benefit greatly from factional warfarematt  ccp  argued that if corporations in alliances would be allowed to join factional warfare individual corporations might sign up with opposing factions making them each others enemy through factional warfare and each others ally through the alliance which would result in a logical paradoxccp said that they would rather want to make the shiny features of factional warfare available to alliances and 00 combat this would include a rank system for corporations  and make 00 warfare more interesting by having strategic locations to fight over like in factional warfare rather than using the resources to make factional warfare available for alliances andrew  csm jade constantine  noted that just quickfixing factional warfare and allowing corporations in alliances to participate would be enough to please a lot of people matt  ccp  replied that ccp will first look how factional warfare will develop in the future before making any rushed adjustments but that they will look into making factional warfare available to corporations in alliances with the limitation that corporations in the same alliance can only sign up with one and the same faction
i think alliances as a whole should never have the ability to join a milia for faction war for the simple fact that it opens up a whole new can of worms alliances are somewhat on the same level of militias and intertwining them breaks the entire fw credibility and racial divide fw needs to be kept pure based on standings alliances are far to vast to have every single person accept which militia would be appropriate as for corps within alliances being able to join i also find that to be inappropriate what would stop an alliance from joining all its corps to a militia the issues from all this outweigh what eve currently has in place for fwbesides not all corps can join an alliance those are player based and run alliances always have that option to secure themselves militias do notalliances and corps in alliances need to be kept excluded from fw
what i read from this statement was that the fw mechanics are being considered as the multiobjective role model for revamping 00 soverigntyyes soverignty needs to be redoneyes soverignty needs to be disconnected from possyes small gang objectives is better than blobsno alliances should not become part of fwas much as i would like to do some fw from time to time i wont leave my alliance to do so thats my choice and i cant have my cake and eat it too
your opinion fortunately its in the minority and 63 csm reps have voted to escalate the issue for the 2nd formal meeting and advise this small fix is deployed as soon as possible for the record im convinced your fears are groundless and fw will be very much enhanced and improved by allowing alliance corporations to join
how many of those reps are part of an alliance already seems a bit lopsided and quite an inaccurate measure of the militia and nonalliance player base not to mention your boldface assumption that my opinion is the minority lets get one thing straight i have no fears of you your corp or your alliance my ideas and thoughts are for the pure game as a whole personally i think you are losing your debate but keep trying to force it its quite obvious you have a personal agenda nothing of what you say or do shows any sympathy to this game or its players in an overall environment
as has been said before if it is fws goal to introduce people to pvp it is simply idiotic to unilaterally exclude them from the alliances where the endgame pvp existsedit votey
well 63 reps voted aye on the issue and represent a clear majority of the voting electorate thats very clear sure 3 of those reps are taking a personal interest in the health and wellbeing of the roleplay community in eve but thats politics and thats how the csm was designed roleplayers cared about the elections cared about the future of eve and faction warfare and roleplayers ensured they got representives into the csm in all likelihood the major alliances to benefit from this change in the roleplay community would be cva and ushrakhan and wouldnt be fighting in your direct ballpark anyways for the record its unlikely sf would ever join a militia even if we could for rp reasons so you are wrong to personalize the debate here in the first placewell again you are in the minority there but i mean look at rationally you are arguing a dog in the manger position as a member of the caldari militia wanting to keep alliances out so thats your bias and its very clear im arguing a position that alliance corporations should be allowed into faction warfare since the current situation quite unfairly penalizes long term rp alliances who have played with the background for years and years and now find themselves effectively excluded from involvement due to a technical bar that ccp have told us can be removed with a very simple bit of programming fixneither i nor my alliance will find our playstyle affected either way by the outcome since we wouldnt be joining a militia anyways so i really dont see how you can accuse me of bias when you are the one who is desperately attempting to preserve your own perceived advantage against the thread of further inclusion in fw to the wider community your argument just doesnt add upwhere i do have a personal agenda is in seeing that roleplay interests are represented to ccp and that longterm roleplay alliances  other than my own  are allowed to involve themselves in factional warfare and directly influence the background by their efforts and playing skill but like i said i do think you are totally wrong when you say there will be a negative impact on fw if alliance corps can join i can understand where you are coming from since at the moment you see yourself as a big fish in a small pond and are obviously worried that rivals will come to spoil your fun but this is eve online  you are not playing in an instance you are playing on the whole wide server and when you raise your game and consider yourself the equal of everyone else rather than an oppressed minority that needs special protection i am confident youll enjoy the game more and come to see that you were wrong in the fears you currently express
i argue as a member of a militia knowing full well alliance involvement would hinder fw completely alliances in fw would overpower the entire design which was to introduce people to pvp not to be a major role in pvp alliances and their sovereign space have no place in fw space having them with me or against me in my militia doesnt matter i have no idea if bob will join caldari and reign terror on gallente to me thats not the case as much as i would love it winning or losing is not the end all factor knowing a good thing vs a bad thing is you fail to see that and you assume more than the facts even i know a simple programming fix can cause a hell of amount of grief and abuse but if you dont want sf in a milita why should this matter sf is basically one corp anyway why not just use the game mechanics as intended and join your your corp outside of your sweet sweet alliance or is that not how you should adapt the fact is we all deal with what we can and cant do the difference is you think you are entitled to what you cant do i feel sorry for your love of rp and getting the shaft but hey eve is not just about youyou fail so bad it makes my eyes hurt like i said having alliance join my militia can benefit me just as much as any other militia but you fail to see where opening that can of worms can have a huge impact and abuse even if its just corps in alliances deal with it you are arguing a point that you really dont understand the consequences too and you fail at understanding my point and where im coming from simply saying you feel sad about not having rp alliances play a role in fw is pathetic its a lame excuse and its your only argument you can roleplay with or without a milita oh and last i check roleplayers are in militias they just joined up like the rest of us and didnt whine about it they obviously see the impact big alliances can have on fw and why it was never intended im for roleplaying its great but im afraid you horribly miss the pointits not about roleplay alliances its about all alliances and all corps in alliances the little part of me that agrees you should have fw access still doesnt offset the fact that other nonroleplay alliances can greatly abuse the fw system the overall game abuse far outweighs making a few rp alliances feel better about themselves
in your opinion others disagree not all alliances hold space often alliances were created for the sole reason of resolving the corporation standings limit you should know this if you wish to make substantive comment on the issue and you make assumptions and statements that are unproven why should anyone believe you have a wellspring of knowledge that the rest of us lack you dont know you assume you have no idea of knowing exactly what will happen you think it will be bad because you are currently the big fish in the small pond i think it will be good and at least im looking at the situation from the outside with no intention of jumping into the pond whatever happens sf was never been relevant to this debate you made the mistake of personalizing it for rhetorical purpose as a means of personal attack against my character as csm chair  but im glad you now acknowledge that was a mistake and incorrect debating stance nice argument why is your point of view superior to mine and what have i misunderstood about your personal stake in fw wanting to keep alliances out because you feel it would endanger your role as indeed they can right at the moment by detaching foreign legion corps and joining anyway this is the item of debate youve never addressed as long as you have corporations like outbreak involved in fw its a nonsense to exclude all alliance corps for potentially unbalancing fw most alliances in eve are rubbish from a military standpoint ultimately you are arguing for a pvp instance in the middle of eves warfare sandbox and it really doesnt wash since its ridiculous easy for it to be unbalanced anyway if anyone was of a mind too
once again you fail to understand anything you can try and single out exceptions but eve is not an exception think overall then perhaps youll see what many ccp devs already dountil you are man enough to list me a pros and cons without any bias then ill consider your argument but as of now the only pro you have is because you say so the cons may be assumptions but they are validfyi youre like one of those salesman that shows up at a door and just wont accept his product sucks just walk away man
the pro is because i and many players of eve think so in our opinion it will be a very good thing equally your cons are your opinion at the moment to my eyes you are in the minority and i do not find either your arguments or ad hoc personal attacks to be compelling well have to agree to differ
ill do it for youpros personal amusementcons major impacts and game abuse
i said it before ill say it here againalliances may not participate in fw is not solving any problem it tries to solve a number of problems but fails at solving those on the other hand it introduces a lot of problems that are unnecessarythe underlying problem in the discussion here is that alliance means very different things to people this ranges from a group of people with over 1k members holding sovereignty in 00 to a number of small corps that banded together for mutual protection some mutual help like pos use removal of standings or war limits etcto correct some common misperceptionsalliances are big corporations are smallthis is wrong taking into account only the 618 alliances with more than one corp the average member count is 200 the median is 92  meaning that the average is affected a lot by the big alliances like goonswarm  a bit more than half of those alliances  322  have less than 100 members 62 of them  388  have less members than 0utbreak a corporation in the minmatar militiaalliances are there to hold sovereigntythis is also wrong only 91 alliances hold sovereignty right now that is less than 15 of themso with these facts  easily checkable via the eve api  now known  think about which problem exactly you want to prevent with no alliances in fw  and think about how to prevent that problem correctlyis it alliances are big fish dont let them in well you have corporations with over 130 members in fw already  0utbreak kindashujaa etc  as shown above most alliances are smaller than that so the exclusion of alliances from fw is missing the point here if you want to have the big fish out of fw set a maximum member limit for corps joining fwor similar alliances have the experienced pvpers corps dont  uhm seriously 0utbreak invicta the corp of the guy who is currently reading this and is angry at me for not mentioning his corp and others are not good at pvp while say john does friendly neighborhood alliance is again the exclusion of alliances is missing the goal wildly im not sure why you would want to exclude experienced pvpers but if you want to do that you wont achieve this by excluding alliancesor is the reason we dont want 00 politics in fw fw isnt supposed to be the vacation sport for 00 alliances you will get politics in fw  you already have  this is good though politics is one unique thing in eve also 00 alliances already create fw corps to get some pew pew there so you probably mean alliances who hold sovereignty in 00 shouldnt be in fw but as shown above a majority of alliances do not hold sovereignty so if you want that then do exactly that  no membership in a militia if you are in an alliance that holds sovereignty
if you have issues with level 4 missions in high sec how about starting your own thread instead of trolling this one
ccp did get on it and caved
okay after reading this thread i have to admit i am more than a bit annoyedfirst off i have never been even close to getting ganked with my empire character doing missions why because i do level 4 missions in a t2 fitted ship its that easy why people insist on using deepspace and officer fittings is beyond me but each to their ownsecondly i think most of the people who do suicide ganking is doing it because they have no other option in empire funnily enough because carebears are in npc corps which cant be war decced or are in 1man corps they jump from after a wardec sorry for the caps  hows that for no ing consequence or risk and war dec is a completely legitimate part of the game  and if someone says corpjumping to avoid war decs is a legitimate use of game mechanics then so is suicideganking imo it is beyond hyprocricy to whine about suicide ganking and the lack of consequences when you time and time again see empire carebears deliberately corp jump or stay in npc corps to avoid risk with zero consequencefair enough let us remove insurance so suicide ganking becomes more difficult at the same time kick everybody out of npc corps after 2 months and then whenever they are in a corp that gets wardecced and they then corpjump that wardec follows the character  only character not the new corp that is createdsaid character joins  for a weekmonththen there would be a way to add risk to now hilariously risk free high sec and frankly its a natural extension of wanting to add to the risk of suicide ganking both things are use of game mechanics however one of them is a response to a use of game mechanics the other is a reponse to a complete and integral part of the game
signed though id like to say that you should be able to be in an npc corp for more than a year doesnt make sense to me
ah the usual lack of consistency risk reward is important as long as it dont affect what you do right
youre barking at the wrong tree i run all my missions in low00 sec you obviously feel missions need a rebalance but i will ask you again why are you derailing this thread
this is an interesting aspect of the discussion
something should be done to make all the sad people in this thread happy

i will be bringing this up at the soonest possible meeting

my name is daneth and i approve of this message
nice op and very good comment from ix
most definitely get the data and the images
i totally agree and ix has put it down perfectlty updated api and data dumps should be available before patchday
sounds like a plan to me
the data dump is something that ccp give us out of the goodness of their hearts  hopefully also a business reason  and it is much appreciated the data dump and the api set eve apart from other games in that incredibly useful outofgame tools can be createdwe have just been informed that it takes two senior developers to create a data dump i dont know how much time they need to make it happen but its clearly nontrivialgiven that it takes this long  and were 7 months overdue  and assuming that the availability of 3rdparty tools is sound business for ccp id much rather see t20 and prism take the time it takes to create an aasadddt  automated all singing all dancing database dump tool  and hit the dump button rather than creating a manual dump if that means well have to wait a little longer now and itll be fast in future ill dealthatd need ccp management buyin  a tool typically eats up more resources  time  upfront whereas it will save lots of resources over the medium and most certainly long term
the prior information was not accurate ccp is considering a closed beta for the linux client at some point in the future
honestly just how fubar is the situation the constant delays gives the impression that crossover is in way over their heads here especially with the mac client
what prior information is being referred to
please just be clear and a little more communicative on the current status of the linux clientduring the last months all ccp messages i saw in the forums were vague statements telling that more information was coming soon or one week later but it never arrived  by the way half a month ago the beta testing was about to starthow is it that now this event is delayed until some point in the future no pun intended im just puzzled about the real situation
atleast start by removing the advance ones and to compensate give everybody 5 in all skill groups
agree as a fellow aussie its fscking irritatingeven better aussies and kiwis should get a small discount to play because we loose an hour every evening in primetime play
there are alot of dialogues that could be dont show me again but arent and some that are and shouldnt be this is one that should have f off and never speak to me again as an optioni get this 5 or so times per night on each character i have logged in as does anyone that plays in the australasian tzlost cause im sure theres just not enough of us but i vote yes with all my alts
well its just after 9pm and its downtime on the server right in the middle of my primetime im working data center missions atm and every time i warp to the dc i get the same message everytime its only so many times you can read itthe popups for quite a few of the dialogs should be show once this sessionmission but i do see that the one anouncing dt should be compusry for the 15 and 5 min one but the one hour warning should be  dont show
why should they should be compulsory the 5 minute timer is more than enough  not the popup the timer how about an optionx yes i can tell the time
absolutely yes please if were going to have pve content and i think for a host of reasons we should then lets make it the best it can be to match the rest of eves quality
heck anything to make missions more dynamic would be greathow about tieing the needtoscram leader in with the onboard scanner when attacked without a point or when he feels threatened he warps off to another ministage somewhere within 4au when he gets to the new point he might get a new group of friends etc and so forth
good ideas for me at the moment lvl4 missioning is mostly mind numbing grinding the only reason i do it is beause its a little less boring than mining and i also dont have to train extra skillsbetter ai would be fantastic its ridiculous that i can blow half of their ships to bits whilst the rest just sit there like lemons until i launch drones or attack one of them
i would prefer shorter missions with fewer enemies and proportionally lower rewards so that i dont have to dedicate an hour or more to themill take 10 of the enemies and 10 lp over any of this  for example it doesnt have to be 10  the bounties will be intrinsically reduced by the numbersi dont want fewer tough enemies it represents a shift toward tanking instead of dps to keep your ship alive you cant kill fast enough to keep the dps down so you have to beef your tank up making the missions take even longer some of them are already way too longsorry fellow forum whoar not supportin dis
i do think that this is a nice idea actually
valid topic for discussion even if ccp come out with a different way to deal with it
signedsalute to malvortex the bug and trollhunterfantastic im about to go to bed  ill check the thread in the morning  but how about ham precisions how do they shape up do they look like current hml precisions or are they a different style sorry for the noobish q  
i think this needs a look at  missles in general are in need of a little more oomph
ccp told the csm that pricing of the game time codes is a business issue and that eve might be more expensive than other mmos on the market because it is a premium productthe csm explained that there were three main concerns the lack of the 30 day game time codes so that players were forced to make larger purchases at once the price increase compared to the old game time codes and the communication between marketing and the players  players did not buy the story  furthermore eva  csm ankhesentapemkah  requested ccp to consider lowering the price of their 60 day game time code to 2995 instead of 3495 as it is nowccp replied that the current 60 day game time code will likely become the standard in the near future and that supporting separate products is more expensive nevertheless they will relay the complaints about the removal of the 30 day game time code to the marketing department they are working on making more payment methods available for subscribers so that players that previously used game time codes can use these methods to pay for eve instead
i have something to add to this that may  or may not  make sense from a business point of view30 day gtcs provide oldtimers with cancelled accounts a low barrier to reentering the game i can imagine that if i had a character with a billion in wallet and ccp launches one of those juicy expansions that id be signing up for another 30 days  with all the horrid dangers of being sucked right back in  now paying up to 150m to do that is a good deal a player could do that about 6 times 7 times if he earned some money during his resubshowever if a player has to pay 300m  or more  he wont be able to resub as often without paying rl cash to ccp himself this could reduce the number of lost customers returning to the gamethe point here is that most players come to eve for their personal favorite thing to do  such as pirating 00 alliances industry mining exploration and i probably missed some  ccp cannot possibly address all these preferences in a single patch although theyre very welcome to try the more times a player can resub while another player pays the bills the better the chances are for ccp to draw a player back into the game as a returning customeri think this is a consideration that should be weighed by ccp although perhaps it already has been weighedranges
i guess a lack of subscriptions will show ccp if they made the right or wrong decision here i have 8 accounts 2 of which always remain active the other 6 i had running on 90d gtcs so they were relatively cheap to keep running even if not used too much now with all these changes all 6 of the accounts remain idle and one may be activated from time to time when needed but thats itso i dare say from myself alone ccp is losing about 46 subscriptions per month not a threat just an honest statement my two main accounts will likely never stop paying regardless of price
coming from the other side of the pacific down here in the philippines i can speak for most of the eveplayers that ive talked to that the removal of the 30day gtc and the price hike of the 60day have all but made them not to continue their accountssome have resorted to more illegal methods of maintaining their accountsthe vote is unanimous here that we want the 30day back
i agree faction ammomissiles make t2 kinda pointless long range stuff like scorchspikeect are pretty good but all the short range ammo is complete rubbish the penalties are too harsh way too harsh especially on the short range side of thingst2 ammo is a huge disappointment a lot of it was pretty meh when it came out with faction ammo being in abundance and in many cases costing the same amount of isk as t2 whats the point
conflag ftl
certainly short range ammo needs looking at and the long range would benefit as wellthe penalties are just too much to make them worthwhile in any fit really
precision heavies seriously
pretty please fix em
were tired of the nano whine compare the amount of posts and the amount of supports of this topic and see how it shows that most people that arent ed  thinks that nano is fine
oh god you make me puke im afraid of changes when there is no need for a fix bootini anyone just cause fw came out doesnt mean a whole new class of idiots gets to whine about getting blown up doing stupid stuff i havent been here since beta but last time i checked the years are piling up on my char and i have seen my fair share of changes and none of them have been shaking the pot if you cant deal with nanos you cant pvp there is no middle ground i tip my hat to the cva guys outside the tremedous blobing they do last time i checked they handled the nano just fine its just verbal poo poo to sit here and have any kind of converstation with morons
ive heard all the arguments ive flown armor shield and speed tanked ships ive owned a snake set after all my research i believe theyre overpowered sorry
as my main goes so goes my nation
i dont even fly nanos and i think they are fine so wtf does your quip add up to now
okay lets cut to the chase here the problem is in mixing definitions in what is meant by a nano ship to most people complaining about nanos  nano means a fast cruiser hull that can choose to disengage from heavierslower combatants after performing hit and run attacks the reason this debate always gets nasty is that attacking that role leads to the promoting of blob warfare and whoever has the most numbers automatically wins obviously large alliances with high numbers of relatively lowskilled pvpers want this but the debate is not that clear cut there is a clear difference between what is attainable with relatively conventional means 30004000  tech2 fit polycarbs ods nanos overheat  and what can be attained with rarer and costly assets  700010000 with snakes drugs tech2 rigs rare modules  there is absolutely no problem whatsoever with the former  its simply variety in warfare and uses speed to dictate the terms of an engagement if outnumbered by heavier slower hulls these conventional nano ships can leave choose their range hit and run and generally skirmish against indisciplined targetswhereas the latter class  and this would include extreme implanted clones drugged up and equipped with faction fits  can lead to hulls sustaining orbit and transversal speeds greater than the ability of the game logic to hit or counter while being able to fire back themselves there is a problem with extreme nano but this is a relatively tiny proportion of the player base and such ships are very rare  for example as an fc in star fraction ive only ever come across a handful of vagabonds capable of this opposing us in 00 whereas the former class  conventional nano  is easy to counter and just requires a tiny bit of thought and reequipping to neutralize or effectively hunt a nanogang moving around the 4000 mps mark has got the ability to burn out from gates or hostile hotdrop ambushes sure but its utterly screwed by a combination of webbing recons neutralizers ewinterceptor webbing sniping etc etc etc sure this brand of nano will laugh at your classic tech1 short range battleshipbattlecruiser blob on a gate but really so would tech2 snipers so would a wellfitted rr gang so would ew superiority etc etc and so on now im sure well keep on hearing insults and angry posting from the nerf all nano brigade but the reality is there are two separate issues here and its wrong to mix them both up ccp have the challenge already of looking at changes to the game that reduce the abuse potential of extreme nano speeds without reducing the whole game to mindless blobbing they know perfectly well that small gang raiding is a part of eve and needs to be preserved so less of the general speeding condemnation of play styles would be helpful in general and in particular  lets stop labelling any ship that travels faster than mine as automatically nano
i disagree that even the extreme nano ships that you describe jade are actually a problemthere are ways to counter them there are already mechanics in place to stop these very ships despite the enormous cost involved in achieving the highest speeds of 10kms and morei know these points have been made before in this thread and others but i simply want to add another voice to the many asking ccp to not dumb eve down any further eves combat mechanics are deep varied and complex so much so that they are often more complex than even eves developers themselves understandplayer ignorance is no reason to further erode that which makes eve special in the crowded mmorpg market  its amazing complexity
dont get me wrong please i know there are ways to counter these things and i personally believe that the extreme cost of these things is an balancing factor  popping a tech2 rigged ship and killing a snake clone is an immense fiscal penalty but whats actually happening is that the kind of sustainable speeds these ships can maintain at that level just dont work properly with the mathematics of tracking and hit recognition it literally breaks the game to a degree in an unintended fashionthe challenge for us  csm  and us  the playbase  is to address the issue in an intelligent way so we can advise ccp on resolving the broken mechanics at the extreme top end without destroying the game functionality at the medium scale nano speed and reducing variety and imagination in space combat yep its all true but i guess the issue is that currently ccp know there is a problem with top end velocity tanking in that their mechanics dont work as intended  something as simple as the mwd sig radius penalty being irrelevant because weapons simply cant track fast enough to keep on target is a case in point means that the sigsize penalty is meaningless this could get addressed by rewriting the trackingexplosion speed attributes to get bonused in some way from the mwd sig penalty on the target ship but its a complex issue to balanceso the challenge is  how to stop extreme hi end nano ships from being effectively invulnerable to weapons fire in high traversal situations without destroying the playability and combat variety provided by ordinary scale nanoships oh i definitely agree and the whole nanoissue is cursed by very ignorant opinions that see anything faster than a gatecamping drake as an abomination needing immediate nerfing its vitally important that ccp do not listen to people wanting to eradicate speed tanking and velocitybased disengagement and the general raiding playstyle simply because they personally refuse to adapt their loadouts and accept that in a competitive environment they need to face the challenge of other players creativity
would it be possible to bring back killer nos to combat nanos
why would that be any more effective than neuts if you battleship neut an orbiting nano its generally dead in the water
hopefully the devs will see it this way too if they cave in to the nano whiners we can expect the same treatment for ecm gangs remote repping bss and whatever tactic people start using next until we are left with only simple slugfests
giving my support to the op not that the csm or ccp will care im astounded that this issue wasnt brought up prevalently at the first meetingthat hot drops and blobs have indeed become a problem is no excuse for people even with loads of investment to enter pvp nighinvincible im all for fast ships that are meant to go fast in principle but watching a typhoon travel 5kms and faster is more than irritating the demand for snakes and rapiers  which hardly are a solution most of the time primary  pop  is also way too high
not only bios but evemails could be longer too
too early to bring this issue to sundays meeting but lets keep discussing it please and ill be happy to bring it to the following meeting with my advocacy
my 2  euro centswell now that the door is open i fail to see how they could prevent fw result to have some effect if fw ever have a result indeed disregarding a clear win would be too disruptive too immersion breaking so the two lowcost way out are the effects are negligeable andor fw never have a result more preciselythere are no clear results no faction are ever beaten for gameplay reason i guess thats a set condition in the not so short term  fw is now part of gameplay as is mission running or mining a way into pvp here for the long run not a transient feature tied to a particular storyline event so it cant end the effect are just a bunch of news  maybe background of a chronicle at most  which impact only rpersgiven the rather hum conservative pace at which evolve the storyline  except for the sudden change that where needed for fw  we are not really in a hurry anyway
im thinking it would go in rounds where ccp could set objectives like controlling a system or certain series of systems by a certain date and let the players know what the result will be if they succeed or fail at the objective then the players have until that time to achieve that objective to obtain that resultstorylines could be written with these sorts of binary results so that for instance ccp says if the minmatar militia captures these 3 systems in the next week a million slaves will be freed and at the same time if the amarr militia captures these other 3 systems a valuable shipment of war supplies destined for the minmatar republic will be captured by the amarr navy instead etcplayers would then be able to look back at the canon storyline and say i helped free those slaves or capture those supplies

could someone clarify what this means is this ccps priority or a csmdetermined priority how did things get organized in this way its a great idea to have a priority list though cheers to that 
so it cost us players how much for this basically 12 round trips to iceland to deliver a synopsis of the general forum in all seriousness what has this accomplished that couldnt be done over mirc
on the final day of meetings the csm sat together and had some fist fights over which things should be toppriority for ccp to dothis is the product of that
believe it or not but meeting in rl works a bit better than irc looks like they managed with reasonable amount of work and i like most of the things brought up  
im liking how skill queuing is still only low at mediumhigh priority when it is one of the longest running topics around looking forward to the roleplaying elements and such and i hope it works out unsure what to make of the avatar stuff but then im not a capital pilot so i wouldnt know though must ask why its so easy to bump an avatar having managed to bump one before in a stealth bomber at 30msand sovereighnity however its spelt  should be good to look into the roleplaying within that would immense were it to be devised but with the whole new graphics look outs and ofc landing on planets im sure a method much like that could be devised where going up close and destroying key targets only in small ships  like the limiters on accel gates  would be nicehopefully all works out welldaks
this is ccps priority that they received from us weve been told that they will be addressing fixesnew content based on the priority for issues agreed by the csm quite amazing really but they are going to be directly weighting development effort on the results of the formal meetings and priority we set
oh wow industry is at the bottom of the list quite a surprise there
i am going to add nothing here  for the moment  other than duplicate an earlier comment  with a spot of bold  ok give in i will comment  not all of us agreed with the final ordering or thought it made any sense whatsoever indeed the manner in which it was done left imho a lot to be desired in that rather than taking an average of all the csms views it was based on a simple majority  so effectively ignoring those not in that majority  it is probably clear from the results  and the shock of what became the top priority and the small number of pilots it will affect compared to the issues that affect every piloteg skill queue user interface etc  but that is the order which ended up being given to ccphowever the practice of ccp is to continuously review the priority of all ideas under development and that means not only the ones presented in this csmccp visit but their preexisting ones  some of which were discussed in passing offagenda  and future csmraised ones so this list is effectively but a guideline as to the proposals iz
well this was a waste
i have to say that i am disappointed  like many  about the prioritization of some items  ui fixes cough more hotkeys cough and skill queuing but that aside i think you all did a pretty good job of letting ccp know in concrete terms what we players would like to see and what we think is important this list reads more like the kind of information i would like to see in the devblogs and lists of future enhancments that dont give away cool surprises that ccp may have for us players its interesting when i read  in a devblog  the ccp thought that you all should have though about more longterm over all strategery for the game than short term game mechanics i think they forget that we have to deal with these issues on a daytoday basis and long term pie inthe sky virtual worlds stuff is great and all but we want this stuff doneyesterday the csm business seems a hard row to hoe considering what we think know of some of the personalities and internal bickering that we have read about i for one will say congratulations and thank you to all concerned lets hope ccp can keep their end of the deal and deal with some of these issues swiftly
no kiddingui skill queue suicide gankageinsurance and industry fall short of some of that top crap speed tanking tweaks is not even there at all the only factional warfare isssue you could see a problem with is pimping that same old tired alliance thing do you people even play fw do you care how n00bs and casuals experience thislooks to me like the 00 chowderheads are lockstepping all over this one not supprised though bout how i figured it would be
yeah the 3 people with meaningful 00 experience on a 9 person council are surely the reason that this list and most of the items presented were and still are complete crap clearly our 00 gameplay experience will be greatly affected for the better with changes to0013 skill page tweaks0007 double click function on avatars0012 minimum size of hud elements0017 empire war decs0030 pvp wreck ownership0001 skill queue0015 pilot avatar listing0039 roleplay storylines0028 forum issues and fixing0022 shares and dividends issues0027 drone implants0036 small freighter0006 pillageable outposts0033 color deficiency0014 personal assets and hud
0004 black ops improvementsx jump bridges and cynojammers0029 evemail issues0019 contract improvements0018 00 sovereignty issues0013 skill page tweaks0007 double click function on avatarstell me why black ops or frickin avatar clicking is higher in priority to the largest portion of the playerbase than saynannos skill queue ui lag suicide gankinsurance and any number of other thingsand i stand by my query
its not a matter of their absolute value its a matter of how valuable they are when compared to the difficulty of implementing them aside from 00 sov issues which is exactly the kind of bigpicture thing you want them to call highpriority  all of those issues are really easy to implement quickly giving us a real mail client as opposed to a system that most cell phones implement better should take some small number of manhours whereas fixing lag would require millions of dollars and likely a fundamental change to human nature as well fixing lag would be much better for the game but its a lower priority
lag fix  00 sovereignty issues  introducing multiple simultaneous objectives to break up blob fighting there is no magic lag fix beyond reducing the size of blobs anyone who tells you different is selling snake oil
and seeing an alt named mctard arguing with a goon called dramaticus that a  the agenda is dominated by 00ers vs b  no its dominated by carebears kinda convinces me that we hit exactly the right balance when extremists on both sides are screaming its a fair bet the committee did its job quite nicely
i see that sounds sensible so im an extremist for wanting to know out of curiosity what about my other questions nannosspeed tanking arent an issue to anyone at all no tweaks neededfw has no problems other than letting alliances mix it upsomething else occured to me t2 ammo doubt i need to say it but compare most of it to the faction ammoone would think this sort of thing at least would be more important than avatar clicking functionality
so how would a wouldbe 00 but still empire carebear like you have changed the list
nobody has yet posted a nano thread on these forums with anything like a real solution or perhaps any nano thread at all i certainly cant think of one  as such it couldnt have been discussed in iceland also given the delay times on the submission process i dont think anyone had a handle on what the issues with fw were as of the deadline for this process which would have required the post to be on the forums about a month ago  both of these will presumably be dealt with in the next round of submissions to ccp  stick a thread on here and see where it goes from there
nano isnt an issue in the way any of the nano threads have been presented ie a global nerf on speed isnt an acceptable solution to the relatively rare incidence of uberrigged out 810k nano ships breaking the tracking mechanics the csm didnt agree with general nerfs to speed ccp is already looking at ways of addressing the extreme cases but the solution will not be quick and easy to implement and will like involve the complete overhaul of many propulsionrelated systems in that context im sure you can see that csm supporting an omgnerfnano1111 thread would be a ridiculous waste of everyones timecourse it has they will be addressed and advocated in this session but alliance corp involvement with fw was the big one
fair enough
youre being surprisingly reasonable for a character named mctard whats the catch
no im more arguing that the majority of the council was useless since they were more interested in playing chieftains of the internet instead of addressing real issues but hey im sure youll find a way to utilize double clicking on avatars in your next brothel chatroom so maybe it is a victory
so what does this stuff mean stuff like empire war decs ok there are a lot of issues around that but what decision was made is it a high priority to improve the ceo interface to cut the cost increase the limit on war decs or is the high priority decision that you want to remove war decs there are a hell of a lot of things that every one of these list items could mean
everything on this list was apparently a topic that was up for discussionand every topic has since received its own thread in the assembly halleach thread starts out with we discussed the follow topic which raised some issues likeand each thread ends with ccp is aware of the issue and will work towards resolving it
that bit is disappointing me alsothere better be some kind of followup on that like  will be in patch xxx on this or that month 2 full time programersui peoplewhatever have been assigned to solve the issue work can not start on this until xxx date but then we have y people assigned to it and expect it to be finished z time after to be included in next patchi fully understand that the above itself takes some time to assess and as such that info can hardly be available at this timehence why im hoping to see a followupelse its a load of soon tm 
the problem with that is that nobody would believe them even if they did give dates soon tm  is always soon tm  even with numbers attached whether ccp is right this time or not
time for ccp to turn that around then isnt itand definatly something the csm should push forccp knows very well how to approximate how long a given task will  should  take and to work towards deadlinesyes they might get it wrong software can be tricky in that regardi do it myself daily and have myself had projects suddenly blow up in my face and occationally have had to push a deadlineto point beeing however that a new deadline was set and communicated to the client and ive yet to miss a 2nd deadline fingers crossed most of the issues on that list are pretty isolated tasks that can be assesed with regards to time etcan example on the opposite would be their ongoing effort to rewrite their network layer etc but few of the items on the list are anywhere near that kind of complexityso i stand by my first postsoon tm   regardless the wording  will simply not do on issues specifically brought up by the csm on behalf of the playersif so then nothing has changed at all and the whole thing will be a huge disappointment to me personally
where is the pos issue on that least the pos overhaul which was i might add a significant issue to which number of csm candidates responded favorably how come it is not even on the list
what about adding new time intensive skills for those who already have high amounts of sps for example skills like 1 to cpupg with x5 multiplier and pre requirements like several x1 x2 x3 skills up to lvl5you talking about specializing in industry think about specializing in engineering or electronics high pre requirements of new skills will make them far from overpowered and in second hand give interesting alternative to learn for those who paying ccp from really long time
okay im convinced that the csm as a whole didnt give this issue a proper hearing last time around and im going to present it again this sunday
thanks for your help jade even if the csm doesnt want to hear you it would be still be useful to ask the others why they rejected escalation if they have specific balance concerns we can attempt to answer them here
jade my thanks goes out to you again for sticking with this thread ive put a tremendous amount of effort into trying to bring this issue to light to say its been frustrating to see such a glaring and obvious problem almost entirely ignored is a slight understatement particularly with such lame excuses from other csms regarding why they felt this shouldnt passif you need me to throw together some digest of this thread in order to simplify your presentation of it please let me know im quite busy at the moment but i will find some time to do so if it will help the cause
i need to write up the submission template by 1800 hours tomorrow evening  if you can get me some notes  probably pm at the star fraction forums best bet  ill be sure to include themfingers crossed we can convince people this time
another very enlightening example of this problem  with a quote from the csm meeting to further illustrate the issue  nighthawk t2 heavy missile launcher x6t2 bcus x3t2 mwdthis fit requires 4175 cpu  735 pg remaining cpu  27625 remaining pg  1525nighthawk t2 heavy missile launcher x6t2 bcus x3this fit requires 3675 cpu  570 pg remaining cpu  32625 remaining pg  3175sleipnir t2 425s x7t2 gyros x 3t2 mwdthis fit requires 27125 cpu  11382 pg remaining cpu  3225 remaining pg  6868so using my prvious comparison of the nighthawk and sleipnir and adding only a t2 mwd one can see that while both ships are antisupport both ships shield tank and both ships generally fit their lower grid weapons  autos and heavy missiles  that the nighthawk is left with magnitudes less grid than the sleipin bold the nighthawk does not even have an mwd and they are nearly tied for cpu and the sleip with an mwd still has more than twice the grid of the nighthawk without an mwd hello problem
he prolly means the ship portraits that appear on top of the screen for each locked target yea color coding those would be nice to havethumbs up
currently ships in the hangar do not display the effects of modules rigs and skills this did occur in the past but was removed due to people exploiting the mechanics by offlining cargo expanders so that they would not suffer the drawbacks but kept the passive bonus of the module thus the cargo space increase is now an active effect which required the module to be online when not boarded all modules on a ship will go offline resulting in less cargo space being availablealison  csm inanna zuni  indicated that the 30 second time delay between swapping ships was the reason behind the frustration that this issue caused ccp is currently looking at decreasing this session change timer but cannot change the cargo hold issue
cloaks already have the drawbacks still active while module offline feature afaikis there a good reason why this couldnt be expanded to include the modifiers cargo expanders grant too 
not gunna happenidiot
yes
ccp quickly dismissed this as a possibility for the market system as performance will be drastically impacted and the market was designed to match a buy order with the lowest sell order this is a highly optimized system capable of handling the large amounts of transactions in eveeyjUFFFD  ccp  commented that eves market was designed to be totally open and limiting access to certain orders would destroy this open market principlerather than changing the market improvements should be made to the contract system the csm will submit suggestions for this in a future meeting
its too bad that an alliance or corp cannot get a preferred vendors list or that producers cannot set discounts for a group if we could do so you would have a way to punish corp thieves piewrats or war targets you could reward a group for providing a steady marketfor example its difficult for a 00 alliance to use the market in their own 00 stations to provide discounted ships for their alliancemates any ship put on the market at low prices can be picked up and resold by an interloper who does not even need to dockthe two issues i see are1 cant give discounts to people you like2 cant block thievesinterlopersenemies from manipulating your own stations marketi understand the markets optimization its limitations are however making contracts the only way of accomplishing some transaction tasks while very useful contracts are not the market and are much more difficult to use
how about a confirm sell based on corp standings not a automatic one maybe some time limit for when seller unavailable
take a look at this
ccp recognizes the issues with the forums and devs suffer from them as well the problems originate from some serverside limitations because of the use of asp instead of aspx but there are also session limitations in browsers which cause problems there are also issues with the load balancer which occasionally sends people to a different node which does not recognize the users authentication which is an issue that can be looked at ccp would like to move the forum to another database and will change the entire forum in the long run but a final decision and plan has not been finalized yet the csm and the players will be kept up to date on the developmentsregarding the forum not being readable in the ingame browser there are no plans to address this as the current ingame browser is no longer being developed there are plans to replace the ingame browser with different software
exactly what is there to finalize this frustrating issue is several years old when my alliance needed a new forum it was done in a few days by one person and it works better than this forum any time of the day about one hour ago i tried to reply to a different thread and finally gave up after clicking on the reply and quote links for several minutes straight without any effect other than the forum page refreshing itselfi find ccps answer on this subject to be disingenuous whats really going on
deserves its own topic but its mentioned in this one so aha finally the cat is out of the bag not that we didnt already know ofc but its the first time its made official more infopleaseseriously more info  including a timelinetheres  a few  of us who thourougly believe in trying to enlarge the eve experience through the use of the igband while its quite exilarating to hear that theres actually plans for doing something about the miserable state of the igb the vague as an aside only comment about it leaves me worrying about the timeline  another 5 years 
according to ccp making pos arrays public is technically impossible because the jobs require a local hanger and this would interfere with station ownership of the structures themselves shayne  csm serenity steele  asked for different ways to address the lack of public slotsccp plans to add more slots to npc stations but with restrictions such as maximum job time to prevent people from easily clogging up all the available slots eva  csm ankhesentapemkah  commented that there are a lot of industrial corporations that have set up a pos to get around the limited amount of slots and that they should not be robbed of their investments according to her an increase to the slots in npc stations would be welcome but not by huge amountsccp said that price dynamics were removed when the new si system was implemented they will look at reinstating it in the distant future more personalized structures might be added to the game that might also have a lab function
setting a lab to public could be acheived by removing the slot from the lab while also making sure theres enough stront and fuel to last until next dt in the tower and attaching it as an actualadditional slot  with different pricing schemes and additional warnings  to an existing npc station or player outpostlabs with public slots can not be unanchoredonce set as wanttobepublic a slot only becomes public at next dt if pos is not in reinforced and has at least 1 ful day of fuelstronteach day the same check is made again if failed the slot is detachedin case the pos in question is placed in reinforced mode all current jobs get cancelled returnable materials are returned to the job installers at the npc station or player outpost and the lab slot is detached from the stationoutpostthis is one possible solution that while cumbersome might possibly work
nice work the solution to fixing the problem is removing anyones chance to compete with it making this change means you are invalidating thousands of researchers working in research alliances not to mention the 10s of people who have invested billions and billions in infrastructure to provide this serviceincreasing the number of public slots is not the solution it goes against everything ccp stands for in regards to wanting people to socialise and have player run services the only reason research operations are currently popular is because there are no available npc slotsputting this change through you kill the entire player run research industry  which is already barely profitable  in an instanthell allow the public access however limit it to only t1 bpos  that dont require materials  have a message like the station owner isnt trained to handle this bpo if you attempt to use a t2 bpo in research dont invalidate the entire industry to save a bit of time
what will happen to bp market if too many more slots r opened up i do not want our pos public
they wont be this change means everyone gets station slots now so noone will use your pos they will sell their goods based on the 90k it costs to make a battleship bpc whilst you are paying for pos fuel on your large towerbut then you will find its cheaper and much easier to use an npc lab so you close down your pos and we end up back where we started
welcome to 2005
the ability to install jobs from a different location in the same system would be great and fix a lot of this example my bpo is at a station around planet 1 but i can install it to any other station or pos i have access to in that system now slots can be made available for public usealso more npc slots need to be introduced over time the population of eve has greatly expanded and basic services need to be expanded alongside them however the increase needs to be carefully balanced so that slots are available without 30 day wait times if you want one but research corps still have a need to fill i believe that that balance could be easily reachedor add all the new research slots in lowsec
ive proposed a possible solution here  put simply allow player corps to set up researchmanufacturing lines in their existing corp offices and sell those publicly
ccp informed the csm that they have a game designer and 3 programmers currently dedicated to implementing ui improvements and cut down on the excel in space appearance of the ui ccp is also interested in making the inspace view more usable as currently almost all spacebased interaction is done through the overview listthe standard behavior for doubleclicking avatars is something that can easily be implemented and will be looked into regarding electronic warfare icons in the overview ccp indicated that they would want a more dynamic solution where information is only displayed when it becomes relevant to the player and does not take up space otherwise as for the minimum size of the various windows in the game it will be hard to change this in the shortterm individual windows can be changed one at a time but changes across the board will not be possibleccp will look into changing the skill page to clearly display the currently trained skillthe personal assets page was set up as it is by design the data is not available locally and loading everything would be heavy on the database this will probably not be changed sorting items by subcategory and general category will be something ccp is going to look intoregarding the display of pilot avatars in the side bar of the chat channel ccp will look into making this a toggleable feature the csm noted that the reason behind this is that people want to see as much names as possible in the list and that avatars take up a lot of spacemaking icons stand out better for people affected by colordeficiency ccp is aware of the concerns but it will consume a lot of resources to replace the current textures and thus it will likely be surpassed by issues with a higher priority they will keep it in mind to make future icons stand out better to people affected by this condition
a toggleable transparency removal for icons would almost instantly alleviate a lot of these issuesnot fix but make them more manageable  and it should be easier to implement than a complete overhaul of all textures involved
this would be another good place to start xaens list of ui improvementsyes i know its shameless agenda pushing but theres a lot of good stuff in there and i didnt come up with it all the stuff youre posting about is relatively minor compared to the hotkey problem threading problem modal dialog problem and shifty overview problemmy current favorite improvment is a very simple one if the mouse is over the overview window dont update the sort order or add new list elements to ittrying to click something thats moving around results in misclicks a bajillion timesalmost everyone sorts their overview by distance but when things are moving or spawning on grid its impossible to use because everything is moving aroundedit support
does this include fixing the ui per se right now my windows jump all over the place i lose overview settings randomly etc
ccp you astonish me first you say we have a game designer and 3 programmers dedicated to the ui then you say we cant change a glowing indicator because we dont have the resourcesone of those statements is a plain lieplease fix the glowing indicators on weapons and modulescheck out bitmaps or ui resources from source controladd a black background or border around the glowing portionask a visually impaired person if they can see it better nowcheck back into source controltestrelease patch
excel in space is hardly the problem the problem is a buggy badly designed interface that requires three times as much effort from the user as it should well that and a pile of subprograms evemail igb chat etc  that have problems that were solved one or even two decades ago seriously i remember my dads email program at work in the early 1990s and it was betterimplemented than evemail in every aspect but autolink similarly take any basementmade chat client from 1985 and youd probably be improving upon eves chat functionality dramatically i might actually be able to type a third sentence in one of those programs without hitting my character limit that said thanks for the plan to overhaul the igb i just about got up out of my chair and did a happy dance when i read that me likey
id pee my pants if they actually implemented this
basically it is an improved giant secure container that allows a pilot the ability to do a quick refit and store ammo1 usable by pilots with anchoring 52 solar nuclear powered  rquires no fuel or other pos mgmt bs 3 has no other functions  no mining refining labs etc 4 does not have any defenses beyond armor though not a bazzilion hpit should be easy to destroy5 should be cheap  since it is damn near disposable this would encourage small gangs to setup forward operating ares that are temporary in nature for supporting short term objectives they can be deployed any where and can be scanned out with probes or directional scanner and of course destroyed similar to mission structures
colin  ccp  researched the balance in assembly arrays and could report that efficient equipment assembly arrays will definitely receive an increase to slots with possible minor adjustments for other arrays as well while all the material multipliers will be looked at
ohh does this mean that we might see the component assembly array modified or maybe a new efficient version added that does not have additional waste would be nice to be able to build capitals at a pos when all the build slots in stations are busy
from purely an rp standpoint i support this i also think however that the issue is of little importance guess thats why this was labeled as a minissue
shouldnt exotic dancers be considered charges anyway i mean i use them up all the time
i completely agree exotic dancers are win in my book must have at least one in my cargo at all times
this is a really tiny issue yes it would make the situation a bit more realistic but for that matter i should be able to turn on my mwd get up to speed and turn it off and not lose speed until i hit something we have space friction in this game and i do not support because the current situation is a accepted reality
ccp is aware of the issue and noted that there currently exists a whackamole type of play where players repeatedly undock fire a few shots and redock this is undesirable but will have to be carefully balanced to account for various situations and possible exploitive strategies ccp addition this subject is about the UFFFDdockjump after aggressionUFFFD timer  60 seconds  not criminal flaggingthief timer  15 minutes alison  csm inanna zuni  observed that ships of all sizes have the same time limits and that it is generally harder to destroy a large ship opposed to a small one alision  csm inanna zuni  and valentijn  csm dierdra vaal  suggested that the timer should be changed based on ship typealex  csm bane glorious  was also concerned with removerepair alts whose actions currently have no impact on the aggression timerccp is aware of the issues and heard the csm concerns and will work towards developing a solution
please make a new forum for all the minutes topicsfor the love of god
separation of church and state man
there was once and then it was removed can you say spam
holy spam
i would support this topic but i cant find it for all the damn minute topics in this forum
we decided to do it this way for a number of reasons first of all we had to decide if we should create discussion threads or let you the players create threads on the topics you felt like discussing we figured that creating a separate thread for each would allow everyone to easily find the topic they wanted to discuss in addition to being able to read the full meeting minutes in the sticky thread creating a separate forum for this is not an option due to the low traffic in threads wed get there and jita park speakers corner is too informal for these discussions we are of course aware that this will clog up the forums a bit for a short while at the same time getting feedback on these threads are as important as anything else being discussed here currently once people have started discussing what they wish to discuss the csm meeting threads will drop down or remain up and get mixed in with the rest of the threads and the forum will clear up and show the threads where people are actively discussing the various topics and you can always go to page two to find the thread where you wanted to discuss other things thus bumping it up  by discussing not by posting bump how we present the meeting minutes in the future is in no way set in stone and were also looking forward to the csm giving us their opinion on the subject in future meetings maybe coming up with alternatives or better plans
we could definitely do with a new category called meeting archives and move this stuff  finished issues  over to wrangler  this will allow assembly hall to more effectively showcase the current issues prior to csm vote
quite assy hall for new issues somewhere else  like the dear departed dont post in this forum forum  for the meeting records and any followup discussion which doesnt propose a new issuepossibly the biggest problem with doing a good job as csm is the difficulty in being able to find the new issues being brought to us separating out the asked and answered would help a great deal iz
well heres a question  the meeting minutes topic for the 00 sov issue say that the playerscsm are expected to come back with a concrete proposal for how to achieve the desired resultsare we supposed to post suggestions in that thread or create a new issue thread that will be supported by playerscsm and then brought to the csm meeting again for a new vote
geez if this isnt the most screwed up way of presenting the minutes and simultaneously clogging the assembly hall forum its unbeleivable instead of a single central section of the forums we have three separate areas that the minutes etc are posted in the one serenity started the minutes over on the nav bar to the left and now this i never know where this stuff is going to pop up
wrangler you just buried everyone elses threads
need better organization in generalseparate forums for acknowledged issues separate forum for addressed issues and then separate forum for all these results that wrangler just postedand allow csm delegates to lock threads in the assembly hall and schedule thread deletionbecause they can never plan on thread sorting but still really need a way to organize issues more forums and forum control is really what they needor one of them create a completely separate forum with powerful organization support and use that instead
we had a proclamations forum rightshould get that back and only allow ccp to post threads but give everyone the right to reply like the information portal is now
the problem s currently afterburners go almost completely unutilied outside of mission deadspace areas where mwds are prohibited this is because mwds offer many greater benefits that vastly outweigh the drawbacks  signature radius lower capacity  in addition smaller ships are not very popular in 00 pvp as their lack of firepower and durability over larger ships such as battleships and hacs due to the heavier skill requirements of bses and hacs this is a significant barrier to entry in for newer playersrecently factional warfare has introduced some revised roles for smaller ships by creating different types of complexes some of which can only accommodate frigates and destroyers others accommodating ships no larger than cruisers i like this system but i dont like the idea of hard limits that simply prohibit larger ships from entering these complexes as eve is a sandbox and i think that features of this nature remove a tool from the sandboxtldrafterburners suck small ships mostly suck in 00  fw helps but hard limits on ship types go against eves vision the solutioncreate tactical environments that encourage players to use smaller ships by incurring penalties based on signature radius the details and resources of these tactical environments could be implemented both as entirely new environments  nebula clouds containing a unique resource such as moon minerals  or as a revision of existing environments  specific asteroids belts exploration complexes or even around moons planets and stars  they would have various penalties that would apply to all ships that enter dependent on ships signature radius this would both create roles that only smaller ships could fulfil well and encourage the use of afterburners in these complexes in order to minimize environmental penaltiestldr create environments where using bigger ships is harder due to penalties based on sig radiusthere would be a simple formula for calculating these effectspenalty multiplier   signature influence    ship signature radius so if a ship with 400m sig radius entered an environment with a signature influence of 100m and a penalty to ship velocity his velocity would be reduced by 75  100m  400m  025

i agree marcus some of the ideas posted have been good but more could be added which i plan to address on my websiteif you follow the qen over 50 of the playerbase have no interest in pvp and yet they get the most content additions the last major addition for the pve side was the lolqual which 95 of owners dont even use for mining  it makes a far better jump freighter  invention was a good change as well as the exhumers but thats about itthere are also some items which would appeal to both sides such as the shipbased habitats listed on my webpage in short though please add some more detail to the pve side of things ccp
adding more types of game play cant hurt imo more ways to play the game means more ways to have fun
you already have enough attention dont believe me well okay let remove that you get flagged from looting cans concord buffs 25 hp buffs and see how it feels then
i agree with the trend that marcus notes i disagree with the black  white nature posted i follow the story do missions build stuff but i also pvp as my current corp the amarr militia shows pirating is just one aspect of the game though it does seem to attract more than its fair share of jerksthat said i think its about time the pve and industrial side got the same level of attention we have a vibrant dynamic economy with ccp even hiring an economist to keep track of it all an entire manufacturing system that means one cannot help but build ships and modules simply in order to pvp and yet the purely pvp crowd have the audacity to claim that their chosen profession should take priority and looks down their nose at those who produce the ships they fight withive always wondered what would happen if every person with industrial skills in the game went on strikeedit funnily enough this 00 issue thread is almost entirely about industrial issues as well so the cry can hardly be levelled as though were all highsec newbies wanting our cake and to eat itthis statement is just dumb and im not normally that blunt in my posts capital ships dds titans an increasing number of t2 ships aimed at pvp numerous balances and changes all aimed at pvp the introduction of an entire new militia system aimed at pvp are we seeing a trend here then again the tone and topic of your post puts you squarely in marcus camp of griefers so id not expect you to actually consider the entire game rather than your own personal spheredont get me wrong as i said i enjoy pvp but lets not kid ourselves that the other aspects of the game have had fair treatment
adam raises an interesting point
given that ccp were surprised that the csm were taking up minor issues big ones like this i think ought to be given more weight yes making this possible should at least be discussed
yeah im for this discussion as well i think its important in the interests of combat variety as for how to keep enemies from just warping away at mid range combat range  how about some kind of interdiction bubble cannon that needs a battleship grade launcher perhaps and fairly expensive ammo  or a weakershorter ranged bubble  than dictorhic capable bubbles might be a horrible idea but would sure make things brutal
what mid range combat could do with is a medium range mod which diswades disengement although allows escape unlike a scrambler something likegravition disruption field30km optimal 60km falloffhi slot item designed to fit on bs or gimped fitted bcsactvation time 20 secondwarp scrambles for 2 seconddecreases target agility by 35increases  speed required to warp out by 75
there are three ranges in eve  with a little variation for officer mods and overheating close range 5 km aka web rangemid range 24 km aka scram rangelong rangel 170km aka fleet rangeif what you are proposing is to allow for some kind of combat mechanic for the ranges between 24 and 170 then yes but i really cant see how that can happen without forcing a mechanic to exist in those ranges anyway a thumbs up for the discussion
after discussing and evaluating several options the csm voted to change the amount of required votes to bring a proposal to the csm from 5 of the playerbase to 25 of the amount of people that voted in the election effectively lowering it to 275
i really thought this csm thing was fictional pulp now i c how the mechanics of game direction will improve a greater effort might be shown in future to bring more players into the vote these notes might help some
my bad i tried looking through evesearch for votes but it must not have had cachedi support
pUFFFDtur  ccp  explained that the current 5 amount of players to bring an issue to the csm was to ensure that not a single alliance could force their issues through but that 5000 votes would be a more practical number at the moment ccp wants to keep this democratic mechanism in place but understands that either the percentage will be too high so that it would never be obtained or too low so that a single alliance can force all its issues throughthe csm conferred on its own and changed the required percentage to 25 of the amount of people that voted in the election
it was suggested to involve more alternates in the csm or to discharge uninterested alternates and appoint new ones but the csm voted against these proposals and no change was made to alternates

erm what
you do know that the rokh was made a rail boat because of the caldari players whining that they didnt have a decent hybrid platform rightps dont destroy the best sniper in the game just because it isnt how you wanted it
you do know that oses like windows have their own regional formatting code that takes care of all of this for the developer right
agreed
they had one back in beta i guess it would be embarrassing to show the amount of open issues  nonetheless it would make bug reporting a whole lot easier
i agree with the op shares have no place in the game unless a proper stockmarket is implementedeven then there has to be a way to delist ones corp from the stockmarket
of course they arnt each race has pros in one area and bonuses in one area thats why you stay in a fleet with a curse rapier and falcon for mega win
bull tell me just exactly what other race is ecm and neuts
before anyone else posts please consider how your idea will not only effect the game playability and its effect on player attraction and retention but more importantly you should consider what impact this has on the csmit is their support you seek as and as such you should not waste anyones time by suggesting anything that doesnt further their best interests or expands their enjoyment of the gameseriously just having some funmeds running lowcant get to 00 cause of those really cool choke points that ccp says are cool and expand the enjoyment of the gamei cant tell you how much more fun i have jumping into a gatecamp that blows up whatever i am driving before the armor repper does a cyclegood times theregood timesgunna have to run missions for about a week to be able to handle this kinda financial expanded fun seems my isk and my fun expand converse to the 8 guys camping that gate and their isk and funoh joyheres an ideaplease just post your travel rates and a central ghost character to accept payment and make them toll roads i mean really it would allow you more people in 00 which is a major issue for those silly people who actually want to do pirating to make a living strange how no people could adversely affect your career like it does piratinganother thing is how can those in 00  pirates and such  that want more people not figure out that if we cant get there then they wont go therehonestly do you need to be told thatreallyno ok well consider yourself toldand before you say that well all the good stuff is out here think again all this isk is in empire and after a month of pvping you will sell all that good stuff for the isk the make then you will go back to doing whatrattingyou know they make nonnetwork games that you play alone on the computer now days so you can rat there and chat with your friends and save about 20 bucks a monthsjust sayingi mean really think about iti understand some of this is to allow for some use of tactics and terrain and to actually add stratigic value to a system but to isolate hundreds of systems behind 57 routes just seems kinda  stupidanywayno real point here and since we havent even seen the minutes of the last csm meeting in iceland much less any positive effects  actually any effects upon the game would show something in the game i really am just posting to waste timethat and it is neat to see how many people actually read this crapi mean come onccp has included drone implants as a catagory in the contracts for like forever but still nothinganticloaking fieldsall kinda neat sounding stuff that wont see light of daycause expanding the enjoyment of the large subscription blockshell ccp has gone so far as to do the wink wink nudge nudge of releasing a client version that supports playing multible accounts on the same computer and actually had the hypocrisy to offer it in the same breath that they state they dont approve of doing itpriceless poo thereright up there with the large corps and alliences using third party software but once it hits mainstream it gets bannedor maybe that is how they will make everyone join an allience you only get the good stuff if you join an allience otherwise we dont allow you to actually have the cool ping voice alert software that tells you when a ship jumps into systemstrange how both bacon and hotboxing are not officially approved or supported by ccp yet one is banned and the other they actually change the official client forlife is full of stuff like that like how long will the same pvp packaged as factional warfare take to wear thinhow long till ccp starts doing something for solo play outside the mission pillor how about some consistency in the storylineplayer actions impacting the universal storyline consistant or notwhat is really mind numbing is you read all the way to here to find whatfunny
neither the topic name or the op post makes any sense at all
this will be a short typing i hope im never good at massive walls since i dont like them lolnow to start of i have noticed and i am sure some of you guys and girls have noticed that the mod for say cruise missile launcher only needs missile launcher operation yet the missiles it self needs cruise missile heavy missile operation heavy missiles and alot more before using ammou there for you can not use the mod untill u can use missiles wich is very desiving some times for new players or people training missiles for first time i suggest to fix this problem we  we as in ccp  make changes to the cruise missile launcher so you have to train same skills for the missilesexamplecruise missile launcher atm only needs missile launcher operation lv 1after it will needcruise missile launcher lv1missile launcher operation lv5heavy missile lv 3missile launcher operation lv3standard missile lv3missile launcher operation lv2secondary skill requirmentmissile launcher operayion lv1i was allso thinking changing or adding a skill so it give bonuses to the launcher as well since caldari arnt that good for solo pvpwell some of there ships arnt and that extra kick might bring caldari back into pvp instead of just missioning all the timebtw im gallente not caldari and im not train caldari so this isnt just for my benefitsflame on
yeah
x the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because the mission runner owns the wrecks and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamicthe last reply on the 1st page gives very good reasons why ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first salvage is stolen from the salvageable wreck that has the mission runners name andor corp abbreviation on it
there is an issue i am rather surprised hasnt been brought up  ok i skipped some pages and may have missed it  ninja salvaging is currently restricted to salvaging because it is safe if people are criminally flagged for salvaging and they have already invested significant skill training and isk into the ability to scan down these missions they will have no reason not to start looting the cans as well if ninja salvaging had never been safe and profitable maybe the suggestion would be a good one as it is you will just give people reason to steal anything else of value that might be in your wrecks
i r piwate too
i didnt bother reading the thread tbh im just gonna go ahead and assume that tchell is owning everyone in debateoh and i think that it should stay the way it is with no aggrobut i would love to see it aggro so that i can kill mission runners who shoot me all day long please god make it aggro
id like to see a vessel introduced with the ability to both scan and do combat which would prevent the hassle of changing ships especially when you find a site in unfriendly territory it could be prevented from being used as a simple search and destroy vessel by giving it time reduction bonuses to specifically the scan probe launcher which would make in an ineffective recon ship it would probably need cpu or a cpu reduction bonus to the scan probe launcher and a few mid and high slots for equipping the necessities like the analyzer and codebreaker while at the same time housing adequate combat ability to do some unknown sites perhaps even a ship like this for each noncapital ship size would be nice  frigate cruiser battleship  faction or t2 wouldnt bother me and im sure many explorers would appreciate such a ship no matter how hard it is to acquire since i know many go through a lot to get the sisters scan probe launcher im sad something like this wasnt discussed at the summit but hopefully such a ship comes about
this was already suggested and was turned down by the csm
we havent officially decided what to do about issues recurring and in a situation where convincing arguments can be made that that the csm reached an incorrect decision first time around im not averse to hearing items a second time the player base has raised some pertinent criticism about our handling of this issue  i think its worth us asking ourselves if we made the correct decision since the exploration ship debate has direct impact on solo playstyle and expansion of a whole area of game content
im glad this is the case most exploration content can be completed solo it just can get a wee bit annoying to have to consistently switch in and out of ships for exploring clearing and then hackingarcheology an explorationspecific vessel can help save time thats about it really while it was turn downed originally im glad the opportunity to present it again is available
im very much convinced we need a better discussion on the issue since a lot of decent arguments came from the originators of the thread i personally love the idea of solo explorers out in hazardous space being able to operate from one ship  like an scienceexploration  vessel and make a living from this stuff and i find that always forcing players to use multiple ships  gang mates for every task is actually forcing a degree of conformity into playstyle that shouldnt exist in a sandbox environment like eve this universe needs room for loners and maverick explorers in the deep frontier and i think this issue promotes that
i like to explore and think that the ships we have now are sufficentexploration ships should not be designed to be able to take out everything thats out there theres to much computer ai and what not for the scanning that takes up all the room t2 frigs for scanning should be enough and the excuse that one can not do the plexs by themselfs in low or null sec is not very defendebal people with enough experiance and proper combat ship  once the site is found  will be able to handle all the threats just because u can not jump into all the better null sec areas right away should not be the argument to have a bigger ship for that purpose it takes time to train to the level to handle all the rats in the null sec plexes this we need bigger ships for exploration because i dont want to go back for my other ship is a silly and empty argument skill up to be able to meet the threats and u wont have a problem doing it solo you need to change your outlook on life you cant have everything at once and right away
this post makes no sense people arent asking for an allinone ship because they cant do low or null sec exploration by themselves it was proposed so people dont have to switch ships so oftenpeople can already meet the threats this ship would just cut down on travel time i agree with you to an extent about skilling up sans the soapbox banter about lifestyle changes or some garbage
hammerhead and probably other devs have already said as much in their evetv interviews from months ago so its not like its a big secret how they feel about ricedout speed ships though before you ask no we dont know any specifics
doesnt that term denote modifications that are purely visual pretend to have a performance effect but dont
yes butyou know what i mean
basically there is a big difference between what most nanocomplainers talk about  30004000 mps speed  and extreme nano  700010000 mps sustainable velocities attainable with implants drugs souped up rigs etc etc  the former is a tactic and entirely valid response to the challenges of the environment the latter can cause problems because it messes with game physics the difficulty is addressing the latter in a way that does not damage the former and reduce the game into who can blob most on stargates even more
no problems bane please make sure we get the submission doc for the issue on the internal mailing list by tomorrow evening 1800 as well though all the best
linkagethere is a link to the post of a suggestion and on that post is the original topicthere is alot of stuff written in the back story articles  linkage  that i feel is verry underused there are things wirtena bout an antians civilisations deralict stargate on the outskirts of the amarr system  that the first jump gate between systems was built in amarr to hedion  surly therefore given that in the timeline it was 2051 years ago  it should look older compered to the other gates  my point is there is an awful lot of for lack of a better work lore been written for eve  but verry little of it is transferred into in game locationsmy original post highlights one such thing the system of new eden supposedly has a giant stargate larger than any other structure in eve as well as lots of ruins and wrecks ect i remember there being ruins and wreks on the scanner years back  but now as large collidables dont show on scanners there is no hope of finding anything i supose my request is that more of the lore be translated to in game locations and that we regain the ability to explore them  i think it would deepen the whole atmospheric of the game
i saw it located as one of the priorities but the individual post explaining the proposed changes is not within the post a simple mistake i guess or did i just miss it
im eager to read them too and it is always a bit disappointing when people promise exact days if you are not 110 sure it is going to be done by the time you say then a soon is far better lowers the expectations and disappointment of people
i started a thread in features and ideasto the original posti would like any support on this i could get since i think this would be a valuable and good addition to the game thank you
isnt needed imo use a destroyer
read answer i know its not needed it would however fix the picture of ships used in their role and move the maraudeur out of the best salvageship role and you wont salvage and loot a level 4 with less then 2000mUFFFD also the work is minimal concidering the introduction of a new ship class being rather extensive no new model needed no change in attachable turrets  since no weapons can be mounted and the tractorssalvagers do not use an iconic weapon no pvp balance issues since this ship has a rather well defined role
its not in that role currently my ship is ask those who see me salvage out of their tractor beams how effective i am
depends funfactor is also an opportunity cost and this factor is pretty low in missioning for somethe hauler profession may be alt for many but for some itUFFFDs amaybe for some time a main  the central issue is that the logistics of the open market are suboptimal you have to travel too often too far to get what you want especially when you want to stay flexible and just not be bound to a hughe reserve of stuff in one or two stationsfor example last week i had the idea to spread probes to more places over the region so that everyone does not have to travel all the way to the trade hub but even then one customer i interviewed was unhappy about the five jumps he still had to travel to get what he bought so i think there is a certain need to be able to provide more logistic services for haulertradersiUFFFDd like especially to ask jade constantine about this issue because in his agenda flexiblity and dynamism even it was more concerning warfare was written pretty bold
any csm care to weight in or are you busy bickering
can someone please lock this ing threadi mean really it was not ment for anyones soapbox but my ownand until you can show how the csm have done anything good or bad debating their currently nonexistant hypothetical impact is a wasteone i dont want my name on thank youi have enough trash threadsgod i can not believe this thread is still on the front pagewhat a wastedie ect
based on our feedback ccp has created an internal ui focusgroup inside the company once in a while they will be flying a guy from ccp us who is an expert in ui over to reykjavik to help rework the uiso the csm has done something but you will probably not think that it counts well then wait for the minutes while nothing will happen instantly things will change for instance the assembly arrays are probably getting changed
finally the voice of reasonpls ignore all of these other pvp wannabes
i read over the minutes and paid attention to the pos stuff listed and it had nothing to do with what the dead horse is about did csm not understand what we want why wasnt this talked about
i did the same thing i read it four times just to make sure i am growing extremely disappointed here i think what csm was really doing what some may call it a political horse trading paying attention to the pet projects and ignoring a general and unilateral call for action on this issue this is an absolute disgrace and should be taken in the account when the next socalled elections come to pass absolute disgrace and all those people who support and bleed everyday due to the outlined pos issues should voice their opinion  and call csm horse trading out
support added same to the csm for they lie about suppoorting this great ideea
as none of this is detailed in the minutes more support
those are two thumbs up seen from the side
so how does the ceo of a corp with members skilled in industry not combat prepare for a war dec ok mates lets all blind these guys with our mining lasersoh yeah thats exactly why you no skill pvp pilots in empire declare war for the easy targets if you had pvp skill you would be in 00
you must be profoundly stupid and inexperienced to think such a thingi was expecting much more sensible changes like the ones suggested my assembly hall thread instead we have several months later absolutely no change on the ccp position a dedicated fuel bay doesnt make them even remotely relevantthey are a gimmick right now rather than gameplay to that end no one cares about jump bridges or covert cyno fields when the core stats of the ship favor virtually every other ship class in the game at no point is the opportunity cost of fielding a single black ops worth the cost when you could have had an insurable carrier or a handful of hacs and battleships for the same amount when every circumstance favors other ship types 100 of the time its clear black ops need a more dramatic revision than some token noncombat tweaks particularly when you cant apply any realistic fits to any of themthat someone can suggest that the fix for a combat ship is some byzantine logic with a hauler boggles the mind the solution to black ops is bridging haulers guys relax as ive said before bridging recons and or haulers is meaningless costly and counterproductiveyou cant siege pos knock out station services or anything of value its especially wasteful when those same recons could have traveled to a system on their own without obstruction we need parsimony of balance not some roulette style balancing where the tech two version is several magnitudes worse than its tech one hull much less a single recon shipthat someone like jade with the pretense of being a guerrilla warfare expert could bring nothing more insightful or persuasive than this is truly telling and disappointing this was an area where only a handful of people could provide meaningful contributions and one that was as a result at risk of being marginalized because of its time and skill investmentlucky for us both csm and ccp completely failed to deliver
wow im totally agreeing with this im going to fish out the old blackops boost threads as there are many issues with blackops and i cant believe that only the jump capabilties are being discussed here
exactly fuel bay jumping into cynojammed systems etc etc does not solve the fundamental issue which is that black ops like assault frigs have no real world role its the old putting a band aid on a broken leg storyyou can already jump into cynojammed systems by using the gate before you say the system is camped what exactly is a black ops meant to acheive in a cynojammed system that is camped attack someone in belts do people rat when they are camping a cynojammed system nanoships or force recons are better for moving stuff in perhaps you catch a ratter or someone in station in a camped systemgood luck trying to kill such a target before the people camping rush to gank the black ops back to point there are several different real world ideas for blackops that actually give it a use in real world pvp i have written down the best ideas i have seen in the forums i have written the best idea for each category of pvp they can be inclusive or exclusive of each other1 large fleet pvp  black ops become doomsday resistantimmune long range jumpdrive snipers a bunch of these ships jump in or uncloak2 smallmid sized pvp  having the portal ability to portal any ship sub capital this way a black ops can portal his gang to destination and jump though himself afterwards just now whats the point of portal when you cannot portal hics etc through3 solo pvper  well best i read was turning these into cov ops cloaking battlecruisers since thats pretty much what they are
black ops issuesresists its a t2 ship where are my t2 resistscloak bo gets a bonus no targetting delay due to cloaking but the improved cloak give me a delay in scan res so wtf is thatcloak2 can we haz cocd bo has the stats of a force recon yet not the cloakfitting more gridcpu please2ly jump range come ongive me tank or ewar or something it has no rolecan i portal in a useful ship a hictorinterceptor anything
without greater range and a fuel bay they cannot reach their intended function as they cannot reach enemy territoryfor supply purposes we need a covert ops transport this could just be a higher level transport say level 3 covert ops transport it can jump with the black ops battleship it should just be a higher level transport and not a separate skill however add the ability to fly a covert ops frigate to the prerequisite to fly the actual ship the covert ops transport should have 3 hi slots  no turret or launcher hardpoints primarily to allow a salvager tractor beam and cover ops cloak mid and low slots should be probably 2 or 3 2 rig slots cargo capacity about 12 of the current blockade runner handling on par with a blockade runner
what is their intended function i have yet to see a single pvper actually define how to use a black ops even if it could jump further  which is no bad thing my cargo expander redeemer can benifit from such since if thats all that is changeing then all black ops will become are jumpdrive haulers with most alliances bridge networks the way that they are you can jump all the way from deep 00 via pos cynos or bridges to 1j from hihgsec and if the gate does not have a bubble up just though to highsec on the return journy skip all camps by jumping straight to a pos cyno from high sec and bridgepos cyno yourself back solo is that their intended function because thats all they are going to be used for if changing jump ranges is the only function
youre talking about transport ships as the antidote to black ops battleships no one cares that you think there should covert transports given the ubiquity of carriers rorquals and bridge networks ill paste this a few more times until you understand how spurious and irrational this is youre talking about transport ships as the antidote to black ops battleships youre talking about transport ships as the antidote to black ops battleships youre talking about transport ships as the antidote to black ops battleships youre talking about transport ships as the antidote to black ops battleshipsin any event covert haulers already exist its called a pilgrim
one complaint is that you cant haul the loot due to fuel requirements the black ops battleship still has to jump im suggesting that perhaps we need another ship to fulfill the role to collect the loot and such from such ops thus alleviating the problem the transport in itself cant jump on its own it would only be able to jump just like the covert ops frigates with the black ops battleshipit could be used to carry additional fuel as well or additional ammunition or a combination of the two thus extending the black ops operational ability the largest problem with the black ops battleship itself is it lacks the range to reach many systems it also has a small cargo capacity relative to the fuel needed the small cargo capacity affects more than just its jumping though it limits ammunition for the operation making it hard to operate for extended periods of time even if it can make it to enemy space a covert ops transport would help alleviate that problem
there function was to strike into enemy space with small commando raids something they cant do right now due to constraints of jump range fuel and ammunition reserves
small commando raids define commando raids in eve
the ability to jump into a system and hit soft targets without necessarily having to contend with the gatecamps in between  cynojammers i still believe should block them    
currently arazu  mining op  sin and manticores
to be frank  whilst the proposed issueschanges to black ops are useful they still leave the ship roleless and underhanded in combat the jump range and fuel bay isnt the base concern its more so the ships have no true role in pvpa suggested fix has been that of creating them as bs force recons has been discussed at great lengths in many topics so wont spam anymore but yes  whilst its good to see them being looked into scan res whole unable to warp cloaked and so on gives them a whole variety of issues  let alone holding no advantage in most scenarios vs their t1 variants 
and in what way is a black ops bs superior to a nano gang for that purpose
jump to what  is the enemy going to open you a cyno what is a soft target i am not trying to be defficult here i am pointing out the fact that these ships are useless for raiding roles if ccp called these kungfu ships then people would still be like omg its the best beause it has the word kung fu in it so we can kung fu our enemies its like stealth bombers there are people today who think stealth bombers are the best simply because they somehow think it has real life connectionmy friend i have done many solo and commando raids such raids rely upon speed if you are not fast the mark will see you in local and warp out or dock up or even logoff before being agressed or call for backup your commando raids are actualy what current nanogangs or cloaking nanogangs do they can charge in commando style kill people fast and run back to safety if you genuinly beleive that a black ops pilot will somehow send a recon or cov ops to destination then you may as well send a nanogang though if all that happens with these ships is extra fuel then all people are going to do is use them as cheap jumpdrive haulers insted of pvpand pvp is the point of these things
i was just comparing the stats of the redeemer with the armageddon and i am a bit surprised to see the stats of the redeemer are even worse than those of a simple tier 1 battleship trading an important low slot for a not so important med slot lower shield and armor hp and no tech 2 resists seems pretty crap with those kind of stats can it even rat in 00
put a shield extender in that mid slot
will all those its fine except for the fuel bay fans just quitunless this ship is for stealth hauling then it really does no crap to fix its lack of combat ability compared to its t1 counterpart add to this a half billion dollar price tag and i often wish that whatever crap you people are smoking was available and affordable to people in my areaits a combat ship so lets try to focus on actually making it useful there ok
sometimes its better to work in small steps rather than big leaps at once theyll have to have one covert ops or recon ahead in order to open the cyno a stealth bomber is best used for an alpha strike when the person is already distracted if you stay to shoot more than twice your most likely dead the problem from ccps viewpoint is that if they make it the equal of a t1 battleship even then the defender will have little to no chance it is better to boost in small ways first and see how it affects it rather than a large boost at once
id say the following improvements should be looked at1  seperate the cargo and fuel bay for all jump ships including jump freighters and capitals plus add a fuel bay for recon ships in order for them to carry liquid ozone  exactly enough ozone for two cynos at cynosural field generation 5  the cyno generator on these ships is currently epicly underused and this would be a good addition2  allow covert cynos to be dropped in cynojammed systems for real use of a black ops bs3  give the ships bonusses to their races recon ships combined with reducing the number of guns and adding a 100 bonus to the damage to allow for easier fittingnow for an example the redeemerthe damage and tanking abilities remain unchanged here however the utility ability is greatly improved with an added midslot for an ew module and the two spare high slots for nosneuts makes the ship much more flexible also an extra 75m3 drone bay allows you to carry spares  unlike the ship in its current state  because lets be honest youre going to be behind enemy lines for a while and youre bound to lose some dronesthis is not necessarily a boost to the ship it just allows for much greater flexibility other than the nos bonus  which follows the whole wasted bonus of amarr ships but thats another topic  these changes do not boost the ship in any way other than flexibilitythe nos bonus similar to the one on the pilgrim and curse however instead of adding amount it reduces the reduction by half which is exactly the same affect but again allows for greater flexibility rather than such a long wait between cycles remember this is a hitandrun ship not a tankmachine that can sit there foreversimilar bonusses should be given to the other races as well along with a redistribution of slots in order to allow for use of those bonussesgallente  warp disruption range  possibly an infinate point minmatar  stasis webifier range  100 bonus to range instead of 60 caldari  more ecm strength and a higher ecm jammer strength  make it like two falcons rather than just a really expensive scorp 
for large fleets mid gangs small gangs and even solo pvp these ships are pretty useless playing the t2 bs cannot be better than t1 card is not strictuly true a cerberus outclasses a carcarel a zealot outclasses a omen loosing a omen is pretty much profit loosing a zealot is a small loss loosing a equivalent of a uninsured carrier  black ops  is a big loss a faction module outclasses a conventional module a t2 gun outclasss a t1 gun a officer bcu outclasses a cheap t1 bcu cost stops people pvping in fully navy fitted ships cost is a big factor in balance thats why the vast majority of eve does not use slave sets etc for pvping back to point these ships lack a real world pvp role small nanoship gangs are far superior to someone using a black ops thats the issue not some fuel  extra range is welcomed though 
i actually find navigating the bops an issue using ingame mechanics only and using the map its far too confusing egusing jump to lists all available cynogens not just those in reachusing capital navigation menu lists all systems not just those with a gen or active cynousing map unflattened is confusing for directional understanding and flattened you lose the range sphereso this means toggling to an external tool to try to navigate nightmare tbh and with the blended travel ability of bops and jump freighters its even more of a stick to your known routes handicapany way to get an ingame map toggle for cap travel or adjust what we havebone
well seeing as how this is the hotnew bo thread ill post stuff here in more depthnoah was right to prenerf them  the issue is that having known they were prenerfed and that the older players would want a ship to keep them ingame and keep them entertained etcwhy was a known issue left so late in the day to be fixed good intentions or notforesight was lacking sorry pandrew is right with his points there  the range is too short to be of any tactical advantage  and the logistics needed for jumping makes them useless for the majority of 00 combat why spend 10 minutes preparing for a cyno jump when youre only 3 jumps out combined with this is as he saidthe fuel usage a possible fix would be ofc a seperate fuel bay  but what might make folks want to use these more is maybe no fuel cost for jump portaling only capacitor who knowspersonally id prefer not to see haulers be the answer to the fuel cost answer those who trained capitals have to work in teams even to move a battleship should not need that work especially when us jump drive folk already are tied down in that aspect heck for a jump of sufficient decency well need three charactersplayers present one cyno  god forbid if we need more than one  one hauler one black ops id prefer not to have to have such teamwork just to use my battleship seeing as we have the other end of the spectrum  carriersdreads etc  for thatfinally  as i stated in my earlier post there is no main issue with black ops its the whole shebang the scan res is nuked to hell and back due to the cloak and for that reason we have to fit a sensor booster should we want to lock faster than a carrier fair enough you might say but using my ship as an issue  and make no mistakethe widow is the better of the four children  i have to give up a mid slot to fit the sensor booster to lock in a decent time that means scan res which means no targetting range  which is already poor on black ops  combiend with that is the fact that im an ecm boat so i cost 600 mil have no tank and cant lock fast with my ecm so will be jammed by a lesser ship such as a falcon at which point i become useless fair enough those situations are avoidable to an extent but the fact remains that the attributes of the ships do not match their role guerilla warfare ships yet cant hit fast and hard because they have 1 poor dps and 2 cant lock at any decent speedoh  and then theres the last point of worse than t1 variations the widow is relatively ok  minus the above  in comparison with the scorp you dont lose much bar from ecm range  big deal but bareable  and in exchange you get higher dps raven and scorp in one is nice but i see no real value in the sin or panther or redeemer and i try and spec as much as i can for these ships in knowledgeso  yeah thanks for the confirmation on youre working on itbut please whatever you do dont think that list encompases all the issuesps  warping whilst cloaked is viable dont let the whiners dictate how you balance the game d
especially now with faction warfare this would be an amazing featurei currently have an absolution sitting in highsec amd 90 to amarr am in faction warfare and have a 4 sec status i cannot even get this ship to lowsec to be moved by carrieri would love ccp if they allowed this you dont need to repackage them just make them movableif you add a ship maint hanger to a freighter it would not encroach on carriers jobs as they would be impracticle to use them in combat or anywhere other than highsec
even though you can courierpack anything smaller than a bs for transport in a freighter and you can use a carrier otherwise some definite strong support
definitely allow freighters to carry unpacked ships or transport wrap them simple restrictions of nothing in the cargo bay at all  to stop them being used as super freighter  itty 5 with full cargo times  only can be taken out at a station though should appear as loot in a destroyed freighter  recoverable by another freighter  just to make things more interesting and risky  read only used by the stupid or desperate in lowno sec so as not to tread on a carriers toes 
add a skill que tired of skills that end at 4 am and have to switch to another skill before bedtime have 4 accounts very irritating
i would completely settle for having a one skill queue when my 3 hour skill is done switch to the next level or have it automatically dump into a long term skill that youve had your eye on for a while and would like to chip away at
im all for allowing 1 skill to be queued up and ccp removing training from accounts not currently active it gives ccp more cash by not allowing people like myself to disable an alt account while i train a 30 day skill and makes a large portion of eve happy that they arent missing as much training time  especially new players whos skills will be running out every few hours or less the first few weeks
even a queue limited to 24 hours total training time would solve the basic problem
it would be a nice feature
good to hear you are looking into it
this is really overdue now
hi there im a new player and i have something to weigh in that i think you guys are missinga lot of the skills i want to get into require long skills to unlock random example is the two level 5 electronics skills needed to unlock the short cloaking device skill in this situation i want to learn the prereqs for cloaking devices not one of the prereqs for cloaks and some oddball support skill that i was intending to learn at another time new players are trying to catch up to the minimum skillset needed to be useful in eve as it stands one of eves greatest features is that each tree you can go down as a path has an end i want to be the best caldari stealth bomber pilot ever i can do it me the guy who started the game in april 2008 now ill be nothing but the kestrelmanticore pilot to my team but i can do it and be as good at it as any other pilot whos been playing since launch and has mastered bombers nano battleships exhumers and whatever else he wanted to for all 4 races just because he has so much time inthe problem here is that the lack of a skill que means that i have to micromanage with no less than 2 third party aps  evemon and battleclinic  and scheduling of my time that is in direct conflict with my ability to enjoy my game the excel in space comment made over the ui applies here as well there are times where this game is less an enjoyable distraction and more like a second job adding some kind of ability for me to not have to drop what im doing and run to eve constantly would do much to fix thative run into periods where the only skills i want to train are synced to annoying periods work and sleep are two of them and big ones to be sure but the really annoying skill rollovers are any that tick during downtime not just the short daily downtimes either but the nice long ones like for the deployment of the new features setyeah the ability to que up a second skill would be nice nicer still would be for the game to assume that if i trained level 1 and 2 and the skill pops for eve to go gee i should probably train him into 3now i know the possibility for exploit with this mechanic but what if you limit it to one auto rollover per skill like if i accidentally forget to pop covert ops frigate from 2 to 3 it does it for me but not from 3to4 or 4to5 that way if i go out for dinner on a friday and the date goes better than id expected i dont have to pass on my social life just to roll a skill im not farming a character and i still have to come back pop the skill later but at least i dont have to decide between something in real life and my characterperhaps limit how many times that rollover can be used too twice a month perhapsi like that better than a que because it has less of a chance to be exploited it also helps with that annoying hey this 7 hour skill is gonna mess with your day mechanic
there is no need for some imbecilic weakness built into the system this is something that should have been in release as a core part of skill system can you imagine if you had to log in every 23 hours to toggle something trivial to make sure you kept gaining rested experience in wow absolutely no one would tolerate that because its sloppy and detracts from the overall experienceyour ui team must be a bunch of interns and boyscouts
i read lots of the posts but couldnt read all of them so if someone proposed this idea before me consider my vote to itif not then here is my new idea  how about a train new skillskill you know like umm under the learning skills add a new train tree that makes you able to que skills with better and better results the more you pour skill points into it say  just an example  lvl 1 allows you to que up skills into a 1 day time frame and ea lvl grows it exponentialthis format would allow for those annoying short time skills to train without constant reloggingbut not let the 20 day  36 day que up while account deactive as to ccp contention that it encourages game play to log for skillssorrytotal bs most play when they have time not because they just happened to have to reset skill and even if what they contended was trueits your accountyou paid for itif you want to pay real money to just train and not play thats your rightyou paid for iton a side note with my alt ive been in this game just after it came out of beta  some of my friends where in betai was a eber  and the que issue has always been just thata issuethat they have always pushed off into the future and never addressed it has always gotten mouth service and promises but never addressed it is high time it is taken from the issue catagory and added to the solved catagorynot middlekindly upgrade it to top
i still support the idea of a skill queue anything from 12hrs to 2 days long would be fine it is the short skills that are a pain especially when they end when i am not able to login to eve to start a new skill trainingwhen i have to login to start a new skill say before i go to work i am sorely tempted to sit down and play heh if that did happen i would lose my job and then not be able to pay to play eve  it is more annoying to login just to set a skill and not be able to playi will be happy if they at least just implement this for the time being but thats me ab
why not add a skill queue implant or item that cant be reused once the skill queue is complete
wooti can put skills this evening that finish tomorrow when i get back frm work
thank heavens now we just need to get priority for this over nonsense like walking around stations
like 99 of other players i have no idea why a limited queue wasnt implemented 3 years agothis issue has been beaten to death hammered into the ground and driven halfway to the coreit is in fact the single mostannoying aspect of eve and has driven away friends of mine from the game its so aggrevatinglack of queue does not encourage playing eve it encourages cancellations of subscriptions i myself ought to knowi spent almost a year tweaking skills for 10 seconds and then playing things i enjoyed more or just going to work in the meantime ccp enjoyed my dollars and didnt have to put up with my server load if this is the goal then bravo crappy design happy marketing department except of course for those 6 months i couldnt be arsed to do it anymore and killed rebillingi am not alone in thisnow im trying to enjoy eve again  and succeeding more thanks  but yeah ive got about five skills hanging between 6 hours and 1 hour remaining waiting for me play long enough to finish them off before i can move on to the ship i want to fly meanwhile yet another 5day skill is ticking down while im away at work or with my family or whatever and when i come back to the game ill be no closer to stealth bomber than when i leftbroken but then you know that2skill queue limit the first skill to less than 2 days time train them sequentially or train them in parallel it doesnt matter that much but hades do somethingfinallykrum
when i first heard the idea i hated it having read the forums i like iti like the idea of the dual queue it allows you to train 2 for a short duration say 8 hrs  work college sleep etc  however it also gives you the flexibility to set 2 skills that require 9 days each allowing you to go on vacation by the time you get back both skills are down to a more manageable 2 days
skill queue please some people have to work and sleep
you know there is damn simple and good compromise to thisno skill quebutlet the same skill continue training until it reaches lvl 5 at which point all training stops and the pilot must manually activate training up a new skillfor example i start training up cruisers it trains up 1 2  3 4 5 then stopsthis way you dont waste time if you cant log on to switch skills but at the same time you have to login to switch between skills
im thinking of the train next level 1 stage thingforexample if i start training cruiser3 it does cruiser4 too when its done with the previous but wont do cruiser 5  it should auto start training the next level of the skill once without me doing anything
it doesnt need to be any complex system peoples frustration seems to be around the sp they would lose by not logging in to change skills immediatly their last skill completedthis could be resolved by simply allowing a limited amount of skill points to accrue while no skill is training say 4 hours worth when the person logs in and changes skills those points would be immediately applied to that skill and it carries on as normal this would allow it to be easily adjusted for balance by altering the length of time they accrue for or the rate they accrue at it also leaves room for skills to modify it if needed in future
the need for some kind of queue is so obvious one has to wonder about ccps continuing reluctance to actually address the issuei support some sane limitations  2 skills or unlimited skills within a 100hour maximum etc  but the argument about character farmers is pretty lame far more often is a popup in the middle of a mission or a murtherin great battle or something distracting the player from play which should be the goal of the programmersvs
no kiddingi could not possibly care less about ambulation
why didnt eve get this feature in its very first patchit seems obvious
yes punish the people who actually have a lifea short skill queue is a good thing
sph depends on the primary and secondary attribute the new skill must have the same primary and secondary attribute otherwise one would be able to accrue sp with his highest attributes  say intmem  and use them in a section with his lowest attributes  say perwil i quote myself from another threadbut i guess training two skills at one time with 12 speed will be more easy to implement
yes and while this logic is true allowing an unlimited que length would allow them to purchase such farm character account then set the que and not pay for it again until its ready to be sold this is not a profitable scenerio for ccp and it still uses there equipment we should all know that personally non of us are willing to work for free for extended periods of time current game mechanics allow farmers to purchase accounts and train skills they are forced however to continue paying for those accounts and using those accounts there are loopholes where you can setup your skills so that on the ending day of the month of your sub term you can set a long skill and in reality get free training out of ccp repurchase your sub as your skill is finishing does all this mean ccp should stop the process of training if your subscription is cancelled i dont persaonally think so i think the use vs reward for ccp as is more than ok i beleive a skill que is a must needed asset to the game it would draw alot more player base of the target audiance that ccp is geared towards 2050 ish range i assume since our current player base is of averge age of like 2735 or something like thatlets cap it to a set number say 5 for this example those 5 skills cant be totalling more than 168 hours of training notice hours trainable equals a full 7 days  those same 5 skills also can be a single skill trained multiple levels in sucession ie gunnery 12345  since gunnery is only a 1 time modifier it would not break the hour limitation and thus allow 5 skills to be qued together this system not only stops the character farmer from not paying for an account it also soves the player bases request for the annoying 6 hour skillsnow to finally reply to the quoted poster since you say you dont buy into the whole character farmer argument are you a character farmer
as a new player i also find the lack of a queue incredibly frustrating i am training up low level skills that only take 14 hours so i have to spend my whole weekend constantly logging in to change skills or train up a higher level skill that i dont really need right now i cant get any meaningful training done during the week because i work for a living as others have suggested the lack of a queue does not encourage me to play it encourages me to spend hours looking at evemon to make sure all my skills end at times when i am reasonably assured of being able to log in and switch them one would think with the number of people logging in changing skills then logging back out ccp would want a skill queue to relieve some of the demands on the server as for character farming something tells me if people can spend all day farming for gold on wow they can spend all day logging in and changing skills
how about a skill que with a time restriction say one that wont allow you to que skills that come to more than 12 or 24 hours at a time most people just want something to get them past the times when theyre sleeping and working this way they could and ccp would still be assured that people were logging in at least once a dayby limiting time instead of the number of skills in the que you could get rid of a bunch of short little skills without having to stay logged or continuously log on and offbest regardswindjammer
the queue need only be 2 deep current  short  skill and next  long  skillthe dual training would achieve the same effect but would likely be more complicated
why do people keep thinking this is a good idea whether its every couple hours every day or every few days logging into the game long enough to set new skills isnt playing the gamemaking a queue to clear out small skills might be useful to some but it would ignore the larger skills and then those folks who want a queue for their spring break are stuck trying to find wifi from whereversome other folks have talked about setting chains rather than just queues where you can say i want to fly a covert ops effectively tell me when and then the game will autotrain frigates covops electronics cloaks and suddenly you can fly the shipthis is a bad idea and everyone knows it if that were possible people would buy the books and set a character for titan v then theyd come back in a year and sell the character on ebayonce again im completely in favor of current skill  queued skill if they happen to be two lvl v and youre set for weeks so be it at least im not looking for a connection on the beach
awaiting word on medium and heavy mining drones as well now hoping for a hulk alternative that focuses on drone mining better than hulk with t1 strips but less than hulk with t2 crystals a better omni miner rigs help with drone ore yield but ganglinks help with strip miner yield so hulk is still far better in a gang
hmmmmmimplants are tied to skills and there are not very many skills that affect drone usethe chocolate covered thump of inaction says yes that is rightadd more skills and make drones less of a gimme while expanding their role and depth while also allowing for differant types of drone ships and the addition of drone implantsgolly chocolate covered thumb where have you been all this timethats not chocolate is it
not much to say here other than just spam a support post
weird almost like its war or something go figureif we pretend this is actually an issue in the first place which it isnt  remember that thing about not logging into hello kitty online  war dec cost should be looked at before any radical changes to the system itself as an extension of reevluating cost perhaps something like cost goes up based on the ratio of members of the corps involved could work eg if the two corps have equal members  or the agressor has fewer  the cost is of x where if the agressing corp has a ratio of 21 the cost is 2xknock it off with the carebear handholding ccp eve hasnt come this far because youve been doing it wrong all this time
all of the ccp representatives on this issue have very valid points the current system does essentially create a payforgrief opportunity limited only by the income of the corp in question furthermore it does deter younger players from leaving the npc corps heck its the whole reason you see macro farmers in npc corpssince if they were out there stripmining belts 237 in a player corp theyd eat so many wardecs their logistics chain would vanish instantlywhich is in fact exactly the intention of the systemi dont know if theres a fair way to force farmers out of npc corps and into vulnerable corps  special npc ones or player corps or not as for addressing the concerns of matt  ccp  you can provide the option for more limitedscope wars  to an empire region constellation or a system theoretically  to perform those attacks on logisticschains and at the same time rebalance costs for corps with high sptotals that attack others with comparatively low sptotals sptotals here are a proxy for playerexperience and networth since calculating either of these on the fly would be very difficult to impossible if you can come up with a structured approach to objectives in wars then that would be great to see presented to the playerbase for discussion its a bit complex to get into detail on in this thread the mind swims with what would have to be covered however for such a system you would need to include some capability for the defender to defeat the war rather than just preventing victory and letting a war time out in other words conditions under which it ends earlykeep in mind here that wardec are a limited excuse under concord oversight for corporations to break the rules they are not unlimited war as you get in 00 and should represent the interests of the empires in policing violence while permitting extralegal justicekrum
an end purpose for the war victory conditions  yes please when declaring a war we should have a select box with options1 isk demand we want this amount of isk x milcorp wallet transfer solves it2 isk loss inflicted we want them to lose x milkill mail isk like estimates3 corporation disbandno players left in the corp member count 04 drop in player base xeg 80 corp attacked has 100 members 80 leave achievedthis can be abused easy i think it would be cool  but i have no idea how to not abuse it you guys are smart figure it out5 evacuate area check x days for players using agets in the area  having officeslocator like system need x days to check if they are there this needs someone smarter to figure out how to work properlynote victory canditions can be made public by a check box when public the enemy can see themwhen not public only the war deccing corp can see them
i think that the problem presented by wrangler will remain  griefing the smaller corp by the big boys 1 give us 1000 bil isk the war will continue for ever and the problem will remain2 we want them to lose 1000 bil isk the war will continue for ever and the problem will remainand this two are enough for the present system to continue and nothing will change3 corporation disbandno players left in the corp member count 0as i understand the idea is to encourage the formation of smaller corp without the fear or being disbanded because of a war dec from a bigger and bored corp
the involvement of mercs in a war could take the form of an attachment system an temporary alliance where you attach another corp for a limited time and that corp becomes involved in your warsthis allows for a quicker response to a griefing wardec than getting a merc corp to wardec the aggressor
most griefers i know are significantly smaller than their targets that way they are more likely to find people to fight
lets stay away from the farmer issue on this one cause we all know they will end up corp hopping in player corps have fun wardecing 3948732y7y corp 27238yf corp and 2083yu8r corp that are being made whenever they need to hope but yeah the merc contracts that would be helpful although they need to be instant the 48 hours to get into a fight could means  dead client pos in highsecmakes us able to do our jobs you know
hopefully the wardec will follow the characters in the corp for the rest of the week to stop the lame corphopping too
actually i really like the command bunkers idea although not necessarily in that formsomething that when a war dec is declared the defenders can do which ends the war dec and means the attackers cannot declare them again for x time  say 3 months  yes the attackers can disband and reform their corp or switch corp or whatever but then you just complete the objective again and soon enough they will stopthat objective can be selected by the attackers upon declaring the war and then from there it is fixedfor exampleattackers declare one of their high or low sec pos as a command bunker  any pos they like could even be an anchorable pos module destroy the pos end the warattackers declare a ransom to be paid by the victim which cannot be set to more than 10millnumber of people in corp at time of war dec the ransom if paid goes to the attackers and the war endsthe attackers declare that they will get x kills per day  number being something like number of people in target corp  10  no rounding so if 3 peolpe in corp you need one kill every 3 days etcbut to reiterate the attackers choose one of these options at the time they start the war for example a ransom corp would choose option 2  which would automatically handle the ransom a griefer corp vs a bigger alliance might chose option 3  whereas one vs a corp similar in size might chose option 1but in the case of option one the defenders can hire mercs to help take out the posor whateverso to reiterate  no victory conditions for the attackers as presumably they had one in mind when they war decced  well maybe the ransom one is a victory condition for them  but when the attackers declare war they have to give one for the defenders
this is eve not hellokittyonline players can group and organise in safety  inside the stations once you undock youre out in the wide worldanhkwhateverhernameis needs to get over that facteph
it would be nice to have something between the few million isk itty v and the billion isk freighteri want to haul more than an itty v can hold but not that much more
this is good  
also important thing is moon mining in empire because few towers produce near 100k m3 so i need freighter to catty out but it dangerous and jumpfreighter is more safety but cost too much so middle size industrial what cost 300400 mil can carry 200300k m3 and have agility better then freighter is real cool but this ship must have enough hp for safe from one2 bsh not like industrial
this 24 cans of capacity and the ability to fit modules nothing fancy just an iteron or badger with a bigger hold call the class hauler
it looks to me like there are 2 ships that people want a minirorq that cant compress and just hauler between the huge and hugely expensive fighters and a regular indy maybe another type of t2 indy that instead of the blockade runner aspect just has a bigger holdpersonally i would like to see both a larger indy would be good for fueling setting up posses and such and a minirorq that can use ether the capital tractor or has a bonus to the regular tractor would be very useful for hauling to a rorq at a pos
thirded really not everyone who would haul has 2 billion  1 for ship 1 for cargo  laying around to invest in a single entity theres an awefully long way between an industrial and a freighterkrum
for me this ship is not a responce to freighter ganking or any other downfall of freighters other than the skill and isk cost of themthe one overriding factor of my support for this ship is the need for it to be easially accessable to small corps who otherwise wouldnt be able to devote the resources needed to get a capital class haulertherfore nothing fancy no jump drives no ewar poncyness and certainly not t2 just a big ass t1 hauler to move stuff between stations and possably posesim not too sure about allowing it to scoop cans though if you do allow it to who in their right mind is ever going to fly the oldstyle haulers anymorei would prefer this to be a huge industrial ship rather than a smaller freighter if only to avoid the freighter skill the equivilant of battleship size and probably just a bit over battleship cost as well seems about right120000m3 is the size of the largest courier contract you can make so i see a target for this ship i also like the symetry of a 200mil isk pricetagas for whether you go for 4 racials or a single flavour mining barge style doesnt matter too muchanyway bring it on so i can retire my aging mastodon
the easiet way to counter that is to make it skill intensive who in there right mind flies a badger 1 etc people who dont have the skills to fly anything better there are always plenty of low skill point players who will be a market for existing ships
sign
people who have less to move and will use a cheaper ship to do it
i like isazmodeus suggestion
eh but i would like to have a smaller ship that can carry a battleship or two and costs less than a freighter going 50mil for a transport to 900mil for a freighter is a bit of a big step
my thoughts exactly
150k to 300k in cargo space  skills and mod dependant no rig slots3 lows  two wcs and a cargo expander gets you at least three battleships 2 mids  for moderate tanking 1 high slot for a single tractor with a bonus to range  eliminate it from the salvage role alignment slightly higher than itty vwarp speed same as itty vhalfway resists armorshield between itty v and blockade runnersno drone baymild bonuses to mining gang and skill dependantinvented off the top haulers prints and requires some capital parts and t2 components build cost should try to fall in line around the 280 to 500mil mark
yaywhen will it get ingamewhenwhensoon or eventuallybetter be nowsugarrush that is no sugar 
qft i would allow the rigs to be built seperately and then only installed by building them into the ship during construction that way these new rigs could be traded and sold outside of the actual build jobalso as a purely radical change you could have base hull values for each race that allowed certain bonuses disclaimer all numbers are pdooma disclaimersay a caldari bs hull could give any 2 or 3 or insert your number here  of the caldari bs bonuses at so the scorp ecm or raven torpcruise bonuses after that is decided you select a number of engine components armor plates shield emitters drone bay size etc now the racial hull type will limit maximum values or establish the penalties for increases the idea here is to either limit caldari hulls to a total maximum armor amount or to make an amarr ship have a 10 speed reduction for some amount of armor plate and a caldari ship a 25 penatly for the same amount of armor you would even have to add the turret and missile hardpoints and at the end have your own custom bpo that would be an awesome reward for a rd agent
no no norisk of low sec or 00 is why people do not leave empire if they want to risk for higher reward the option is there they choose not to risk with out the safety of an alliance already established in 00 there is little option other than ninja runs in and out of 00 for many
i will agree with thisi also like anhks idea of making the reward for a pathway in specializing to be something already existing like a rig as was previously brought up there is room for 8 rigs in the ship configuration menu depending on the skill and dedication of a manufacturer they could have 1 or 2 rigs go into the production on the wpa industrial i kicked around an idea for having a manufacturer pick a faction they wished to specialize production in while we talked about the issue it was brought up there should also be a way to back out of one specialization and train another  like maybe a fee and a waiting period  say i want to specialize in amarr items most amarr ships have cap issues perhaps a rig for cap or for making the lasers use less cap but something that is already established with in the item databasemaybe a production of large beams ends up with 1 or 2 t2 large beams of that type along with the rest of the production batch  run 100 units 98 regular  2 t2  the options are really out there is just a matter of looking  
science is already one of the most heavily skill intensive areas of the game with really relatively direct game influence why would we want to add more skills and more complexity to itpersonally i think this is a bad ideathe idea of more customizable blueprints i like the integral rig idea where you can swap them out is good new skills to allow that would be fineim leery of the idea of allowing more t2 bpos especially in any random system as the previous lottery was shown to have been manipulated from time to time
1  cool2  agreed3  why not4  supported5  i loled its unrealistic hope you can deliver better arguments than that if these components could be gathered in high sec  maybe something to make high sec exploration fancy again  im in if its intended to take the t2 barrier on to t1 and force carebears to low sec to gather the stuff  jump from a bridge 6  variable outcome yes like runsmepe t2 bpo render the whole invention thing obsolete do they not the problem is that there are allready t2 bpo in eve so id say yes7  epic wrangler just epicso yes we are in fact aliens you couldnt have phrased that any better wrangler simple questiondo you want the eve community to grow do you want to earn more isk then i strongly advice that ccp starts to see the  behind us carebears and therefore generate pve content immediately and try to avoid such formulations at least except we hear something similar for the other percentage of players ask the csm how these players should be approached and if there should be allocated less resources in order to allocate more resources for that other percentage of players  thumbs down
good way of working around the issue you could produce a stripped ship without bonuses  or with fewer  and give it extra tweak slots  up to 5 for tech1 6 for tech2  using those remaining rig slots in the fitting screen very elegent build these manufacturing tweaks out of metacomponents rather than rig parts and have these stripped ships come with very high calibration you would need to need to modify the manufacturing screen to accomodate design calibration or perhaps introduce the customization step as inventionthis could also be used during manufacturing of metamodules if you do this you will need to add more manufacturing slots you could mesh it with tweaked ships  see above  and metamodule manufacturing howeverno no bpos do bpcs for metaitems  also possible via invention  metatech2 items and the like if you want more special items add them currently you only have at most 4  nonfaction  variations of a basic tech 1 meta 0 itemadd a few more with variation to different attributeseffectsstay far far away from bpos if you really want to reward people hand out longerrun bpcsand even let them research better efficiency on thembut no more bposfirst we suggest you be less patronizing we like your sandbox too but are generally more riskadverse because we have less time to put in to recover lost isk from meeting violent natives that said here are some limited suggestions that either address the risk or provide something interesting do more with exploration seed highsec with more exploration sites that escalate rewardingly into lowsec make a player in an explorationmission deadspace at least as hard to probe out as it was to find the site to begin with there are many other ideas you have suggested in your todo list for explorationimplement them smarter npcs redesign your npcs using eve fitting tool give them some statebased ai so they react less stupidly possibly hire the indigame guy who did armageddon empires to help you rebalance rewards for their harder state structure mission encounters so its possible to use more tactics  hitandrun jamming etc look at pvp  seed these new npcs in new missions and new exploration sites with warnings to players story elements and the like so yeah content and if you balance things theyll leave highsec just try not to be too patronzing about itkrum
everyone seems to be hating the option of t2 bpos but the fact remains that if you dont fix existing bpos then there exists a grave imbalance to anything you try to do for bpcsi for one believe that the only real solution is to allow the introduction of new bpos whether through a chancebased system of creating new bpos through invention or perhaps through the lp store any other fix to existing bpos would be unfair to current owners of t2 bpos as unfair as this is to new players  or is it  it better levels the playing field between existing bpo owners and the notsofortunate characters stuck with bpcs than invention ever couldtheres no real way to tell the difference between someone whos worked for months to buy a bpo  screw them over by turning bpos to highrun bpcs  versus someone who has held onto their bpo for months as an isk printing device
the comment from ccp below is a big deal and it needs to be fronted so that others can see itthis issue needs to be split off from the industry discussion ccp noted that a large percentage of players never leaves highsec and wants to know from the csm how these players should be approached and if they should allocate more resources to create content for this type of playerbefore we get into all the little details of invention industry missions exploration ect we need to discuss the big issue of the highsec player thats the core issue herewere not all the same and each have our own ideas of what wed like to see added but that belongs in the features and ideas forum what we need to get across to ccp however is that many of us will never get into the lowsec game and why then we can hope to have our ideas heardfor me personally i enjoy the social aspects of multiplayer games and cooperative game play but have no interest in any sort of hardcore playing style where i have to watch my back all the timealthough i have plenty of friends im not team sports kind of guy a buddy or two getting together for a common goal is one cool but i have no interest in the alliance  corp power struggles im not going to play any game that simply allows me to be harassed for the enjoyment of others luckily ccp allows us to be relatively safe and thats where ill stay its ridiculous that i play in a game where i have to post my opinions with an alt to avoid ingame harassmenti enjoy goals challenges competition  there must be an option for this that does not include random unregulated pvpim increasingly frustrated that all the best content is in lowsec only and that in order to enjoy it i need to play with personality types that i try to avoid
one more comment while im at itat least one a day i hear how eve is strived to be realistic and a sandbox and the riskreward thingrisk does sometimes equal reward in real life but isnt an investment a risk wouldnt pve be a risk if it werent so darn easy im sick of the notion that highsec dwellers are risk averse just because we dont fight themalso isnt it even more true that hard work  rewardwhat about that dynamic i want ccp to get rid of the progress ceiling limitations on the working class of eve and let us accomplish it all our way
the ability to end up with a t2 bpo from invention shouldve been in from day 1 imo
change the cloaking mechanics a bit so that bombs can be fired while bieng cloaked when the bomb is fired the ship firring the bomb will be visible for a short time span shorter then decloaking and cloaking again  like a fade time that would enable like intercepters and other fast locking ships to slock the bomber while big ships would still be unavaliblechanging the cloaking mechanics to a fade time or the like would also mean that bombers would most likely only use passive module boostersproblem with stealth bombers was always that they wore designed to lock and fire at a target wile they wore cloaked so if you want to fix them and there issues you should look into bringing the stealth back into the bomberi know this gave a record number of problems when bombers wore first introduced but you should still take a look at this option  as the are still paper thin and easy to killmaybe only allow bombs to be fired with a fade timer and leave the cruise missiles like they have always beenand maybe consider some kind of mechanics where the bomber can only carry the bomb it have got loaded already and then implement some kind of support mechanics for the stealth bombers for reloading the bomb launcher so it physically requires more people to manage this ships team work ect so that the ship doesnt become a solo pwner
bombs are pretty expensiverather than changing how the bomb launcherbombs work we might need a new platform to use them fromsay a stealth heavy bomber maybe a tier 2 or 3 covert ops shipit would have perhaps bonuses to bomb range bomb damage or bomb area dependent on raceperhaps even the ability to fit a covert ops cloak making the shorter range of bombs still useful if you can sneak close enough
aoe weapons are an abortion  bombs  largely unsupported  smartbombs  or a must have  oblivion dd  great balance would use again a
i like this  another t2 ship type designed around bombs able to warp cloaked deploying bomb blinks the cloak allowing fast lockers a chance due to their potential if the delivery platform is sorted out the current price tag seems ok
for me the two biggest issues are the sec hit the having to stay uncloaked until detonationtwo simple solutions sec hit reduce the hit in 04 or lessstaying uncloaked  what is the point in having trained cloaking to have a 5 sec turn around time if the primary function of the ship negates this  add fire and forget to it if youve fired one of these things then youve just committed millions of isk to a single strike  at least let it go off and allow the firer to be alive to see it  blobs are a pain in the neck and itd be nice to have a decent retalliation other than the lets go and get a bigger blob approach to removing them cough bob maximum damage
actualy this cannot worki explain why when you warp on a blob  you have a random 1 to 10 minutes freeze to charge the grid acording to the number of ships in the gridif you are not cloaked the blob have enought time to pod you even if 10 bombers warp in togetherif ccp realy want bombers become an anti blob ship it have to be able to stay cloaked the time for client to charge the gridi see only one solution for this  make sb able to use covert op cloaking devicehowever there is a problemcovert ops will become useless and bombers overpoweredgood luck to balance team to solve thisidea  change the bomb launcher and give the following ability  activation of a bomb launcher module cloack the ship for 1 warpby activating the launcher the ammo  bomb  is used and cannot be recovered by any waythe offensive effect of the bomb is released as soon as the launcher  and cloak  is switch offrestrictions   bombs are expensive in isk and cargo this is ok you have to be aware you have enought cap for the warp you are about to do to the blob if not youll lost you ammo in the void using a covert op as scout to ensure you warp in the good place will give you more chance to survive  warping to 0km will uncloak you then release the bomb this would introduce UFFFD new tactic  the kamikaze ship but if you are poded before the bomb explode pilote will be killpoded by his own bomb making this tactic quitte dangerousproblem 1  this can give a paying cov op abbility to sb for example you could  1 activate module 2 get a cloaked warp 3 then jump to a gate or lof offsolution 1  if the launcher is not released the charge explode in the ship doing full damage to the shipproblem 2  can it be implemented  this change the use of module up to now modules have only one effect  activate disactivatethis idea introduce 2 effects for one module and both have to be player controledsolution 2  for devsthere is problably other things to sayfeel free
well as is being noted here  the greater blob will always hold the advantage because they get to load incoming ships individually rather than all at once like the incoming fleet does thus what needs to be done is that when warping to large engagements one shouldnt come out of warp until the full landing grid has already been loaded
i am a feverent nemesis pilot i love the look feel and everything about the ship when i heard about bombs i literally squealed in delight then the bombs came out and i realised ill probably never get to use them1  too expensive2  too weak3  must be shot out from a ship being used in a way that involves it getting close to the enemyi agree with any changes being done though i think the most important thing to change would be their cost they just cost far far too much
decrease the size of bombs or increase the size of stealth bomber cargoholdsthe current price doesnt seem too far out of line considering what bombs should be able to doincrease the area of effect a bitleave the damage as is for nowget bombs to
 thisregarding auditors there is much they can do with api to substantiate the claim of someone starting an ipo except tell the difference between a bpo and bpc  anyway that could get fixed ccpno mater what the auditors findings its only on what has been done up to that point no assurance the person requesting venture capital will actually do as they say
why should the stock market be any different than the rest of the gamei mean alts are used by everyone to avoid involving their corpsalliances they are used to post with haul goods to empire sell items and buy items i fail to see how they would be any more detrimental to the stock market
exactly creating a secure way to sell and buyback shares would be step 1we already have auditing in the form of the api  increase the amount of information from the full api though  from there everything would already fall into place and design mechanics issues would become readily apparentwhen we the players say we want a stock market we are not asking for an entire new ui overhaul new windows major additions we are asking for a secure and easy way to transfer shares between players make shares contractible the market will create itself
should a corp decide to go publiccreate two types of stock voteing and nonvoteing stockstock valuationfor non voting stock1 the full value of the master wallet  a corp set percentage of each other corp wallet division  set between 2 and 10  the master wallet cannot be less than 20 of the total of all isk in the corp should it fall below that it auto drafts from the other wallet divisions eqauly to bring its self back to 202 nonvoting stock can be sold and traded freely between players3 non voting sock can be sold back to the original corp at current value  based on valuation 1  this will create a stock that fluctuates in value which is a good thing for investors speculators based upon the strength health of the corp issuing the stock  it also does not kill corp management by having voting stock out there in the hands of the massesvoting stock1 can only be issued by the ceo2 is valued at the full value of the all wallet divisions divided by the amount of stock issued including the nonvoting stock 3 the ceo through the corperation can at any time buy the stock back at full valuethis creates ownership in a corp for corp members  directors it still allows the corp to get rid of a problem member by buying thier voting stock backi would like to see some way of tagging corp assets for instance if the corp buys a moros then that moros is tagged as a corp asset and cannot be sold or contracted out of the corp except by successfull vote regardless of who currently has possetion of it the asset would also contribute value to the corp stockany one coming into possetion of said asset would be notified that it belongs to xyz corp that xyz corp has been notified of its whereabouts and that thier use of it constitutes agro and that they can be fired upon without concord intervention this would curb a lot of corp theft or at least give the injured corp some recourse  more pvp  just a few suggestionstribe
thisaccountability and trust are issues that extend fair beyond the scope of just the stock marketno attempt to address those issues would be effective if approached only with the intent of creating a foundation for the stock market as it must address all aspects and styles of game play for it to effectively protect those investing into the stock marketall that we are asking for is the means to contracttrade shares securely
allow people to destory station services rather then just disabling themdisabling a service would be the first step in a process to destory it a second step mightshould include some minigame or somthing basically somthing that wasnt based on firepower but some other form of skill where the people holding the station wore still able to counter the actual atempt once the technical disabling step have been completed the station service should like undergo something similar to a reinforced timer maybe and after that the service could be dismantled completely firepoweronce all services are destroyed the station would be fully inactive the only thing you would be able to do was to undock from it and leave it in space maybe change the station gfx at this point similar to when the evil gallente flew a nyx into a caldari stationoutposts should be reparable with a process similar to that of upgrading the outpost  thus spending all this time disabling and destroying the services would actually impact on the holders of the outpostassets in the station would be all but intact but they would be inaccessible i know this is kind of a compromise but what you should remember is that the game mechanics for this are mostly already in placeyou can lock and disable a station service  just need to make the station service unlockable when it have been destoryedthe upgrade system is already in place and the features and mechanics of this system can thus be used to implement the repair process of a stationwhat needs to be implemented is a way to prevent people of lets say using a item in a disabled stationi can only find a record few places where it would actually make sence but stillbpo research copy factory would all be posible at a pos with in the same solar system as the outpost was located even though it was disabledscammers would have a field day selling items that wore available in a disabled station that go go both for escrow and the general marked
we have a war dec system that has no victory conditions entire ship classes that are broken and useless and you want destructible outposts
1 total destruction 2 boom boom and pillaging 
being able to pop outposts will stop alliances building them what would be the point in having a major asset poping when a pos does allmost the same thing
on my mind outpost should be destroyable  some but not all asset in the outpost can even be destroyed or simply dammaged but wreck should not  as titans are actualy moreover it should be possible to repair an outpost wreck  by using components required for the egg an outpost should be recontructed backoff course youll need sovereignty as if you build a new outpost but cheaper
outpost destruction is out of the question you rent offices out to corps and entire corps have there assets in there or there must be a way that all assets are transfered to empire to a npc station  because i tought that ccp goal whas to get more people in 00 not to get a 00 dessert where there are no people left or just 1 big alliance rampaging 00 as soon a alliance try to get an outpost in a 00 system destructible outposts is the end of 00 and the end of eve jita is bad but whatto think if you in empire with 20000 people in that heap
as said greeny knight if ever outpost become destroyable the asset inside would not be destroyed pillaged otherway you can be sure 00 will be much more less tasty for playerwill make lot of player leaving the game  i dont think ccp would be ok btw its true that doing a derelict mode where no service are available and should be rebuild  a major task which cost money and need to bring lot of stuff to repair services by services would be cool 
no matter what the disconnect is on ccps end it has to get resolved this cant go on changing ammo is the most frustratingly bad situation sounds to me from wranglers minutes that the transactions between modules and the database need to be rethought somewhat
just stagger it rather than making it simultaneous when you get used to doing it you can do eight guns in just a few seconds so whatever load that causes is already present how fast the ammo changes isnt necessarily the issue its the effort involved so an option that loads the guns over the course of a few seconds would do
hmm if it causes to much server lag i think we can do without it
it has always been that way its just an opportunity to handle it better on the server side why is it creating so much load in the first place should be the question
one click is what we want most not all at once ad literamso make it one click but switch the ammo in loop
last night i had this dream where i did a close reading of this issue and in this dream it was revealed to me that there was a fearful symmetry to ccps logic of ammo switching and another deeply hidden feature the much requested skill quelet me elaborateif ccp fears that a skill que is unnecessary or detrimental we can rearticulate this position as follows ccp discriminates against features that streamline or enhance mundane tasks because ease of use doesnt encourage players from playing while the opposite is in fact true thus if a feature enhances playibility and if a reload all is a feature that enhances playability then the only logical conclusion is that we must avoid this feature because in reality it could mean that the fans play less not more qed
pleasehell even something to fix 50 of my crystals from not loading watching gun 1 load and then gun 2 load oh and when gun 2 loaded it stole the crystal from gun 1 and then gun 3 loads then gun 4 loads stealing the crystal from gun 3it sucks
you dont just use the current formula and then x 8 youd pick from the possible damage range using a vitual dice eg 10 chance of doing 50 1075 20 for 90 20 for 100 10 for 105 20 110 10 120 the allow the client computer work out which shots were scratches wreakings etcitd save tons of work for the server but youd never get 8 wreakings  
little fix probabilities will bite you in the ass sometimes
how much of a difference would it be to have one playerissued action to reload all turrets with another type of mission compared to the reload all feature compared to eight playerissued actions to change or reload ammo on all  max 8  turrets one by oneitems are moved around in either case maybe trying to improve the way it is done  codewise  would help and it would be less of a concern for all the cases abovethe only aftertaste i can imagine are amarr drooling all over the place
lulz at ccp for beleiving there fears are not already true any good fc should already be commanding fleets to reload on command and the frustration on the server is accumulated by the some 250 pilots in battle to switch 8 guns manually would the server better handle the process of one command 250 times or 16 commands times 250 and seriouselly why would you ignore your paying customers with a function they have been asking for for almost 5 years just to y to beleive they wont leave you for something betterim personally on the side that ccp is really unwilling to admit and fix there ruffneck coding 10 years ago with a language that has changed and evolved into a much better system than it was
lag is going to be generated period actually the only part that will create lag is in the hard drives or ram of the servers reason that this is not an issue is being that the storage medias are gonna store the change so why does it matter if it happens now or 1 time in the 10 to 15 seconds its going to take also everyones rof is different the lag is going to be staggered this way anyhow plus the reload time is different as well for each gun actually if nothing else with some packet optimization you can actually improve the lag problem to summarize i dont see the problem in implementing the highs ammo charges in a single command you can actually generate less lag where lag is going to happen
sugestion allow turrets to be loaded with multiple types of ammo at once and let people change which is firing all at onceso for example my neutron blasters would be loaded 50 null and 50 gallente navy antimatter and i could choose which one fired with a quick toggle
that about sums it upperhaps in their review of adding this feature they might be able to find away to optimize the process so that it is less taxing on the server as a whole by processing all of the changes together on the server side as well as on the client sideanyways i expect that people will switch ammo types just as often the main difference will be how fustrating it is to do so
sorry i misexplained things  ill try againrough approximation of the current systemserver works out  chance if the shot hits or misses server rolls to see if the shot hits if it hits theres a dice roll to work out the hit type  well aimed wrecking etc  then it applys the hit type to  turrets damage modifier x ammo damage now itd go though this for every shot firednow lets propose an alternate systemn  number of matching turretsdam  damage type modifier from  n1 x poor hits  1 decent  to  n1 good hits  1 wreaking x   percentage to wreck n 100 1  server works out  chance if the shot hits or misses server rolls to see how what  shots hit then multiplies by dam x ammoold system 8 calcs new 1 calc  damage is worked out when each turret is online dam is worked out whenever a turret is onlinedofflined  ie out of battle  the new system only saves calculations when two or more turrets of the exact same type are used  most people tend to use as many of the same type as possible  but doesnt lose anything other the old system if different turrets are used theres probobly a few holes in there but a variation of this system could save tons of server work for turrets lanchers and drones especially
not that im an expert on this but wouldnt it be a higher load to a server to send multiple commands one at time ie one command per gun than to issue one command for all the gunsregardswindjammer
tornsoul  no offence but this sounds an awful lot the same as a possure there are some key differences  slightly cheaper probably not linked to moons probably not needing fuel ceases selfrepair after a certain hp count probably harder to damage compared to current pos  you mention 20 bs and 5 hours thats something akin to 200300 mil raw hp  but overall your proposal isnt significantly different from whatever was actually implemented  eg the poses we have nowadays so again no offense but how is your proposal any different better compared to the current system or for that matter compared to a generic fwlike activity based sovgranting system like the one i proposed  not necessarily that one but something similar 
the current system is boring because it isnt very sophisticated nor skilled it is very simple atm put pos into reinforced defender picks time of return leg battleit is a grind to refuel pos and a case of bring more numbers  of the right ships  and winthe key is in how you create the new system to avoid it being overly complicated or rather the detail is the tricky bitthere are two ways you can do it either you build structures which directly affect certain things rts style so you build a caldari fuel depot and you get a  bonus on nitrogen isotope used in pos or you have npcs who have needs like education and healthcare sim city style and by being good at providing that stuff you get a higher sov  and thus get general bonuses on the overall  say you need 75 to online a cyno jammerthink of it like thispos  castlescivilian structures  villagesyou can go round burning all the villages and leave the defenders tucked away in their castles sure you wont take and control the country but youll leave a burned wasteland when you leaveor you can just go straight in and seige the castles harder but once taken you control the land around and can start making use of it straight away
this raises the whole planetside problem how long should it take to capture somethingsay i go on holiday for a week atm i can expect that my pos if left unattended will probably be nuked should it come under attackbut say i just have a busy time at work and dont log in for a couple of days if ive stronted correctly the pos is at least semisafe till i get backhow long does it take to capture the flag  or gate or planet or moon  30 minutes 2 days 1 week i dont want to have to camp a gate for a week  and lose that cap when the enemy blob up for 30 minutes one time and force us off after 5 days  but neither is it good to wake up or come home from work and find youre deep in enemy held territory so fast as it is to take a system
you might also look into solar system size as a possible element in this new system currently the only thing that matters is the number of moons and thus small systems are usually 100 coveredbut why not turn this the other way aroundsmall alliances with fewer assets avalible might deliberately chose to live in a system that favored there small size what im thinking is that you might build some features into the new sov system where overwhelming numbers would mean close to nothing im thinking 300 herepeople settle into systems where they know that thy will be able to defend them simply cause they know that hostiles will only be able to brig like 102030 more then there numbers to the fightthis would really benefit small scale alliances and would hopefully mean that you would see a lot more small alliances instead of this massive color blobs on the map
i believe the current fw system is a step in the right direction
im for eliminating fuel requirements for poss other than while reinforced i mean we live in an advanced space society surely someone has thought of and used solar power  within 5 au of a g class star you could generate enough using solar panels given the level of tech solar panels probably would easily reach 6080 efficiency in this time line making them a prime source of power beyond the 5au you could use a system to harness the solar wind much like wind turbines on earth nearly limitless power so long as the star doesnt die while reinforced they have to use auxillary power systems as their cloaking shield prevents them from utilizing their normal solar power
why not simply use something based on the fw system with the control bunker being built and placed by an alliance this gives the alliance control of the system preventing anyone else deploying pos in the system the control bunker then spawns complexes in the flavor of the bunker  eg build a gallente bunker and it spawns gallente complexes with npcs loyal to the alliance  when the system is uncontested any pos in the system operate at heavily reduced costs  i figure that if the alliance is controlling the area then local populations  on planets etc  would be taxed hence the reduced costs  when the system is contested the bonus is halvedif it is possible perhaps make it so the the bunker spawns npcs to destroy any pos deployments then anyone attempting to put up a pos would have to remote repair the pos till it was built make it so that if your determined you can still do it but youll be harrassed the entire time by the alliance npc navywhen control of the bunker is gained then the owner has the option to destroy it to free the system of any sovereignty mechanicspos mechanics otherwise unchanged meaning that sieges can still be conducted to cause damage but are not necessary  especially if the alliancenpc navy thing is implementedi think that would give a real feeling of ownership of a system also making sovereignty a very desirable bonus for any industrial base this uses existing gameplay elements so it can all be done  
just an idea  ive not had time to read the whole thread introduce a new module called a gravitational field generatorone script is a gravitional disrupter one is a gravitational compensatorthe module would need say 1000mw and 200 cpu to fit so most bs can fit it but they are slightly gimped to do so you can just about fit it on a cruiser but be massively gimpednear every moon you have a number of gravitational nexus spots which are found using explorationstyle scanning the number ranges from 1 to 5 and over time more appear and disappearbut whats the point to all thisyou go into a hostile system and find a pos you scan out the nearby nexuses and you go there with your disrupteryou then turn it on it has a 1 minute cycle time and acts like a cyno in that you cant move and a beacon appears in the overview so this is quite risky only one generator can be running at each nexus at a time the ship would need to ninja into an empty system or be defended while it does thisthe nexus would have a stability reading between 1 and 20  each time a cycle finishes the stability gets worse by one  disruption script  or better by one  compensation script but what does all this achieve1 the pos takes damage  not enough to destroy but enough to weaken  the shields on both the pos and all pos modules get reduced to 50   average  stability of all nexuses  2 2 the pos fuel bills increase both fuel and stront consumption gets increased by average stability  to a max of doubled with full instability so scenario you are harrassing a bigger alliance you run a gang through destabalising their pos this weakens their defences and increases their fuel bills while at the same time encouraging small gang fights away from the pos guns to defend both the destablisers and the stabalisersscenario pos seigefirst bring in the destabalisers to drop the shields to 50 that way then go in for a full out assault  or just do the full out assault in the first placeeither way you cant actually take sov without a pos seige but you can effectively harrass the posmake them harder to maintain without one and you can also soften them up before the seige itself and all of that is done using small gangssub capital shipsjust an idea  hope people liked it   note that the objectives are time based so if you have 200 people you are better splitting into 20 gangs of 10 people each with a generator and going to hit 20 nexus spots at a time than you are just sitting 200 people at onesure 200 can pile into one system and hit 20 targets there at once but defenders can then harass whichever generator battleship the attackers arent blobbing at
create 3 new structures that contribute to sovereignty in a system minor facility facility and major facility each facility contains a deadspace generator and associated acceleration gate each sized gate only allows the same sized ships as their faction warfare counterparts make sure each gate is 100000km from the facility to prevent the nano entry exploitthat way you give the smaller ships a role in 00 and a steady progression for faction warfare players
if you need to draw players out of their fortress introduce a weapon that is so long range that they have to warp all the way over to fight ita mobile artillery installation that can shoot from anywhere within the same system as its targetthis way an attacker can also create multiple fronts where the battle can take placeif youre at your base defending it from dreadnaughts then someone else will have to go all the way over to the artillery installation thus splitting your forcesnot to mention that warptunnel disruptors can be used inbetween the base and the artillery installation to intercept strikecraft inbetween the two this will add a lot of strategical and tactical options to pos warfareits important however that the artillery installation could only work against buildings as otherwise it could be used in the poss defence against artillery installations thereby negating the desired effect artillery installation versus artillery installations should be ineffective
most of the suggestions ive read regarding make 00 warfare more scaled and more responsive to smallgang action just serves to turn 00 sov warfare into a glorified game of wackamole the last thing you should do to this game is create situations where defenders have to run around responding to fastmoving nano gangs or have to mount static defenses in those scenarios youre creating fun for attackers by making extremely onerous tasks for the defenders weightofforce  the presence of force determines the speed of a flag  in this case sov  change  type mechanics end up being the fairest but the sorts of issues created there become exactly the problem that these sorts of antiblobbing mechanics are trying to stop the easiest way to get around the wackamole or standing army issue is allow alliances who have achieved certain sovlevels the ability to build npc defense forces and mount gate guns all destroyable objectslet the weight of infrastructure available the number of poses the number of pos modules the presence of an outpost etc should all allow for more defensive infrastructure to be built and i mean built let the alliances have to build and fit their own npc ships for use in systems where they have significant sov levels as roaming gangs move through these systems theres a definite incentive for playergangs to form up in defense and keep their npc defense ships from getting blown to hell it gives roaming gangs something to do that has a tangible impact on your opponent it ties in industry and infrastructure with pvp operations it gives people a reason to defend lest they see several billion in npc ships blow up
i disagree no one would use the npc if they are too weak and will just get blown to hell and if they are stronger what is stopping a gang from blobing the npc really i dont see how npcs could serve any purpose in sovereignty mechanics too expensive for too little valueyou can look on the fw stats pages and see that it takes a damn long time to capture a system even with very dedicated teams of plex cappers you as a holder of sovereignty would not have to respond to every threat that comes about but it does give players a reason to patrol their own space rather then just dock up to save their ships i suggested using the constellations as a sovereignty rather then the systems alone this provides a smaller ground for small groups of defenders to patrol when the fight becomes escalated the defenders would only have to defend the flag that is the number of capable spaces becomes smaller thus forcing a bottleneck and larger fleets now have a role at some point you want large fleet fights you just dont want them being the beginning middle and end there is no need to whackamole since there is no need to destroy every attacking force so what if they cap a few plexes the point is to keep that number small by patroling space and keeping the noob gangs from capping everything plus it encourges the breakup of blobs as having one ship cap a plex vs 100 ships makes no difference in the amount of time its more effective to break up a 100 man gang in to 10 10 man gangsone last comment i see the average take time for a whole constellation being around a week to 2 weeks the final escalations will take about 23 days this give far more time and pewpew then the current mechanic basically almost all the other post here have copied fw i find that the main reason fw is not small gangs and all blobs is because people have no reason and therefore dont attempt to cap plexes since the reason behind sov is to keep your space people now have reason to defend it more then just to blow stuff upid like to see some csm delegates or ccp members respond to these ideas mainly about the viability and fun factor
i support both ombers and angelus suggestions but a clear no no no to reserve i hate that  on ebaymotors as well reserve is clearly in favor for the seller if you setup a low starting bid you take the risk of selling low while maybe luring more people to your auction cause of the low starter if so your profit may exceed the usual market price its risk vs reward if you want riskfree auction setup a higher starting bid or use item exchangecontract system is fine with me i would just like to see more filtering options as its really anoying sometimes to scroll through all that stuff a filter for tier items  like meta lvl t2 officer faction whatever  system security andor jump range exclude buy orders when filtering item exchange
pls add an advanced contracting skill that let us create 10 more contracts  2 or 3  lvl  
id like some changes to the courier contract system1 it should be possible to enter in regionconstellationsystem for both pickup and destination and only get up contracts that meets these criteria2 it should be possible to have courier contracts that are larger than 120000 m3 at least in private courier contracts i see no reason to split up a 90m trit stack into 8 contracts if you know you are setting the contract up to a freighter pilot with that amount of cargospace3 it should be possible to see and search and limit the courier contract on volume when you look at available contracts it should also be possible to limit on max collateral and minimum reward currently the filters for courier contracts are not working very well except for the filter on name  which works very well ill update this post if i get more ideas
seconded searching by contract destination alone would be worth its weight in  dysprokrum
having the seller set the minimum bid increase would invite attempts to scam and there is already enough of that on the existing contractspersonally im in favour of tiers with the minimum bid increase being the lower of 10 or the tier id set the tiers atup to 100m  1mup to 1b  5mpast 1b  25m
i would like to see a bid for an auction going in as a maximum bid such as that worked by ebay etc yesterday i put a bid in for a 1run phobos bpc for 499mil because of a lag spike in jitaobviously i didnt wish to bid this much but if the bid was counted only as my maximum bid it would be unlikely that i lost as much isk
the auction creator should be able to set the minimum incrementand leave the default at 10 some people will want more some less
the following options should be set by contractorstarting bid minimum bid incrementoptional buyoutoptional sniper rule time auction ending time  within limits reserve is a bit silly it could be used to circumvent taxation by setting a low starting bid and set a reserveminimum bid increment should be within bounds set by the starting bid this would avoid scamming attemps and tax avoidance  low starting bid high incremnts  as well as 001 isk warsto the bidder all variables should be clearly visible including the precise ending time
i think that anywhere within the 01 to 10 range would be reasonable keeping it on par with the magnitute of broker feestaxes
why must the min bid be fixed i mean when i auction something on the forums i get to set the min bid why should ingame be any different
the 120k m3 limit on contracts needs to be lifted currently the only way to move a ship without repackaging it is to enter it into a courier contract  obviously this excludes many ships such as battleships barges and so on that might have rigs fitted and but for the limit would easily fit into a freightera paladin takes up 517500m3 when not packaged so this is a minimal value for any new upper limit id suggest a new limit of about 750000m3 but no more than 900000m3  or contracts might not fit into a fenrir  maybe 720000m3 just to be on the safe side
thank you for your support but im not clear as to why you think ccp wont respond theyve already stated its a known bug and defect rather than the result of a nerf all the proposal is asking for is an estimated time of completion on the two bugs and request the completion date be sooner rather than laterregardswindjammer
yeahyour rightthey will get right on that now that they know about it
good one and i can appreciate where youre coming from with the irony but youre missing some informationof course ccp knows about these problems already but the information youre missing is what ccp has said about issues brought to them by the csm items brought to them by the csm more often than not get a bump up the priority list so an inquiry even a brief one has a good chance of being responded to by ccp in a positive fashionbest regardswindjammer
yep seen both
not missing it actuallyand while i fully support the addition of more bureaucratic hurdles to anything and everything  kinda like hiring someone to tell you something you already knew  to further complicate things that otherwise are plain and simple and easy to handle i just dont see it happening given that they have actually known about it for years and responded to dozens of threads about it and have done nothingi mean really how far down this imaginary list does a actaul bug that is detrimental to gameplay have to be for it to be ignored so long yet remain unaddressedoh yeah thats right drones are lagging and not good for large fleet engagements and ccp really has that multiplayerjoin a large dev supported allience or suffer mentality about the gameare more alliences using droneswhateverthough if it does go through i will of course step up my pay to play idea of paying off the csm to give a crap about issues that dont actually directly effect them and instead focus on improving gameplay as a wholebut really good luck on this
your idea   i personal think it s a pretty good idea should be combined with some minimum standing to the station u plan upgrading your officeor perhaps adding a shareholding market  where u can buy shares which make it possible or perhaps combined with actually factional warfare and shares u can only get via missions depended on your sucess of pvp killswith something like this it would be able to seed out the market a bit  theorie examplecorp a got on federation navy miltia mission where it is possible to get a share of the corpthis share u can change for a module which upgrade your office pa example 1x tech ii ship manufactory  lowers building costs time limited to 5 slots  the corporation is able to rent this slots to other peoplesthe manufactory must be build by the player for a price simliar to pos modules like u said this would be interesting for manufactors if they get a little extrabonus by thisi personal think it should be not to simple to have such an office upgradeat least it should be in line with the time u need to fuel a pos transport etcstations should have limited space to upgrade officesals stations should be more in line with there professionresearch stations  limited to research office upgrades pa examplenavy stations  manufactorys around war toysshipyrads  manufactory slots around shipsit would seedout the manufactors and can split them up around constelaationsperhaps something against highly frequented trade hubsif u would add a shareholdingsystem where it is possible that peoples got dividendes  i they own shares  depended on the market transfers and incoming isks u can seed out the marketoki to much about marketbut your idea is a good base for something like this
interesting suggestions maybe make the slot type dependent on what kind of station it is also perhaps the upgrades can be sold at the lp store as a proxy for the standings issue  a halfmillion lp gets you 10 lines of the appropriate type say also they should expire when you lose control of the office to avoid the need to keep track of what offices are pimped and what offices arent at the prices being charged by pc slots now 9khour  a single slot makes just under 80 million isk a year at full utilization so 500k lp for 10 seems like a fair price give or take maybe its a bit high assuming prices drop with the increased availability but its a starting point im not sure where youre going with the talk of shares though care to explain further
i couldnt find the link to the post anymore so i will  paste some from inside my folders on words here it could be interesting combined with your sugesstion1 station s and bonuses industrial stations  extra bonus on tax for building jobs  mineral orecomponents trades extra bonus for equipment building requirements refining load in  load out time to stop new mega hubs building slots limited to produce equipment components   perhaps an little bonus shipyards  building slots for ships within all classes extra bonus to all building jobs not possible to dock only to open a hangar where u can put the stuff u need for the job choose of delivery of the job  compact modus to transport it within freighter s or directly to board it  compact board modus effect the building timescience stations  extra bonus for all researchinvention jobs to lower the tax on jobs extra bonus to all blueprint trades load in load out time to stop new mega hubs   bpcs goes in a checking phase the computer is heavy in progress u stay in line navy stations  extra bonus to faction trades limited to ships equip navy shipyards same as shipyards with an extra bonus to faction ship buildings include t ii shipsthe idea behind this could be splitting the trades to lower high frequented stations to have something like this  it must be interesting for players with extra bonus also it must be limited to give the npc corporations a real  sense in there business something like this could be also used to start a faction warfare scenariolike the caldari industrial section is in a depression the envy of the increasing business of the gallentean industry makes them agrressiv and they start attacking them shipyards should be placed in systems without high npc colonisations  accidents in stations with high amounts of death npcs and long term damage for citizens of space stations let them think about building a separate section and shipyards away from the colony there specialisations increase the bonuses to jobs stations in low security systems add a bigger bonus to there tax jobs instead of the non presents of protection of concord  the bonus reflect the tax they pay for ded concord to protect in high security system 2black market hubs  special  smuggler stations where u can  only  offer your shiny npcs pirate faction stuff located in low security  war buffer zones  the trade of npcs pirate faction stuff within the empire is seen as an criminal act to stop supporting npc pirate factions  bonuses on tax for trades   which could be nice if u save several millions when u sell your 10bn mod  to enter such a station u need to contact a middles men on the normal stations like a  agent this middles men gives u an special rigg which u had to set into your ship and guaranty u the docking  without u get toasted  a middles men is also the option to spread out deals to lower the traffic and have no  balck market mega hubthe idea behind this is keep out all trades for npcs pirate faction stuff like modules  pos  ships whatever  to keep them away from the trading stations if the compute gives the direction via the middles men and a spread out around the constellation it will lower the traffic  add several scenarios to pirates  gankers  smugglers
3 brokers adding them to stations  get your infos about market prices include traffic status and load in load out time offers contact to npc agents which change transport jobs into dynamic missions for players  system like u give him the goods which u need transported then he gives it to an agent inside the station which offers to transport the goods to a mission runner the mission runner gets secured cargocans in a size  m  3  which need to be transported  it would open the way for a lot of mega trading missions which will be dynamic then reward will be done by the player like a payment the broker gives a certificate to the mission runner as an extra bonus  reduce tax which is adapted to the market skills the idea behind this is  sort out the maximum in profit  with an broker save your time let mission runners do your job this would improve the transport missions which are atm more scam then serious certificates or tax it will be your choise   it safes skill time if u have certificates  4 certificates and npccorp shareholding systemcertificates adapted to the actually trade skills to reduce the tax on transactionsplayer can choice if a certificate or the skill  but not both together certificates will be generated in dynamic transport missions as rewards upon m3 of goods which need to be transported range  npcs corp shares via broker needs a good standing  relation to the broker  dynamic transport missions shares are limited and gives a monthly  dividend upon the business which is done at this station   of transaction taxes etc  something like this could open the way for public relation works and specializing tradestransports  buy orders to bring ppls to transporttrade stuff at your station upon the business shares raise or falla lot of text  there was more but  it could be a nice addition and reforming the market a bitif u could offer players your manufactory slots it could be interesting around this public relations would start because u anne have a high dividende each month   theorie bregmac
this is ridiculous a corp is a corp corps can be wardecced are we going to allow corps to join militias to dodge decs now if you get wardecced deal with it there should be no easy button to earn you allies
all i asked for is making pos anchoring less painful ill leave the overhaul of the system to the whining pvpers d
you mean subversion no doubt
it would be useful when at work  12 hour shifts sometimes d
ladies and gentlemen we already have a positive response from the developers as i understand it it will be implemented with a medium  high priority
am i the only one with experience around childrenwhen they come to you again and again begging for a cookie you say alright dear ill get you a cookie in a minutethen you let them run along and playits called pacifying and thats exactly what each and every one of these new meeting minutes threads amounts to we understand the situation and it will be addressed says to me at least ok honey ill get it laterevemon start eve eft all are examples of an issue in the game and issue that went on for so long that other players had to invent their own means around the problem and now that the solution was created without ccp paying for it they have no desire to implement their own solution far easier to link you to the outside source they havent licensed and thus dont have to bother paying forits smart economically but lazy professionally
turning off training while unsubscribed is slightly harder than people seem to thinkunless the devs are morons your database entry is not continually traininginstead your skill point status and time at the last occaision you started or stopped a skill is what will be recorded then the client will calculate your current skills pointssofar for the character sheet but only confirm it with the server when a skill finishesskill points exist in a state of uncertainty until you measure them they are schroedingers skill pointsthat means that if you unsubscribe and then resubscribe the system would have to count back through subs records when you next log on to figure out how far you should have got with your current skillit is unlikely that historic subscription records are available to tranquility itself and so the trick to implementing this apparently simple functionality would be to have tq call up the subscription server at each login and check the history since you last connectedits not impossible obviously but more awkward than people seem to thinkas most people have pointed out  a short skill queue  current skill plus one or two next skills  would stop mass character farming and work out just fine
i love the idea of tradeable kill rights it could actually make bounty hunting a possible career d
good to see all that posting in the idea forum is getting through on the count of partial bounty payouts to reflect the losses inflicted
its eve dont nerf ganking just fight fire w fire bounty hunting is the way to gohowever im wondering what type of time tables we are looking at for short medium and long term no one wants to sit around and wait for a real ingame response to ganking soon or slated for winter of 2011 my other concern is that bounty hunting will be a pre nerfed profession ill reserve judgement until they actually release a working model but just wanted to throw that tidbit in
one thing i dont get about eve is why are they punishing players for there playing style eve is supposed to be a game where you can do your own thing start up a industrial corporation and produce ships or start up a pirate corporation and kill stuff so why is there a security status in the first place its like saying here play the game the way you want but if you do naughty things we are going to deny you access to half of eve  just a bs number dont know exactly how many lowsec00 systems there are compared to empire i understand the need for something so that people are not running around killing people left right and center in highsec but i also dont think the way security status is setup right now is the correct way hasnt ccp said before that highsec is not supposed to be designed as a place where no one can touch you why protect people who go around in t1 untanked haulers on autopilot with billions in there cargoholdjust my two cents
fortunately ccp disagrees with youhonestly im amazed at the number of people that still try and make that argument given that every statement ccp has ever made on the subject has been to the contrary if you just want to complain then fine but if you want to talk about changes to game mechanics that might actually get implemented some day you need to accept the developers position on the issue and work from that  whether you agree with it or not the devs are not going to change one of the most basic building blocks for eve because you dont like getting shot at in empire
this may be a bit of a side note but what i would like to know that are there any plans on revising the insurance payouts on tech 2 shipsin my mind one of the biggest problems with the hulk for example concerning suicide ganking is that it doesnt really even pay to insure it since even the best insurance in no way reflects its real market value last i looked it was about a third of the market priceso are there any changes to be expected regarding this
and when im crusing through high sec and target you you auto target me back and your mods are active and you engage me get popped by concord and dont get insurance then whatthe problem is not the pirates but the pilots that allow them to be ganked ive lost billions but i dont whine about it cost of doing business
so how about throwing us piratey types a bone on this one and reducing sec hits in low secto give an example if you were to increase the security penalty for aggressionkill in 10 space 25 times its current amount to 125 and 5 respectively and then have the penalty decrease as security gets lower by a multiplier equal to system security security status could mean more than if concord will show up  and how quickly  sec loss would thusly look like thissec aggrokill10 1255009 11254508 104007 08753506 0753005 06252504 0520  current values 03 03751502 0251001 012505as it is now its just high and low sec the numbers dont really mean a thing this was how i was initially led to believe system security worked when i started instead of a mostly blackwhite split of lowhigh sec
yep  simple fixthats as it should be  otherwise leave it as it is this is eve 
welcome to hello kitty online
another commonlyproposed suggestion that would help this situation a lot and give a boost to lowsec piracy too while making 10 a somewhat bigger accomplishment  i approve
the hell is this statement too biased in the gankers favor their are a slew of defensive modules and precautions someone can take to not get suicide ganked these include wcs istabs a scout logistics protection not carrying enough to be a target transport ships cov ops and force recon ships tanking your ship cloaking all the ganker can do is sit right out in the open and wait for a target in fact there has been several adjustments to concord making suicide ganking harder and harderplease ccp wrangler explain to all of the players here how it is too biased for the ganker for a topic that got so little support from the playerbase i do not think you are getting the correct information on this subject
well its simplein rl you crashed your car while being chased by police what will be the response from your insurance if you try to claim it backi rest my caseon the other side players should be aware of their environment carrying 800 m worth of datacore and flying afk or autopilot is just an invitation to be gankednaresh
the issue that the gankers dont see is how odd it is to take out a 2bil capital shipcargo with a gang half that expensive and covered entirely by insurance and then have one person take a fourhour sec hit bad balance simply this logic applies primarily to freighters though the rashes of minerganking  not just farmers mind you  have raised the issue to greater prominence i have much less sympathy for afk industrial haulers in their 1 mil shipsexcellent plan flagging the criminals who commit crimes as criminals bravo not so bravo on the additional sec hit based on the status of the victim instead a counterproposal have concord contribute to the bounty of the perpetrator s  based on the sec status of the victim this would only work with corrections to the bounty system as well  see below good plan cancelling insurance payout under circumstances in which a  the aggressor is destroyed by concordandb  the victim is destroyed by the aggressor would prevent accidental discharge from ruining newer players while ensuring that successful ganks are not rewarded by insuranceif you wish to increase the sec hit for pirate activities in highsec then you should decrease it for pirate activities in lowsec this is only logical and fair but also only reasonable if you fix the bounty system which ill comment on further in another responsethis would be cool because a lot of suicide ganking targets are in npc corporations it would be appropriate to move them out of protected npc corpsand into special wardecable npc corpsonce they reach a certain amount of skill points this kicking the new players out of the nest is highly reasonable given the nature of eve and would if done right cut many of the farmers out of business or at least permit them to be legally attackednpc corp standing loss on criminal action is not a bad ideabut faction loss is a very bad one if for no other reason than the lack of options in recovering standing currentlyi generally approve of this plan but it needs more fleshing out and i wish the csm and ccp working groups the best of luckkrum
simple solution is to add just a single logistical ship to the concord detail moving in to protect a ship that is being ganged this should only be a feature for the highest sec gangs like 10 and 09a single logistical ship respawning with more concord ships if it was killed would make it significantly harder to do empire ganging and would hopefully reduce it to 08 systems and belowthis would mean that gangers would have to follow there pray for a couple of systems which would give the pilot of ship that was about to be ganged a chance to dockup or atleast counter the attempt some howi defenetly thing that empire ganging should stay in the game but to things make this way to easy first gangers can just sit and wait in the biggest tradehubs for a potential target they dont even have to move at allspider tanking doesnt have any limitations which is actually more of a general problem  im not saying that it should be nerfed to the same level as nano they could look into some kind of stacking nerf for the remote reppers
let me throw out some more detailed comments on the killrights and bounties as i think these really are the core to a functioning justice system in eve currently killrights sit on characters for a month or so dependent on the victims ability to do damage to the pirates who fried him in the first place not a good prospect for a player who gambled on a little lowsec missioning ratting or miningand lost killrights also do not authorize podding a provision that works poorly with the bounty system asisbounties are simply collected by an alt or friend once they rise high enough after a quick jumpclone trip to avoid implant loss and theyre placed by playersthe same who lost money to the piratevillian to begin withthese suggestions would go a long long way to fixing the current situation ideally you should be able to visit the concordbounty hunter office take your killright and break it into contractable items authorizing the recipient to kill the ship of the criminal you should be able to break a 1month killright from losing your ship to a criminal into 1week 2week or 1month contractable items so as to spread the love around making such an item would of course decrement the time remaining on your own killrightsince killrights apply to your corp  i think  then they should permit the recipients corp to hunt the criminalif the criminal podded you then your killright should permit podding him back with no security loss  an execution order bounties should be paid out in proportion to the value of the ship or pod lost by the targetto prevent abuse of this i also recommend voiding or reducing insurance payouts for ships lost due to execution  on them  of a valid killright concord itself should contribute to bounties on players that commit criminal acts and add a sum based on the skill points of the criminal and the security status of the victimof course players could always add their own bountry contributions to others who annoy them permit players for a fee at the bounty office to list themselves as bounty hunters with statistics such as bounty totals collected kills executed efficiency  time from killright start to target termination divided by total killright time  and etc for additional fees auction  limited  space on an advertisement board in each region so hunters or merc corps can show their name picture and a short pitch  pirates got you down cant mine in peace hire us to kill them all burma shave like with transferable kill rights wardec should be hireable out but thats for another threadlike in other threads it would be great to see a comprehensive plan from the csms regarding what they want to put in front of ccp next on stuff like thiskrum
ill compromise on my no insurance at all stance and move to a position of insurance only paid to members of player corps and invalid if killed by concord  because that is the only fair solution unless the underlying issue is addressedof course as previously noted the real problem revolves around the structure of npc corps in the first place  and unless that issue it tackled then no true fair and balanced resolution can be brought for suicide gankingi strongly believe  and have posted before about it  that there should be a difference between a starter npc corp and other npc corpsi am fully in favour of protecting new players to a certain extent a little safety net until they get their head around things but not foreverrestrict starter corps in a similar way to trial accounts encouraging players to join either other npc corps or player corps as they outgrow the starter corpallow warfare against npc corps  not starter ones  but with a high costs and factional penalties  concord might not care but the corps and the empires arent going to be happy about it player corps remain as they arein this senario it is possible to fairly remove insurance payouts on concord kills because it offers up alternatives to suicide ganking on all but the newest playersadded i made a more detailed post a while back on how the revised npc corps would work the assistance they would provide to their members and the penalties for going to war with them ill save it all for a thread on the subject however rather than further derailing this one
a few thoughts 1  it is just fraking hilarious to listen to the gankers whining about being nerfed and denigrating the people theyve ganked as whiners that is absolutely choice as with most online games  who is whining depends on whose ox is being gored2  there are two things that are often in conflict in game design realism and playability in no realistic governmental system s  would the level of piracy that exists in eve ever be allowed anti piracy would be the factional navies first priority but  that said  most games arent very realistic so  it depends on the level of realism you want here ccp seems to have decided they want a little bit more in this area3  insurance pay outs to gankers killed by condord should be one of the first things to go i laugh at the idea that this is really a penalty though they are using frigates for petes sake considering the fact that theyve got their buddies in some alt corp sitting by to scoop up the guys cargo they ganked  theyre making a fortune in profits  or could be if they cared to to keep from penalizing accidents to much  the first thought that comes to mind is  was the guy who got shot blown up if it was an accident  then the person who shot the other person is going to stop shooting at them if they kept on firing until the other person blew up  then its obviously more deliberate4  only one person mentioned it but it is an excellent idea that is to fix the fact that insurance pay outs for t2 ships are based on their t1 counterparts this is such a glaring error that i assume theres some reason for it though what it could be escapes me this would go a long way to redress the imbalance now suffered between ganker and gankee the gankers lose a few frigates and the gankees lose some hulks the gankers wont even notice their loss even if they dont get insurace but the gankee is devastated this is completely unbalanced also  some kind of safe flier discount would help 13rd the cost of the hull is bad5  4 hours oh oh my gawd pity the poor pirate his victim spends months saving for that hulk and he has to spend 4 whole hours getting his security status back oh my gawd the horror the horror6  most games are vulnerable to having the players circumvent the designers intent ccp seems to intend that high sec not be completely safe but that it does offer some degree of safety and some penalty for those committing what it has decided are crimes of course in any real universe  getting the slap on the wrist for blowing up someones ship that the loss in security status is would be absurd in any realistic venue  theyd be banned from the system for life and hunted to the ends of space for doing that one fraking time anyway  it obviously being ccps purpose that this is a game for pirates by pirates with everyone else just there to give them someone to attack theyve designed it the way they have the thing is  when you get players who really max out a game design vulnerability and take full advantage of it  the way the jihad swarm did  dont be surprised when the nerf bat comes out yes high sec isnt supposed to be completely safe but the wholesale slaughter of miners wasnt what they had in mind either and yes  the miners fought back as best they could hiring mercs to strike back  but in no case did their kills come even close to their losses now  if they could have inflicted losses equal to their own  then  you would have balance then you could say the system worked  but as i recall  the goons laughed at the mercs the whole time the miners did get some measure of revenge and that was all they expected  but there is a vast difference between that and  balanced game play if game mechanics allow one group to slaughter another  then the game mechanics are broken its about time ccp did something to fix that
its you you are the problem that causes suicide ganks
oddly enough i was thinking of the logistical ship idea as well though in my case it occured as an extra insurance idea for a service concord could offer you pay extra and well assign a logistics ship to watch over you in highsec should you get attacked by criminalsim not sure this is a good idea frankly as another poster pointed out concord offers consequences not protection this idea would however raise the bar for gankings and require moreexperienced betterequiped characters to pull it off im not sure thats bad given the thought of recycled altgankers but it might be too much when combined with cancelled insurance contractsyou could nerf spidertanking concord by simply giving the response ships jammers that would break the circuit unless the gankers use plenty of eccmkrum
facepalmhow about i dont know having a friend do that for you instead why the hell should npcs be involvedagain people who dont know how the mechanics work why dont you try spidertanking concord let me know how that works out for you
thanks to the csm for adressing this problem what purpose should that serve the more carebear the victim the harder the sec status hit me thinks system sec would make more sense wouldnt itmy vote goes for no insurance at all this would automatically balance factiont2t1 and solve suicide ganking till a certain level yeah pvpers would have to spend more but dont they mostly use t2 ships anyways and wouldnt a general decrease in isk serve eve
rl comparisons to a game  complete and utter failif you base eve insurance on rl insurance not a single ship in eve would get insurance
my two cents on the subjectin what way do you feel that the situation where a cruiser can destroy an exhumer with relative ease and even get paid insurance for it whereas the exhumer pilot gets about 13rd insurance at best balancedsure one can slap on all kindsa defensive  on the ship but then you might as well be flying a barge since then the mining capabilities are well and truly screwed and whats more not all of us have the luxury of a fleet protecting mining ops and not carrying enough to be a terget since when has that had to anything to do with most suicide gankers most gankers seem to do it simply because they can not for profit but to cause losses on the targetsitting in the open or perhaps in a covert op waiting to signal a buddy that the game is on and once you see them its too lateadjustment to concord to make suiciding harder i sure didnt see it what i saw was my ship blowing up and them showing up too late and my ship wasnt entirely untanked there just simply isnt enough power on a hulk to fit proper shield boostersextendersbut the main thing is a ganker with a ship worth couple of mil being able to gank a ship worth over a 100mil  the insurance of which is a joke dont get me wrong i agree that highsec shouldnt be 100 secure but at present its getting ridiculous
uh boy tell me what would you find to be appropriated to protect an empty industrial ships and modules have become so cheap these days that the gankers dont even scan the ship cargo anymore they simply lock you and open fire it has happened a couple of times to me lately  and i was nowhere near jita  how many corp mates should i bring with me to fly home that empty indu a scout a logistic a jamming ship im sure there are thousands of volunteers in your corp to take over the escort of an emtpy hauler some x jumps through high sec
maybe but not having insurance wont decrease the amount of isk in the eve universe it may decrease the flow of isk into the eve universe however it will decrease the amount of minerals though
yea and in a real universe i could take the system over rather than fight an omnipotent police force also noone really seemed to give a flying  about the jihad swarm except for those who paid the mercs just because the mercs cant inflict the same amount of damage on the goons doesnt mean the systems broken
yeah right it works like i said it did but you dont like my post so you pretend im wrongyawndid you start posting yesterday  or cant you come up with a more original response than thatwrong look at lloydsrealism in game play serves as a touch stone reality is inherently balanced while arbitrary game systems tend to move away from being balanced the more arbitrary they aredo you want the person playing your flight sim to throw up on their key board and spend 400 hours just learning to fly their p39 the way chuck yeager did nobut that doesnt mean that an arcade style game is desirable eitherwhat you want is a balance between realism and arbitrary gaming devicesup to a point the more realistic a game is  the more immersive it is the more immersive it is generally the better a game it is judged to beso  realism  does have a place in discussing game playalso one of the ways of pointing out just how flawed something is  is by using realism as a referencehere  you have all these pirates squealing like stuck pigs because  the game designers are taking modest steps to redress their excesses by pointing out how utterly absurd things already are in the game compared to a realistic situation  you put the pirates whining into perspectivelets be clear about thismost of the posts here as in most forum threads are about people advocating that their style of game play should be blessed and that game play styles they dont like should be nerfedit isnt about whos right and whos wrong its about how ccp is going to adjust things one way or the otheralso  realistically  paying one third the cost of your hull with no payment for the fittings  which often exceed the value of the hull by several factors  would be fairly steepthe way it should be done  is to have the premium you pay dependent on how many ships you losethats how real insurance worksand yes  after a while  you wouldnt be able to get insuranceso  if youre a careful care bear and rarely lose a ship  your premiums might go down from the base line  what it is now if youre a suicide ganker that is constantly having your ship blown up by concord  then no you shouldnt be allowed to insure anything you own  though no one is actually advocating that  i think it would be funny if ccp did it though that would be realistic and something the game designers could really do  if they wanted to seriously limit the amount of high sec ganking going onif youre in a factional militia  then youre insurance premiums should be paid by the faction they arent  but they should be people in the army dont pay for equipment they lose to enemy action  though they may pay for it if they lose something without the enemy being involved the way it is in the game now if youre in a corporation  the corporation can insure your ship  and anyone in the corporation can use it  on top of which many corporations furnish their members with shipsso there is a way to make the insurance situation in the game both realistic to some degree and playablethe way it is now  it is seriously flawedeveryone pays the exact same rates regardless of their play style there is no penalty for treating your ships as being expendableredressing the insurance system would alleviate much of the problem by not only punishing the gankers but by being fair to those they attackas usual  being more realistic  makes a game more balancedyou just have to get it right
that is the way
neither this is the meeting minutes the csm wrote after their meeting with ccp i think i corrected some grammar and ryan wasnt involved at all ill tell him that you consider him a puppet master though no idea ive never had a dress before my tshirt size is xl if that helps as stated above i did not write this i just posted it youll have to ask the csm
yeah it got ridiculous when i can come out richer having concord destorying my ship before the looting plat insurance edit and lets face it the sec hit isnt that bad if you pick your targets p
cant wait for the first whine on the forums oh god i accidentally activated a mod in highsec got concorded and received no insurance ccp fix this
thats what the warning labels are for pbut yeah you could delay insurance payoutie if you managed to killpop someone or get on the killmail as the killer in the next 20 minutes after concord popped youyou dont get insurance but if you didnt pop anyoneyou get it after the 20 minutesthat way the accidents would get it but a successful suicide ganker wont yeah i doubt people who accidentally shot atactivated a ecm burstsmart bomb in highsec would manage to pop anyoneso
i seriously believe that it will no problem of course accidents will occur but they will be rarewhat you instead will see on the forums are fake troll whines who are mighty popular these days
yeah lets make highsec the safe place it should be a safe heaven from all the evil pirates who have nothing better to do than harrass honest players by suicide ganking if i want to transport 2 billion in mods afk through highsec i should be damn able to its not the game mechanics its the people playing this game what a change like this leads to is dumbing down the game i guess its natural considering the intellectual capacity of most of the whiners here
yes there are not flaws  but certain aspects of the game such as youve pointed out even with factional warfare its not like planetside where the ultimate object of the game was to go around trying to conqueror everything  but cant you take control of a system in 00 doesnt that exist to some degree  that is a rhetorical question  uh  sure  only the people getting blown up cared but if you look at the stats on just how many miners got blown up the loses really were slanted in one directionit isnt that one side lost more than the other  its that one side was being slaughtered by the other on a consistent basisccp has given high sec some degree of protection for a reason there are some operations by some people that need some degree of protection otherwise  there wouldnt be any newbee miners theyd all be base camped in their schoolscommercial vessels need some degree of protection from combat vesselsif youve really got your act together and are in a strong alliance then you can go on down to 00 take over a system and protect that system and your people in it and reap the rewards for operating in 00if you arent in that situation which a lot of people are not then you need a bit of help and thats why the game has different levels of securitynothing ccp is advocating is going to end suicide ganking or make high sec a completely safe place to beall they are talking about doing is redressing a problemif the goons hadnt done what they did though  we wouldnt be having this conversation  see the link to the goons killboard posted in that thread yes they certainly werent and arent the only ones  but they made a big show of it  which only encouraged copying  so even more people did it so it became a problemall the wailing and knashing of teeth by the gankers posting here is just over reactiontrust me  eve is going to stay the same cold heartless game it was designed to be and has always beenall ccp is doing is taking steps to keep things the way they were before suicide ganking became what it has becomethis isnt about turning eve into a warm fuzzy place filled with sunshine and laughter its about it not getting any more vicious and deadly than it already was
lol well if you would take the time to read through the numerous threads about suicide ganking you would have a better idea why your views on it are based on complete fallacies the originality of my response is higher than the originality of your rant as that has been answered and debunked numerous times already when you get the urge to post about a subject in which you have no experience please do us all a favor and step away from the computer this debate is muddled enough by imbecilles who havent the slightest cluethis is what im talking about when i say do your ing research you obviously havent read any of the hundreds of posts debunking this nonsense
do you think you could do us the favor of asking the devs mentioned in the op to come here and answer a few of our questions  like how they can just suddenly realise that suicide ganking is too easy despite it having been the same way for five yearswould make us all feel much better about this i think
but  you see  i have done my research and come to a different conclusion than yourselfmy conclusion  as it happens  is right and your conclusion  as it happens is wrongthus  you are the one who needs to remove the bias from your point of view  and look at what is really going ongankers abused  no  took advantage  of a vulnerability in the game mechanics  and now they are being made to pay for itif theyd not taken as much advantage of it as they did  we wouldnt be having this conversationim not the one that caused the problemccp didnt suddenly wake up one morning and say hey lets go nerf some gankers todaythis all came about because a lot of people started doing the same thing and it had a real effectthe people who said hey lets all get together and go gank a real  load of miners well use cheap ships and cheap modules and pend will pay for our lost ships man this will be cool well really make those care bears squeal  they are the ones you have to thank for thisif they hadnt done so much of it  ccp wouldnt have changed anythingisnt that the way this always workssomeone comes up with a way to really take advantage of some game mechanic  and  the developers nerf itwhats the big surprise
its funny how many times the griefer niche needs to adapt to the whines of the superrich who are goddamn lazy and afk haul billions in their t1 industrials risk vs reward my ass sounds more like reward vs better reward
two thoughts on this really1 when you delete a character it doesnt get deleted for a monthso before you suicide gank with your alt with the plan of recycling it you know youre going to have to wait an entire month before you can start training again2 delay insurance payouts on concord destroyed ships for a month too
then itd be my fault for having autotarget turned on concord warnings turned off and weapons blinking when not engaging an enemy already perhaps it would promote people to be a little more careful in what theyre doing if someone has auto target back on but has disabled the concord warnings they only have their selves to blame for accidents there are measures in place for a reason
wouldnt worksuicide ganking works on the premise that you have already destroyed your target by the time concord arrive because when that happens youre instantly scrammed jammed and omgwtfpwned no one is doing any damage to a gank target once concord are on grid theyre too busy with the dyingwhat frustrates me about the suicide gank debate is the argument that there are plenty of things the target can do to protect themselves i dont buy that personally if you arrive on the other side of a gate into a waiting gank party youre dead do not pass go do not collect UFFFD200 there is literally nothing you can do in this situation and unless you have a very peculiar fit theres no way any tank can survive 20 seconds of overloaded torp volleys hitting youthe issue at heart really is the fact that faction  officer modules do not confer an added level of protection commensurate with their price tags a 5 billion officerfit battleship does the job in missions a bit faster but against 6 ravens that have a collective cost of about 100m  insurance payout   ship  insurance cost   it stands no chance im not advocating that factionofficer modules should make ships a lot stronger just pointing out a flaw if you will in the system
uh  i recently deleted a new character id made   poor choice of name   but it only took me a day or so  maybe two  and he was off to the biomass recyclershrug
educate yourselfnothing in the game mechanics has changed to make ganking easier since that was written this invalidates your argument
except there are plenty of things a pilot can do to avoid being suicide ganked to say otherwise is to whine out of your arse and you should realize that your officer mods only give so much advantage theres a show info button on the contract window and a compare to option on the module info screen and hell if its a 5bn fit i dont need insurance to gank it
in fact ganking has been made harder
remove insurance and the problem goes away  along with a myriad of other issues with the game revolving around the industry and market 
no it doesnt
so suicide ganking in highsec will be made hardermore costly i can actually see some reasons supporting this butdonUFFFDt make it too hardcostly this isnUFFFDt hello kitty online harderyes  impossiblenomake sure it doesnUFFFDt equally hit normal lowsec piracy itUFFFDs hard enough as it is and is an essential part of lowsecwhile your at it why donUFFFDt you kick everyone older then 12 months out of the npccorps make them valid wardecctargets instead of suicide targetsthe suggestion to connect sechits and factioncorpstanding sucks tbh even pirates need to have a home and run some missions  if not for anything else then to be able to reform if they want  fing up their factionstanding would be a massive hit imo and not an easy one to repairjust my humble opinions
how so removing insurance lowers the profit barrier and would in essence reduce the number of incidents eve is not a pretty place and no place in space is safe you cannot eliminate ganking it would be idiotic to even remove it completely anywayyou can however eliminate the innumerable number of gank camps sitting on the borders of jita or at the chokepoints between major hubs since they exist for profit they profit because insurance buffers the actions remove insurance and you remove the buffer and add costyou can still gankitll just cost you more now the way it should bei wont even get into the other benefits no insurance has since its for another thread
the most obvious problem is the payment of insurance to suicide gankers i support the removal of all insurance from the game after a toon reaches a few million experience points by then they should know betterccp needs to implement a tracking system for biomassed toons there needs to be a way to determine if someone is making suicide toons and recycling them frequently then ban the perpsthe real key is making bounty hunting a viable profession being a piewrat is a viable profession its nemesis should also be viable more viable actually as they are on the side of the lawtrends i like in the posts seen so far no insurance for concorded ships reduced penalties for lowsec pirating increased for highsech pirating tradable kill rights longer timers on kill rights podding included with a kill right bounty reworking so piewrats dont just have a buddy pod them bounty hunter profession reworkedccp im sure youre aware of just how divisive this topic is do what you can to allow piewrats to exist just dont consign the rest of eve to only exist as prey
unless ccp broke the code or theres some sort of exploit floating around i dont know about everyone on the killmail gets the sec hit
that is not true by the sound of that you never have been the victim of suside gankingif you have you would not be saying that if you lost about 100200m worth of cargo not including the shipthere is a simple fix for this if a persons ship gets destroyed in high sec from a ganker simply have it so that heshe gets up to 60 value of said ship back and also have a way to ensure the onboard cargo in a similar way not just the ship like the system is nowor have concords ships be able to insta pop any ship as soon as it fires of the first roundganker looses his ship and the victim should get awayif not there is the current insurance for that and also have it so that the cargo can be insured as well
this has got to be a troll
seriously
afraid not this is a prime example of our opponents in this debate
sucide gankers are nessessary to remove these nasty marco miners  i would like to see a system which forces people out of npc corps into wardecable corps but giving a new players a month or so time to get the hang of the game and find a corp to join before they get transfered if the player cant find a corp then a new automatic corp can be formed which is wardecable and has a tax rate   this new taxrate could add towards global victory conditions for wardecing partys once a automatic corp has been wardecd players in the corp can not leave the corp for a much longer time period than the standard 24hours nor can new players join a wardecd corpas for bounty hunters hunting pirates  kill rights should be automaticly passed on to the bounty hunters for all people who commit acts of crime as for pirates and gankers  they should receive a direct security hit and not get concorded but lose priviledges to dock  jumpgates at main stations in that sector and then forced to use backdoor pirate stations and jumps gates staged in deep space inorder for these criminals to move around  sell stuffjust ideas
remember the idea is to steer people away from ganking and towards war decs real pirating mercs etcleave the ability to gank just put the costs inline with the action and remove insurance
if this was the idea then npc corps would have to goedit oh and corp jumping to avoid wars would have to be made impossible or a bannable offense
how so remove insurance and you still can have your altd gankers they just cost quite a bit more than beforeif you want a for profit operation youll be forced to declare war and hunt your target down in empire sorta how it was intended you know
erm no to the no insurance and as for mostly using t2 ships anyways  where are you pvping and how did you get into it specifically let me emphasize this  how did you get into itfor someone just starting out and looking to pvp in a frigate or cruiser insurance is what allows them to go huh i really screwed that one up  let me get a new ship and try again as opposed to damn lost my ship  now i have to go grind for an hour or two to afford another cruiser and when you first start out it takes you an hour or so to be able to afford a frigate with t1 fittings its only later as you get experience with pvp and get to know what youre doing that insurance becomes more pointless and you start using t2 shipsalso remember that people can be doing industry or something else for years before they try out pvp and then they tend to loose even more ships than someone who just started the game there is no reason to make the cost of trying it too ridiculousarazel
eh  i read that ages agowho said anything had changed in the game mechanicsi said the suicide gankers had taken advantage of existing mechanicsi said that they got so good at taking advantage of existing mechanics that it led to a slaughter of miners and got ccps attentionthe very existence of this thread validates my argumentperhaps if youd learn to read what people have written instead of presupposing what they are saying wed not be having these little discussions
if by taken advantage of you actually mean used im ok with that lineno what really happened was an influx of people who didnt know they had to be cautious even in high sec they got killed where kinda miffed about it and decided that threadnaughting eveo about it was the correct way of action the only ones who have payed attention to the whiners are csm they are not ccp our community manager wrangler who posted this thread has distanced himself from the contents of it ccp dont care about thisgod no the existence of this thread is due to endless amounts of whines by players who dont know how to play id say we still would because even now that you post something that is actually formatted in a readable manner it is still full of falacies
because alliances make extensive use of npc alts to circumvent war decs suicide ganking is the only way to target logistics in this game it should not be hard to do it should be encouragedkind of hard to declare war on an npc corporation which incidentally was my entire point
in that regard you could always just limit slots from npc corps gimp them so that players are encouraged to create their own corporations
having explored high sec ganking from both ends of the issue i have the following observationsin eve we are supposed to find our own paths miner hauler missioneer bounty hunter and pirateso obviously there should be piracythe bounty system is broken that is the biggest proponent allowing hsg tradeable kill rights would go a long way to fix that currently the only people in my experiance who get ganked are those who are autopiloting shuttles and industrials through low  high sec  the risks of hsg increase as the system sec status drops 07  05 will guarentee a gank from a shuttle with 10 5 implants autopilotingavoid the muss and fuss warp to zeroallow tradeable kill rights and you make the bounty hunter proffesion viable nuff saidtribe
thank you for adressing this subjecti have a friend who was mining in a retriever trying to make some iskhe is 45 month old in the game so he is not very skilledhe was mining in chelien  07 system  when lautsu of xfire killed himhe lost his ship and all equipment and wants to quit eveanything that can stop actions like this would be good
 paying attention being aligned having friends that help you not fly what you cant afford to lose tanking your ship treat all space as dangerous spaceyoure welcome

i support this one hundred percent not because theres too much suicide ganking of autopiloted haulers with billions in cargo but because of something this thread and related ones seem to have ignored mining barges being suicide ganked by solo battlecruisers or battleshipsheres the scenario that was being played by a section of goonswarmyou rememberthose jihadswarm fellowssuicide ganker manufactures a brutix and a hulk the brutix is insured for the max payout suicider sends an alt cov op into the system where it finds an ice mining hulk suicider then jumps into system and warps straight to the cov op the cov op bumps the hulk to keep it from aligning for warp suicider takes out the hulk with maybe three volleys dies by concords hand has an alt or partner loot the wreckage of both ships collects insurance goes down to 00 to speed rat the sec status back up andoh yeah sells the new hulk hes manufactured then hes back in a day or two to do it againin at least one solar system the same guy was doing the suiciding and selling of hulk mining bargesone suicider to do the job hes not gone for weeks hes gone for a day or two at the most he nearly makes a profit from the insurance alone the sale of the new hulk and any loot from the wrecks is gravy and this says nothing about the loot and bounty isk he makes in 00 rattingutilization of the game mechanics in this fashion made a joke of concord and high sec security sure you should be able to suicide gank but this risk free profit making griefing is absurd if youre going to suicide somebody it should hurtregardswindjammer
lawlsclueless
5m isnt worth my time and effort i like pimped out mission runners
a very simple solutionmake ships killed by suicide ganking  damaged by someone whos not wardecced  not drop cargo1 this stops suicide ganking for profit as there is no longer profit to be had2 this still allows suicide ganking to interdict altcorp logisticsthe goons can still suicide gank the bob altcorp freighter all they want knowing that the cargo will be destroyed
you forgot 16 which is where i petition you for recycling alts
couple of comments  ideas i hadi dont remember where i first read it because its been suggested in the forums over and over i would like to see some sort of penalty to insurance payouts when concord kills you  max payout with best insurance  50 when concord is involved with the kill  if you broke the laws of eve you should not receive full reinmbursement for iti very much like the idea of being able to trade kill rights i think this would be a good way to help improve the bounty system one thought i had was that perhaps it would be worthwile to create some way to gain kill rights on the fly so if you see someone with a large bounty you can contact the bounty office and somehow gain kill rights  buy them  on that person for a limited amount of timethere would definately need to be some way to keep it under control though to avoid abuse the target must have a bounty on their head  that you did not put there  the target would need to either receive a warning message or gain kill rights against you at the same time so they arent blindsided by an apparent neutral shooting them perhaps make the bounty office a npc corporation  or perhaps nonaffiliated militia  that you can either contact from space or from any station and make it easier  take less time  for you to gain kill rights on someone if you have a high standing with themcarebear warning this final idea appeals to my carebear side as i would like to see more variety in types of missions availableif the bounty office were made into a npc corp you could also add more missions specific to that single corp like duo of death something with one or two very powerful npcs perhaps missions that you have to hunt the target down through exploration your agent just gives you a generic last known location hes believed to be somewhere in this constellation and you have to find himedit add  reiterate a couple ideas i liked
well the obvious would be to kick people out of the safe npc corps and put them in the militia corp of the empire they have the highest standing with this places them at risk as they are in a pvp specific organization good luck macro mining or afk hauling like that just make it so that raiding parties can enter high sec in a reasonable manner and you would slowly see the macro miners all gathering in 10 for the best protection then let the gankers deal with the mining fleets in 10 how they see fit congratulations you just got drafted for hiding in an npc corp for to longa player in an npc pirate corp still has access to high sec as long as heshe has the security rating right this would mean open warfare on mining in high sec as the rats that spawn in belts also attach an aggression timer to you making you vulnerable and legal to any npc corp player rat i think correct me if i am wrong been away from eve for a long time  though it would be funny to watch i think that might compound the threadnaughts that get started about pirating alreadyi support the idea of adjusting ganking but not by nerfing the crap out of the pirates players need to get out of safe npc corps where they run a higher risk
no thats not what happened what happened is what i said happened but typically the myopic poster who can only see his own point of view is unable to accept that it was the actions of the gankers that brought this upon themselveswhether youre right about wrangler well see the impression i got from all this was that they did care you might be right but your pov is so biased i cant tell if you really know something about the inner workings of ccp or just like to think you dobut if im wrong about anything it may well be the amount of support ccp gives to this here again well seea bunch of developers making a big deal about getting input from the players and then ignoring it would certainly not be newmy formatting was fine as i said above well have to see what ccp does about thisone thing you are right about is that whining works of course  as i said earlier  who is whining is mostly a matter of whose ox has been gored what you see here as justified ganker complaints i see as pirate whiningits all just a matter of perspectivesince even if they implemented all the things the gankers are so concerned about  it wouldnt really make any difference  the level of over reaction here on the part of the gankers is easily as bad as any over reaction on the part of the gankedor are you stupid enough to think that only care bears whine my experience here and elsewhere has shown me that the biggest whiners are always the guys like youthe one thing i really hate about some pirates  is the way they try to make things out to be the victims faultno he didnt die because he didnt do x y and z  he fraking died because you blew him upif they take pride in their work and want to boast about how sneaky they were and how they outwitted someone  i dont mind but all this it was his fault i killed him crap is just lameyeah being stupid may get you killed but not being stupid is no guarantee you wont be i take it that you think youre pretty smart  but i dare say youve been blown up more than oncebut so many of you morons are like that never take any responsibility or pride in your own actions just blame the victimof course the ones that are really bad  are the ones that are so stupid they actually believe their own crapif youre just trying to distort the truth to keep your play style from being nerfed its one thing but if youre so stupid you really believe what you are saying  it is entirely anotheran influx of people who didnt know they had to be cautious in high sec caused the problem  yeah  right all those guys whod been playing long enough to own hulks didnt know that eve was a dangerous place to play 
lol you people are funny who is recycling check back in a few months and i will be here simple fact is you can have an effective suicide ganker ready to ruin peoples fun within 9 days i never said that you would get rich doing it and the clueless reply i guess your right because i dont know what the heck you mean by that any way the whole point was to show that if you are willing to take a sec hit you can have a little fun at others misfortune and still make isk under the current set up proving that insurance payouts when concord is involved should be stoppedill add the final step 16 watch bitter replies from people on the same side as me
its nice to know that all those exhumers and barges that the jihad swarm killed were all fakesas a freaking carebear i hate to admit that i have no problem with a pilot using the autopilot to transport millions of isk in a tissue paper armored ship getting ganked if the ganker has it setup so they get the loot all the better that would be the proper way they would make money with a suicide gankagain i would not be all that bothered by nonnoob npc corps that could be wardeced i would base it on skill points not time  1  2 million sp and you are transferred to a decable npc corp  but i suspect you would find a whole load of player corps with 1 or 2 people in thema good bounty system with tradable kill rights is a great idea i am all for it anything that allows players that are interested in pew pew to do it without punishment is great as long as its aimed at getting the pew pew to be with others interested in pew pew pew pew with people uninterested in pew pew is where the punishment needs to be looked into suicide ganking is the most sterling example of forced pew pewthat the punishment is no insurance the knowledge that the target may make some money selling what used to be useless kill rights and the security hit you take may take days of drudgery to correct  if you care to correct it  does not seem to be too bad to me
right back atcha chum while its not the topic of discussion your formatting really leaves a lot to be desired try to make your paragraphs a bit longer right now it looks as you are pressing the enterkey twice after each sentence it really makes your posts hard to readno im not that stupid i do know for a fact that carebears whine as a first option my kind doesnt we whine only when all in game options are tried and shown not to workmy guess is that you hate it because you know  deep down  that its true people are stupid people flying afk getting ganked and then whine about in on the forums are stupid suicide gankers are merely exploiting that stupidity if the person wasnt being stupid he would still have his stuff youde be amazed about how many people have no clue at all about game mechanics or how to protect themselves or even that high sec isnt supposed to be 100 safe its not just noobs although i mostly encounter people like this in the 2006 cathegory
actually the arguments are pretty clear those on one side presented the idea of removing insurance and or removing insurance on concord kills this would be a deterrent to the suicide ganking for griefing and still leave suicide ganking open for logistical warfare etcthe other side still has yet to present a counter to that point other than screaming whining carebears
lol well thats one way of looking at itanother is that one side has demanded a change in game mechanics and have yet to present any valid evidence or arguments for the change the other side is having a lot of fun shooting down every moronic remark the first side manages to post
its not we are having fun shooting down your arguments ki as carebears we dont really like to shoot things we have fun pointing out that what you think we are saying is just wrong
you havent shot mine down made on page 4 post 108 i wonder why that is you seem to be spending a great deal of time arguing against a change many of your comrades claim will not stop or impede suicide gankingfortunately ccp disagrees with your assesment and is on course to make the necessary changes just think of itsome day a hulk or mackinaw might not have to worry too much about mining in a 07 system with icewindjammer
this sounds like a reasonable first stepperhaps having the size of security hit  for shippod kills more so than acts of agression  vary with the security of system might also help add depth to both high and low sec piracyi expect that the number of successful kills by new players is fairly smallvoiding insurance when concorded because of a successful highsec kill instead of concorded because of a simple act of agression might be appropreatehowever there are likely to be alot of subtle details to address in implementing such a systemi would strongly suggest starting with making short term changes security penalties  particularly ensuring that a more sever penalty for a kill is applied to all highsec gankers and not just the one laying the final blow  and observe the effect that it has on balance before proceeding to change insurance payoutswhat would be the penalty for being in a pirate npc corp what would be the cut of point where a player is booted into the pirate npc corpgiving players freedom to attack pirate npc corps anytimeanywhere and bootin pirates into those corps when they reach 50 security status wouldnt actually change anything from the current mechanicsany attempt to impose other penalties on them would only encourage the formation of annoymous player corpsall i see such a change accomplishing is forcing gankers to make irrelavant adaptions to new game mechanics
well im arguing against it because it is not needed is a complete copout will not solve anything will cause greater problems and doesnt make any sense what so ever about your post 108 ill see what i can do in a separate postccp hasnt made any comment claiming to support or not support any of the proposals in this thread csm have but theyre not ccp it seems to me as ccp are distancing themselves from the proposals in this thread as evidenced by wrangler personally i believe a small change will happen but it will be a bone thrown to you antisuiciders to shut you up for a month or two mean while people will still be getting ganked and the problems caused by whatever change is made will let themselves be known look below for answers to your magic post 108
not unbalanced and very much needed as long as we have the current npc corp mechanics change those to make everyone wardeccable and we can talk about changing suicide ganking to change it before would unbalance things completely as people would have free reign to accumulate wealth in complete safetya hulk pilot is not some new player without any cash a hulk pilot mining in high sec really need to get pushed around every now and again that will let him know hes not safe wherever he isno it really shouldnt hurt too much not more than it already does anyway concord are working exactly as they should the proof of this is to be found at every gate and crowded asteroid belt in high sec warp to any of those and what will you find dozens of players not shooting each other all of this because of concord suicide ganking provides that little bit of risk that high sec desperately needs
please detail your counter argument on why it is not needed how does it constitute a copout and how will it cause greater problems what issues will it raise and if possible can these be mitigatedreally until then your just a typical cnp troll
no insurance is silly let me explain whyfirst new players who want to start pirate careers will be incredibly hamperedsecond most gankers are only going to comit to the act if the potential rewards are there they are not going to gank a 20 to 30 mill cargo  unless its a mistake  so eliminating the insurance will only hurt the newest least experianced newbie playerstherefore eliminating insureance payouts are just going to set precedents where it can be eliminated in other instances it will not stop you from getting ganked in udema when you bring your itteron iii through topped off with morph you will still get gankedkeep in mind that part of the game is piracy you will get kill rights and there is nothing more satisfying that catching the ganker later when he is in a mission ship and popping him and looting his wreckdespite what you may beleive hsg is completely inefective if the target warps to zero go out and experiment fit up a cargo scanner sit at a gate and scan inbound and outbound ships note how little time you have to react and notice that most people do warp to zero  good luck too as far as those people who get ganked in barges in high sec belts thats not driven by a need to generate funds thats more of a griefing imhotribe
sighhave you read any of my posts ill sum it up for you since you cant be bothered to its not needed because theres no particular problem to solve noone has provided any evidence that suicide ganking has gone up to levels that are detrimental to the game in fact noone has provided any evidence that suicide ganking has risen relatively to the increase of players noone has provided any evidence that suicide ganking needs to be limited and noone seems to be able to listen to or use any of the numerous counters that have been presented over and over again removing insurance for concord related crimes is a cop out because that wont solve a thing people will still suicide gank it is a cop out because such a change makes no sense at all criminals shouldnt get insurance my ass using the rl argument noone in eve should get any insurance the only and i mean only reason that ccp would ever contemplate making this change is to placate the whining masses it wont help and it will cause more problems than it solves but much like before whiners will whine until they get what they whine for only then when they finally realise exactly what it was they asked for will they start whining that the solution wasnt as great as they expected and that ccp should change the game again removing insurance for concord related crimes will cause havoc in crowded systems in empire mission ravens that are already exploding from concord left right and center will now not recieve any insurance a mechanic designed to mitigate such losses will suddenly have disappeared and the economy will take the full brunt of the blow its not going to break the economy apart but it will make people quit the game in greater numbers than those quitting due to suicide ganks another problem is that such a change would make it seem as though ccp ranks mission running as a more valid profession than high sec piracy it will be a step away from an open ended players solve their own problems sandbox of a game and a step towards a game where npcs and rigid mechanics limit what you can and cant do it is a step towards the mainstream mmo market that while it probably would temporarily increase subscriber numbers would eventually cause the players that see through the bad pve system and see a game that is player driven and pvp centric ie it would drive away the hard core players spelling eventual doom for the gamei hope this answers your questions
hmmm im thinking the classic muumuu will suit your body style best try this baby on one size fits allwranglers new look  
well i know youre probably all excited and bothered by this issue and that might be why you missed some things the op ccp wrangler said take a moment to relax and read the op with particular attention to short term and mid term comments youll find them in the second and third paragraphswindjammerps it isnt that youre losing the argument youve already lost
you know the funny thing ki an is that i have the same view of this as you do to a t just because the game mechanic existed doesnt meant that it was meant to be utilized in that fashion this kind of stuff happens all the time in games and it is happening now it has always been there yes but as many have pointed out it has become a common tactic that isnt being used for the sole purpose of fighting the logistical elements of 0 corps to this end i dont agree with it and thats why i support the removal of players from npc corps that cant be war decd as i said put them in the militias and then you pirates can fight your way into high sec and blast away at them all day if it were my system imagine being able to take anything you want into caldari space and kill loot and plunder the crap out of people not smart enough to get in a player corp where they run the legitimate risk of being war decdso i want to show you what a whine is so you recognize oneomg i just got suicide gankedhow can ccp not realize this how can any sane person not acknowledge this why have the mechanics not been changed beforecaving in to piratesall i did was take your whine and reverse the statement to support the carebear both are in fact whines but since its coming from you i am sure you think it is nothing but a rose scented breeze right you know that saying i am talking about some people think theirdont stink
couldnt disagree with you more its unbalanced now and this threads op acknowledges that in the first paragraph reallyyou should read it ccp also says in that first paragraph that they do not plan to remove suicide ganking completely doesnt sound like they beleive these changes will in your words unbalance things completelyyoure right a hulk pilot is not some new player without any cash and since hes not a new player he already knows hes not 100 safe anywhere in eve however its ludicrous to say that some solo griefer in a max insured t1 ship should be able to push the biggest and most advanced t2 mining barge around in high sec whenever he feels like it with little pain to the griefer you cant even insure the hulk for its real market priceoh pleaseyoure telling me the scenario i described  paragraph 3 post 108 page 4 of this thread  can be equated with pain man the pirategriefer laughs himself sick to and from the bank on that one high sec has that little bit of risk just fine without some solo artist being able to kill you and profit despite concordin these cases concord is not working as intended and the situation needs some substantial tweaking read the op and see just how thoroughly ccp agrees with that sentiment i know youre really enjoying this forum war and all butdudethe war is overtime to find a new thing for yourselfregardswindjammer
jihadswarm is there some other proof necessary i could go find the earlier post where someone explained how he has to try to convince one of his friends to stay in game after a pointless suicide gank and point out that ive had to do the same but you
this
again i agree that removing insurance is stupid only because its impossible to truly sort the accidents from the intentional i would like to point out though that any dedicated mission runner in a raven or anything else  using a sb or ecm burst is a moron and deserves to take a hit on hisher ship for using those in missions and to their sec statushowever you also mentioned that driving dedicated players away from games kills them when in fact dedicated players are what cause most of the grief for the games developer by finding and continually exploiting the mechanics of the game rather than just playing it to fill a role ganking as a tactic to reduce the logistical footprint of a 0 corp because of an already broken game mechanicperfectly fine ganking because its funnywell its funny to bored people who dont enjoy the game as it is but the mechanics in the game were never intended to allow people to randomly destroy players for no reason it has always been a riskreward system and fighting anything outside that system is fine by me if your ganking as a tactical application for reaching a goal fine but a lot of people are doing it because it boosts there ego that they can kill unsuspecting afk macro or noob players rather than actual pvpers in real life which quit deluding yourself the game is intended to have very realistic aspects anyone who kills just to kill and is caught is locked away your clone would simply be deactivated in this world and that would be that however as a game mechanic pirates are allowed to redeem themselves instead of being permanently locked out of the system not that pirates would be locked out of eve its just that you would be forced to swim with the sharks down in 0 and low sec instead a pirates actions are not permanent which is a game mechanic that allows them to redeem themselves if they get bored or pushed out by alliancesi personally think a great mechanic missing from the game is a way for pirates to function as pirates instead of griefers that hide behind legitimate actions gate camping is a legitimate defense but its also pirates ganging up on people nothing wrong with it until every gate going into 0 and low sec has a dozen pirates camping it and then it gets the nerf hammer so the pirates start suicide ganking and its nearing the hammer as well i would like to see pirates be able to align themselves with npc pirate corps either threw joining an the npc corp or the npc corp having its own militias even having a few sovereign systems of their own that gives pirates a fairly safe base of operations then give pirates access to financial records not exact records but approximates that show how wealthy a corporation is so they have legitimate targets to pirate that they can war dec from 0 or low sec this makes empire corps face a dilemma as the carebears brave enough to fight probably wont go chasing you into the heart of the sansha nation while they would not really have a safe place the one limitation is people in the npc corp would not be allowed into high sec simply because they are an active gurista instead of a privateer for the guristasi feel the biggest requirement is to get players out of the npc corps that is currently the biggest exploit in the game and much more detrimental than suicide ganking which is why i wouldnt allow a pirate to go into high sec if heshe is in an npc pirate corp
well if they would just give out bpos instead  but for a larger rpisk value  it would be even better actually
its common knowledge that alliances have a wide range of numbers which is why looking at the big picture is what we need to do you can say fw is good for alliance a but you know quite well alliance b would use the same situation much differently you have to keep in mind all scenariosi do realize this however i refer to my above comment it really just doesnt matter trying to segregate the different kinds of alliances alliance conflicts are best kept in 00 and sovereign space even if there are alliances with good intentions to use fw there are those that will abuse itits not the big fish scenario its the big abuse scenario i could care less if corp a left an alliance and joined a militia with 500 people if they had the standings to do so more power to them but what we dont want are corps in alliances deciding to fight other corps alliances on the fw militia field can you imaging if 2 corps from two hostiles alliances joined the same militia it all leads to abuse and exploits probably some we cant even think ofi agree that you dont have to be in an alliance to be a pvp pro but we all know some of the best most powerful most prepared most skilled and wealthiest are in alliances sure there are exceptions to the rule but the truth is one alliance inside fw can make or break a militia
i have to laugh at jade here because his alliance is war decking corps in fw to disrupt it and prove to ccp that they can do nothing to stop alliance interferance my corp has been war decked no biggie as most of us are seasoned but we lost new fw pilots because of the sf interferance they just quit completely not even going back to the militiahow are we supposed to help players new and old intrested if the great jade is allowed to end run around things and do as they pleasefrankly i think corps in the fw should be immune to war decks from corps or alliances outside of fw to stop corps from joining to avoid a war deck simply do not allow a corp under a war deck to join fw or they just carry the war deck with themanother idea is since the militia is an alliance of sorts that war deck should transfer over to the militia make it where they have to deal with the navy and all pilots of a militia not just one corpif an entity like sf can just war deck fw corps on all sides and their leader holding a position as they do you might as well just allow alliances to join frankly i cant believe ccp would allow a high ranking member of the community to disrupt a new tool that was designed to allow new players and old player to experience pvpyes i know the corp can just disband and just rejoin the militia but thats not the point some of these corps are in exsistance to allow new players with out the standings to join fw and get a taste
i also laugh at jade given the amusing abuses of the wardec system that said we can discuss wardecs in its own topic threadthere are already persons and corporations representing large 00 alliances present in fw some of these are new corps created for the purpose some like smx are empireside reflections of an alliance these persons or corporations bring badly needed experience organizational professionalism and money into the pvp practice ground that fw was meant to be you already have vastly experienced and spheavy corporations  including more than a few pirate corps  joining fw because of the richness of the target environment the majority offor examplegallente kill successes come from their gangs of very expensive and effective nano shipspermitting corps within alliances to join fwif they have the appropriate standingschanges nothing not the logistics chain not the participation of players  via primary or alt characters  nothing except you engage a large pool of persons including many in empire who have not cared to abandon their alliance assests and friends for a few more war targetsto the content of this proposal i suggest only that corps be permitted to join not only the same faction as their alliancemates but also the allied faction minmatar and gallente caldari and amarr krum
dang here is an issue where i wish it was possible to give a thump downi am far from convinced that the majority of players want alliance involvement in fw
exactly that works both sides keeping alliances out of fw is preventing a large number of alliances from joining fw for reasons that are targeted at a much smaller number of alliances the big picture here says that something is terribly wrong in this solutionyou are presupposing again that all alliances are about 00 and sovereignty and once again only 15 of the alliances hold sovereignty if you want to keep sovereigntyholding alliances out of fw then do that and disallow corps from alliances that hold sovereigntyyou mean they might wardec each other as it has happened before in the gallente and minmatar militia as i said you already have these politicsi disagree some of the best pvp pilots are in corporations such as 0utbreak atomic battle penguins invicta  sorry for leaving out someones corp there are lots of good corps  d00m  they were in a militia for a few weeks  etc there are also good pvp pilots in alliancesone good corp inside fw can make or break a militia that is the case right now keeping corps within alliances out of fw does not solve this problem at alland just to reiterate it there is a lot of uncertainty and fear about what might happen if corps in alliances could join fw while being afraid of it people all too easily forget that corps within alliances are not that much different from corps outside of alliances you are completely ignoring the large amount of really awesome and large pvp corps that are already in fw that havent broken fw yet with the fears brought up here  and that those you argue should be kept out are just a minority of alliances sometimes not even in alliances and that more specialized rulings than no corp in an alliance would help your goals much much more
but where is the difference between whole alliance joining to fw or all corporations joining to fw if they decide to do so they need just join every corp to same fw militia and done
so jade are you saying that if an alliance signs up for fw their industrial corps should be allowed to run around all of empire well of course they shouldnt be allowed to run around gallente space if they are the industrial wing of an alliance that is fighting for the caldari this just in from gallente officials we didnt want that omber anyways thats a disadvantage that should be weighed before joining fw anyways as for the rp alliances well it sucks for them and all alliances hell i want in not all of us are interested in 00 and are we defining experienced lowsec pvpers who sign up for a faction greifers now and 00 has strategic locations rare moon minerals and i suppose the asteroid beltstoo bad the static complexes are gone
dev commentary has two obvious problemsyes andwhy would this be badthe situation wouldnt last long there would be angst someone would get shot people would be kicked loot would be stoled this is just part of the everyday milleu of life in 00 plus it would help reduce the influence of the biggest alliances since it would be harder to maintain order within themthis makes no senseyou set up fw war as a precursor to 00 but then build a chinese wall between the two so that players and corps cant interact geniusthis locks people into fw because their entire corp has to switch to 00 on the same day you cant have people drift between the twoif you want fw to be pvp00 lite then you need to let everyone play the whole game then use risk limits  limit numbers and ship types in complexes  and reward limits in fw to keep it as the game for newer players
hmm i suppose the more important issue is why the hell is fw considered noob friendlyintroductory pvpif anything i would want to join a corp in an alliance and start pvping with them then in one of the lollagfest caracal blobs
this is my opinion but i also think alliance should not be able to joint fwmatt  ccp  is rightjade constantine  csm  talk about a vote saying a majority of player welcome alliance to join fw i myself never heard about this voteis it sure player who vote are representative to all players in eve how many votes  how many involved in an alliance and how many without a 00 alliance  how many alts giving 2 voices to a same playerdoes all csm members think the same for this point i think ccp have a better judgement  fw is very new and nobody have a long term experience on this featurealliances may have a very deep impact on fw  this will for example introduce the capitals battle fleet blobs in the fwa thing that some pvpers dont whant to see anymorefw is a chance to pvp without capitals crazyness you can now see in 00
i like ccps approach to this let factional warfare have a chance to do what ccp designed it to do be an introduction to pvp for those who havent experienced it and at least for now keep alliances out of iti understand jades role play view and desire to be part of a shiny new piece of game content but i think he needs to leave this one alone for now id rather he offer suggestions for additions to the 00 battles which would be similar to fw mechanisms than intrude with his and others alliances into fwas far as jades allegation that his view is in the majority on this issue i beleive that he is incorrect the majority he speaks of was a vote of nine people on the csm a meeting whos minutes have yet to be published though the csm is elected by a vote of subscribers there are many within their constituency who did not vote yet still deserve unbiased representation if youre new to the game and unschooled in pvp you probably dont have much idea what the csm is much less know to vote also those that voted the csm representatives into office do not agree with every single position that their representative supports thats politics you vote for the person that you think is going to support most of your postions you never find a person that agrees with all your postions and you never find a person to vote for where you support all of theirsjade also seems to feel that allowing alliances into fw is a done deal simply because of a 63 vote in favor of it i would remind him and readers of these posts that those things the csm escalates to ccp are recomendations not law ccp must act uponbest regardswindjammer
yes
this 
sign me up for the closed beta i assume this a native client being discussed remember though guys blizzard and others dont even get close to ccp in attempting to satisfy what is still less than 10 of the total marketi do how ever echo that ccp try and sort their plans out and give us a bit more information
since ccp is working with the guys at cedega  crossover  i believe this client si like the one we have now but with premium content   premium content no native client
yes  because eve is using directx it cant simply be rewritten to use opengl so that linux benefit from this thus eve will still need a wrapper like cedegawine around it to work under linux and i believe this wont change soon tm 
sign me up for this beta too im currently running the windows version of eve using wine  and the need for a native linux client is very clear
i dont see the problem here you dont like them dont use them same as with implants
theres no real reason to remove them the two biggest arguments are that they are mandatory for new players and that they are a waste of timethe whole point of the learning skills originally was to give the player the choice between shortterm and longterm skill prioritisation since this is a choice they are obviously not mandatory for new players as that would be a contradiction they are only mandatory for minmaxersif someone considers them a waste of time obviously they should prioritize short term skilling and forget the learning skills keep in mind that the total time to train them all to a decent level will eventually be overshadowed by later skills they are only daunting if you train them right off the batsome people are incapable of making or understanding this choice which is where the idea that they are mandatory or that you are losing sp if you dont train them comes from well the lowest common denominator is not a good target when balancing the complexity of the gamethere are two good reasons to keep them first it requires no work to leave them as is second the fallacies generated by people who dont understand how these skills fit into the greater scheme of things are a constant source of lulz
thumb down for a bad idealosing learning skills  homogenization and dumbing down of evebetter idea would be to establish another server where a new player starts with 10  20 mil sp and trains at 4 or 5 times the rate on tranquility the fpsinstant gratification kids could go there and reduce our server load
this was actually the suggestion im most doubtful about to be honest i would really like mission setups to get away from the capsustaining permatank  damage formula to something that would require a mix of both tanking damage electronic warfare speed and player piloting skill and cutting the npcs in half an replacing them with more powerful ones does the exact opposite however given how limited ccps time is to devote to one particular improvement i tried to keep my ideas in the baby step range so if supported they might show up in 6 months not two years ive got some more grandiose ideas for pve content that includes running blockades stealth missions that require electronic warfare escort missions requiring logistics and other things but those would take significantly longer to implement  and write up tbh 
getting 60 days for the price i got 90 days is i dont like running missions so much generating an extra 18 bil a year just sucks  and that is with lovely discounted gtcs from alliance mates  i want to go back to 10 but that doesnt work out so when im buying gtcs some days i have gotten very lucky some days isnt enough to pay for gtcs
i would rather have the 90d back
and this i will probably be keeping 2 accounts active and one training a month long skill and not active for a month  2030days  i have lots of month long skills looks like i will be doing carrier dread fighters capital energy turret 5 and sentry drone op 5 in the next year or so
yeah bring the 30 and 90 days backgive people the options and yeah we dont need to copy wow although i can see how the gtc issue is related to the euroconversion issuehence the new 60 days price  but yeah a happy customer will bring in more customers
other mmos are not premium products thats a pretty subjective statement to make
and the creditcard payment method is still the same price as it was previous to the change
i made a point during this meeting to ask for at least 30day timecards to return since they seem to be the most commonly used
as one of those that bought gtcs to sell for isk  i used it to buy a freighter  i can tell you that i was starting to wonder how low the price  in isk  a gtc would have to get before people would stop selling themnow we have a 60 day card that costs us more but sells for less again lowering the reasons we have to buy and sell them as the people like me stop offering up gtcs to our fellow players how many of those players will find alternate ways to pay or will they move on to other games they may not like as much as well but can afford to playi also worry that those that currently use gtcs to finance their play  unlike me who used it to finance a special purchase  will decide it just costs too muchbut the 60 day cards are awesome really
for a premium product you sure do have a lot of bugsive already let one account  out of three  expire and have no plans on resubscribing it under current conditions ill probably let another expire and not resubscribe so you gain a little extra money from a single subscription costing more but lose a lot more money from losing two subscriptions bright move that30d and 90d gtcs should be brought back
signed
supporting even though this should have been looked at and addressed long ago op makes a good overview of some of the issues and i miss the interceptor fights in which 6kms was a good speed
yes and i cannot stress enough that it detracts from the flavor of the game
an excellent and concise summation of the problem
the mere fact that so many players have taken to flying around exclusively in polycarbed overdriven recons and hacs  with the occasional falcon or sabre  at the expense of the more traditional mixed shiptype gangs tells the story pretty well in itself theyre not doing it because they really like the ship models
maybe the problem is the majority of ships that go really slownerfing speed will utterly suck for everyone if slower ships were somewhat faster theyd be on a better competitive level someone think of the children i blame the liberals oh wait this isnt that simpsons episode when everyone is about to rioti know fighting speed based ships all the time gets really boring but it is better than everyone being a snail when you consider how much distance you can travel in every solar system when doing things like miningmissioningexplorationpvpif the op is calling for a speed nerf it will nuke every ship not just ones fit out entirely for speedtake nosferatu for example where extremely effective more than they were intended after the nerf i told people i had over 50 heavy diminishing power drain systems in one station someone literally screamed at me to reprocess them for minerals
agility fix agility and you fix the top end nano problem while still allowing speed tanks to exist
personal attacks are not permitted on the forums saint
eve is for pvp and not rp so quit this boi stuffas if it had any impact on the game in any form or fashionnext thing you know you will actaully be supporting interactive storylines reasonably logical ai and the inclusion of depth into this video gamefor gods sake just stopthe chocolate covered thump of inaction is down
complete waste of time
i would like more room to 2  3 times more should be sufficient for me
this and eve mails
though id be more interested in bios not losing their formatting while being edited unless thats been fixed since i left
if it was a strain on some resources implement it as a subscription or purchasable thing for those in need of a longer bio or mail optionyes another isk sink
bring back the long bio
i support this
also longer ship names
longer bio longer ship name space longer evemails dammit signed in triplicate with cherry on top
give me ma biospace back d
ok i misunderstood your proposition that roundlike thing seems doable imho it could even bring people to rpbut it may go against the sandboxmake your own story philosophy of ccp they decide an evolution and we pick up a binary choice the story is not growing from players actionmaybe an alternative is the same thing but without the players knowing it a news story just pop up saying slave freed or supply broken according to the evolution of the war but without any prearranged choice if its clear that those story stem from the actions of the last days it gives an incentive to the war  we are on the news  without a straight path being laid in front of the playersin fact the main thing is that until now the capsuleers news feed  which include fw news  is together with 00 news and separated from the empires news feed  which are the one with storylinebackground things just stopping that discrimination would be a good thinganyway from what i gathered of cpp plan bridging the gap between empire and 00 is one of their aim so i would be kinda optimist on that one no
problems with this are1  what do you do if outcomes on other servers are different2  large parts of the player base are arbitarily excluded from fw at this time
i guess suck it up and hire some additional chinese story writers allow alliance corps to join fw csm has already met and voted 63 in favour of this fix lets hope we can get ccp to roll it out pronto
ive come to love the little readout option
why not
sounds good to me
dingnot just a percentage and absolution readouts but also a userecharge
very simple very usefull
simple idea easy fix should probably be included under general ui improvements though
sounds good considering you need 95 to bring a module online and i know ive received error messages you are currently at 945 before which is irritating
yes this shouldnt hard at all to implement so no excuses ccp
agreed especially because the shieldarmorgraphics are much easier to quickly read because they have a single bar while the capacitor has that odd circle thing with multiple bars
yes
to be frank  whilst the proposed issueschanges to black ops are useful they still leave the ship roleless and underhanded in combat the jump range and fuel bay isnt the base concern its more so the ships have no true role in pvpa suggested fix has been that of creating them as bs force recons has been discussed at great lengths in many topics so wont spam anymore but yes  whilst its good to see them being looked into scan res whole unable to warp cloaked and so on gives them a whole variety of issues  let alone holding no advantage in most scenarios vs their t1 variants 
why is it that the linux client issue s  are missing from the listcsm  ccp meeting 001  0034 linux clientafter a delay of 7 months all we know is that a beta on a better version of the client is going to occur at some point in the future now im not sure anymore what having official support from ccp on linux and mac does mean  
its frustrating to see that ui fixes and improvements are not the number 1 prioritory whatever else gets changed the ui is always there and its how we play the game and everyone has to deal with it sigh
thanks for posting this now i know what is going on i never really kept uptodate with the csm
how did jump bridges and cyno jammers make it to high priority i thought escalation of that was voted down in a csm meetingwindjammer
here is the original list repeated with links to official thread as best as i could find themif i find official threads for the remaining issues i will edit my post to include them as well
not constructive  navigator
a friend of mine offhandedly mentioned this post as we sat discussing eve before kung fu panda started so i thought id come by and read up on it  ive been out of touch with the game for the last month so i havent had time to peruse the new csm forum im not sure how anyone could thoroughly read this thread and not understand the problem the excuses given by the csms are pathetic within a page or two of reading this thread it should be as clear as crystal  for those not familiar with the ship  that the nighthawk has needed a pg increase since the day it hit the serveranyone arguing that it doesnt need an mwd is out of touch with reality or only wants the ship balanced for pve anyone arguing that one should use rigs or implants to accomodate fits doesnt realize that other command ship pilots do not need to do such thingsi hope the csm gets this issue right this time around
reading the minutes where the nighthawk is discussed shows me that some of the csm members simply have no business being there you people seem to forget that youre elected to bring up things with ccp that we the players have raised concern with the cope out some of you used is simply unacceptable that was not a vote of we do not see a problem with the nighthawk it was a well we decided we do not want to cover these kinds of things and voted it downinstances like that make me glad you dont actually have any real authority and are just there to voice to ccp the concerns of the players bring it up for another vote with the evidence in mind and without your pathetic excuses to disregard what many see as a serious issuequick reminder for you guysbrutix  astarte300 pg15 cpuferox  nighthawk290 pg80 cpuenough of your crap do your job or step down and make room for people who actually understand what their role is as a part of the csm i hope ccp implements a way for us to lobby to them to have people removed if theyre believed to be working in their own interests or halfassing it just to help curb the harm that such people will do with their actions
word  aka this either that or create a third state as this would affect things like armor plates cap rechargers it would be nicer for when i have several ships unpackaged and oh shoot which ones did i rig again and even a show info  fittings tab see what is fit
if you want to improve the contract system implement a search feature thats it id love to be able to go gee i want a drake and instead of the current system of hey contracts tell me every freaking ship in the region being contracted i can tell the contract system to go no stupid not amar shuttle i want a drakeyou can already make contracts private you can already set your sellbuy price and filter out the riffraff make they system in place usable
there is a search feature i use it almost every day
we have people who make us ships and sell them at a discount no we cant buy them at a whim and it takes a day or two but hell i have 1020 something battleships on hand at all time its rather easy to do and all it takes is a contract i can make 9 contracts and well that took me about 2 hours to train the skill to level 2 you are in an alliance im sure you have some sort of logistics to get stuff done 2 is a bit of an issue
to take load from the database and make the market faster i sugest changing the max time for orders in the market 90 days is way to longgemini
up the time on contract availability lower the associated costs with setting them up30 days for a contract and skills to reduce the costs of setting contracts up
this seems to be the exact problem i am having at the momentwe have lots of corps who now use the helpmymission channel so we have toyed with the idea of setting up an alliance the problem is we would have wanted an alliance that would work more like a trade alliance cartel type of systemthe aim would be to allow people in corps  alliance that you want to be able to see which things are available to them at discountedcost prices etcthis would in theory be quite easy to implement with a button saying alliance market or something like that and the option of having it as an alliance trade when putting it up on the market in the first placethis would be a very useful feature in my opinion and would be useful all over eve
glad to hear we are on the same page
its no wonder that the forum nukes database and loadbalancerseach new request creates a session if there is not already onethis is a waste of resources  you should only need a session when someone is logged in asp creates session cookies with different names these allow multiple session cookies to exist  which breaks the cookie amount limit and can prevent users from logging in when no new cookie can be created in the client storage restarting a session uses more resources if you need to check 20 asp session cookies if any is still validloadbalancers need a way to reassign a user to the same application server if session storage is not shared  if it is shared there is no reason for sticky sessions unless you process uploaded files in multiple steps also there are different strategies to assign users to application servers  some of them dont require no space on the balancer at all so a simple fix would be stop automaticly starting a session  only restart if cookie with id is present and start only when needed  use a unique name for session cookies not aspsessionidabcdefg  value optional increase the session timeout  you will have much less sessions after solving the first two issues 
fixd amirite
haha this is so true i dont know why ccp is using asp either it doesnt make sense for scalability
im not a techie and i cant comment on all the details here intelligently but from my experience with other forum software specifically phpbb  run by people who really werent techies either i cant imagine ccp has any excuse take the existing free software skin it to match the eve site and make the user database and avatars equal to the games user list updated automatically every downtime its copylefted so youd have to release source code but that shouldnt be a real issue given that your only real amendments would be to skin it which a lot of fan sites would probably like  a bit of code to transfer data between your user db and your forum db and another bit well probably a lot  of code to import all the data from these old forums none of that is really a trade secret or any kind of security risk as far as i can tell and if im wrong on that point theres plenty of other forum software out there  i just named the most popular that would solve the issue of login times im not sure ive ever had to relog on a forum i used at least occasionally  post length limits and the consequent need for 20 reserved posts on the most useful threads out there the inability to create a separate csm forum and a pile of other issues and ive seen it used on boards as busy as this one with few issues so i dont imagine scaleability is a problem perhaps i havent outlined the optimal solution but from everything i know its a far better solution than the current one and would take next to no time effort or money to implement it could just as easily have been done when the game was in beta of course but theres no use crying over spilt milk also on the topic of the igb being slated for demolition ill just say two things 1  thank you oh god thank you2  firefox
the old old argument that corps who have stations with research slots and run them as businesses would be penalised by the addition of extra npc slots has no credibility for me  such corps  and other manufacturing corps  routinely clog up npc slots in order to force people to use their services or exclude competitors and unless steps are taken to prevent this  which is impossible due to alts  the need to allow people to conduct research without putting themselves at risk of scammery is imo more importantnew players are essentially excluded from profitable manufacturing for at least the first month of their career  which means free trials have no chance this needs to be fixedpersonally i would rather see a system which forces people to make more sensible use of current slots than the addition of more slots perhaps ccp would like to comment on just how much slotabuse there seems to be at the moment  how much evidence is there of slots being locked up by corps who run pos research businesses and how many slots are being used to trim the cost of a battleship by 3 tritthere is little disincentive to overresearch a blueprint at the moment  the time to conduct research is dominated by the delay waiting for the slot not the time taken doing the actual research so you might as well schedule 100 cycles as the 10 that are really needed attacking this overuse of slots seems to me to be a potentially fruitful approachone possible solution or step toward a solution would be to limit the number of cycles that can take place in a single job if each job was limited to 5 or 10 cycles with the number perhaps dependant on the type of blueprint and maybe increased by a skill this would at least cycle research slots more quickly allowing people to get at least some research done within a realistic time frame it should discourage the overresearching of blueprints the limit would not apply to pos slots
how about ability to rent more npc slots if you pay for an office in the respective station the slots per station are probably static so this would be a problem but one could rent services from the npc corporation with the rent where they can request priority on a jobfe i rent an office with me and copy slots service on top of the usual corp hangar this allows me to use up to x slots of each type in some limited cycle and i pay for the job also as usual  on top of the increased rent this would become more expensive as more offices rent slots so whoever comes too late has to pay extra or move somewhere else naturaly lowsec slots would be cheaper than highsec  scale based on sec status  there will be a limit on total slot amount you can rent but you can divide them into the types your need10 slots total you select 6 me and 4 copy  as an example there are some more issues that need to be cleared about this but i hope you get the general idea
given that me resarch over a given value is practically worthless why not just introduce an me cap of say 25 for all bpos this would stop slots being taken up by people who dont realise the extra me is pointless stop people just overresearching because the huge wait time is the biggest time factor hinder corporate slot blockers who would have to keep buying new bpos  which would get expensive as to block up a slot with the me cap in place would effectively requires a new ship bpo 
the solution for public labs is easy allow materials to be taken from the personal  or corporate ie not the pos owners  hangar with all of the outputs going to that hangar costs will be from out of the personal wallet  if using a public pos  personal hangar  or the corporate divisional wallet  if using your corps hangar to research from no need to go to the pos other than fuelingsimple ehedit if the labs  pos is offlined or destroyed the bpo would return to the hangar it came out from like they do currently as far as cost reimbursement everything comes at a risk
can you please explain this further by local hangar do you mean a hangar at the starbase itself or do you mean a hangar in a corporation office in a stationif its the latter then i see it only technically impossible if youre not a member of a corporation corporations can rent an office in any station in that system which then grants them the local hangar required for thisif its the former then i suggest creating a new structure public storage array it can be selected from the job creation process window as a valid location from which to pull the required science  industry resources and to which the finished products can be placed this array is specifically designed for public use of research and noncapital tech1 manufacturing arraysthe structure itself has a 0m3 cargo capacity and does not allow anything to be placed in it to use this structure you have to lock your blueprint in place that is a new checkbox is added to the job creation process public industry escrow this checkbox only appears when there is a public storage array attached to the starbase from which you have selected the assembly or research line when selected and created this job does several thingsfirst it does not actually create the job in that it does not extend the wait time of the assigned assembly line it does however lock the price of the job your isk and your blueprint details on this will be described further belowsecondly it counts towards the respective job count for which youre creating the escrow regardless of whether or not existing jobs are in escrow for example if you have mass production trained to level 4 then you can create a maximum of 5 manufacturing jobs  whether in escrow or notthirdly an automatic bookmark is created  similar to how theres automatic bookmarks for missions one for the missions agents home one for any combat encounters and one for pickupdelivery station  for the public storage array this is to make sure that you are able to locate the structure so that you can place your items in itfourthly creating a public industry escrow modifies your personal or corporation hangar attributes  depending on if you created the job using your personal hangar or your corporations hangar  for the starbases attached public storage array the first attribute modified is the size of the cargo capacity for your hangar it is now changed to the required m3 for the job you created in escrow the second attribute modified is the items in which can be placed into your hangar in the public storage array everything is still disallowed except for the items required by the jobso if youre manufacturing a raven then you can only place tritanium pyerite mexallon isogen nocxium zydrine and megacyte into it if on the other hand youre manufacturing a mobile large warp disruptor i then you can only place tritanium pyerite mexallon isogen nocxium zydrine megacyte warp scrambler i and electronic parts in it on the research side of things most t1 blueprints will still disallow everything for me and pe research if for example youre attemping to research the me level of a mobile large warp disruptor i blueprint then the public storage array will allow the placing of reports and consumer electronics into itfinally you can only create one escrow per public assembly array this is to prevent racking up the m3 available in a single location
you now have the knowledge neceessary to create a job in escrow how to locate the required public storage array and how to place the items into the public storage array lets assume youve done that now whatwhen you created the public industry escrow i stated that your blueprint has been locked it has been removed from the location it was in and has instead moved to the magic land of wherever science  industry moves blueprints while theyre being used in a job if you cancel your job your blueprint will return to the location it was at if the starbase is destroyed your blueprint will return to the location it was at your blueprint is safewhen you created the public industry escrow the price of the research line was locked in place and your isk taken to pay for the line the isk is in limbo perhaps it doesnt need to be but thats how i envisioned it in any case if the starbase owner decides to change the prices of the research lines after youve created the public industry escrow nothing changes if they increased the line price you still pay the same price you had agreed to if they reduced the price youre getting shaftedand i stated that the industry line did not have its wait time increased yet now that all of the required materials are placed in the public storage array you need to open up your science  industry window and locate your escrowed job youll find that its activity is stated as escrow this is basically the same as pending  no research is being done you can still pull your materials out of the public storage array and cancel the job by the way if you cancel the job without pulling your materials out all of the materials will be forfeit and returned to the starbase owner  they will be placed in the starbase owners deliveries section  so make sure youve pulled everything out beforehandonce youve found your escrowed job select it and click the start job s  button at this point the isk is paid to the starbases owning corporation and the industry lines wait time is extended the materials vanish from the public storage array the public storage arrays available m3 is reset to 0  for your hangar  and the public storage arrays acceptable items is reset to nothing  again for your hangar at this point you can cancel the job just like any other job the industry wait time will not be reduced the isk will not be returned to you the materials simply vanish without a trace and no finished product is returned to you your blueprint however is returned to youor you can let the job run until completion when the job has completed you can finish it just like any other job the finished materials for any manufacturing process will be placed in your hangar of the public storage array your blueprint will return to the location from which the job was creatednow on to the downsides what does this do for the starbases owning corporation well obviously they have to attach and online yet another structure and pay for the fuel for it if the starbase is attacked and goes into reinforced the public storage array goes offline and no one can place new materials into it nor can they start any escrowed jobs for which theyve already placed all of their materials  error message stating that the structure is offline if the owning corporation decides to move the tower they will need to make sure that the public storage array is empty before they will be able to unanchor the control tower  under current game mechanics  tbh this could be fixed by allowing corporations to unanchor control towers whether or not there are anchored structures nearby but that is an argument for a different topicand if anyone destroys the public storage array normal loot drop mechanics will apply to all materials in it blueprints will return to the stations like normalgg the end problem solved
also it should be noted that public storage arrays can be set to corporation or alliance use to prevent public use this would encourage corporation or alliance members to use the corporations assets for personal or alliance gainobviously you wont be able to create a public industry escrow if the public storage array is offline or if its not set to allow you to use ityou could have multiple public storage arrays attached to a starbase and simply search for the first available one  online and matches usage filters  when creating a public industry escrow this would encourage having multiple escrowed jobs  read multiple jobs for a single starbase from a single client also make sure to remind the customer that their materials will vanish if the public storage array is destroyed before the job is started and that the entire job may vanish if the researchmanufacturing array is destroyed if the public storage array is destroyed but the manufacturingresearch array stays anchored to a nearby tower then it needs to be possible to redirect the finished product to a new public storage arrayand finally the public storage array needs to be anchored inside the bubble to prevent the starbases owning corproation from simply killing the structure in an attempt to gain free materials so to make sure that people can still access it without the starbase password it needs to have a rather large maximum operational distance 50km is probably good
if you add more slots maybe limit their use by standing so people cant just spam all of them and instead need to invest time and effort for less frequented slots and it would also put more significance to the more unused npc corporations
1 to akita t public labs idea
i do not beleive that a modest increase in the number of npc station slots is going to impact the pos research business to any appreciable degree it might make the que times a bit shorter but there will still be a longer wait at the npc station than at the pos station the same people who dont want to wait now wont want to wait then and the pos researchers will not be effected to any significant degree if at allregardswindjammer
if i had my way xaen wouldve been on ccps payroll years ago my wrist probably wouldnt be throbbing right now from eves hostile user interface
right now you can do pretty much anything you need to do by right clicking the target of your action dont change that while adding all this fluff its nice
when i read that ui improvements are being considered the first thing that came to my mind was the fact that trash it is placed directly next to activate ship which is basically a disaster waiting to happen you misclicked once to get to the trash confirmation window and its not hard enough to misclick again and confirm your choice to destroy your largest investment for no gainall that really needs to be done here is to move the trash it menu item so that it is not directly adjacent to activate ship that and hopefully add another layer of confirmation preferably with a small timer if its a ship thats being trashedthats my idea ive never made this mistake but i have misclicked trash it enough times to make me uneasy about this particular featureedit one other xaenlike idea that i have to bring up is when you set a module to autorepeat and autoreload such as a cap booster it goes until it runs out then reloads then stops it should keep activating until you turn it off even after reloading this includes guns
please add in keyboard functionality to the ui right click fine but not everyone is a clickaholic   keyboard commands or bind keys for functions are possible in many other games why are you so afraid of this if you have 3 dedicated programmers
this attitude is quite appalling to me you are the ones who screwed up by not considering our friends with impaired color vision  or frankly most of what are considered best practices in human interface design and now you say we know you are having a hard time but we dont care enough to go back and fix our mistakes
i have to wade through there once again  i lost track about that thread  my favourite issue is the tactical overlay and its total unusability for almost anything
heres one for you trails and trajectories what would this look like well remember games like homeworld where ships leave behind long winded engine trails this does not just look good  it adds more intuitively accessible information about speed location and trajectory to the inspace view it also lets you know more exactly what theyre doing for example if that inty is orbiting you or manually pilotingthis functionality already exists in eve but it is currently largely useless and mostly serves as eye candy  im talking about engine trails of course have you ever thought about adding trails as a ui item for example when the tactical overlay is switched on the  ui  trails of far away ships would have to be visible they could be segmented so that larger segments indicate higher speed and shorter segments lower speed they would fade away after a set time obviously so fast ships have long trails and slow ships have short trails you get the idea i thinki imagine this would be a very useful ui element for the inspace view and it also wouldnt add more load to the servers since it can from my understanding all be calculated with the information already available to the client through the overviewim going to have to think more on this and produce a more elaborate proposal with images dont i
and what about an xml based  or whatever  based ui and alow players to make their own feature me dream about a solution for setting size and locations off windows by myself
yeah thats the ultimate solution to about 80 of the existing problems theres some that can only be done by ccp but for most of it they should just crack the ui wide open and let us have at it you need some antimacro protections of course but thats not a wrecking problem one of the ui coders needs to take a vacation in azeroth and then come back to us itd help things immensely
aye it would stink if all of a sudden our universe was invaded by macros who mined or ran courier missions 237
you cant get rid of them completely of course but itd generally be nice to make it so that it takes a touch of skill to do it theres a world of difference between it being possible and it being easy
ive been saying this since ive been playing if ccp cant get it right  no one person or company will ever make a ui that is right for everyone  let the players do itand please dont give me the crap that its not possible it is possible to change the ui from nonxml based to xml based as eamythic did it with daoc  i believe the trials of atlantis expansion 
this may be the problem why isnt there an ui specialistadmitedly i ask the same questions in my own company and our interface is also a bit on the random side
hahah you do realize that you are getting trolled hardcore right
currently people use npc corps as a shield against war decs  though the flawed war dec system is another issue  and some players stay in these corps for far too long id propose that 2 tiers of npc corps get createdtier 1npc start corp a player can remain in this corp for 6 months after that time they get an evemail from the npc corp head saying they have been promoted to a position in the tier 2 corp to help with the war efforttier 2 these are still npc corps but with one major difference they are considered sideparticipants in fw while not a full fw corp they have an existing history of aggression with a tier 2 corp of the enemy faction and a permanent war dec between these corps exist this would fit into the current fw storylines and encourage pilots to form groups in npc corps or movecreate player corpupon joining the tier 2 corp their new ceo will send them an evemail outlining the new risks they face in space and the options available to pilots in that corp heshe will highlight how many of their pilots have gone on to officially help the war effort in  insert empire militia name here  or gone on to create highly successful corporations of their own a tutorial will also pop up that further explains empire wardec rules and how it pertains to them and highlight the possibility of creating or joining a player corp if they choose not to participate in this specific warwhat this will doencourage players to move to small player corpsintroduce players to pvpreduce protection to older players in npc corps
i like this idea many will hate it ccp will dislike it as it will  off some subscribers with no upside for ccp
at the moment it is not possible to carry a container other than a general freight container filled with modules for a freighter or for carriers to have ships in them that only have ammunition id like a reversal the only way around this is to get a jump freighter and as it stands i dont have 5bn isk to go out and buy one carriers were the main supply lines for alliances in 00 and gave them something to do other than sit around and do nothingthis needs to change and be reverted to previous settings it allowed smaller corps and alliances to move items and more flexability in a carriers role which atm is just to get shot atas far as i can see the old system made things work smoothly and had a vital role in logistical matters now its a lot more expensive with having to buy hugely expensive freighters and more hassle than their worthgive us back the old system so carriers had a role and were used more often as they are not used much now and would remove the utterly suck tags that attach to them
ild go for this im a fairly new carrier pilot about 3 months or so and all i have done is ferry a few ships out of 00 when our corp disbanded
neat idea would love to see more work and consideration into it
the problem with this is that most of the most annoying mwd ships operate outside web range as it is also the web range penalty just looks like a swarm of bugs waiting to happen but for some varieties of pvp web resistance would return afterburners to viability i like this proposal  one of the most sensible plans for an ab buff ive seen yet
signedthis allows for closecombat fighting by smaller shipsas already mentioned this could help fix assault frigates
one idea i had which wasnt too warm welcomedab make you faster by pushing the ship hardermwd make you faster by generating the same warp bubble that regular warping doeswebs make you slower by entangling the ship with a modified tractor beamscramblers throw off the guidance systems making warpdrive destinations hard to plotso why couldnt the current system be tweaked a bitwebs affect ab by providing drag to counter the extra force but webs would lose their hold and slip off when an mwd forms the warp bubble around the shipwhile a scrambler could possibly inhibit the mwd from locking onto the destination which may only be a few meters ahead of the ship anywaysso in essence webs no longer affect mwd but scramblers would with the same basic effect as current websehh
i dont really see how that addresses any problems listed or any problems at all all that does is reallocate the problem to other modules and not fix any problem
because nanos can balance between polycarb overdrives and stabilizers then ab craft suffer inside web range and mwd craft can plan ahead and avoid being slowed down by overcoming the scramblers
im kinda lost on how thats different from today and webs current useas for scripts im game for scripts if webs had to choose bt 40 webbing at 30km and 90 webbing at 5km but that still doesnt address the ab problem at all right now mwd trumps ab bc speed and mass allow the mwd to be an incredible defensive tool to escape tracking damage and scrambler range there simple is no reason to choose less speed while still wasting a slot for a mod when you can just tank harder right now its mwd or nothing at all for virtually all shipsthere is a reason they took mwd use outta complexes but left ab i see this as a similar application to complexes but on a practical level for pvp use
exotic dancers are widely considered a good luck charm oddly ive met pilots who use livestock instead but i really didnt want to discuss the issue with them in detail
i agree with this totaley
okay i support this now the original post seemed like a prank and im still not sure it isnt but subsequent posts have brought up the issue of good luck charmsgood luck charms really work not because of some supernatural intervention but because of the way they make people feel if you have a positive attitude about your chances in combat youre going to do better it doesnt have to make sense if it works you use it you see the same thing on sports teams all the time rituals before the big game articles of apparel or game play such as a lucky sweat band or bat or glove or club etchaving read the above you might guess i have good luck pieces and youd be correct mine are slaver hounds i keep one on every combat ship i field liberated from their hated amarrian owners they have absolute loyalty eliminate shipboard vermin and provide an amusing and terminal surprise for any who board my ship without my leavebest regardswindjammer
exotic dancer bonusesendless lifeendless ammoetc i support this
i was in a small fleet battle the other day  70 on 60  and found that some people in the fleet were able to target ships and shoot while my module activations just failed and my ship was unresponsive resulting in ship loss without firing a single shotthe funny thing is that my fps were not that bad and also eve voice worked fine all that time so the network connection seemed finei know that lag can not be avoided but at this point it does not seem to impact all players in the fleet the same way maybe i need to upgrade hardware or try another isp but at this point i just do not have enough information about the nature of the failure to do fleet battlesmaybe we can have indicators that show the following conditions1 client cpu can not keep up with game status updates2 we have fps already3 network quality of service  are my modules not activating because adsl downstream and upstream capacity are conflicting 4 server cpu loadi suspect that when the server gets overloaded the requests that get processed are not scheduled in a fair order resulting in some requests being handled and others starvedwithout more detailed feedback we customers can not really do anything to improve the situationccp please fix the lag  and your ui by the way  before blizzard will do to you want they did to everquest
trolling removed navigator
agreed but i would like a smaller distance particularly for the smaller ships
lol nanos already have a big advantage  now they need an escape with my pod alive 99 of the time feature get real
agreed
i like this idea a lot
i support this however it should also be noted that while moving at greater than maximum speed this should not affect the instawarp that pods already posess  ie if you eject from your ship and are moving at 2kms in one direction and click to warp to a celestial in the other direction you should not need to slow down first you should simply warp
make remoterepping someone with an aggro flag take on the same flag themselveswould prevent carriers from sitting on the station and repping their own guys as well as logistics that sit on a gate and jump out when they get banged up
have no idea for solution but 
i say adjust the docking and jumping timers based on sigradius of ship at the time of their most recent aggression this actually gives target painters something useful to do in these situations judging from current signature radiuses  radii  of everything from frigates to battleships i would say that ratio of 1 second timer per 25 meters of signature radius would probably be acceptable that would mean that an abaddon with its current 470m sigradius would have a docking timer of 26 minutes of course this should be playtested on sisi to figure out the best ratio  perhaps 12 or 13 of sigradius  and to avoid exploits  jump in a frigate at a safe location shoot something  perhaps a willing friendly  then jump back in your battleship or capital to dock  make sure that the timer for the most recent aggression isnt smaller than the aggression previous to it before setting the timer to itif you cant kill something with that then add target painters youd be surprised how fast a battleship or battlecruisers sigradius  and thus timer  would multiply with just two or three paintersin any case create an assist timer which is 50 of the aggression timer of the person youve assisted so if player a aggresses and receives a 60second timer then player b repairs player a player b should receive a 30second timerif youre feeling especially nerffull you could make both timers cumulative  so two remote repping ships would each receive a timer of aggression  assist the example above would total 90 seconds each then to tie it all together apply the current 15 minute aggressionlogoff timer as the maximum for the docking timer so if youre scrambled you can log off and sit  most likely warp scrambled  at the undock for 15 minutes with no view of whats going on or you can stay logged on and monitor your tank for that 15 minutes and then simply dock or you can selfdestructthis would also help against nanos if a cruisersized nano aggresses with their mwd on theyre going to have a 3 to 8 minute aggression timer  depending on particular ship and fittings  in which they cannot jump out of system which gives defenders additional time to set up trapsand it gives a bonus to regular interdictors their smaller sigradius means that their bubbles wont prevent them from jumping for a full 2 minutes but rather a much more reasonable 25 to 45 seconds base if they leave their mwd off thats a fair amount of time to kill a slow interdictor  again mwd off  if you primary them as soon as you come out of warpin all cases for any dynamic timer to not  off a lot of people you would definitely need to display the timer somewhere  im looking at you 00 systems  large fleets will get angry when their heavier ships cannot keep up with slower ships for simple fleet movements just because they shot someone 5 minutes ago and they dont know what their timer was  because it could have been adjusted by someone painting them 
undock  you appear 15km off station with invurnerable timer just like jumping though a gate invul timer ie you dont move or do anything and you are not lockableperhaps in a random direction 15km form station meaning a camped station would have a force surrounding it and the defenders could undock to try to risk making a run for it this also solves all undock bumping and stuck issues as well
random undocking spots and distances now
especially with the recent implementation  and based on bad amarr standing and sec status  i am finding more and more of my ships are stuck in highsec systems i cannot accessi understand that there are consequences for actions but their outta be a means to move these ships to where they can be used none of my alts can fly them and they are rigged so i cannot repackage them for transport of a freighterperhaps with the proposed small freighter it can have a ship maintancence array relatively large so as to move a single battleship  the hardest to move in highsec  but give it horrible agility or some other nerfor perhaps a new ship class similar to a freighter but only able to move assembled ships and have the ability as well to haul a single battleshipanyway just an issue i have had and wish to be addressed the proposed ideas may not be ideal but i am sure csm and ccp will be better equipped to see an advantagous solutionbryg
issue is coming up this sunday and was initially raised in this thread please go and add your support to that one and can you discuss implementation ideas there ideallythanks
this is a nonsense situation a forum is inherently a broken method of dealing with the whole csm topic discussion  at least without some additional functionality  and now its been made even more of a nonsense by the massive spam of meeting minutes bumping all of the actual topics awayit was bad enough sorting through the threads before and what ccp wrangler has done has made a mockery of the process i think that the csm is doing a great job and the light at the end of the tunnel was beginning to shine but this only goes to solidify my perception that ccp really dont care about making the csm effective and by implication that marginalises all of the playersive been keenly reading and sometimes posting on the topics raised  but i am really starting to think that participation in this process is like banging your head against a brick wall a growing mountain of little bits and pieces like this have eroded my faith to the point where i lack confidence that ccp will ever take this as seriously as they are claiming and as a result i am definitely sliding from interested towards indifferentcome on ccp  sort this out before it is too late meeting minutes and the threads that generated the discussion clearly require their own section on the forums get the proclamations room back in and move all of the threads into there you have several csm reps on this very thread saying this method of posting was a bad idea  please for gods sake listen to them like you said you would
exactly the proclamations section of the csm forums was put up and then taken down before there was anything to put in it now that there is something to put in proclamations they dump the whole thing in the middle of assembly hall this is not well done and it is very difficult to see how assembly hall can possibly function with this happening after every csmccp meetingright now its made the assembly hall navigation extremely cumbersome and disrupted it to a high degree i really do not want to see how much a mess they can make it by dumping every csmccp meeting in herethis has the feel of something done with little carewindjammer
yeah there needs to be a number of forums imogeneral discussions  currently speakers cornerissues  assy    halloutstanding issues raised with ccpresolved issuesrejected issuesthen a proper process can be followedidea is raised in 1  or features and ideas after a period of discussion the same idea is raised as an issue in 2 with reference to the original discussion so people can show their support formallyif enough support is raised the issue is brought to ccp when this happens a post is started in 3 with reference to the posts in 1 and 2 and with ccps reply if ccp want more information on a topic then the post is opened for comment otherwise it is locked  for example if its something only they can look at internally when an issue is resolved it is passed to 4 referencing all previous threads and a comment on the resolution including  if appropriate  details on when the solution will be implimentedif at any stage an issue is rejected it is moved to the rejected issues thread and locked with comment on why it has been rejected
good ideas but is going to fall down on any actual moving between forum categories this is a function that is unlikely ever to be available to csm members  and creating more work for the full time moderators will not be popular best resolution remains  please give us back the proclamations forum rename it to csm archives  or something   move all these threads there and in the future let csm members request moves for closed issues also so we keep the assembly hall for discussion of live issues
whilst it would be nice to move the threads the same could be accomplished by locking the original threads and creating a new one thats why i mentioned the references so theres a decent papertrail
if wrangler can make 30 topics i think that he would forgive me for bumping one even if you dont support my ideas let me know why im always open for additional suggestions and improvements
why cant you put your ideas in the idea forumso you want a antimwd cloud in every belt and plex so the player who already uses abs will still use abs and receive no penalties the players that use mwd will still use mwds but now get a penaltythis thread is all kinds of fail abs are only useful on rattingmissionplex ships so lets boost their usage in plexes then more people will use them riiiiiight
stupid and counterproductive when the issue is that the modules are terrible the answer is not to create elaborate environments that make them seem attractive but rather to fundamentally revise the moduletactical environments are just a buzzword for complexes and instancing the wrong direction for eve to be going in
how so i dont think that the only places of combat should be gates and moons and factional warfare has demonstrated that such a system can exist and be fun why is it bad to encourage more of this instead of people clumping up on moons and gates like it has been for the past five years regarding revising the ab module you are free to suggest a change  if i like it ill support italso complexes do not equal instancing
i would like to see a grander introduction of game play for the eve populous some thing for everyone what a lot on players see is a lot of attention to the pvp side changes and fixes yes they get attention but the majority of the time it is not the favorable kind pvprs have had the biggest change in there game play than any other in the game players are forced to change skill paths and so on just to keep up with the balancing a lot of the goodies pvprs get are either broken worthless or incomplete and once they are accepted they end getting nerfed it is the cycle of things for a pvpr its a pretty turbulent rideindustrialistmission runnersoh hell carebears in my past life pvp was very important focus and now trying the bear side of the woods its kind ofwell like eating newspaper its pretty bland and very repetitive there are some challenges and yes the rewards can be great butits just another plain cardboard box one thing i do appreciate is that the stuff we do get are pretty much stable there is very little change to upset the cart but there is very little change to improve the taste of newspaper toothe bear side needs something and so does the pvp aspect i think if we can get away from focusing on one side or another we can find our selves a grander idea one that noah at ccp is looking for something that gives color and a little spice marcus came up with some ideas that can work on a ground floor base the ideas he initially presented can be used by all that is where we need to go or at least start
its amazing you can actually type something like this and still manage to dress yourself in the morningthis must be from a random bull generator no way can this be real
there are people that believe they dont need manufacturing and the last time i saw something that said stuff about the industrial side getting stuff it was well received you jettisoned the ore aka you threw it away deal with the consequences ratting  reprocess  mining  ed up w00t you had one valid point move ore from cargo to giant can hauler then moves ore from container to its cargo you are in a corp you guys dont do mining ops together or anything please do go on

first english is not my first language so plz take that into account then let me tell you i played in large alliances for about 3 years and participated in big campaigns in all different kind of settings without capitals during the dreadage and also the supercapitalage using the first titans in gameccp claimed that they wished the csm to present more longterm ideas regarding eve because they wanted to discuss eves future not minor issues so lets speak about eves futuretime to realize a mistake was madeshort version1 veterans will know eve was way larger back in the days before the capitalera  if you dont understand read on 2 the introduction of the jumpdrive was one of the biggest balancechanges and the consequences a major oversight by the developers at first it wasnt so obvious because more ships with jumpdrivecapability got added only later3 now after about 2 years  it could be seen earlier but lets analyze it now  we experience the consequences a capital blob can visit all of 00 in about 2h and lay havoc everywhere only to be countered by a even larger capital blob this blob got a size normal fleets couldnt match 2 years ago4 its time that eve gets bigger again and there are only 2 waysa  increase evesize by adding deep 00   not near empire because all operations can start from empire and adding more space near it will change nothing at all b  nerf the jumpdrive  i dont like this idea taking something away is always bad but it would be the easier solution edit deep 00 are regions added for example behind branch making the distance to travel to the furthest point from empire 23x the time needed today5 why lets face it capital blobs will not go away they will get bigger and bigger as it was before the capital era the territory has to be so large that an entity cannot travel it in one evening even in jumpdrives  1 evening  about 34 hours 6 lag well knowing how the serverstructure of eve works we also know that adding systems is only a question of adding more cpus to the serverstructure yes 1 system nowadays is limited by 1 cpu  because only 1 cpu can be assigned to it except the marketchat  and by the rather undynamic loading system  only at dt  no 1000man battle can take place in a systembutadding more systems doesnt change anything as long as ccp adds the same amount of cpus parallel to the added systems  20 more systems  20 more cpus  you as a player will then notice no differenceeve got to a point where everything was great and then ruined itself the point i speak of when dreads where added but no carriers and supercaps that was the best eve i have played dreads where no problem because they were specialized ships and bs where still necessary but there was no fast travel mode for bs and dread didnt replace bs so the distances in eve stayed the same and 50 jumps where a long way to gothen carriers and mstitans got in and changed everything in 2 ways 1 carriersms replaced the need of bs in war and fundamentaly changed the logistic aspect of posnetworks and 2 titans could move every kind of ship faster across the universe then beforeboth changes made eve smaller at least by the factor 4so time to get that right again veterans who played before the capital age will know what i mean and others should think about what it could be because there was a time when eve was huge in terms of territorylet me tell you when you are able to supply a whole alliances needs with only 2 ships  2x rorqualjump freighter  you know eve got too smallwarning rl comparisonmedieval age  slow transport  regional conflictsmodern age  fast transport  world wars superpowers can fight in every part of the world within 24h  you can count that kind of superpowers on 1 hand as in eve of today i want my medieval eve back it was simply more funnow for the csm to elaborate and discuss this topic
before i start im no carebear ive pirated i kill people daily and i enjoy it so dont slander my name with carebear bull x the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because the mission runner owns the wrecks and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamicwhen someone does a mission who kills the rats who spends time to get the ability to do those missions who spends isk to afford ships to take rats out the missioner does ninja salvagers are a scourge on missioners i salvage every time but strangly enough marauders are expensive maybe i have other things i want to buy than waste a several hunderd mil isk because some  feel the need to come into my mission generated because of hard work i have put into this game oddly enough i cant be in 2 ships at once and i cant do much salvaging in a raven without sacrificing dps or tank so whenever you come in m mission which i might add happens all the damn time you are 1 taking something that you have put 0 effort in for oh no the skills are soooo hard to train for well how about getting some balls and training to do your own missions instead 2 taking isk out of my pocket3 being a lazy  that cant do missions of his own because well you guess know your own problems so i hardly need to say them aloudbut this class of players that ccp will be destroying if they fix this are theives who reap the benefits of others hard labor and spent isk try and help eve delete your account and make one that might actually be a productive player rather than an  you would save me and others who salvage their missions alot of hassle ccp needs to fix this so that when some stupid  comes into my mission i can kill him and not have half a dozen of his buddies try and jump me plz allow me to shoot to kill without having to worry if his buddies are waiting for me to do thisnow i have no problem with you coming in and asking first and salvaging if im ok wit but you never do that do yousry for the rant its late and stupid people arguing over something that is boils down to one thing thefti bid you good day unless your a ninja salvager then you can go  yourself
i will say this againyour best bet is approach some of the csm privatly and pay them to support any idea that is not to their exclusive best interesthonestly the reasons against this have been lame and without reasonable excusejust to prove ittake the arguments being used against a better solo exploration vessel and replace all refferance to it with the mobile station and you will see the words of our beloved csm are more aptlazy doesnt even come close to the description think about it they call us lazy cause we dont want to have to travel 30 jumps one way get a differant ship and then move 30 more jumps back to our starting pointbut they want to be able to carry the whole damn station whereever they wantthe csm is a polluted and worthless beast build on the desires of the large subscription blocks and nothing morejust to give another examplebacon had been used by the large alliences for a while once it entered mainstream use ccp said they dont support it and changed the client to keep it from working but they even publicly stated they knew it was being used by the large subscription blocks for some time see the large subscription blocks didnt like eveyone having a level playing fieldnow look at hot boxing ccp says they dont officially approve or support this but they turn around and write code into the client to make it easier to do to make the large subscription blocks happylisten i love exploration but since we are not part of the large subscription base and are actually supporting something the large alliances do not want it aint gonna happenexploration might be the next solo pacifier missions that take longerlook at the drone regions they are still way messed up in exploration but they dont care cause the large alliances dont careand neither will the csmand those who actively dont oppose a craft with solo potential just dont care enough to know anything about itsorry but it is truthi wish it was differantbut its not
please explain how the csm verdictopinion the they are just being lazy is arguable in any context and that may worktill then if it doesnt impact the csm directly then they wont support itmy suggestion to the op is get enough isk together to pay the csm to actually do something other then talk about the lazy explorers who dare to no want to treck 40 jumps back and forth to get a ship that can do the site you just foundoh and eve is a multiplayer game and solo content is frowned on by many of the csmcheck the minutestrust me the isk route is the best bet of getting anything donegood luck
learning skills are a bad idea because they have nothing to do with how well your character performs at anything except training times they arent really optional unless you like taking too long to train skills with a few levels of them youll end up ahead within a couple weeks anyone saying i did it stop whining is just bitter having to train learning skills adds nothing to the game it does not add difficulty its not something they have to work for its just a waiting period at the worst possible time you want to immerse new players as quickly as possible this means letting them play and noticeably advance rather than spending their entire trial waiting to advance just give everyone the equivalent of 55 learning skills no one loses anything most of us gain and would not complain for it on an unrelated note i think a true mentor is probably the worst thing for a new player in eve the learning curve is steep but the mentor is going to try to maximize the efficiency of the new player not the new players ability to enjoy the game sure rushing learning skills is fine if youre making an alt but for a new player its a drudge i think i would have grown bored with eve rapidly if id not discovered things on my own and been told to grind straight into higher missions for isk get this ship train these skills etc instead i trained straight into assault ships and tried to gank a vagabond in my 1m sp rifter in a 3 and had a hell of a lot of fun doing it

the iceland meeting has already taken placethanks for posting
please lock this thread its now really taking the mickey that discussion of meeting 3 is constantly bumped above discussion of recent meetings post iceland when virtually everyone with an interest in the process knows that these early teething issues with the council have been resolved to mutual satisfaction this thread  and others like it  now serve only the interests of trolling and shouldnt be open
thread lockedtopic has become little more than trolling
lockedplease do not crosspost
all of the people in this thread and thousands more have been pretty much crapped on by the csm all they are interested in is their own little games  i will be sure to keep this thread alive and will definitely bring it out when it is time for the next elections serenity steele how interesting and telling is your silence as the other members of the csm who so heartily supported this thread how very telling is their silence well all of you people look at yourselves and start asking questions
some quotes by csm members regarding thisreally please tell me what happened  did horse trading got in the waywhere are you dear friend where is this on the ccp  csm meeting minuteswhen did this happen before or after coffee or was it just whispered about i do not see any information about it in ccp  csm meeting minutes
once again ccp is aware of the issue and it will be addressed sooni think they call that pacifying the crowd
how many of the csm representatives run even one pos i think none veteran players and leaders shun pos management and often paw off the running of them on more singleminded individuals who can handle the mental abuse that it is maintaining and even looking at pieces of this could explain why the pos issue was largely forgotten at the meet
i am the only person in pl or anyone we fought so far to use a black ops on a regular basis in pvp combat  using serena greyskull about 100 kills  so i have more experience then most with this classwhat has been suggested in the topic more fuel jump to covops cyno increase jump distance is without question needed however the issue of range needs to be addressedthe current ship bonus makes most black ops effective in combat only at close range with the exception of the widow  which i fly  and lets face it people dont want to use 700m ships up close even the widow suffers at range because it has jamming bonuss that are only effective at short rangebs are effective at distance anyone stupid enough to set them for close range will get d by hacs and as such black ops should have fits  bonus that allows them to stay with the bs fleetthe widow is a great ship but all my other black ops stay in the hanger and need additional bonussotherwise reduce there costs so other people can afford to use  loose them in up close combat
you make some rather good points therei specifically like the one about teamwork i feel you are right you should never need 3 players to take full advantage of your ship maybe two  carrier  cyno  but three is just way too out there i say this drastically reduce fuel use or use an alternative waxau mentions cap as an alternative which isnt a bad ideabut i also go as far as this remove the second player i dont need a cyno character to make full use of my paladin so why my redeemer allow black ops to jump to any system within range given they have the fuel make them appear in a random spot 1au from the sun or something these two improvements would make players love the blackops ship they could jump into a system execute their plan  killing of a target whatever  and gtfo quickly without the need to have another player there to light the cyno each time then again who am i to speak i dont fly them  but waxau does d   i just wish i can  50 days left o  
i think that this is an important first step i suspect that they will still be weak afterwards as they are weak defensively and offensively and very expensivealso a fan of transport ship being able to be jumped  give it cloaking ability also  like a stealth bomber
yup always thought we needed more logistics support in the hualer sense carries are just to expensive and general for this  ei to little space  id say 100k or so exclusive fuel  but with too muhc offencive power also we need nerf so they dont end up to be the new jf  else that needs a boost  it needed from day one anyway for that price 
i can see some inherent problems such as1 how do you get all your ships out into space how do you get them back into a stationwould you just undock each ship leave the ship dock back up get the next ship etc then finally undock with the tug and lock up each ship and have some sort of tractor module and what would prevent people from jumping in your ship while you are getting them all out of the station2 jumping through stargates how exactly would that work part of the whole idea of ships is that it is in fact enclosed the stuff around you does not follow you to the next system how do you jump 20 ships and a tug at one time kind of defies logic too but whos to say whats logical what with oil instead of outerspacei support a ship that can only carry ships its cargo is huge millions of m3 but it can only hold unpackaged ships it does not require any removal of mods but cargo can only have ammo  to keep from carrying a bunch of extra crap as you can imagine put a cap on ship size nothing larger than a bs when the ship transport blows the ships just pop up in space fully assembled fully fitted  if you choose  just floating some may blow up with the transport some may suffer damage and others will be unscathedthis puts not only a huge risk on transporting but also allows a whole new mechanic imagine the loot you could score however these ships should definitely not be easy to kill  as in no suicide high sec ganking 
youre right i screwed up on the description of what i was aiming for i should have added that this time restriction would apply to 3 or more qued skills that way you could still have a long skill in the que ie finish a short skill and continue in training with the long skill andor train 3 or more short skills up to the time restrictionccps desire needs to be accomodated in this issue and personally i find it to be valid they simply feel that people who log in frequently say once a day are more prone to interact in the game and thus provide a dynamic to the game i think theyre correct and i would also like to see a que of some sort i think its possible to do bothhope thats betterwindjammer
its great that they are hoping for somethingbut the sad reality is a lot of people log in just long enough to switch skillsso as i said whether its every few hours  currently  or every day  your way  or every couple days  my way  logging in to switch cant possibly be considered playing the gameif someone wants to play then theyll play training has no impact on that fleet battles mining parties lp grinding a skill queue of any sort wont impact those activitiesbut sometimes you just want to let a few skills train while you play xbox or something in the meantimethats all im saying if they added a time limited queue especially one that only permits a days worth of training itll hear just as much complaints as the day long jump clone timerjump clones shorterskill queue longer
the other way could be considered as well is settingup skill training for a certain level fe if i have warp drive operation at lvl 2 i would like to have a possibility to set training up to lvl 5 wo need to login
generally this isnt that hard to work around ive been training alot of chars for alot of years while working when at the computer i put on the shorter skills as much as possible and so have a heap of longer skills ready  23 weeks each at least  so i could do an hour or so of a 6 hour skill in six different sessions and put on a longer 14 day skill as i finish playing however i think alot of people are really trying to reduce the impact eve has on their life schedule and its only something i can support as its a more responsible way of dealing with the game having people staying up for an extra hour or some such just so they can finish a skill and get to the next long one is a real issue that people shouldnt be having to deal with we want the game to be fun making it like work isnt especially when things like the api for viewing your skill training go down it might be a little bit easy to make it duration based as you could go to sleep and wake up with 12 lvl 1 skills finished or something silly at least if it was dual training or something like that it would give you a chance to finish the current skill and put a longer one on after that or simply have skills train until their highest level
thisseems to be the simplest and most logicalrealistic thing to do
this tbqfh
the best idea and simplest imho is to allow the training of two skills at one time with the skill points split between them this allows for a long skill to be picked and a shorter ones to be picked as well with the shorter one finishing and then the longer one getting the full time when it is completeanother possible solutionmake skill point generation more generic and automatici select two attributes and they generate skills points that can then be applied to skills that use those two attributeswhile online skill point generation is either at the current normal rate or 15 the current ratewhile offline skill point generation is at the normal rate or 15 less then curernt rateif an account is not active then skill point generation is 25 of the off line ratethe skill point requirements for levels would still be there and based on the rating of the skill but you could save till you have enough for the level or put some in every few daysthis also means you can setup a inactivity timer to disconnect people that just log in and go afk for most of the day 5 min should be good as it stands now someone can log in and stay connected for hours on end with no activity this wastes resources and generates lag
i would love the idea of a skill que thats just 2 skills deep would save me a hell of alot of trouble
the main reason for the current skill trains at the same speed onlineofflineinactive account etc is that the database calls for it are very simpleskill training on skill started at time xthen when checking it simply has to find the time it started and see how much time has elapsed it doesnt have to add points or do anything at a set interval its just a simple time calculation that can be done outside the database if necessary its actually quite brilliant in terms of reducing the load on the database so i imagine a candidate for an extra system would require that it didnt cause more server load dual training is probably the easiest of these as it just makes the calculation a little trickier but doesnt make the information you need to store that much more complicated
i think a skill que would be great i am deploying for a year and will not have access so lining up 12months of skills would be well worth it for me to stay active with eve otherwise i might have stop my subsciption
definitely support this ive never understood why this feature was missing i completely disagree with the fact that logging in to change skill encourages me to play the game i play the game simply because i want to play to the game there are certainly weeks where i just didnt have time to play but had to log in for just long enough to set a skill it didnt tempt me to sit there and play because i simply didnt have time and ive also certainly lost a few weeks worth of training to being on travel for work which is kind of unfair in a time based training system when the whole point is that you skill over time not based on time spent in game grindingedit as for the queue itself i think it should be 510 skills deep theres no reason to limit it based on time i dont buy limiting this curbs macroers who make accounts for mining  selling as most of their life is spent playing this game and its hardly a hurdle to have to log in an account and set a skill when youre sitting in front of the game anyways the only suggestion i would have is to change it so that skills stop progressing when an account expires so as not to be able to take advantage of the system and gain skill for free

a totally different way to look at wardecs is through the eyes of the factions and their agents for example the rulers of caldari would most likely want the corporations operating within their territory to keep the peace and not interfere with trade and stuff by blowing each other up corps breaking the peace by waging war against each other will therefore be punished by lowered standings with caldaris main agents and corporations all based on where the wardeclaring corp has the majority of its offices and where the wartarget has the majority of its offices caldaricaldari would be very bad but caldarigallente would not be as bad  in analogy with the faction wars this would allow for wardecs to be issued as today but would stop the offender from doing it too many times in a row without risking jump clone facilities and such stuff
if they are going to make it harder to war dec they better do something about the corp hopping they need to make it much harder to corp hop
heres a victorylossisk suggestionship values are determined in the game  there are benchmarks ccp uses  see insurance  the payout is always the same by this i mean if i have a megathron and someone else does if we insure our ships it costs us the same and the payout is the same  and for all the other megathrons out there and for every shipso these ships have an isk value that ccp has placed therestarting a war with a corporation could involve a victory condition as stated in the op whereby once a certain or certain sets of scenarios are played out the war is over  won by either side what this is or these are is yet to be determined here is my suggestionthe initiating corporation  the ones that start the war dec  could set a victory condition of 500m isk  for the war to be won 500m isk of ships to isk value of the destructed ships this value is paid down by the initiating corp to concord this is the bondfor each week that goes by without the value being reached the cost for the warp for the starting faction is half the amount of destroyed shipsfor every ship killed the isk value of that ship is paid out of that bond to the pilot of either side  so if the defenders kill one of the attackers they get the isk from the attackers bondexamplethe initiating corp sets a victory condition of 500m isk in the first week they destroy 300m isk of the target corporations ships the cost for the war for the next week will now be 150m iskin that next week they need to kill 200m isk more for the war to be over they could stretch it out longer only by killing less shipsthe defending corp can pay concord the same isk back  whatever the war dec amount is left to pay  to invalidate the warquestionsq1  why 50 of the valuea1  its an arbitrary number i made up it could be any percentageq2  how does this make sense storywisea2  the war dec cost is described in game as a bribe to concord to look the other way so to speak the more ships you kill the more you have to pay but the war will be over soonq3  whats to stop really rich corps from continuously setting 10 billion isk wars on smaller corps which will take a year to be wona3  nothing technically but i cant really see people paying a bond of such a large amount just to shoot some kestralsthe aim behind this is the attackers cant really go around deccing corps of brand new players  they set the bond too high and its not worth it  they set it too low and the war is over quicklythis also allows players who can afford it to pay concord to invalidate the war  after a 24 hour period  i cant see why this isnt logical  you bribe concord to start a war why not bribe them to stop it in this case if the defenders bribe concord then the bond from the attacking corp is paid back to the attacking corp  it wouldnt be lost iskim a suicide ganker right but im not above reproach  i once suicided a new players entire life  his proud 1 hardwirings etc  i thought they were worth more   when i found out his entire badger was worth 20m  hey we all make mistakes  i paid it him back out my own isk because what i had done was not prey on the stupid but the new  and i see that distinctioni also recognise and i think that a lot of people do if theyre being realistic is war decs are screwed entirely in the favour of not just the aggressor but griefers i dont use that word lightlyracketeers are not griefers privateers are not griefers 2 20m sp players deccing literally a corp of 20 people with 1m sp all brand new and dont know what the best mining laser is yet is wrong  its just not fair and this is a game after allsomething needs to be done about it and i think my idea outlined above goes some way towards that its a little rough around the edges and could do with shaping up a bit but i think it could be the basis of something interesting
im sure most of us would love some grand scheme that creates a great deal more depth in the war system im sure something like that is out there but anything grand is going to require a significant amount of development resources take a while to actually deploy and risks disrupting some other things unintentionallyso in the mean time rather than totally reworking the war system or adding many layers of complexity at once what are some small changes that are small improvementsheres one as an example we have a paytogrief system why not add a payforpeace counterbalance if the aggressor pays 10m to wardec the defender can pay 10m to suspend it forcing the aggressor to rebid at 20m and so onno it doesnt solve everything no it doesnt add much depth no it doesnt apply to every situation but its supereasy to implement and has very few sideeffects
to be honest i havent had any issues with the war dec system since the privateers were kicking it large scale at the moment at least any war decs are because people want to hunt my corpalliance and not just because wardecs are cheap and we can just dec everyone and make empire target rich at least this way you have to put some thought into choosing your target thanks though to the privateers all my operations are completely immune to wardecs since having a full time war meant adjusting things to work regardless of the war state instead of just the occasional inconvenience if found the easiest way to stop a war dec is to simply not present targetsalso its actually much much harder for the bigger party in a wardec than the smaller one if you are a small corp and declared by a large one its easy to just not give them easy kills as a small corp fighting a larger one you have more targets and so more oppertunity to score killsyou could go for some kind of target fee  corp a declares corp b  cost is  corp a size  x  corp b size  though sometimes i think that just means people will through as many alts and non active players into their corps to make declaring them more expensiveid suggest maybe making a way to win a war as the defender being to not lose a certain value of ships or win as an attacker by destryoing a certain value maybe the war is over once that value is not reached in a certain time or earlier if reached or some such with the war cost perhaps being related to the value you can destroy   just throwing the idea out havent thought it through fully ignore if it seems silly still im not sure its a broken system maybe the cost needs to move up if its determined to be too cheap if people are willing to pay a good amount to grief a corp i cant see why you cant just make them pay money and not get any kills avoiding death is not that hard if you have a head on your shoulders
a thread of fail for a bunch of pansies
attacker have to risk something otherwqise grief will continue i still suport my command center optionif griefers risk to have their corp disbanded for 1 or 2 months and all members unable to join any corp for about 2 months when a mercenary corporation find and destroy their commander center they will think 2 times before grief someone and declare warall other solution are useless sorryedited we do not need to make war more expensive we need to allow anyone tod efend himself by his own weapons or by paying mercenaries as it is now noobs cannot defend and even if they pay mercenaries they cannot play for patrol 24  24 waiuting thet thet griefers come online
300k would errode market share from jump freighters unless jump freighters also got a boost theyre currently the agile way to move that sized cargo around in empire  ie more agile than a freighter but carrying alot more than a hauler personally id like to see a jumpdriveless rorqual with the ability to carry other ships in the bay aside from haulers  to let people move rigged ships around empire if needed probably with less tanking ability and a slightly faster warp than freighters  though less than a cruiser sized ship 
i like the concept of a larger hauler as it pertains to high sec poss the thing that holds me back from setting one up is all the time it takes to haul fuel for it 150300k space would make it fueling poss a lot easier without the expense of buying a freighterso thumbs upand judging by the comments here i dont see anyone really against the idea
id like to see a big brother to the transport ships with about 10 times the base space with a base around 4000075000 m3 and 10 mediumlow slots the ship would be interesting to haul in assuming you maxed cargo expanders and rigs the hold size might approach but not exceed the racial jump freighterthe lack of ability to fit a freighter makes the ship a known gank target player time spent discussing ship fittings is entertaining without the ability to fit the ship that aspect of the game is lost im also a fan of massive tanks but i suspect most pirates are not in the end the space vs tank issue will need to be balanced right now the freighter tank is too small for the value of cargo it can haul if this ship fits in a similar vein with out the ability to build a powerful tank then the ship will not be well received
sadly the fact is most of us dont trust ccp to make a good system after the discovery of all the problems with the lottery systemi have two thoughts on t2 bpos however both would require considerable effort and probably both would make certain parts of the playerbase mad1  accept that tech ii is the new tech i it has become so plentiful that in reality it is the standard by which things are judged today as such have t2 bpos seeded on the npc market this gives equal access to anyone who wants to buy them  this does not guarantee they can build them to be effective though you need a new level of items tech iii for the inventors to achieve and produce blueprints for for the manufacturers thus this is probably the most intensive programming wise for ccp 2  remove all t2 bpos from the game modify the results from invention such that the chance of success becomes good enough to enable the inventors to take over from the bpo holders
exactly why do you think so nobody have yet to actually make provide a good reason why it would be beneficial
we have to be somewhat realistic here the barn door is open and the cattle goneshutting it wont matter anymore with regards to t2 equipment making invention easier and t2 items more common is happening and they are the new standardespecially as more and more characters are expected to be able to use them due to their volume of spthere are some players that are wealthy beyond all reason because they  years ago  got into the t2 bpo game and have milked it ever since arbitrarily removing their tens of billions of isk investments is quite simply an immoral solution  obviously im not a socialist here dont jack with t2 bposeither adding or subtracting from them just replace them with another tech tier and this time dont make the same mistake of seeding bpos at all everkrum
personally adding specialist rig slots would be nice you have your standard ones for cccs etc but then have specialist rigs for ship class weapon class or whatever
i would emphatically support adding more complexity to industrymanufacture i specialized my character as a scientist and so for the past year was training nothing except skills for invention until our manufacturer was unable to play for a time i trained skills to cover for this in no time manufacturing has to be one of the dullest and simplistic things in eve i understand that si go hand in hand but theres a whole lotta science and a gaping lack of industry in this game anything that gives more ability for manufacturers to affect the outcome of the job is great in my book after all they are the ones building it a great manufactuerer should be able to do more than follow a blueprint precisely she should also be able to add his own touches in some way
i agree that a random lottery  potential for abuse im not aware of anyone that objects to the tech 1 bpo system at some point  before tech 3  ccp should consider adding tech 2 bpos as corporate sold bpos to the market at jaw dropping prices of course at that point invention would need to be ready to switch to tech 3 this is probably a long ways off however since i dont get the sense that ccp is done with tech 2 or ready to up base character entry skill points again
have a bad feeling about this the only reason new industrial skills should be added if there are new industrial things added i really think industrials need to get there own expansion but i think it will never happen because it does not sell to the non eve playing public
here are some more radical ideas change all t2 bpos into bpcs with one years worth of runs and be done with them make t1 production component based as t2 production just with new cheaper components  as already proposed  change rig production to use standard producible t1 and t2 components introduce sized rigs current rig blueprints become cruiser sized existing rigs will not be affected but will be phased out convert all existing salvage into t1 and t2 building components fitting in amount their current value  according to eve world average  salvaging will now produce t1 and t2 components the salvage loot tables get changed accordingly greater amounts of salvage may be available remove t1 loot it will be part of the salvage then in the form of components reduce currently public industry and science slots add standing restricted slots instead in several tiers to allow privileged access only for people that are willing to dedicate the time to gain standing for the corporations add research contracts contractor will give a bpo for a collateral defining certain mepe values and a time frame on accepting the collateral will be put in limbo and the bpo transfered on completion the contract can then be exchanged again for the collateral and the payment for the service failure to finish the job within the given time results in the loss of the collateral but the bpo will remain with the researcher mining will get changed according to my ideas and stuff other people have contributedwell that should be enough food for rabbles now
agreed noone who has put forward this idea has yet explained what ultimate goal they want to achieve by it or why they think this is the right means to use towards that endat the moment its certainly true that a number of the current t2 bpos  especially the less widely used ships  are causing market saturation and driving down some prices to the point where inventors cant compete with them and this could be seen as somewhat unjuston other other hand a lot of people have contributed an enormous amount of time and effort towards purchasing these bpos gambling heavily that they arent going to lose their value and it would be unfair to these people if the field was suddenly levelled the inventors relatively speaking have tiny upfront costsof course if the field is levelled then ultimately noone will ever make more profit than the markets will bear which wont be very much at all id prefer to see a system where people who invest significantly more capital can produce better returns to a much greater and more varied extent than is currently possible via skills and research
 emphasis mine there is a solution to this i suspect it requires a new lowlevel game mechanic so its not a quickfix and i acknowledge that its very counterintuitive but were trying to create a disincentive for something that is by nature very good  a bigger fleet means more friends more firepower etc bombs must do more damage to many targets than they do to few targetsthe defining characteristic of a large group of ships is that there are many ships there are very few other attributes which can be used to balance against them they dont take any longer to warp out they dont take any longer to lock targets they dont get affected more or less by bubbles and so on there are different ways to approach the specific mechanics  and even the rp of it  to illustrate the one that comes immediately to mind is a sort of capacitance discharge device where each bomb consumes half of the remaining capacitor of all the ships in its blast radius to do a proportional amount of damage but the specifics are either beside the point or will be worked out in testing and not really part of this stage of the discussion
either a price reduction or ability boost needed at the moment i dont find the survivability of the ship is an issue when youre pretty much destroying a bomb that costs as much as the ship the issue is that its not all that effective unless you have alot of them at which point their cost effectiveness is ridiculous not many other weapons systems cost so much to use for so little potential effect pretty much all they can destroy easily doesnt cost much  can easily escape in the time theyre given

a market around shares would be realy interestingmy personal thoughtscorporation shares should be only avaibale from npc s corpsthe should be gettable on a realy hard and expensive way which gurantee u a monthly dividende upon the buisness which was done for the corp   tax from trades on there stations mineral refining etc a way for modernindustrial pvp if peoples try to push buisness on stations  npc corporations to get more dividende each monthif u know that your enemie corporation owns shares of station u will not do trades there because u will not make them rich theorie about trustpeoples should be able to found fonds this should be adapted like founding an alliancelike corporation abc investment foundthe founder had to pay a fee of 500 million isks as a base capital into a npc shareholding bankfrom this moment the bank announce that a new fond is avaiable and offers fondssharespa example 1 million shares for 500 isks eachto buy shares from this bank u will need some new  broker skills upon the level u will be able to buy limited numbers of sharesthe npc shareholding bank returns 50 of the incoming money back to the founder of the fond  on a seperate fond wallet the rest stays in linethe founder is able to split the corp tax and can set a special fond tax  limited to 15 examplefonds wallet  250 mio iskscorp tax  100 fond tax  15  from every incoming corp tax goes 15  seperate into the fond wallet monthly incoming 1 bn isks fond wallet 400 mio isks   end of the month shareholding bank wallet   fond capital   500 mio  basecapital to cover the shares   250 mio from the share owners which had buy shares 750 mio isksfond wallet 400 mio isks   350 mio less then the shareholding bank wallet to get a dividende the fond wallet must be minimum 750000001 isksthis isks should be splitted then in a  to raise up the fondbasecapital  a payout  taxupon the raise up of the basecapital the worth of the shares raise up u can sell them to the shareholding bank u had to pay a tax thenif the fond wallet is less then the shareholding wallet the worth of the shares fall downnot realy riskybut as the founder u should be able to ask the shareholders to get a credit on the fond walletto buy a bpo pa examplepa examplethe  fond wallet  750 mio isksu need 280 mio isks for a bc bpo the shareholders vote yesthe founder is able to buy the bpo via this fond wallet and is limited to the 280 mio isksbpos buyed by this wallet are flagged and a part of the fondselling it is only doable via a vote by the shareholders something like this could cover the trust issueif the founder want to buy a carrier from this money and the shareholders vote yes it is there own risk if the carrier is destroeydthe insurance money goes into the fond wallet thenperhaps something like this could be worth think aboutnot perfectbut keep the stone runningbregmac
all other ideas aside lets make the stocks in a corp directly representative of the amount of money in the wallet of the corp so if theres 1000 shares and theres 1000000 isk in the wallet each share is then worth 1000 isk in this way as a corp wallet grows then realistically so does the value of the stocks and thusly if someone wishes to sell his or her stock in the corp there can be an automatic system in place to pay them the value of their stocks out of the corp walletalso in this way the ceo or directors of a corp can never take more money out of the corp wallet than is the value of their stocks thus preventing a corrupt ceo from pilfering 100 of his corps value overnight and leaving everyone else with nothing if a ceo holds on to 100 of the corp stocks then he is still the dictator at the top but as soon as he starts to sell stocks off theres potential for him to loose controlas a side note to encourage ceos to offload more stocks make it so that votes through shares require a 23 majority rather than a 50 majority though this may encourage them to hoard more stocks than offload ah well
what is worse is that jade ran on this as his main issue and won a lot of voteswhile blowing up stations would be cool there is a glaring huge problem with this it is extremely biased towards people who live out of or near npc stations since they cannot be blown up so you sit in curse or whatever and mow down stations with your uber capital blob and blow up enemy stations all while laughing as you dock in risk free npc stations rightderelict mode is interesting but still wholly unneeded
i like the idea of the op  i think if something like that was implemented perhaps stations could deploy guns similar to pos guns but they couldnt be controlled by players theyd work like sentry guns but theyd have the hit points of a pos gun  theyd be destructible and to make a new one would cost x in isk paid by the corp that runs the station a maximum of 6 could be implemented  like in high sec  and theyd have similar firing mods to pos guns  fire on aggression fire on anyone less than 1 etc
sounds interesting there should be a penalty however like the person raiding it doesnt get anything so if you built an outpost you cant use this as a method to get some of your resources back
would it be viable to have a long term decommissioning system something like the magic button is pressed and an evemail is relayed to all players having anything at all in the station containing information of abc station is being decommissioned as of xx day xx month please remove your equipment from here  insert more rp fill here  id suggest the timer be several months as that gives people time to remove remaining items but also feels realistic from an rp point of view to pack up a station as per another idea stated here itd be nice to have it sit in space still so that someday if someone decided to they could bring the goods and people repair it reinstall modules and get it operating again itd also serve as a nice relic my thoughts
im with ccp on there being way too many issues with destroying an outpost disabling all the services maybe for a cost rather than time to repair might be worth doing but the officeshangarsfacilities etc pretty much have to remain therei cant really see though that this is all that much different from today where poss are destructible and are require to hold the station the same thing essentially  isk  is on the line when you have an outpost i think this mainly comes from people that dont want the outpost but they dont want anyone else to ever have it either this isnt likely to happen you would always have squatters and removing something as large as an outpost shouldnt be possible
i like this idea
there is a possible impact you are all forgetting about and that is ambulation just how far reaching will ambulation be will it extend to outposts if so what happens to the potential business you have therejust a interesting aside to the topic at hand
speaking as a victim of an outpost ousting a mere 4 days after construction was complete i take offense to this suggestion that its too hard its all fine to make removal easier til youre the alliance being removed
i do not agree with making outposts destroyable that would seriously discouarge people from venturing into 00 there are enough destroyable assests in eve and i do not support including outposts to that list people work hard to get the standings and assets to even have an outpost and if you want to run people out of this game make it where all their hard work goes down the drain with their homes being destoryed not to mention all their corp assests and ships i admire these corps that have worked together to aquire an outpost and to sustain it i do not want to see that be threathened in anywayin my opinion this would undo a lot of work ccp has put into getting people out into 00
dont make an assumption  like npcs would be weak  and then reject the notion outright because of that assumption its disingenuous and suggests that youre disagreeing for the sake of being disagreeable if you sit back and think through this a bit more carefully what youre suggesting is completely compatible with the use of alliancebuilt npcresponse forcesnow although responding to this issue seems to assume that i accept some of the conflations youve made between faction warfare mechanics and the wackamole issue that i dont accept i will proceed to address the issue of wackamole that you seem to want to ignore outright and suggest that what youre suggesting assumes and embraces exactly the issue im warning againstpeople will respond to to capture points getting flipped you even state that it will happen you both assume and want it to happen you just think that people will ignore it for a bit even if thats the case it still becomes an issue of wackamole so whether or not you presume that alliances will feel threatened by the first flagflip or if it will take 50  or higher  of flags to flip you still end up in the same situation ive suggested is problematic and am warning against people will not want to get bottled in anywhere the wont want to have their tactical options minimized and more importantly they wont want to allow their enemy to have a morale boost from taking capture points you also seem to forget that most alliances now hold more than one constellation so youre looking at wackamole across entire regions  and in some cases multiple regions  as attackers will pinball around trying to annoy region holders by flipping capture points theres nothing good about creating a system that makes the most viable capture tactic to annoy people or puts an undo amount of tactical advantage into the hands of the attackers the whole point im trying to make is that you need a system that is fun for both the attacker and the defender having alliancebuilt npc responders is perfectly compatible with the conception of sov mechanics that youre suggesting  its flawed but thats not what im taking issue with  and it helps to reduce the strain on defenders by ensuring that attackers need to arrive with some weightofforce to activate whatever sovflipping mechanic is implimented and that mounting a playermaned defense has purpose use and value it helps ensure that your opponent is serious enough to warrant a response
a  you dont get to build an empireb  you have to babysit systems all the time to stop them getting capped or contested one guy in a rapier at 3am should not be able to double your fuel bill for however longremember fw is meant to be pvp lite where anyone can jump in and form a random gang from members of their militia id like to think 00 is a little deeper than glorified capture the flag
00 and sovereignty should be a game unto itself the game should be settlement explotation and controlsettlement buildings to build up the npc work force this decreases the labor costs and maintaince of other structuresdefense structures these are turrents and control towers and what have you that allow you to defend your territory when people sleep or atleast put some kind of defense out there while your not onlineproduction structures these actual harvest the minerals and resources and refine them into usable products by the other buildings and goods that can be used by the npcs this should include food production fuels manufacturing refining general production research ectsystems with planets should allow for eventual terraforming of the planet which would increase your npc populationthe npc population should be the factor that determines sovereignty the higher the population the greater the sovereigntydestroying either from a full out war or a steady system of raids on a system would lower the npc populationregular patrols would increase system secruity and allow for protection of the populationthis should be the game of empire building you move into one system and change it then spread out
i have some ideas one of the major problems with sovereignty now is the ability to pos spam an alliance out of the system and the need for alliances to thus have many many pos its cumbersome and not fun for either the defender or attacker what i propose is a system that works as suchalliances may only have 1 small pos 1 medium pos and 1 large pos claiming sovereignty in a system  players may have as many pos as they want in the system just only these three claiming sov to claim sovereignty players must first place a small pos and claim soverignty for x days to achieve level 1 to achieve level 2 players must then place a medium tower and claim sovereignty for x days and the same for level 3 must place a large and claim sovereignty for x days and now we implement ccps want for escalating eventsthese three sov towers would be linked by the game and use seperate gameplay mechanics than the current pos destruction mechanics players must attack star bases in an escalating fashion starting with the small pos then the medium then large medium and large sov towers could not be attacked until the small tower has been put into reinforced a reinforced pos tower does not rely on the strontium mechanic used today instead it simply puts the tower in reinforced mode for x hours during this time the attackers can attack the medium tower the attacking force must put the medium tower into reinforced within this timeframe if they do not the small tower will come out of reinforced meaning the attack failed and must start over should the medium tower be put in reinforced successfully the timeframe is extended and the attacking force may assault the large sov tower when the large is put into reinforced a 2448 hour grace period is given to the defenders and then those towers come out of reinforced and can be destroyed by the attackersonce destroyed the attackers may place a small tower in system and begin the sovereignty processmechanics should be introduced to ensure that a 200 bs  andor capital  fleet doesnt show up and rip through mechanics intended for smaller shipsfleets small ships should be shooting the small towers bs for medium towers capitals for large pos weapon loadout andor mechanics such as those in empire complexes that restrict ships should be used so what if theres only a level 1 soverignty system that an alliance wants to take over the process is the same but the grace period starts when the highest level sov tower is put into reinforced after the grace period the tower can be destroyed i realize this is only a rough outline but one can see the benefits from such a system it eliminates pos spamming reduces logistical upkeep for alliances adds escalating events and makes sense
is that responding to my suggestion  this is zarch on an alt one guy in a severely crippled  1000mw used on a high slot doesnt leave much on a recon  rapier sat uncloaked and unable to move with a beacon up in systemdoes sound like much of a threat to me even a single tech 1 cruiser coming into system could kill him unless he had backup
i completely disagree with number 2  and if you really want to lock the goons out jut set a decent standings requirement  but point 1 is interesting why do people care so much about thatpeople inside alliances can already shoot each other if they want to if an alliance cant manage internal discipline thats their problem
not supported
im not sure how to go about this so ill do the best i canin the time ive been playing eve ive noticed one glaring thing thats always bothered me despite the third bloodlines  being khanid vherokior achura and jinmei  having been released over two years ago we have almost zero prime fiction concerning the societies of these groups the khanid being the exception as they had prime fiction during beta i believei am asking that the issue be raised with ccp so that we may have a more full view of the eve universe and its inhabitants in particular i find it very hard to roleplay a vherokior without really knowing anything about vherokior society we have the corp description  vherokior tribe  the information from character creation and the description in the information panel of the race the jinmei and the achurans have even less then this lacking an npc corporation with their namesedit i would also like to extend this topic to all societies within the eve universe that have been underrepresented by the prime fictionthankyou for reviewing this
i support this also add something about the udorians  tashmurkon  and the ealurians  mysterious race mentioned on the amarr timeline  as well
im for an all out genocide ending the availability to create more characters of these additional races selling out to cater to the highly xenophobic asian market was a mistake to begin with you can make the races we started with look asian enough if you trywhere are the blonds whitehaired skanks doesnt counthow about it ccp push the pc envelop off the table and make it a real racewar
i dont know if there is any jinmei pf at all aside from the info at character creation    im pretty sure i havent seen any at any rate the achurans actually do have some pf from missions though i dont know how much some of the rp community has done a great job in building upon what little there is and inventing stuff that seems to fit  i would hope that ccp incorporates much of their work if they expand the official pf actually in general id like to see official stories incorporate ideas that the rp community has developedin any event while it is sometimes nice to not have ones race be completely described and thus have some freedom in how you depict them and that goes along with the philosophy of eve being a sandbox it certainly would be nice to have at least a little more info about some of the races both playable and not  with priority being given to the playable races that dont have much existing background 
illegal items can be transferred by placing a want items contract but can not be be put on a regular contract for someone to collect i bugged reported this but it transpires this is an intended feature id love to know exactly what this achieves except an inconvenience and no logical explanation how this would fit in with the back story
heres some suggestions1  get rid of freeform contractsi have scammed before but never using freeform  because no one uses them only scammers use them theres very few genuine freeform contracts out there it was a good idea to have them implemented but theyre just not used at all the only reason to have them is to scam  and no one falls for them so just get rid of them  useless game mechanic2  lower the tax on public contractsits far too high  on the market when people pvp there with the 001 isk wars or buyout out stock etc the taxes can be lowered through skills the contracts system is annoying in that if i set the value of a contract and then someone sets one up 100m cheaper to make my sale i have to then reduce mine  losing the expensive taxes  on items over 200m it becomes very noticable  and downpayment and then having the expense of setting up a new contract  this can end up wiping 1050 million isk off the value or perhaps profit of an itemi agree there should be isk sinks but perhaps some skills that can reduce them like with the market or just reduce them to 25 of their current values or something  its just too expensive at the moment why do you think people sit there in jita linking an item and going convo me  its so they can set up a private item exchange which doesnt come with those taxes and feesperhaps a small side effect would be in jita where people would just link contracts more and have less convos  slightly less lag i dont know  it might help  thought id mention that
thanks for the wish of luck cant hurt to try and i still have hopes this might workwindjammer
i completely agree with the above service and or suggestion
1 for drone obedience1 for removal of drone collision detection
the issue i see here is that poss are destructible even in highsec and benefits like this is what i see the advantage of being in a corp is over an npc corp  you can have poss but they can also be destroyed by competitors etc  i think it would be tough to sell an asset like this that couldnt be destroyed or risked etc given all the advantages it has over npc facilitiestbh im dissapointed that such improvments are not on the cards for pos labs as they as well as the entire corphangarpos permission system is in dire need of an overhaul of course this is a significan thing with heaps of coding and testing time required so i can tell why they want to ingore it but its still something that should be done
perhaps u should be able to sabotage this kind of manufactory upgrades  if u are at war with them pa example his service will be shown in front of the station like the station services in 00 otherwise i would see the only chance to get in this similar to poses with ambulation and addid the possibilty to sabotage things like thisu could try also let players think about twice getting this if the monthly tax needs a good booking on this slots every day the slot isnt rent  a hell deep  into the walletreinstalling such a manufactory should be expensive toobecause all the garbage u left behind eeds a special transport bregmac
re players are both profit and pleasureseeking to balance the different secstatus areas make asteroid belts  agents quality dynamic doing this will correct the current imbalance between risk and reward for lowsec as the value of lowsec will keep on climbing until people finally say its worth the reward of pulling up their roots and moving somewhere new  whether it be from highsec or npc 00 if it comes down to it let mining ospreys in lowsec earn the iskhour of a highsec hulk if you have to and caracals running level 2s earn the equivalent of a raven doing the ridiculously popular level 4s of highsec remove the payment scale thats based on security statusquality and replace it with one based entirely on frequency of use let it vary enough so that nomadism is rewarded hoped benefits no more laggy mission hubs because massing reduces the value of an area steadily distribution of markets is encouraged as players spread into previously low population areas thus indirectly reducing market hub lag increased motivation for carebears to risk pvp as the reward of lowsec can finally scale to meet the perceived risk increased socialisation as people seek to reduce risks from missionrunning  mining in lowsec  lots more people pve in lowsec puts the isk back into risk buddaching expected costs hardcore carebears in pvesaturated areas might feel quite unhappy about having their income cut a lot jumpclone corp availability reduces as far more people use a variety of agents when seeking maximum returns for their missionrunning time some npc 00 space can become worth less than lowsec space  some might think thats wrong but if youre strong enough to live in 00 you should be strong enough to lead small gangs into lowsec for profit
the problem is in some regards that we have a dynamic player base stuck in a static worldthe world needs to be more dynamicif the markets are used alot in a system and the stations and agents and there are alot of people in that area then law and order as it is should come to the area pushing out the outlaws and the lawless to areas less usedif an area is not used much then law and order leaves that areaalso as an area is used more the resources of that area lessen and as an area is used less the resources increaseby setting up a more dynamic world that changes based on the population in the area you start to spread folks out a bit more as such areas take on a secruity rating based on the populations secruity ratings and so the secruity in an area that is high in lawful population grows till it hits the 10 capbut the secruity of a system that see little in the way of stable lawful population decreasestie in the resources and payouts by the agents and you have a system that rewards moving around every so often but also can help those that dont like change to find thier own homes as well
so youre saying that a isk farmer hub likesay ingunn could be taken to 10 sec because they spam local with well over 100 bots doesnt seem so good because ingunn once a 03 system now is 10 so those isk farmers will multiplyand do you really want more isk farmers really
terrible idea eve definetly dont need to be even more npc controlled
how would they farm the isk in that system once it becomes a 10 sorry have not been to the system so not sure how they are farming the isk in it but the payouts for any farming of any type would decrease not increase with more secruity
im almost inclined to believe that low sec needs to be a mid way between 00the best way i can think of doing this is the following  though im sure ill get flamed to hell and back for this p 1  remove sec pentalies for killing in low sec2  put concord  or some other npc type police force  at the gate so that within 200km etc of a gate it is like 05 but the concord does not chase you if you run away or maybe you cant run away i dont know yetall i am suggesting is while low sec travel should be safer that it is now because low sec is low security the bowels of low sec systems should be lawless it would explain how concord cant guarantee your safety there it can but only at the gates youll see a lot more trafic and the low sec mission hubs could be frequented more
for those of you that say npc corps are partly to blame im doing a shameless bump of this thread
i bolded it i want to talk to the ccp who believes suicide ganking is too biased csm members can also try to come out of their hole and explain this as wellthere is a bunch of good ideas that may come from this but i am worried about ccp is doing a 180 on a game mechanic that has been in eve for as long as the game has been in existance as far as i know
as a pilot of a more mature age i resent the fact that reckless newly licensed rich kids push the insurance premiums up for the rest of usin all seriousness i have nothing against suicide ganking but i find the fact that an insurance company would repeatedly continue to insure is out of character with the game if you repeatedly have your ships blown up in any circumstance then you should expect to pay higher rates as you are a bigger risk to the insurers this would also affect careless victims of suicide gankers who loose their ships also
yes to reduced or no insurance why would anyone want to insure youyes to transferable kill rights fun for both sidesno to any concord buffsno to increased secs hitsyes to being expelled from the university
this seems more like a 3 faceted issue to me to help with all 3 id be willing to go with revoking insurance for anyone who suicide ganks increasing the sec hit is a bad idea though it took me over 2 weeks to work off the hit from only 3 or 4 suicide kills  not everyone plays eve 247 and has easy access to 00 1 freighter ganking this could easily be solved by reducing the base cargo space of freighters by maybe 50 to 70 give them some midlowrig slots and increase their velocity just need to make sure that their cargo space fully fit with the best cargo expanders and cargo optimization rigs is the same as their current cargo capacity this gives freighters many more choices  such as adding a tank  and addresses the midsized freighter topic it is very lame to have a ship that cannot be configured in any way whatsoever2 miner ganking start with the removal of insurance and see how it goes what about having a rentacop option available at stations and have the cop protect you while you mine the cop will not follow you through gates use this to make up for the lack of gate guns3 indytransport gankingremoving insurance for suiciding is plenty here it will raise the barrier to entry enough as is theres plenty of people flying around in afk industrials loaded with cargo expanders cargo optimization rigs and sometimes with more loot than i would carry in either of my freighters if people dont bother to put much work into protecting their assets then i wont have much sympathy for themif people are allowed to fly afk in 500k indys carrying billions of isk then mission runners should start complaining because they cant run missions while afk with nothing but cargo modules without worrying about losing their ships
do you know why insurance was introduced to the game it was not based on rl analagies let me assure you unless our ccp economist is soundly asleep or passed out under a desk somewhere you would think that he would have pulled it along time ago if the insurance was hurting the economy of eve or wrong but hey i just enjoy logging in to a game where i do not have to deal with rl like insurance companies sending me bills for my kids cars and i would be slightly shocked if they had a ploicy for a rifter
i seem to remember coping fine before insurance was introduced into the game please enlighten me further
you would not have coped it with to long maybe what several monthsit was to stimulate pvp game play and feed the bears players were ing about the fact they had to spend a week or more just to replace the one they lostn00bs were leaving 00 was failing it was not very fun for the casual gamer that could not spend 237 to put together enough funds to get them back on the field time to isk ratio was upside down the eve economy was sucking assthe problem is that everyone is trying to link some rl analogies to game play who fn cares is a god damned video game if you want rl go to work pay the bills mow the lawn and kick your dogthe question we should be asking is if messing with or removing insurance right now what will it do to the game play and the economy overall how many players would it effect negativelydo we have the economy where we need it to ween our selves off of the insurance pacifier what is the prostective long term effect how will it effect pvpand who is qualified to determine that
i hope this gets read somewherei am a suicide ganker  i do this  so keep that in mind when i say what i do belowi think that insurance for a ship that is killed by concord during a suicide gank should be removedhow can you tell if its a suicide gank or an honest mistakesimply set the insurance to not pay out if a ship was killed in the last 30 seconds in high secwhat this means is if someone accidentally fires on another in a mission or a new player not knowing the rules  theyre not going to kill a ship before concord shows up  certainly not very easily since in order to kill someone before concord arrives you have to be properly set up to do just that  then the target doesnt die insurance is paidif the target dies before concord show up this is incredibly likely to be a suicide gank  no insurancesuicide ganks would still happen  but it wont be for the 20100 million that people do sometimes now itd be for much higher targetsim in favour of suicide ganking being in the game  no where should be safe  but right now i feel its too easy and too cheap to do it means brutix wont go after a badger ii with 30m isk of stuff in it and it means that to gank a mission runner would still require 610 battleships but itd end up costing literally 6001 billion to do freighters even more  so it doesnt become worth it to do lower targetsthis preserves suicide ganking in the game but increases the penaltiesperhaps combined with other ideas  increased sec status hit or faction standing loss to the empire you did it in
eh a few comments on whats been said since last i logged in these are mostly repeats of things ive already said but the opposition is still using the same stupid arguments so ill point out why they are wrong  again1  jihad swarm caused the problem they are the reason this happened anyone who cant see that  ki an  is intentionally in denial you point it out to him time and again and he just blathers on ignoring the facts blandly stating that his opponents are wrong when hes the one who doesnt have a leg to stand on look at his replies when he has to supply details to his arguments all garbadge  see 5 below  2  real life is a touch stone that works very well in keeping games from becoming unbalanced reality is inherently balanced you dont want things to realistic or the game would turn into work  but people who say that reality has no bearing on a computer game are just ignorant3  an example of this is lloyds of london  which provides insurance to such as ships sailing in harms way and has done so for hundreds of years the problem with insurance in this game is that it doesnt mimic real life practices closely enough if it did it would solve a lot of problems see my earlier post on this for more details4  suicide ganking is not excused by claiming it is needed as part of war decs it is a criminal action in this game and war decs arent if you were just suiciding those ships supplying your opponents there might be an argument but thats not whats being done do the gankers even know that the person theyre ganking is supplying their opponent  or are they just ganking anyone who comes along that looks like a good target and  so what if their enemies are supplying their stations with neutral shipping this is balanced since both sides can do it there is no need and no justification for indescriminate suicide ganking to support a war dec talk about cop outs mostly suicide ganking is done for fun and profit with no relationship to war decs that is nothing but a red herring5  cnrs are not getting blown up left right and center by accidentally shooting people in high sec thats just absurd there are game mechanics in place to keep that from happening and if they fail to prevent it  then thats a bug that should be fixed  not an excuse not to remove insurance payments to suicide gankers all you have to do to discriminate between accidents and intent is  not pay the insurance if they blow someone up if they just shoot someone by accident and then stop  they are very unlikely to kill them6  also as i said before the insurance systems as a whole needs to be revamped if you had adjustable rates based on ship loss and if t2 ships could be fully insured including modules then the fact that someone in a t2 ship got ganked wouldnt be as big a problem as it is it is quite frankly unfair that the person commiting the criminal act can make a profit from the insurance while the person being victimized is not fairly compensated for their loss both the removal of insurace payments for criminal acts and fair compensation for their victims are needed to redress this flaw in the game mechanics7  the problem with suicide ganking is that it is something that can be casually and cheaply done  and it shouldnt be if youre going to commit a criminal act to get some one  you should have to think about it more and pay a lot higher penalty than you do now if it was a strategic act as part of a larger war effort then having it cost a lot more than it does now would be worth it but it isnt its just a way to have fun and make money while taking advantage of a hole in the game mechanics to do so8  the gankers have not debunked or answered anything all theyve done is to present the same lies and distortions they always did
9  and no this will not stop suicide ganking it will just make the penalties a little stiffer for doing it it wont stop someone from doing it  it will just make them think a little bit harder before hand10  all of the pirate arguments against increased penalties for suicide ganking in this thread are nothing but pirate whining yeah care bears whine about getting killed but the pirates whine more  when their ox is the one getting gored the reason you dont see more pirate whining than you do  is because the game is already slanted so much in favor of the pirates look at the fact that youve only got 15 minutes to retaliate against them a fifteen minute statute of limitations on robbery  now that is absurd what was it some pirate whiner said about concord that it was an omnipotent police force yeah right in high sec what about the rest of new eden there is no concord presence in most systems and yet  that isnt good enough for the pirates  no theyve got to be able to suicide gank people in high sec and get paid by the insurance company to do it11  the biggest whiners in all online games are always the sniveling cowards who like to pick on people weaker than they are and  then  blame the victim instead of at least taking pride in being the criminals they are if they had any pride theyd be taking on equals instead of bullying new players and war deccing weaker corporations because they were insulted
when game mechanics utterly fail to map to real world concepts it becomes impossible to suspend disbelief you are no longer flying a pod in eve but feeling frustrated at some messed up game mechanic in a computer gamethe people who want suicide ganking seem to have an incredibly myopic viewpoint the idea that there is some insurance company that happily pays out when you deliberately destroy your ship in an act of piracy is just nuts the idea that concord happily sits around and indeed protects you as you loot the wreckage of a friends suicide attack is just nutssure  lets keep high sec somewhat dangerous suicide ganking and can flipping though are just plain stupid explain how it works to someone and they are just left with the opinion that eve is badly designed it is just obviously an abuse of game mechanics that the developers have been unable to fix for fear of making other things worse it makes eve appear to have a fatally flawed designso fix the insurance system and make profiting from suicide attacks nearly impossible keeping high sec dangerous is a different issuepiracy still occurs on todays seas and is still profitable for the people doing it it would be in eve too if concord where not so omniscient perhaps instead of concord knowing exactly who is the aggressor as soon as a shot is fired they only become aware of this when they arrive on grid a well orchestrated pirate op would then be to find a target far enough away from concord and to pop it loot it and warp out before concord has a chance to respond
i agree and dont when things are going their way the hardcore gamers only play defense on the forums which is easy because all they have to say is prove it the normal happy casual gamers will never visit the forums because what goes on there is not worth their time then there is those like me that have a job that says when  is really bad in the world your working so i spend a lot of time on the forums at work because i cant play at workjust kick players out of the safe npc corps and put them into some kind of war dec or pvp corp so that they can be killed and you solve a hell of a lot of problems
some nice circular logic has been added to this thread since i left there is a problem since this thread exists yeah rightanyway im gonna ask you wrangler again to please get whomever in ccp that has agreed that there is a problem with suicide gankings to this thread if as you say ccp has nothing to do with this thread and its all csm please say so before a lot of people get their hopes up for nothing
you are suggesting reward without risk a proposition which completely destroys the foundations eve was built on exhumer pilots must not be allowed to profit in guarenteed safety  the end result will be all the legitimate players getting driven out of the economy by isk resellers macroing huge fleets of mackinawsthe reality is that current game mechanics support numerous methods of protecting yourself already jihadists like myself are easily avoided andor defeated using the existing game mechanics if it was up to me the only change that would be made is a 50100 increase in freighter hp but i fully expect insurance to be disconinued at some pointthe problem with that particular solution though is that it will only encourage me
but they arent going to do that any more than they are going to make factional warfare mandatoryfor me  i came here from planetside where it was nothing but factional warfare there was no mining or manufacturing or trading it was a pure unadulterated shooter and when i read that eve was going to have factional warfare  the all out conflgrations that went on across the ps servers 724 were what i expectedwhat i got was corporate squabblingok  so i adjustedi personally would love it if we went to the type of mandatory all out factional warfare that i expected when i came here  but that isnt going to happen eithershrug
was a lot harder to make isk then than is it today which is why i think insurance should be dynamicyes but the line has to be drawn somewhere and that line will naturally move over time as the game develops and the community too i agree with you here these are all important questions to be asked before such a bold move was taken
as always  wrongthe thread is proof that a problem is perceived to exist by a lot of people you just dont happen to agree with themthey all happen to think theres a problem  specifically because jihad swarm created onebefore jihad swarm  you did not have all these miners worried about suicide gankers now you do and the sentences are separated to emphasize a point well now see if you get a responsefor one thing  ill tell you that ccp does have something to do with csm they are taking notice of it they publicized its meeting and they posted the minutesif you can get a ccp representative to state that they went through all that trouble to publicize something theyve no real interest in supporting thus undercutting csm completely  that would be very interestingyeah one way or the other  id like to hear about that toowell see if we do
for s sake try to use your head for once before responding just because some people believe there to be a problem that does not mean there actually is one that was my point im not surprised you missed it eve isnt a democracy just because there appears to be a lot of empire miners and mission runners who never actually plays the full game that are whining in this and other threads that doesnt mean ccp has to do something about it after all the people whining are the same people who refuse to take any protective measures and insist on flying their multibillion isk ships while watching ing desperate house wifes seriously do you want the game balanced by those people i dont i think theyre ing embarrasingly stupidso id say a bunch of them believe in elves and trolls too that doesnt mean those existare you new or something the whines about suicide ganking has existed as long as suicide ganking itself jihadswarm had nothing to do with it its pretty annoying just sayingccp arranged for the csm to be set up they have no influence over what stupid ideas the csm might put forward you will notice that ccp doesnt have to do a thing the csm says nice strawman
ha ha yeah at first i was gonna say bs  i mean  you wrote it so its probably was  but  then i looked at it and  yeah that is what i intended to do of course  i made it fairly obvious its not like i was trying to fool anyone the point being that you are asking a ccp rep to publicly state that they were just bsing us about supporting csm  which  yeah i really would just love to see in print that would be funny as hell good luck with thatnow  ive emphasized the parts that would lead us  those who disagree with you  to believe that ccp had something to do with this and erased those comments specifically attributed to csm repsnow here is i assume the point of your assertion that wrangler was stepping away from the statement to me  this sounds noncommital  as in ive got a lot of things to do and am not going to take the time to give you an answer note the smilely with the sun glassesnow  not surprisingly  you have leaped to the conclusion that ccp doesnt support this  when wrangler didnt say that the fact of the matter is  he refused to comment  which could mean anything  and thus means nothingbut the statements written by csm are very specific as to what ccp is going to do are they lying they arent mincing words up there they are specifically stating ccp is going to do this and ccp is going to do thatshruganyway well see what happens  but we probably arent going to see for several months as it will take them that long to get the code done and most of the developers ive seen dont really tell you what they are really going to do until they are ready to release the codethey make up their mindsthey code itwe get to live with itah the servers are back up toodles
i definately support the idea of consequences for actions sechit on a slide based on the system sec status seems an excellent idea look we told you it was dangerous and we cant be everywheretradeable killrights would definately be awesome especially in conjunction with other ideas such as involving mercenaries in wardecs it would allow for a serious market in that area secstatus hit based on sec status of victim is also an idea i support and its simply realistic if you attack a citizen in good standing it is likely to be a worse offense than if you attack the dread pirate robertsas for game balance that is a discussion that i have to gracefully bow out of i wont pretend to have done nearly enough research
yup kill off insurance works for me
i watched a hauler get suicided in jita last night t1 ship outside the station where 65 of all good change handsi convod the person out of curiosity the mammoth has plain vanilla t1 expanders on it and was carrying construction parts total loss of ship and all fittings cargo etc less than 10 million isk the suiciding ship was a raven it didnt even bother to scan firstcombined with the attempt on me while i was flying an af carrying 8 million in datacores  which failed btw  that alone tells me that something is seriously borked in the system
i knew that  would have some really bad ideas for evego play the movies and ask the devs to create a drivearoundwithcarssoitlooksextraidioticaddon oh and dont forget to tell them to remove the trees so you cant crash
speaking of which maybe we should add followthrough to ammo so that when you shoot someone in the undock port of a station and miss the station guns respond as if you had shot the station  which you should have done actually making suiciding cost the ganker something is not the same thing as training wheels
i am not suggesting anything i am stating there is not enough risk to suicide gankers relative to their reward when these changes are implemented it will not make 07 sec or any other high sec a place of guaranteed safety eve has no such place nor should it want to suicide a hulk or mackinaw in high sec want to have that fun pay for it grieferbefore your jihadswarm and before ice was removed from 08 sec space there were fleets of mackinaw that were destroyed in 08 all it took was a single raven with high racks stuffed with smart bombs one raven could take out 4 or more mackinaw before being hit by concord the reward for such a deed was high but so was the price paid by the suicider and you know what i didnt hear one complaint against it in fact i saw people  miners too  wanting to fund such people in their effort because when mackinaw grouped like that allowed the slow moving raven to manuever in place like that it was almost always macroers who were being killed and everyone liked that the reality is that current game mechanics make it impossible for a solo miner in lower high sec  05 to 07  to protect themselves or even run in any practical fashion from a solo suicider thats what makes it so much fun for you griefers attacking someone who cant fight back or avoid you that and the fact you do not pay a price for destroying a t2 shipim pleased youll be encouragedi really am knowing youre paying a higher price will bring a glow to my heart lets just see how much more we can encourage youwindjammer
tell mein that reality you live inare there unicorns space unicorns the original post of this thread could not be clearer ccp has set up a task force they have identified short term mid term and long term goals and spelled out clearly what these goals are youre living in a fantasy world if you think this isnt a done dealkindest regards to a troubled soulwindjammerps yeaha lot of smileys today cant help it im just in a good mood must be all this rat whining nothing like a good whine from a rat to put me in a good mood
while not directly doing anything to the gankers perhaps some focus should be placed on the victims of high sec gankings i was thinking something along the lines of concord ships mounting remote repair systems for shields and armor so that when they arrive they can immediately begin to assist the victims ship and still attack the agressorsi realize that the ganker solution to this will be to bring more ships but then as they bring more ships more concord will show up and remote repair the victim s  this still makes high sec gankings possible but the larger ships with more hitpoints would not die so quickly and might even stand a chance of survival
dont worry isk isnt something ive had to worry about in a while the problem is that there needs to be some kind of balance here isksecstatus are just functions of played so the real question is how long should i have to play to recover from one suicide gank if that number gets to high suicide ganking grinds to a halt a result that doesnt actually benefit anyone  macros will drive down your profits and they are the bulk of the jihads victims this could not be more false it is trivial to avoid 99 of highsec suicide attacks nothing i do approaches even 5 of the speed or sophistication with which roaming gangs attack in nullsec and yet thousands of players manage to ratmine in 00 systems every day without getting ganked just because you and the thousands of highsec miners like you dont understand the first thing about how to avoid hostile players doesnt mean its impossible to defend yourselfafk mining is not and shouldnt be a supported playstyle if you are sitting at your computer and paying attention i am easy to avoid if youre just checking your hulk once every halfhour to warp to the station and empty your cargohold you really should be a sitting duck out there in that ice belt if youre willing to take that risk fine  just dont complain about how evil and unbalanced suicide ganking is when youve taken absolutely zero precautions to protect your ship
lolccp has told the csm they are setting up a task force to see if theres a problem and if there is how to resolve it that does not mean all the suggestions or any of them for that matter in the op are going to come through it just means ccp is taking a look i have now several times asked the devs mentioned in the op as realising suicide ganking is too easy to come in this thread and explain why they feel that way the only response has been from wrangler  not directly to my request  where he quite clearly distanced himself from what was written in the op im interpreting this as ccp not really knowing how to deal with this one and i dont blame them if they cave in to the whines and change suicide ganking too much they are setting a precedent that the game is shrugging its hardcore mantle and opting for a more fluffy main stream angle this is a dangerous move
i agree with most of what you say not that it really matters if i agree or not but the simple fact is there is already poscapitalmothership battles in fw they just havent reached blob stage yet some of the corps have the ability to capital blob there just hasnt been a reason to do soseveral times we have had carriers hot dropped on us and we have returned the favormy whole point in my post was that ccp needs to do something to stem the outside influences though i fear nothing will be done as jade seems to think hisher word is law which has been proved in this thread several times i guess the power trip is now active and in overdrive what next jade when someone opposes you are you going to kill them repeatedly until they buckle maybe just strong arm their corp under a constant wardeck until you get your way and can stop cryingfor example who gives two shakes what you think your here to represent the people the proper way to say that without sounding like you have a big head would have been the pro is because many players notice no i this or i that you seem to think what you want matters i seem to think what the players want matters and not what you want i also think you need to go back to tact schoolin your position everyones opinions should matter and you should be open to discuss them last time i checked this was eve online not jericho online
what about letting an alliance join fw but the condition is that they are unable to claim soverignty anywhere in game if they are part of a faction
see thats your opnion youre pushing the opnions of six people as the majority when they are merely six people whos views on a range of subject coincide with about 02 of the eve population each the csm exists to bring issues to the attention of ccp the csm does not decide how the game should be run if people thought the csm had anywhere remotely near that kind of power alot more people would have voted instead of the paltry turnout achieved because people saw it only as a forum for voicing grievances not for electing someone to maintain the status quodont get me wrong i fully support that an issue like this is brought to ccps attention and they hear what everyone has to say not just the members of the csm what i do like about this game is that generally ccp do listen to what all players have to say and id hate to see that changed just because the csm exists its supposed to be a tool for getting ccp to give more attention to the playerbase not lesssuch a statement is a disgusting thing to say from someone who is listen to the views of others it doesnt matter that someones view is in the minority it has a right to be heard and if there are enough different opposing points of view it will be quite clearly seen at the moment werere 103  players not posts  against introducing alliances into fw in this thread not an extensive survey as of yet but from where i am looking from it looks like you only see what you want to see
if you want a more extensive survey you could try one of the threads that discussed the topic before the csm minutesdev blog commentary
75 supports from 108 posts on the issue threadim seeing what players want me to see fitz just because you are very opposed to this measure doesnt make your opinion more important or weighty than the people who do want alliance corps in fw
75 supports from 108 posts in the formal discussion this is eve online not my little pony online if you dont like wardecs leave the militia and go back to an npc corp stop bringing your ingame frustrations as a member of a combat ineffective entity to wider gameplay discussion threads part of the reason i got elected in the first place was because the members of pvp corps and alliances that trusted me with their vote knew i wasnt going to take nonsense from the antipvpinstanced evetotal security in hisec crowd nicolas i was elected to promote the interests of part of the community who want to see eve remain a real and vital combat game with good support for small scale pvp and dynamic consequence it was made very clear to us in iceland that ccp appreciate the fact that each csm candidate has individual interests and represents different parts of the community and collectively we cover a wide range of gameplay specializations and focus in this matter of fw i am 100 convinced im promoting the interests of pvp opportunity in eve and rp interests and the cause of content availability to a broad range of pilots in alliance corps who nonetheless wish to access fw features and conflictim very happy to discuss these matters with people ive been discussing the implications of fw choices and development options since well before it was released to the live server discussion does not automatically  agreement however and in this case i am convinced you are in the wrong and i wont be supporting your opinion
what the op is about not allowing fwers into alliancesim not supporting because i dont support locking fwers out of 00 and alliancesthere are plenty of threads demonstrating support for allowing people in fw access to the whole game and those threads also include plenty of straightforward solutions to all the problems suggested here and elsewhere
im not sure exactly how these threads work and how support is shown but frankly there are people against fw in alliances and for some reason thatthread only shows a thumbs up so that alone tells me theres already a flaw youre only seeing the support and support for what some thumbs are are support for no alliances is fw so what exactly are the numbers i think jade is once again trying to spin something in his favor of course someone who supports it will show up in the thread and put a thumbs up the thread is asking for supporters to post what you dont see are those not supporting iti can give support to this thread support as in no alliances or corps from alliances in fw evertheres really no clear understanding so dont try to mislead us jade
one thing this does demonstrate is why even starting down the road of not allowing fw players into alliances was unwise purely in terms of community managementwe now have a situation where just letting everyone play the whole game is going to seen by many as taking away entitlements
since you want to get personal how about you undock instead of hidingoh ouch your right oh wait a minute i think i said i dont mind since we have been kicking your butts all over the place as a matter of fact we mutualed your new war dec so you couldnt back out i mean come on 58 effectiveness overall surely you can do better the point i was making is the so called head of the csm is doing something to interfer with fw just because they can while in other threads post your nice little hello kitty postspoint taken but i have to say the i this and the i that makes you sound like your power tripping just like the non facts of your last post you tell people their opinions dont matter and yours do that isnt right everyones opinions should matter i think its great that alliances want in fw more power to them but they shouldnt interfer with fw in such away that you and your alliance is if you want to fw join it dont war dec corps in fw to make it harder on the new players and give them a bad taste sf sitting around and picking off players that are new to pvp and chasing them off is sad actually i should say alliances doing this not just sf sf is just the main one causing a headache because we have to go out and put you in your place before we can go out and actually teach new players about pvp thats not what you said before earlier in this thread you said your opinion is the only one that mattered again we have the ive what about weve are you saying youre the only one active on the csm panel there is no right and no wrong just because you dont agree with me doesnt mean i am wrong just because i dont agree with you doesnt mean you are wrong you know sometimes theres a grey area and there is no right and wrongi think what youre doing with sf is wrong doesnt mean everyone see it that way i joined fw to fw not to be war deced by an alliance not even involved in fw just because they can and want to prove a point doing something out of spite just because you can and to get some cheap noob kills not that it doesnt happen in fw make you a very small person in my view harassing corps and forcing them to pay for you to drop your war dec and making them move and promise not to form blobs from certain points is lame in my book tooi understand its part of the game mechanics but so was pos bowling
continuedto quote you from a past post in this threadso why interfere and why get your hackles up when youre called to the carpet about it if sf has no intentions of joining the militia why war dec fw corps on all sides i know because you can and you want tothat is why i say the rules for war decing a fw corp should be the same thing as an alliance joining they should be targeted by the navy and they should be a target to all militia thats how alliances should join just war dec a corp there should also be stipulations to the war dec an alliance should have to pay for a month in advance this so they cant jump around if the war dec is mutual they should be locked in to it just like a regular war deccorps under a war dec shouldnt be allowed to join the militia to prevent certain problems
problem with missions theyre dull grindathons for which you setup a perma tank disengage your brain and mash the f keyspossible solution make the missions less predicatable with varied enemys and spawnsa problem occurs with this in that they will be harder but also once your in the mission and something truely unexpected happens you have 2 options warp out wander back to the station refit a more appropriate fit undock warp back to the mission and hope something else doesnt happen or try and muddle though with a suboptimal fit both these options arnt particularly enthrallingthe problem is ships in eve arnt flexible once you undock you cant change a hardner for a webber you cant swap your medium drones for webber drones etcin our current system during a mission youd see 10 gurista bs and your go f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8in a variable mission youd see 5 gurista bs and your go f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 ohhs noes 10 sansha bs have warped in what am i to do i know f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 its still not particually exciting is itthe only system i can think off that might truely be fun would be to introduce pets or in eve terms mercs offer a selection of npc ships the player can call into the mission with costs attached to having a particular npc ships available  on staff  having the npc warp into the mission  hes a merc after all  and if the merc ship goes pop  to compensate the poor sods family    this would allow the player to adapt to changing missions on the fly it also allow ccp to introduce truely untankable missions
i am all for more dynamic spawns in the missions but it does have to be balanced by type so some predictability can be planned for due to the nature of ship outfitting   some of that could be overcome with changes to outfittings but that is another subject the t1 loot issues shouldnt be here while not having to pickup and handle the t1 loot would take some tedium out of the mission it wouldnt really add in any fun and should go to a seperate thread as it is a seperate issue that deserves its own attentionstory lines for mission when you start with an agent so you start with an agent for the first time and starts you on some standard patrol missions you run a few of those and then he moves you to a couple of special mission types and so on once you have the faction standings that unlock an agent your current agent should tell you that agent x has asked for your services if your so inclined this helps on the finding of agents and moves folks to diffrent areasregardless the agents should know what i have done for them and remember the things i have done and the missions that become avaliable should be tied to my faction standings with the corp and the agent and my rewards should be tied in the same so there are benifits to sticking with an agent for a good period of timeas for the work and how hard it will be that is a sideline as this should be an area that ccp wishes to improve on i know many folks have left the game due to the repetiveness of the pve part of the game also each faction beyond having thier prefered weapons and strenghts and weakness should also have optional equipment they can and do equip so for example sashas might like to use warp jammers so now you cant warp out or angels like to use webs gurtias like to use ecm ect this things give people an introduciton to these systems and how they are used and what to expect when they are used and how to counter themmore varied ais an elite fighter should fight like one not just have a tougher ship pvp mission types these would be ways to slow introduce some players to pvp
i totally agreefor me giving ccp my credit card details is simply not an option after they decided they could not stop themselves from acting like a kid in a candy store my credit card even though i have barely played eve for the past year i have kept 2 accounts active via gtc purchased for isk with this change 1 account will defiantly be cancelled
i dont think only having 1 option for gtcs is very good for the market 30 60 90 day gtcs will even out the supply and demandoh well whatever at least ill have battleship level 5 when  if i come back to eve 
why dont ccp simply sell electronic timecodes directly from the website for the same price as a monthly subscription  it would remove the loss of income from a reseller it surely cant cost all that much  being just bytes you could offer as many timelenghts as you want for very little cost one issue i see with more expensive iskgtcs is that it give isk sellers a boost when the cost of people legitimately buying isk through gtcs goes up the room for the isk sellers to operate in goes up as obviously they would have to be cheaper in order to justify the fact that youre probably going to lose any isk you buyof course you couldnt expect third party stores to sell the gtcs for the same price ccp would directly and this would mean many people would probably lose the money theyre currently gaining from refering people to certain gtc sites  myself included  but overall this would be a good thing it was a tiny bit broken before that certain large alliances were essentially gaining large amounts of ingame isk via these referals so that people could avoid paying the euro priceprimarily i see the move to the more expensive 60 day gtcs as move by ccp for the following reasons1  to force euro customers to pay more  as its now more attractive for them to sub directly vs buying gtcs in usd 2  to limit the people that are doing dark training  subbing for 30 days then training a long skill while unsubbed paying for the account via isk  things like datacores 3  to gain back the profit they were losing to people that were subscribing via gtcs  because the gtcs were sold cheaper in bulk to allow for commission paid to resellers the statement that it is the standard or will be the standard i find offensive as if we are being treated like idiots who wont know better i dont blame ccp for doing what is in the best interests of running a company but being fed a bull reason like that makes me more angryi agree that eve may be more expensive because its a premium product i quite like not having to pay for expansions etc but the issue i think is that the game isnt just more expensive in general its more expensive depending on where in the world you are and how you choose to pay for it  granted a physical card from a store should obviously be more expensive as it obviously has distribution and commission costs but thats not the exact issue here 
timing sure sucks for ccp i was just setting up a second account but with the inflated prices thats going into the gutter after the 14 day period
its good to see the question of why gtc users have to pay more for eve than anyone else was completely ignoredmat sweep typical
jade sorry but i still disagreei dont have a problem with the 7 or 10kms ships they take some work to deal with but as you say they are expensive and rare they are special cases and with a bit of work they can be dealt withwhat annoys me is that most gangs we engage are nanod no shield tanks no armour tanks no snipers nothing but a bunch of 3 or 4kms cruisers and maybe a few dictors and inties and a falcon 200km awaywhere is the fun or varietya rapier in mandatory in a gang if you dont have one you might as well not go out how is that fun or flexibleyou complain about the blob but ive seen just as many nano blobs as other blobsbring back battleship fights close range slugfests snipers and all the other things that used to happen we fly nano ourselves because we would be stupid not to but that doesnt mean we think it is balanced let missiles actually be able to do some damage to something that isnt going two or more times the explosion velocity of even precision missiles etclet me use my tanking skills actually give me a reason to fit a repper and some resists on my ship hell i even use a nano ship for ratting
im not supporting thisthe bio is supposed to be shortif you want a long bio then get a webpage and link to it
i support this  
yeah because who wants this game to have functionality anyways
and evemails  side note most of the time i cant even put back my ship name to lance fighters abiddon it cuts it off lets fix that too k 
as we have the color indicators in local the need to do info on every pilot is not so pressing anymore and bios dont need to be preloaded imhothus it should not really create any server strain  reason for the nerf was preloading of all bios when people jump in i think thus unnerf this please
longer bios please side note i want to be able to name drones long live hobgoblins bob fred gary sue and larry reality check thisll never happentribe
as a person with a helpful bio i know that bio space could drastically be improved at the moment you cant even fit all the damage types or such correcting this issue by lengthening the bio back to its original  and have it so it only loads when you check the bio  would improve this dramaticallyagreed
this man should be given a medal
yes this can be very tedious also for capitals jumping itd be nice to know when you can jump without hovering over the cap
you didnt do   except win a free trip as many ahead of me have pointed out you were so busy patting yourselves on the back you forgot to mention the concerns of the same people who won you the trip
im really excited about evemail improvements does anyone have a link to a post with any further details
pretty much correct  csm had a chance to do something special instead they focused on some safe nickel and dime bull  and failed all those who voted for themgoonswarm maybe able to push their candidates through sheer force of numbers but rest of you regular elected csm better be ready when the next election comeswhere is the fix for pos something that had overwhelming support i am not talking about a controversy here like black ops or war decs or idiotic suicide ganking all those things worked and worked ok even half broken very much unlike the current pos system which has been broken for years and takes bloody hours and days and years to maintain when it has to be improved and is affecting pretty much everyone
im disappointed as well as it seems that the interests of a minority of players  00 players in large alliances  are being over represented in this priority listfirst and foremost should be attention paid to the core parts of the game in particular the ui anyone who plays eve for any significant amount of time can sit down and write out a list of things that could be tweaked to make using the ui less tedious and annoying heres a few off the top of my headmining laser countdown timersmore tabs for the overview 5 just isnt enough perhaps a drop down list for the list of tabs you want displayed id love to be able to set up a group for general pvp a group for complexscanningexploration a group for missioning a group for gathering lootsalvaging etc the vast majority of the time i could use 23 tabs for the type of gameplay im currently engaged in but since i like to do lots of stuff there are far more than 5 totalapplying all color tags to the local list  id love to see low security standing players for example making similar context menus have the same options for example i cant align to a stellar object in some context menus while i can in others  why would you have different implementations of context menus in different places anyhow letting us view market details on any ui element that has an item contained inside for example the info window sometimes has it as an option sometimes it has no options at all why the differencelet us cancel warp in midflight if we can bookmark a location while warping why cant we just stop its not likely that you could have the accuracy needed to land anywhere specific on purpose ever warped to the wrong gate while flying a freighter and realized it just as you entered warp and the gate is 120 au away sucksfix the various ways that numbers are handled in text fields when i click on a price there should be a cursor inserted there thats it i dont want to do anything odd and i dont need the numeric display to change to something like 418831299 whered the 99 come from anyhow  i think the auto justification is part of the problem here for gods sake let us sort by meta level in our hangers i cant remember which modules are the valuable ones but meta level can certainly helplet us export and import overview settings to other charactersaccounts this data is obviously being stored somewhere on our hard drives in some format why not make it portablelet us highlight our own orders in the market window and shoving the whole alliance thing in there as the top fw issue come on the reason why alliances arent in fw has been stated and its a reasonable restriction given the likely outcome if the restriction were lifted let corps in alliances in fw do you really want goonfleet or evolution signing up in fwfactional warfare is fun but based on the last months worth of player experience it could use some tweaking better rewards mission tweaks something to discourage giant blobs etcyet none of that is on the list instead we have the issue of alliances participating in fw how about we get fw polished up and make it more fun first before worrying about thatand despite what jade said above the speed issue should be a priority on the community representatives list as it is obviously a priority in the community how can you possibly justify saying that this is representative of the entire eve community without that issue listed its one of the most talked about issues in the community it doesnt matter what you think of the issue or what ccp thinks of the issue its what we think about it youre there to represent us please dont forget thatits unfortunate that special interests seem to have a disproportionate influence in this priority list just like real world politics
additionally why black ops over assault frigatesfar more players have the ability to fly assault frigates than black ops yet black ops has the highest priority and assault ships are absent whywhat about the 3rd high slot on the heliosthe missing turret on the vulturethe fact that only a few of the recons are really usedall of these ships are more available to the general population of eve than black ops ships yet we see nothing itd be easier to swallow if black ops was further down the list but you guys have it as the absolute highest priorityim sorry but its just not that important to the majority of us sure it should be looked at but not before you give the assault frigate class a better role andor tweak them so theyre an attractive option to cruisersthis really doesnt have to be a 00 vs carebear thing  which totally ignores the fact that there are carebears in 00 too  instead its about proportionality of the various activities that players can and do participate in vs the priority of the items in the listyouve focused on some special interest items at the cost of improvements that are beneficial to everyone
the same flaw the elections for csm had in the first place if you voted for someone that got a low number of votes your vote was wasted when if done on a preferential system you could have either recast or indicated a second preference etc to affect a change in which other candidate you would prefer to be elected out of the remaining a much fairer system instead of the current one where effectively 002 of people decide each csm candidate  and the views of a third of the voters are simply discarded 
i fly the helios the reason it doesnt have third high slot is because unlike the other covops it has a drone bay so while the fitout for the others is probe launcher  cloak  gun the fitout for a helios is just probe launcher  cloak  drone  i rather like this as it means you dont have to waste fitting on your weapon and the drone is handy for popping pods you scan down etcgranted this may not be an effective use of the ship if youre using it in one of the newer pve roles but i guess thats something to consider i dont think adding a high slot to them would necessarily make them overpowered since they are so tight on fittings anyway and not exactly useful in doing damage against anything that can shoot backi think the reason for black ops being on the list is that theyre not really a ship worth having and cost quite abit though being at the top of the list imo is a long way from where they should be because theyre not all that useful as you point out not a heap of people fly them so the problem doesnt affect that many people  not flying something because its not useful isnt the highest order of problem imo  things that you use constantly  possibly because you have to  but that have issues are pretty high on my personal list of things id like to see fixed
out of curiousity exactly how did the csm decide the order of these items you mentioned fistfights etc but i cant believe that any individual would have looked at that list and put black ops improvements topsounds like you needed a formal system of reviewing these items such as a pivot table systemill give a little demo on a random list of letterssotganhdumexywpick one item from the list and decide whether each of the remaining items should be above or below it effectively that one becomes the pivot dividing the list in twopick s  divide alphabetically oganhdme s tuxywon each of the new sublists pick a pivot and continue ganhdme o s tuw x y ade g hmn o s t u w x ya d e g h m n o s t u w x yand evenually you get a nice ordered listit may seem like a complex way of doing it but it has advantagesa  it is transparent  you can justify why the csm as a whole placed any item where it isb  it should reduce the problems with obvious misplacements you are asking is issue x more or less important than issue y as opposed to what should go top of the list which risks everyone jumping on their own hobby horsesc  it makes the process systematic so people are less likely to get worked upme removes his maths teachers hat and puts the decision maths textbook back on the shelf to collect more dusthmmm doesnt come out as pretty as i would like  for some reason the forum is stripping out the extra spaces id put in to make it all line up i hope it still makes sense
everything caldari is seemingly messed up right now i honestly wish ccp would just get someone to sit down and look at the ship bonuses and fitting issues and various other issues plaguing caldari in pvp right nownighthawk is basically a t2 drake though it has the model of a ferox i dont think comparing it to a ferox is fair except it actually performs worse than a drake which is rather sad when you think about itwhile i personally dont want to derail this thread with boost caldari stuff it sure would be nice if ccp would fix caldari when it comes to pvpfar as the csm not passing this i dont get it hopefully ccp does though go open up the eve fitting tool program and fit a sleipnir and then fit a nighthawk and tell me its not screwed up if you cant see the problem from that alone i feel sorry for you
this is not a terribly fair comparison while the nighthawk is aesthetically based on the ferox it is actually analogous to the drake for fitting both the drake and the nighthawk have 7 weapon hardpoints and 7 highs both shield tank also the ferox is a railboat so its not a fair comparison in regards to grid or cpu im still wwaiting for anyone to explain to me why on earth the nighthawk actually loses grid from its t1 counterpartkeep us posted on how things go tomorrow jade i hope you received my pm and can really make it clear to the committee how completely screwed the nighthawk is for gridand again thanks
crane needs some loving
i think a small power grid increase is warrented in this caseall the other blockade runners can fit a mwd and a full set of lowslot speed  manoeuvrability mods the crane however having the least amount of lowslots to begin with has to use one of them up for a reactor control unit in order to fit a micro warp drivei know some ships are meant to be better than others in roles  the iteron 5 is the best tech 1 hauler for example the caldari charon is the largest freighter  i think the crane is a bit too nerfed itd still be the slowest after a small pg boost but at least it could fit 2 speed modson a slightly related note blockade runners  i think with the advent of the sensor boosted heavy interdictor blockade runners can be caught a little too easily perhaps the discussion about assault frigates having a  or skill based web immunity could be looked at here  give a role bonus to say 50 less web effect on a blockade runner this way a hic can still scramble a br but theyll have more of a chance to run back to the gate  with the crane using its mwd and 2 agility mods due to the small pg increase d   and get out they can still be webbed they can still be scrambled but they have slightly more of a chance a rapier or huggin can still double web it  if it can tank the sentries ofc  and a tech 2 or fleeting would do 45 web speed and not 90still flimsy ships with a rubbish tank bonus but you have to work a little harder to kill themi think this could be especially useful with factional warfare as corps and players now in low sec need to ship supplies around quickly and efficiently
parity or balanceanyone who has flown with me for very long will have heard me launch into my back in the day rant about how the different races used to have more significant differences and how much of that flavor has been lost when the kestrel lost cruise missiles we were promised a bomber role would return eventually but now every race has a bomber gallente are the drone race but theres no real flavor between carriers  a caldari ship pilot with drones v used to be a real oddity  i must applaud the diversity of the recon shipsso whenever one of these threads comes up i always want to ask  though rarely do any more the csm section has given me new hope for forum discourse  what could be done to make up for the deficiency rather than just removing it entirelynow maybe nothing could be done maybe the only solution is to simply increase the powergrid but let us at the very least entertain the possibility that there is another wayif there isnt well thumbs up james youve got my support
not being able to see the fittings without boarding the ship is an issue too especially with ships in corp hangars etc that you may not be able to fly  can i repackage this    
this if undocking had a 30 second timer it would greatly upset people i dont see how this mechanism is vastly different to the shipchanging onesure you need to make a bunch of database calls and find out what modules can be put online and what benefits you get out of it but exiting the station  apparently  requires calls to learn about everything that currently exists insystem
its a feature that is in the game already you just gotta look a bit closer tho i admit it is a bit randomwait till you go the required skillpoint amount you want to unlearn above your current clone and kill yourselfgood luck
the rp community does a lot to help really flesh out the various elements of backstory in eve while certainly not everything some have proposed is very good or logical they have collectively created some of the best most interesting and most internally consistent information we have on the various cultures places and histories of eveunfortunately  almost  none of it is officialwhile obviously it would need to be done carefully  and i dont know if the above method is the best one or not  i think its high time that some of the unofficial pf rpers have created becomes official
yes firefox in space anyone
what and deny the people who stay in starter corps so they can brag to new players the chance to feel like big boys perish the thought
the game was designed in a way that means that youre not supposed to be able to wardec everyone empire is not supposed to be lowsec00 people are complaining at the other end that wardecs allow people to grief too easily because if you give up having a corp chat soverignty poss standings and the rest in exchange for being in an npc corp i kind of figured it was fair  people complaing about wardecs being to easy and people complaining about being able to avoid them  balance  if people were forced out of npc corps id have to agree that wardecs would be too easy to grief with and their cost should go up exponentiallypersonally i think if people leave a player owned corp for an npc corp you have won the war ccp dont want players to be griefed out of the game the war dec mechanism is there for cutting hostile supply lines attacking poss etc etc highsec while not completely safe is supposed to be alot safer than 00 and a sanctury for newer players  that is players that havent played much which does not correspond to the age of the char  to learn the game and escape the hassles of constant pvp
no to cnr raven in nub corp
great idea one of most frustrating aspect of gaming is the inability of war deccing npc corps this is still not perfect but best alternative put forward so farps and how do i do the thumgs up thingy
good idea npc corps should be just for beginnersthere is a checkbox when you post that you have to click on
i like the overall idea of moving people past a certain point on to other corps but i think 6mo is a bit much more like 3 months would workbut those other corps should be varied and not at war with anyone by default but can have war declared on them by other corpsanyone with a faction standing of say 3 with a corp should get an option to join that corp if they are in a newbie corp the player that joins that corp then gets faster faction gains with the corp doing missions but that npc corp can have war declared on it a corp that declares war on an npc corp would then lose all access to that corps stations and facilities and would then get a corp standing with that corp of 1 or more so there are far reaching effects plus they would be kos to that corps pilots both npc and player this also allows for pvp missions from agents   they should be optional to take   this could also go into allowing corps to take over stations by the npcs and other aspects making war dec and war in secure systems more dynamic and flavorful
this is such a bad ideaforcing people into war is wrong if someone wants to play a singleplayer version of eve in a npc corp let him why not hes contributing to the economy and not hurting anyonei agree that adding of some form of pvp npc corps with some other extra benifits is a good idea but only as an option not some automatic time dependent methodbut that exists currently with the militia corpsenhancing diferent options and expanding the game yes forcing people into anything noi might slightly agree that avoiding wars by running away to an npc corp is wrongbut what should a corp do when faced with a far superior enemyyou could maybe add a cancel subscription button wich apears when wardecdi dont get itif you wardec someone and they disperse their corp and join a npc corp isnt that kinda like winning the waranyway i never understood griefers maybe thats why i hate this ideasimple sollution is to wardec a pvp corp thats the same size  or stronger  as your own and they wont run away from a war
i dont think you have any idea how badly this would harm the casual player base and industry sections of the gameif you want to pew pew everyone all the time counterstrike is that way in the meantime ccp themselves has acknowledged that war all the time for the sake of war is not generally a good thing look at their past decisions on things like the privateers nerf and comments currently about wardec system issuesnot supported i happen to like playing with my friends who would most likely leave if this was implemented
not agreedas a member of an npc corp i enjoy helping new players out and the rookie chat is too much of a headache with trolls and spam for them to learn anything also its been shown that over half of the players are not interested in pvp so forcing lone wolves  we have horribly broken fleet mechanics in npc corp  to suddenly become targets that are wardecced 237 is not a good ideathere are many disadvantages to being in an npc corp we cant put up poses and if we get attacked or attack others help is nigh worthless fleet mechanics still use the lone wolf idea with no shared aggromaybe have the ability to wardec players for a nominal charge but only those players who have a 1 or lower security status  to prevent griefing of new players  you might also be able to wardec players if they have less than 10 agents in their listing  to eliminate macroers or at least hinder them some  otherwise this idea would destroy the playerbase of eve
if players dont want to move to the tier2 npc corp then how hard is it for them to create a player corp very few griefers are going to go to the trouble of wardeccing a single person corp unless that person has really done something to annoy them and thats what wardecs are for consequences for actions
1 person corp omg i forgot it cost 5mln to make  and lvl 1 corp managment 
if someone annoys you block them
no support a well worded op though nice your proposal will tick off a large number of subscribers who will quit if its implemented thats the big reason ccp will not allow something like this it also ignores the fact that some people like to engage in pvp using means other than straight out pew pew yer deadand where would all the pirate alts go where would pirate mains go when they have to ditch their corps when it gets too hot because of the terrible things they dowhat has someone done to make you frustrated with not being able to get at them dared to talk back to you in local you seem able enough with words that you should be able to best someone in a verbal war seriously though if youre ticked at someone in eve there is always a way to get at them if youre willing to pay the price sounds like youre just looking for a more convenient wayregardswindjammer
to be honest i probably wouldnt bother going after any of those people i just see npc corps as being related to several other threads and issues for example suicide ganking one of the defenses of easy suicide ganking is that 1  macros hide in npc corps2  00 alliances keep logistics alts in npc corps3  too many players try to hide in the npc corpsmy idea was an attempt to fix some of the weaknesses in npc corps and clear the way for other issues that touch upon npc corp immunity to be resolved and once again i really dont see the difficulty in forming a 1man corp if thats what someone wants to do to avoid an npc corp war hopefully though it would lead to the formation of 25 people corps of friends cooperation and teamwork is integral to eve and necessary for players to try a few other playstyles if they want to
this suits ccps stated desire to have more things a small raiding party can do to inflict damage on an opposing alliancei would like to see their contents lootable on destruction to make it worth the timeeffort for a small gang but sufficiently tedious to destroy that it would try the patience of a large fleet so you dont get your space wiped of them by one fleet you cant countermore stuff to blow up is always a good thing  
this idea has a good deal of merit but i believe it could be advanced a more advanced idea i put forth a while ago was the shipbased habitats  sbh  the information is available on my webpage
as long as the minor adjustments mean less waste i agreei have invested a huge amount of work in the posbut due to the 10 additional waste an components and shipsthe profitablity is lowempire stations might be cheaper but not available many timesi want to accomplish a profit using my own factories
who what youre joking right jump freighters are awesomewhat used to take 6 trips in a carrier you can do in one with a jump freighter and you can do it by putting everything into the one hangar instead of splitting them into cargoholds of ships in ship maint bays etc and you can jump right out of highsec granted they require escorts  allthough for the most part a single carrier is plenty  but 00 logistics is already the easiest its ever been i mean i personally ran 32 poss spread across 3 00 regions doing all the hauling of fuel and moon materials myself theyre not more hassle than theyre worth precisely because they can do so much compared to anything else they make 00 logistics incredibly easy you can make billions upon billions of isk with them per week  i can make 3 b isk a week using a jf and most of that in a single return 00 trip this is done and dusted carriers are good enough for moving more valuable  smaller items assembled ships etc if you want to move more cargo you make more trips or you use a ship designed to move things not one designed to do damage tank remote repair etcyoure not exactly in a small corp or alliance so im not exactly sure what the issue is other than perhaps you want to be able to do everything yourself and never have to rely on others  slight newsflash this game is about people working together
moving this to jita park
removing them and giving players effects of all learned would cause all the old players who trained em to complain
problem is that they burden if handled wrong but add nothing worthwhile to the game if handled wellid happily give up the time i spent on learning skills to see them all set to 5 on existing and new characters the community benefits from making the game fun for new players it does not benefit from new players having to suck it up just because we did
cry me couple of rifter sized tears and train what you want to train its rpg
think of the logic and storylne alsowhich sounds more realisticthe developement of a ship to do long range deep space exploration and study of the various phenomenon found in the universe including evegate and rogue drone studythe development of station sized ships to allow for facilities to move about where ever and whenever you likehmmmmyeah i would have guessed exploration ship first but who knewcan you imagine the dd weapon on that super capital shiptruly a toy for the large corperation and it should be implemented imeadiately as this would impact the most people with least effortand really it is the most logical step in making planets that can cruise around and fightyou cant have 10000 in a single server battle but you can have one ship that takes hundreds to operate properly with almost no lagwhat a great idea soon they will introduce the anticloak devices to make sure those not in the dev run alliences will have to stay in 00 or diehonestly ccp there is more to this game then what you guys are obviously focusing onfor gods sake please open your damn eyes before you screw this game up too badas it is now many of us are only wasting 15mo till something better comes along hoping you guys stop this we are the devs and this is our game play our way or get out of the way and take this substandard crap and give us your money we are busy trying to make allience more fun since we run them crap before you ruin it beyond repair
dont forget one of the reasons people would like to see mobile stations is to replace the titans by modifying its role  like removing ddd and replacing with station services  thus solving a huge balance issue and not just creating a new toy that said however there is a hole where t2 bs with tier3 hulls should be as long as they are adequately expensive for the convenience they provide exploration ships wouldnt break the game
ok im talking about nano ships and all you whiners out there and this goes into learning skills i could not give a flying  about learning skills the thing is everyone wants to nerf nano ships i trained cruiser 5 the ed electronic upgrades 5 and all the t2  to fit it with now some noob comes along goes i cant win against him and demands it be stripped from me because he doesnt want to train cruiser 5  off with the learning skills its the time investment es keep the post on track i dont want to hear your whining about learning skills props to my nano bros who keep ing everyone else offsuvliana
totally agree with this thread  whiney threads are literally everywhere  and normal threads suddennly seem to turn into whiney threads to a pretty far extent i trust ccp to manage the game i really like to see the players having input but when it comes to balancing the game making it fair or unfair fun and easy for new players yet still having a big difference between newbs and veterans i say just leave it to ccp and play the game you whiney little vega
hello alleve prides itself being close to real life but so far it has a lot of security holes tied to corporation inner workings my old corporation fell victim to theft one of the trusted 10 directors did it but none of them can be directly linked nor case proven the damage is not so much into amount of things lost but in the broken trust there are no tools to see who was on at a specific time in specific station no tools to see corporation hangar access logs no tools to restore what happened during the time of the crime i understand that ccp wants to have a danger feeling and such things are considered native to the game but if it is to follow the reality factor then you would of called crime lab to do the analysis and find the person responsible you would have evidence and ways to track it in current state there is no such thing in eveif you cannot improve on current corp tools then just add 1 or 2 special hangars that work as secure containers that have full logs available but do something cause this thing is on total rampage this will not stop thieving i know its not the goal goal is to have tools available to track a silent bastard and stop good amount of people getting hurt by the act of a coward at current state i see it being more of a exploit than a game play featurethank you for reading my rant
why is it i see people saying nerf this nerf that boost this boost that yet the real problem in the game that needs fixing for a better game is lg i mean anything happens game lags big fights and everything lags for nearly every one i dont suffer lag that much my self part from beening in lag city  jita  but seriously stop saying we need boosts and nerfs that make more people whine when they take effect which at the end result makes other stuff nerfed for there benefit just fix the lag ffs
im curious what if any dicsussions there were concerning ccps plans to improve their server hardware theyve been awful hushhush about their plans to upgrade and eliminate serverside lag did anyone from the csm bring this up was this topic banned by ccp with all the complaints about lag im surprised there wasnt a five minute conversation considering the large number of threads started concerning this topic id really like the csm to push ccp for some informationi was hoping the csm would be able to get a sneek peak at what improvments were in the works if i knew that the recent price increase was going to cover the cost of implementing the proposed new supercomputer server farm it would be a lot easier to stomach i think ccp should reconsider its stance of keeping players in the dark concerning its plans for development in this area
ccp is not hushhush about it they are implementing an infiniband system
as a very skeptical person in life id just like to say after all the hardware upgrades that were going to give the playerbase less clientside lag have worked perfectly for about a week then the proformace drops back to normal  read slow  performaceim not going to say it wont do anything for us but going off ccp history of boasting on how much it will improve things can be taken with a pinch of salt and how long have they been implementing it now does anyone know
that twelve word responce didnt do it for you either huh
things were improved but ccp keeps adding new elements so all the improvements drown into new more complex content and as such create illusion that nothing has been improvedserver lag is and always will be issue well until the time when they implement the system to load balance nodes themselves there were few explanations on last fan fest and on some devblogs and news items so if you want to learn details do some diggingah yes one more thing that always grows with improvements  concurrent user amount so that eats up the free resources as well
very much so
rfc
thanks ccpcsm for finally posting the minutes
funny there is not mention of this in the meeting minutesit seems that it was not raised to ccp at all next time stick to what you can prove officialyi suggest we will continue voting on this one still to keep it on the top and dont trust the csm until we see it in the official meeting minutes
yes i agree with this as well
if this topic was discussed then please tell us what was said i too didnt see this topic come up in the csm meeting minutes though i would like to know what was talked about on this topic seeing as you guy did bring it up right
support your dead horse csm would be nice to hear from you people what happened when this issue was brought to ccp  was it even i mean skill queue eve has been ok wo it for many years now and seems we been doing fine and it is not as urgent as functionality of the pos aggression timers sale order by standing empire wars suicide ganking wtf 3 days csm had to bring this issue to the table all the issue listed although important are not lifesucking doldrums of what pos system really is all are much more controversial than the pos issue all are niche issues that have various responses yet the only idea that would alleviate the blight that is pos management at the moment the issue that has universal support  did not make it to the table even though we were assured by csm that it will be what happened

i heard someone mention a while back that wars were flawed because there are no victory conditions so it is currently i can kill you for joining a corp and as long as i pay a small fee i can kill you well wars are fought for all kinds of reasons but i do not see the reason for unrestricted war most wars are fought over territory especially wars involving corps  businesses fighting for resources etc  so i ask why not make wars regional charge a fee for each solarsystemregion also since the wars are now limited to a regionintroduce vendettas kinda like a and extreme bounty that is exclusive to the involved parties

yes please  bump 
ive been working on a ship designed to work behind enemy lines against larger numbers anyone serious about wanting to use black ops and work as a covert strike force please read my proposal for a new ship based on the high damage bc hulls for hurting entrenched enemies after reading what you all have to say i believe these ships are very suited to each othercombined with the recons being very adept antisupport ships i believe theres definite potential for these ships to work together and keep the defenders on their toes without bringing new challenges to sovereigntyive heard of a ccp test for appropriateness that goes can it happen in real life can ninjas fly around on rooftops and evade attacks through use of shadows while raining down subtle tools of quick death on the guards when the guards are protecting against traditional attacks yes i hope this ship class to evolve into that rolem  m
look beyond 00 and youll see a use as a lowsec pirate im really looking forward to a working jump bridge one of the biggest problems in lowsec pvp is actually getting a fight in the first place gangs are usually small enough that a few recons jumping in can turn a hopeless loss into an effortless win instead of just getting ignored in a 150 man blob the problem is your opponents are going to be reluctant to commit to a fight with those recon pilots in local andor on scan putting them on the other side of a black ops jump bridge gives a false impression of your strength and lets you lure the target into a fight theyd otherwise avoidand yes nano gangs are nice but two points1  nano gangs cant hide very well sure theyre nice if you can get a fight but theyre much less useful when your targets wont leave the gatestation everyone knows a gang of vagabonds and ishtars is going to be a nasty opponent and that tends to scare away targets2  with a black ops you can jump nano ships of your own in black ops get much better if you can bridge in a couple nanorapiers and this is what the fuel bay solution is supposed to fixanother potential use is bridging in a support fleet for capitals dropping a couple carriers unsupported is a good way to lose a lot of isk dropping a couple carriers with some falcons and nanorapiers is a good way to get some killmailsof course the cloaking ability is almost completely useless ill concede that much but the jump bridge is a powerful tool for those of us who dont have a pos bridge network and a dozen titans on standby
oh please god let there be a skill cachei dont care how weak the implementation or how stringent the limitations any crumb of skill caching would let me sleep at night instead of waking up at 3am because i forgot about skill training and got a reminder from evemonm  m
as much as deployments suck i still think this is the worst possible implementation ideaif the queue were that long then ebay sellers would just mass produce even more freightertitan pilotsi still vote for a single skill to follow the current without time limits that way someone could take a couple weeks vacation if needed sure it wouldnt address a deployment but not everyone suffers that particular issue at work
look i agree a skill que would make people be more afk and result in unnessissary character farming not good stuff however the way things are is just downright crappy irritating and inconvenient why not and idea i put up about a year ago just set a 24 hour emergency skill basically if youre current skill runs out and you cant switch your skill for any one of many reasons downtime issues unforseen problems even convenience your emergency skill will begin training of course after 24 hours it will be put on holdthis way you still have to log on to change skills but it wont be as inconvenient
skill queue good if you want me to discuss skill queues with you go post in the large skill queue thread in features and ideaspersonally id prefer the queue to have a maximum duration on the queued skills and if the queue is longer than the duration then you just cant add skills to it no limit to the number of skills in the queueid also recommend the queue being a few weeks long so that people can go on vacation without having to worry about setting a long skill when they may prefer to get a bunch of shorter onesnaturally the queue should be disabled for people who stop paying their subscription
i know this have been discussed and maybe allready gamedesigned butif ccp think logging in makes us play the game thats right but i think ccp can understand that a lot of low level skill with less than 24 hours are difficult to learn mostly because when you logs in the game you are in your spare time  the time you are not in your irl workschool  the next day most of the time you can be in front of your gaming computer 24 hours afterimho a good compromise would be something like that  when you dock in stations named x school there is a new service named skill programwhen you click on the button you have a variety of choosen skills to learn  for military school that would be military skills  each skill you choose have a price  creating a another sink this way  the price for each skill would be something like  wanted level  hours needed to train that level  skills allready in the queue 1000 iskwhen you agree for a program you pay the total of isk needed and you start training immediatly you stop learning when you dedock from the schoolexample  you dock in republic military school you want to train afterburner from 3 to 4 in  say  18 hours and large projectile gun from 3 to 4 in say 20 hoursyou also would want to train mining and medium blaster but its not in the program of the republic military schoolyou pay 41811000  42021000  232 000 isk you start to learn when you are agree to pay and you can pay you stop to learn when you dedockedit i want to train titan from 0 to 5 i pay 11011000  210021000  340031000  4800041000  53200051000   1bedit2 in ambulation what about your character to become a npc walking around from class to class in the station well whatever anyway  
i would like to indicate my support for a skill queue please make this your first priority the game is pretty swell otherwise but this one issue gives me a large painmy preference one skill in training one skill queued up plain and simple let them run to completion regardless of account activity logins character skills etcbut any queue is better than what we have nowthis would allow me to have multiple alt accounts active as it stands i get too frustrated trying to wrangle skills on more than one account so i allow them to cycle into inactivity on a long training time skillso this would be a winner for me and for ccp  more of my accounts active at once note as to character farmers my take would be that it might increase farming characters increased supply  decreased average price for characters  decreased incentive for farming so it would likely all balance out if the economy were allowed to act on the change
kweel  while everyone keeps suggesting that we need more places for isk to be spent i dont think this is one of themas you stated yourself youd pay a certain fee in order to train skills specific to that station so no one in their right mind is going to give it up early and waste their investment ccp said they wanted to encourage players to stay and play when they log in so they certainly arent going to make a system that will restrict you to that station for the next month while your queue trainsblue  i agree to a certain extent if you cantdont want to afford several accounts at once then dont run several but the intent is to avoid someone setting a lengthy queue and then stop paying for the account until then know its finished ccp wont implement a system that lets people get further in the game and prevents them from making their monthly incomefarmers are another issue and saying the market will run out is saying there wont be demand once everyone has a titanfreightermothershiprorqual pilot of their own if everyone can fly the best then theres nothing for them to strive for you think fleet battles are bad now when people bring 10 titans imagine the fight where everyone bought a titan pilot and that blob is nothing but titans
sweetwhatever the limitations would be it will be welcome as said though leave the current skill training when account is disabled just disable queue and dual training
the idea the forcing players to play when they dont want to is a good thing is just weird one of the best thing about eve is that there is no grinding to level but forcing people to wait around to change skills cause another type of menial play playing a game shouldnt be a job
signedbtw to quote why cant ccp say this themselves
i cant believe it this topic has so much support but ccp wont do anything about it
420m isk for 60 days of play what a deal great job ccp
whoever made thisplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesneeds to make one for the gtcs
dude relax if the system was not broken folks would not be corp hopping
ERROR
why not a ship too p veldnaught10 bonus to veldspar mining per levelcannot be trained on accounts who arent chribba
cant believe im doing this but i fully support this idea provided that the building of said modules requires nothing but vast quantities of veldspar ore to be utilized in its construction
lol total support same for fighter size mining drones 1b isk bricks that can mine oh yeah
good enough for me
why not fix the freighterjump freighter firstslots should be given to these ships before coming out with another ship that is intended to carry cargo coming out with more ships while not addressing the issue with these is simply dancing around this issue one of the great things in eve is that ships are very customizable ccp even provided rigs so we can further customize our ships then you suddenly hop in your freighter and its like hitting a brick wallyou cant do anything to customize it at all these 900 mil ships are as pathetic as shuttlesi would like ccp to do the following to freightersjump freighters before releasing another cargo ship1 decrease the cargo space by around 50 to 702 give them midlowrig slots3 make it so the cargo space with all t2 expanders and optimization rigs equals the cargo space of current ships4 increase base velocity so it will match current ships velocity when setup with expanders5 allow these ships the flexibility of fitting defensive speed etc modulesthe above changes bring these ships more in line with all the other ships in eve it gives us choices hostiles dont automatically know our ships stats we can setup to tank with the ships well enough to prevent getting suicide killed
would there be any possibility of increasing the  of manurfacturing  research jobs a player can performcurrently with max skills we are limited to a maximum of 11 jobs which imo is quite frankly not enougha large  of manurfactoring research jobs can take days to complete tying up the few slots we have for days on endyour concidering increasing the  of slots availlable in installations so an increase in the number of jobs we can install at any given time would complement this nicely and reduce the need for manurfactoring  research altseven if new advanced skills were introduced to increase the  of jobs we can perform
giving out tii bpos through invention is a bad idea imo as it would turn into just another tii lottery which invention was introduced to replacea better idea would be a means to produce more efficient tii bpcs without having to spend millions on decryptorsor maybe allow tii bpcs to be researchd to better efficiency an idea thats been suggested before by the devs themselfs
i will try to take these things one at a time1  players into 00  i agree with what many have said some people play to relax ans have fun which does not include combat or worrying about getting blown up all the time in their minds so here is one possible idea create an npc guild just for miners industrialist scientists etc that people pay to get into  a large annual fee like 1 billion  that makes you green to all all players you can only fly noncombat ships but the consequences for destroying one is huge you also can not belong to a 00 alliance  so they dont sneak things in and out  or have an alt in 00 alliance such a group would greatly help 00 and let them get on with killing each other like they want to2 any additional industiral skills should help people not make things harder for example t2 manufacturing efficiency in order to build t2 stuff faster i am an industrialist and was amazed at the lack of skills available for these activities3 when i started the game i was amazed that you could directly build ships from scratch if people do get to build components i agree that they should take away from the mineral demands on the ships but that could get complicated  a very big overhaul of the current system any changes to t1 components would meet with a huge uproar so it could probably only be done with new items one idea is to make some  not all just some  of the components for t2 items buildable in high sec space 4 in order for public use of pos labs at least some use would be to allow noncorp and nonaliance people to use them remotely for me and pe research this would be a huge help for me slot availability and they would not have to have direct access to the pos for use this does not help with those bpos that require items for researching but this could be built into the costs of the slot also finally it you make bpcs deliverable items that the owner of the pos could not see  even when being made  for which they would not be paid for until deliverable that may be one way to do copy slotscould to see some of the poeple i know commenting here take care all we are the targets of eve you know

ive launched a few bombs the single biggest gripe would be that they need to always explode once launched unless destroyed regardless of the fate of the person who launched it when launching on very large gate camps with mixed fleet makeup its very likely that the bomber and pilot can be killed long before the 15 seconds it takes to detonate when that happens now the bomb does no damage or just doesnt explode bad bomb
good point and one that shouldnt need much coding
bombs would break the blobs when you can break battleships with bombs  atm the usual 00 fleet bs tanks 70k damage because of titans everywherewith a very coordinated wing you could plant 7 bombs next to a blob of bs the problems are range of the bomb the damage they can do the damage they can tank until they pop and their pricenow they dont allow to break a blob because bombs are small targets so they are focused by support and 1shot before they explode if you want to plant them you have to get rid of the support before but if you want to get rid of the support you have to blob the support blob or dd them  both solutions creates a ton of lag  i think this is not an imbalance sig radius of bomb and minimum time until they explode are righti would love the possibility to set bomb to explode when an objet approach them andor allowing them to explode when a ship emit a signal maybe with tech 2 bombs and a new stealth command ship module  when you activate this module all bombs set by your fleet explode you have to be uncloaked and under 100km to use that module  the range of the bombs is a problem no ingame blob is localized in a 15km radius sphere increasing the range from 15 to 30 with a falloff would be greatdamage could be right but to break a 70k tanked bs you need 175 perfect skilled bombs thats a lot of bombs and if you have to plant them 7 by 7 the fleet have the time to align somewhere else and leave the field  7 by 7 makes 3 planting waves 10 secondes for each wave makes 30 seconds  that is not breaking a blob that is moving it to another point of the system creating lag again bombs need to do damage so you break some of your targetswhat is 4000 hp in fleets  it can 1 shot most frigates and some tech i cruisers i think it should create a problem for heavy support too so a 6000 hp damage couldnt be that much of a problem that change the number of wave assumming bombs could tank enough damage so they could be planted 7 by 7 again there 7 bombs  42k damage  more than half a fleet bs  a real problem for blobs under 20 secondsthe price is a problem too sb are paper made ships having 20m for the fitted ship  40m in ammunition is a problem assurance is 5m nobody would use them until you loose 30m each time you use them
im not in shares ipo and all this stuff but why shares arent available on the market  this wouldnt work 
a corps value though is not represented by the sum of its wallet divisions if the corporation has static assets like a pos this adds value to the corporation products for sale by a corporation  stored or on the market  also add to the value of a corporationso how do you determine the true value of a corporation if the the wallet never total more than 1b for example but it has 2 corporate freighters  1 rorqual how much is the corporation worth
i dont think a corp stock market needs to be incredibly complex in fact in order to encourage player participation its important that any system is not to obscure  remember this is a game first and foremosti think we need to understand why a player would want to purchase shares in a corp and base a system around that in my view a player would want to buy shares for 3 reasons1 mid term investment  on ward sale the player intends to sell the shares at some stage for more than the purchase price2 long term income generation the player intends to keep the shares an make his money back via dividends3 political control the player wants a say in what the corp does from the base of being able to vote on issues propose votes all the way up to full corp ownershipthe share seller is selling these attributes  the expected dividend political control and potential share value in order to achieve trust in the share option the purchaser should be able to see the following1 the historic dividend pay out per share and the next dividend payout value  share  this means dividend payouts should be a automated feature 2 the percentage of ownership eg 1000 shares  25 ownershiphow much isk the corp wallet has how many poss or bs it has is largely irrelevant provided the corp shows a consistent history of dividend pay outs after all not all corps make isk purely from a physical activity  eg a corp that makes isk by making alliances to buy or not to buyits a risk always will be but the dividend payout will act as a guide to the historic reliability of the corp  regardless of its income method  a corp with a long dividend history will be seen as more reliable hence its shares will be worth more and so onin order to make this process reasonably user friendly any stock market should show the followingcorpshare value over timedividend payout over timethe share item should showsell value ownershipnext dividend payoutthe next dividend payout is guarunteed  no one can reduce the corp wallet below the dividend payout of all shares in that given periodi would suggest dividends are paid weekly  in order to provide sufficient div history data and a more dynmaic market ownershipownership allows you to have a  value in all votes including the ability to propose votes and see who else has varying degrees of ownership a host of sanctionable actions could come into play here such as  increase div payout surrender war declare war release more shares lock master wallet at  value and so on one interesting aspect of shares not yet explored is that they could be surrenderd by a corp as means of canceling a war dec in effect a win condition c
thats true but its not relevant here the only consideration is can the corp make its dividend paymentsit might achieve that by liquidating all its material assets  poss ships etc  having its members mine until their eyes bleed singing on vent for isk or stealing a titan and flogging itwhats important is whether you judge youll make a return on your investment through dividends c
i believe there to be a problem in that outposts serve too many functions to the player complicating the subject of allowing their destruction1  offline location nobody plays 237 without a mechanism for logging in and out safely in 00 there is nobody living in 002  storage overflow need a place to stash player highvalue goods and provide a place to put large amounts of goods that have no immediate avenues of consumption or sale3  station services4  markets5  operational storage you need a place for your ships ammo fittings etc loot minerals so on and so forththere is some overlap with caps and poss in operational storage and cloning the most critical function is as an offline location bufferwill look at methods of separating these roles out to achieve desired behaviorenrich eve universe
creating an outpost is big acheivement for one corp or a small alliance but there is only 5000 systems in evei dont see a problem when an outpost is shot it is the same problem when you shot poses all stuff in the pos is lost outposts are now havens you can profit them even if you dont have docking rights with a jump clone accessing the marketthis is not realistic i guess when an alliance captures an outpost the alliance ask his military infantry to get rid of all the lasting guys in the outpost toowhat about teleporting stuff in a random lowsecnpc stations when you loose an outpost and allowing to capture or destroying it  the problem would be capitals ships owned by the beaten alliance  what about packaging the ships then what is the problem with this 
small alliance builds outpostbigger alliance wants outpostbigger alliance takes outpost causing catastrophic loss of investment to smaller alliance and 100 gain of asset to larger alliancehow is there not a problem with thisif you want to know why there isnt more activity in 00 this is why an outpost is your offline presence but not only can you not protect sovereignty from a major alliance but they also seize the entire asset making a much much higher propensity to gankit would be like all modules rigs and minerals used to construct a ship dropping 100i might have said well tough thats eve at least you can try to take it back when i first started playing im seeing now though how this situation works completely in favor of established powers gives them all the reason in the world to go after nascent 00 powers and provides no capability for gaining valuable experience through measured lossesi can insure a ship and limit the pain and get better at being a pirate the step to 00 is the plunge that requires a huge investment that is likely to become somebody elses asset an alliance thats trying to get off the ground and loses that kind of asset will probably just crumble instead of getting better since an outpost is currently 100 for the taking and a 100 loss you see a lot of alliances coming to their first test and getting destroyed what it means for the empire kids is that moving to 00 permanently is probably out of reach and likely to just wind up giving someone else an outpostive proposed a new asset to try and fix these issues and the ones of allowing a destructible outposts please contribute
since im pve id be happy with a load all command that just worked when docked
i really like the idea of being able to group all the guns into one big gun but the biggest issue i see is how to apply damage from overheating the server could easily calculate the damgae applied to each gun but if the grouped weapons appear as a single icon in the modules area the player will not be able to see what the damage level is for each gun what i would do is make it so that the first weapon in the weapon group shows as an active module with all of the ammo from each gun combined  ie an 8x 800mm ii autocannon group would show 480 ammo loaded on the active gun  then the weapons that got grouped into the first weapon would show up as passive modules that can be overheated and would show their damage state and if they are online or not each gun that gets overheated would increase the weapon groups damage modifier by the appropriate ammount missiles might need to be changed to an overheat bonus of damage instead of rof to accomodate such a system as for damage and to hit calculations i think they will need to be handled differently from the way normal damage calculations are applied when you fire 8 guns and half miss you still do half damage but when you fire one gun and it misses or hits you are dealing full or no damage also when you get a wrecking hit with one gun out of eight the extra damage is nice but not that great if you get a wreck with an eightgun group it would be absolutely devestating so instead of calculating if a weapon group misses or hits once it will either have toa calculate whatever the tracking optimal signiture modifiers are once and then use those figures to roll the dice each individual gun orb make the damage not random but based on a curve so that the weapon group does x of full damage based on the modifiers mentioned above the last thing that i see as an issue to grouping weapons is what happens when your target is almost dead and you fire a shot that does twice as much damage as you need to finish it off with ungrouped guns you would be able to immediatly fire the unused weapons on another target if we went with option a from above where each gun has its damage computed individualy then it would be easy to figure out how many of the guns in the group were needed to kill the target once you know that the server could reduce the damage modifier to compenstate for the guns that are still cycling and let you fire the remaining weapons
space whalesthe introduction of an npc race that is at least interesting would be nice and due to the quality of the designer many feel that it should be the whalesbegin the flame as i am immune
i wonder if any fedo act as a remora would on a sharkfully supported lets blast some intergalactic candle ingredient
only if robots that transform into f14s and speaker weapons are also added
sounds awesome i second this they would have to introduce a tech 2 dreadnought variant with specialization in space whale hunting the question is what would their corpses yield
space whales yeah read the thread come on space whales
this is the best idea that have been presented here
this reminds me of a certain episode of the galaxy rangersspace mobyi want them back  
i recall another thread on the forums also about space whales and other fauna living between the stars that would make some sort of spectacle if you happened to come across it on your journeyi said i like it then and i still do pas to whether it should be a new npc race with all that might imply im not so sure iz
a  why wouldnt you be able to build an empire everything would work as is except pos wouldnt determine sov to expand on it a little what if the bunker was upgradeable upgrading the bunker increases the sov value using the same system as nowb  i thought that was the point defending your space and controlling an area as to doubling the fuel bill i guess i didnt word that very well what i meant was that the bonus to fuel use given by the bunker would be reduced the more i think about it you are right it doesnt need to be there i put it in there thinking that it would force people to defend their space but really they are going to do that anyway pas far as it being pvp lite so far all the fighting i have done in fw seemed like pvp to me every ship can still be used just not all of them at some of the complexes and the bunker fights are all in how is blob fleets and grinding on pos deeper im not wanting to offend or anything im just not seeing any further complexity
if it was possible to manufacture all the trade goods and convert the posfuel from one race to another that would make it more feasible as it would not require immense amounts of logistics and instead make manufacturingicemining more profitable perhaps a new posmodule to convert posfuel could be introduced that had a lossrate hydrogen isotopes  nitrogen isotopes has a 50 base result which can be reduced through skillsi think that adding materials for eg enriched uranium could be introduced into different 00ores and blueprints for mechanical parts and robotics could be added
the newschronicle writers have been doing a great job lately turning out a ton of stuff it would be cool if they could publish some articles about the new bloodlines
no matter what value ccp puts on the  its either going to be too much at times or too little at others why not just let the person who sets the contract decide to add either a  increase or a static value for upping a bid this way itll be a tradeoff for them hit a higher  and hope someone takes it or go for the lower  and hope for more willing bids this way each and every trade can have a reasonable increase if its not reasonable the only person to lose out is the contract maker who set the agreement in the first place i dont get why anybody could think it would be a scam the only way this could scam is if somebody was stupid enough not to check what theyre bidding on quite frankly how is this different then setting billion isk sell orders on million isk items you can still only fall for it by your own mistakesps even then if you really think its a problem i dont you could just set the maximum up bid at something like 50 not like theres really a reason for anything higher anyways
why not have it chosen by the person who placed the contract
aye remove drone collision detection

so there has been some discussion for quite a while by now about this but i think its in order to hear officially what ccp thinksthe idea is to remove all t1 loot and replace it with some other kind of reward more lp for instance  this has several benefits1 it will free the t1 market decreasing the barrier to entry for new players2 it will make mining more meaningfulthis will mean t1 metaproducts will have to come from elsewhere there are some really good ideas floating around for this1 allow optional products to be added to a production job giving a certain meta item depending on the amount11 this process could use rig components12 or some kind of metaproduct which is dropped in low00sec2 some sort of invention mechanic lower barrier to entry than actual invention see it as fw is to 00 warfare its a starting point preparing you for the real world 3 bpcs to be dropped by missions and things like thatthese are just ideas of course it will eventually be up to ccp to go with the best solution
remove unnamed loot keep named loot named or whatever  gear dropping from killing npcs is a hackandslash game standard for a reason ill agree that unnamed loot should probably be taken out though since it only serves to make missioners train refining skills and destroys the gear market for the industrialists however in combination with component construction for t1 subcapital ships as in your other thread  industrialists arent going to need that much more stuff to produce and the facilities and skills arent there to produce it even if they did also if you want to move the rewards around move them to mission completiontime bonus isk not to lp mission completion is a joke its worth about 5 of the value of a mission i want to see blitzing missions be a serious option  not better than running them but at least something approaching competitive also time bonuses could use an overhaul  make it a huge sum to do it right now 23x the postbuff mission reward  and have it decay over time so that it hits zero around the same time as it does now besides the lp market is close to saturated right now we dont need more lp chasing the same number of implants and cnrs this isnt a pure win for everybody  for one thing im wary about raising prices on the worst gear in the game because it makes life harder for newbies this being accompanied by a blueprint change to make frigatesized goods cheaper might be wise but ill support it in principle as long as the practical concerns are dealt with
ive liked this idea ever since i first heard it
yes this would make industry more significant as the module and mineral influx from missions and ratting would become much lower
a hearty noi like getting t1 loot as drops both named and unnamed lets me get items to fit my ship with that arent subject to the whims of the producersmarket traders also can be a real bonus starting out when you find your first arbalest hml and find that it sells for 14 million isk or more a large portion of my missioningratting income comes from the loot drops that i refine or sell i find that it gives me an edge against those too lazy to do so and would like it to stay that waygetting rid of such loot drops would also wreck havoc with the way that many corps fund their building projects off of rat loot id rather run group missions for 4 hours than be subjected to a 4 hour corp mining op it would also make my self sufficient ammo production subject to the availability of certain rocksminerals in my region of space would make living in out in solitude even more onerous if the minerals from loot were no longer available as a source to be utilized
please explain what you see as the answer for how this would destroy the livelihood of those of us in the resale marketi have over 200 t1 buy orders out on this account and i make a very good side living reselling the very product you are suggesting we remove there are literally hundreds of us in this resale profession and some of us have been doing it for 5 years this would greatly threaten our means of enjoying this game i have a couple million skill points invested solely to enjoy resale and would hate to see them made useless unless i get into the hauling mining or production businesses as i dislike participating in all threesowhat becomes of us
im with this it will also effect 00 mineral income drastically who would want to mine all their bscapital minerals you need to survive in 00i believe the t1 component is not used in construction of the meta item or else the refining value of the meta item would be greater than t1s which it isnt so it would be more of alteration  irreversible change  of existing component
actually resale would still be a very valid business just not as easy as it is now you would be getting things cheap at hubs and find places they are needed and be able to sell more expensive just as resale works when working a spot market if we remove the unnamed t1 loot and keep the named all you will miss is the business on the unnamed t1 stuff the stuff that producers would make for ya instead id say yes to removing unnamed t1 loot too and have the rig components more common instead or just make loot a bit more rare in general then when no more unnamed t1 loot is around also add a chance to get t2 loot from t2 shipped npcs
i agree with this
valid does not mean the same thing as fun and resale has never been easy there is as vital and competitive a resale market as any other the funny part is that the most competitive part of the resale market  other than ships  is the unnamed t1 buy market take a look at the buy orders for some of the cheapest t1 items in your local empire market not a whole lot of margin on resalea huge number of 01 isk order bumpsnot as easy at it seemsbutyesthere will always be a resale market this change would simply do away with 50 of it and damage the fun alot of us come to eve for you may or may not understand just how deeply this would cut those of us who enjoy it but please take us into consideration and dont do anything rash without really researching just how this will effect usalso please consider that fewer loot drops and increased rewards mean less production with more cash looting is a means of production mission and ratting rewards are a means of isk creation be careful how you decide to rebalance an economy that currently works even if that economy isnt perfect
i support this topic
dude come on the real life example is so utterly lame when used with insurance or anything else ingame this is a video game if you havent noticed if you want to use the real life analogy maybe 1 of all ships in eve would ever get insurance insurance was put in the game for one reason and one reason only  to lessen the death penalty it was created back when isk was hard to get and everyone flew t1 ships maybe a change in insurance is neccessary but it should not be only applied to people that suicide insurance is an entirely separate issue as well as eve being anywhere near real life
yea gods this made me sadtell you what if you want to look at insurance then how about also looking at the log for user input from the gankee say if the target is on autopilot and hasnt moved the mouse or bothered to speak to anyone then they are clearly afk and do not deserve any special protectionor since everyone is soo concerned about concord behaving like actual police how about they fine the pilot for not being at the helm and revoke their license to fly freighters in high sec they could run into something and dammage iti do like the notion of tradeable killrightsgalananything less is going to make the isk sellers day
just one more real quickrisk vs rewardthe risk and reward of suicide ganking are both set by the gankee the gankee decides what will be in their cargo they can choose to move billions in a t1 industrial afk or they can load a few hundred million or even billions into a heavily tanked ship and fly paranoid with a scoutfreighters cant fit a tank but they come with a pretty decent one you need several battleships to kill one and any reasonable scout will spot those bs long before the freighter should be engaged using webbers to instawarp the freighter is also a darn good ideaprovide me just one example where an alert pilot with a scout got ganked just one otherwise follow the link on my sig its direct from ccp and its how they feel about playing the game afkno one should ever be rewarded or offered additional npc protection because they cant be bothered to play the gamegalan
ive been ganked on many occasions and lost millions i may be mad but i think its fun  adds a bit of spice to life  shame you cant right it off as a tax loss  ganking has been a part of the game as long as ive been playing it in the same way that piracy has always been a part in mercantile trade on the high seas when a corpmate got suicide ganked after afking to the jitaperimeter gate and leaving his badger there with a billion worth of cargo sitting in it i mentioned that perhaps it was his own fault  he agreed but if its got to the point where people are being ganked outside a station in a 10 system then thats like blackbeard sailing up the thames and attacking the merchant ships moored in london i know its only a game but cmon people it does erode the believability side of things the other point is that noobs need somewhere to learn the ropes  i know i didthis game is partly based on elite in that game you had a hisec and if you were a security risk you spent the whole time around a hisec station with a police escort so my dear pirates be thankful for the freedoms you have

well probably right after anyway i do know its a lot of work especially as theres only two people doing it plus we keep being told itll be ready for the next big patch which was supposed to be empyrean age but nothing happened againanyway im all for this
agree definitely need this dump
bring back the 30 and 90 day gtcs please with prices that are more inline with credit card pricing thanks
seconded i used to pay the equivalent of 280m for a 60d now its going to cost me 380m for the samestealth price hike not cool
this is ridiculous eve doesnt nearly have the play base of wow and trys not to mimic them except when there is profit in it accept it or not ccp is losing accounts because they have decided they dont want to lose some cash here and there to make their customers happy this didnt get nearly the attention it deserved ccp is just going to ignore it with a response of so what if you have to pay we rule i find it less appealing to put my money into this game
what the marketing side of ccp dont understand is that if they higher prices of gtcs now and cut down on the choice wise of gtcs etc getting ride of 3090 day gtcs will result in people leaving they consider there selves permium now but what do the customers think my points of view is that you guys earn well enough from us as we are now but the lack of custumer help etc petitions been answered in answered i dont mean time wise i mean in the fact that we get the same old answers back that say somewere in the answer we can not find this in our logs maybe you guys delete them and say this because i no i have set my cach on low but i still get the messages that indicate there is a log of this and leads to the servers fault etc lagthe future we are not bothered about we live in the present not the future you guys on marketing side should look at the present that people are buying 30 60 90 and higher gtcs for a settled good price and with the increase of petrol electrice gas and other stuff does not help with the price rise because everything is highering part from our wages so if anything ccp marketing side should take this to consider and leave the gtcs how they used to be and maybe work harder than sitting in a chair counting money
and i use 90 day gtcs since they are good for there price and it saves me hving to find the cashisk within 12 months
i can see this killing eve there are many of us who paied for the game with gtc bought with isk and now your makeing it harder for us to pay to play my account will be going on carrer 5 when the begenning of next month rolls around
so far we have had a few hints towards this but i think this is worth possibly raising as an issue for itselfi have had countless requests for creating t1 components in the same way we have t2 and capital componentsit would create a very interesting market and add a much needed level of complexityso the request is that ccp should simply make t1 components its my hope that ccp can tell us if its likely or if its a dream of theirsif we get enough support for this issue i will be bringing this up at soonest possible meeting  12 weeks from now 
fully supportedt1 components would be the first step into industry for the new player and module construction could then require appropriate skills to manufacture similar but lower to t2 modulesthen not every numb nut with a bpc and some reprocessed loot can build their own battleships industrial players might finally get some more appreciation
i think t1 components would be nice but there would probably have to be some changes made to the slots so that thousands of manufactureing jobs for t1 componens dont flood the slots just to build some frigatesin order to not make building  t1 modulesships cause its not very hard with current mechanics since it can be done by a minute old player more difficulttime cunsumingand so on maybe building a ship from components would cost less minerals then building from monly minerals  due to rp stuff like componets have more optimized ways of being manufactured and assebled in the future using less or more then standard what it says on the bp  number of a two given components could build precustomized ships finding out if a different combination will yield a working ship could be done through a new invention where you would research a bp to find a new possible combination and get a bpc with these numbersegfewer armor plates alowing more shield emitters  less armor and more shield hitpoints and shorter rechargefewer armor plates alowing more thusters  higher base speed but less armor hpless thrusters alowing more armor plates  more armor hp less agility and base speedor something
i do support ships being constructed from components i do not support items being constructed from components items should be the lowend for industrialists requiring no real skills to construct also the components should be split across at least three different types of differentiation to allow industrialists to specialize and provide the muchvaunted economies of scale to industry have components for each of the races much like the carbides in t2  each of the ship sizes sizebased hardpoints etc  also one power core per mw would nicely cover this role  components that vary based on the ships role drone bays ew modules that kind of stuff  and universal components computers engines etc  youll have to make the prices low and the volumes high on some of these components especially the universal ones but thats easy enough to do basically take a mix of the way things are done for capital ships and t2 stuff and adjust it so that frigates dont go up in price and battleships dont go down or viceversa of course  as long as its done right this could be exactly what higherend industrialists have been looking for
anything that helps the t1 industry sounds good to me
not in support of this all we need is another way to fill up all my build slots requiring me to log in multiple times during the day to finish each step needed to build a battleship for a corp mate isnt it bad enough for t2 manufactureinvention to require 15 steps to get to an end product this will only provide more cost to the consumer due to the extra work needed by the builders  cost of the new component bpos it will also mean more bpos to research mepe on less open build slots to make stuff with since theyre being used to make the t1 components etchaving components for capital ships  freighters is where i draw the line for t1 build jobs the protocloak components are bad enough and i dont want to see every t1 module take 5 days to build a batch of from scratch
all it would serve to do is run newer players out of the marketid much rather have the ability to choose who can buy my products than to have to build a bunch of components just to build something elsei did that in swg in the original release and cu there it had a function in the quality of the components affected the quality of the final product here it would only serve as a time sink because every rifter retriever raven etc is just like every other out of the box
i think mecinia is correct on this one if i am reading right what is wanted here is creation of more barriers for the production of t1 items correct me if im wrong but this means midlevel or higher producers would have the training to actually create and sell most t1 productwhy would those same t1 producers not simply create their own components rather than purchase them from new players just as in the capital ship market those with the means to produce volume cap ships already have the means to produce the components this would greatly reduce the production opportunities for new players and discourage entry less competition is not a good thing
this is why i say it should be limited to ships leave gear and ship components  to the newbies make fullblown ships the province of more experienced industrialists with large bpo portfolios
this would be better than all t1 items needing components but my argument remains large bpo portfolios coupled with experience and lower production costs means the midlevel producers will not need new players to produce components they would produce a cheaper more competitive product by creating the components themselvesnote that im not necessarily against this idea more complexity is a good thing and makes the game more enjoyable i just wonder if this will make things more complexor if it will make things more exclusive
frankly there should be a bit of exclusivity to industrial operations you shouldnt be able to do l5 missions on a trial account either that sounds banal but its a pretty accurate reflection of t1 manufacturing at present get industry 5 pe 5 and amp 4 and you pretty much never again have to put a skill point into production again unless you want to go t2 thats way too easy you should need more skills more money and more effort in order to become a toptier industrialist also a midrange producer like someone trying to make cruisers from minerals would still need a pretty big pile of bpos to do it some of them would be cheap  the generic modules especially  but the cruiserscale component bpos would be at least 10 million and some of the rolespecific ones would be even more expensive plus production lines start to be an issue if you have more than 10 components needed for a ship and you would one character couldnt keep a full production line going and youd have to outsource some will outsource to alts of course but therell still be a market for all the components  the lowend modules old industrialists dont want to bother with and the highend modules the newer industrialists cant afford bpos for
shey is correct its how it was in swg too you make your own components only if you feel up against the wall to get something done do you consider buying components from someone else because it is always cheaper to maker your own
isnt it a bit silly to add in some trivial barriers to tech level 1 production in the game now the game has been going for over 5 years now as someone above said most people have industrial characters already at max skill so adding in a few new skills will only mean that every industrial tech 1 producing character will train them up and then their will be no barriers again the only people this really nerfs are new players and why should they be nerfedalso this added complexity just brings about a lot of boring menial uninteresting work for large tech 1 producers it is tech 1 items it is not meant to be complex and was meant for anyone to get into fairly easilyto the issue of complexity how would components be complex at all lets say you get the materials for a component and plug them into a bpohow is that different from getting minerals and plugging them into a bpo to make a tech 1 item it isnt complex it is just another long boring step to a builder it isnt anymore complex just what do you need to buy to make x itemwhat problem is this solving i know a lot of builders want barriers to tech 1 production but is this good for the game or good for them simply speaking having barriers means less people possible producing which naturally reduces your competition tech 1 items however are supposed to be easy to produce and rapidly available as well as cheap and easy to manufacture i see a bunch of builders whining about how they should be making x profit and there is too much competition but i dont see how that is an issue espeically for a playstyle that has zero risksand finally please prove your points or show there is a problem and how your solution would make the game better rather than i want this plz ccp giev me hell i would like a hurricane with 15 turrets make it so
it worked in swg becuase you could customize items on build it encouraged specialization i went to one weaponsmith for t21s one for flamethrowers one for fwg5s ect i dont know how it would work in eve every moa that comes out of the factory slot is exactly the same customization happens after the build this was not the case in swg my components were customized on build the weapon was customized on build it was customized after build with slices and with weapon powerups
blobs is the reason i fly nano i would love to do some armor tanking but the fact is if your not nano your not gonna stand a chance due to the bad guys opting to only engage you if they blobnano lets you actually stand maybe a chance against the blobthe percentage of ppl who learn how to do pvp tactics is growing smaller and smaller because they simply opt to blob because it requires no thought process really
jade sums it up its a no for op
and nanos are the reason i blobso yeah speed fits need tweaking
i have never done exploration in my life because it seemed too complicated but if it is complicated and tereis no reward then just do away with it i guess finding valuable stuff should be rare but why sink skills into something that would never pay off

just before the csms went to iceland i remember jade saying that he was going to bring up duel ownership of wrecks and cargo from pvp i didnt see it in the minutes what happend jade
i am guessing that is the mediumhigh priority item 0030 pvp wreck ownershipthe question is where is wranglers postmeeting thread to follow up discussion on this feature
i spend all my time in losec and in the past in nosec and do almost nothing in empire but a little shopping i read the minutes of the csm meeting in its entirety what was discussed was impressive and the csm is to be congratulatedhowever it sure looks to me like the care bears got screwed on the priority listid like a little more light shown on who voted and how in the csm every politician in anything close to resembling a democracy has to defend their voting record and the csm should be no exception
like does it have to be mirc couldnt it be xchatsarcasmwhen will noobs realize irc is a protocol and mirc is just a client lord
how about you make it so you can put as much in a ship you are not flying as you want  i could put 5km3 in a shuttle  though you would get a standard warning when you exceed cargo then a check is run when you try to undock which prevents you from undocking if your cargo is overloaded
right now gallente drones do the most dps minmatar drones are fastest caldari drones are mediocre across the board and amarr drones are ccps idea of a bad joke the four varieties of drone should not be identical but they should be balanced against each other to the point where all four actually see use ive never seen anyone use amarr drones and caldari are very occasional at best the easiest way to balance this is to give all four of them a role gallente and minmatar already have theirs being damage and speed respectively caldari fit well enough into being the jack of all trades  faster than gallente and more damage than minmatar  though they could use a bit of boosting in order to make them better at it amarr drones however are slower than minmatar with less damage and only a tiny bonus in hp in other words any time you use an amarr drone you should just use a minmatar one instead unless you know your opponents resistances specifically in advance my proposed solution is simple  give amarr a massive bonus to hp by a factor of 4 or so make tank their niche its not useful in all situations but its useful in enough that the drones might actually see some use if youre in a ship where you dont want someone shooting your drones  either because youre in a nano ship where they cant shoot you or because youre in a ship where drones are the vast majority of your dps cursepilgrim anyone   you might pick up some amarr drones to make them live longer and apply more damage over their life also in line with the boost caldari to make them a jack of all trades principle give them about 2x the hp they have now  nothing crazy but a nice little buff so what do you think would any of you actually use these drones
nice idea m8 would also be a nice backup for battle carriers vs smartbombs i would also be more inclined to using amarrcaldari drones vs gallente like i usually do
i wouldnt give them a 2x4x boost to hp but any reason to use amarrcaldari drones is wanted
yes giving those two drone kinds some distinctive usefulness would be great anything in the areas of hitpoints tracking optimal range and orbiting range would be welcome
indeed
i agree that its a bit heavyhanded but drones are simple little critters theres not a whole lot of things you can change on them to make them better resistances are locked speed damage and damage types are already spoken for tracking is a direct formula from orbit speed and radius and youre basically left with orbit radius optimal range and hit points as your free variables raising or lowering orbit radius doesnt seem like a buff to me and optimal range is incredibly minor on nonsentry drones since i dont think you want them hitting while theyre still 20 seconds out from the target  hp is the only buff left unless you want to equalize them all or do something really outlandish eg less bandwidth use  given that i dont ill just play the cards ive got its not perfect but its the best solution i see that works within the game mechanics and isnt crazy
as cool as it would be to have 4x hitpoints its not like they are useless right nowfor amarr drones em does wickedly bad things to caldari tanks and on certain 3 hardener armor tanks em is the lowest resist but no why would that matter to anybodyyou know the highest dps number in eft isnt the meaning of the universe
assuming said caldari tanks use only invulns then the t1 amarr drone does 115x base damage base damage is defined here as the base damage for a drone of the appropriate size reduced accordingly for the resistances provided by the invulns  the gallente does 128x base the caldari does 087x and the minmatar does 065x so amarr go to being 2ndbest drones for damage but theyre still not the best similarly against an armour tank using 1 each of t2 kin therm and explo hardeners an amarr drone does 0575x base or 046x vs a minmatar ship  the gallente drone does 0468x base or 0396x vs a caldari ship  the caldari drone does 0489375x base or 0424125x vs a gallente ship  and the minmatar drone does 05265x base or 0468x vs an amarr ship  so at that point the amarr drone is better against three races including the two most likely to armour tank i did say in the op that they can currently be best against certain tanks with certain specific resistances however what you overlook is that thats a pretty bad tank even with no armour compensation skills a 3eanm tank is better for most purposes than a 3specific tank it uses the same fitting saves you 45 capsecond gives you almost as much hardening against the 3 nonem damage types 414 specifically  and also hardens you against em with the comp skills at 2 its 448 to all and with them at 5 its 496 to all ehp against even damage levels out at between 23 to all depending on the race of the ship in other words unless the pvp ship in question has capacitor to burn which no selfrespecting pvp ship does  youll almost invariably go for the eanms meaning your setup is unlikely yes there will be people who use it and against them the amarr drones will be best but in order for using amarr drones to be correct you need to know the enemys fit precisely with enough lead time to change out your drones and in the case of t2 drones train up amarr drone specialization which you probably havent even purchased prior to this  it has to be almost exactly this particular janky fit and you need to know that hes the only enemy youll be facing can you tell me exactly how often thats happened to you yeah if a domis got a bit of spare drone bay you can carry around a rack of acolytes just for the laughs but in terms of practical utility theres almost none furthermore even if you are right im not sure you make your point very well let me illustratewhen are gallente drones the best when you want to do lots of damage when are minmatar drones best when you need the drones to catch up to a fast ship when are caldari drones best when you need some fairly specific combination of a  and b  when are amarr drones best when youve got a ship scan on an armourtanking nonminmatar enemy ship who is using three specific hardeners and enough time to swing by the local mall before combat starts thats not balance thats a sick joke

hey this would be awesome then i could respec shadow instead of holy when we go raid black temple this weekendholy  people can we get serious with thishow do you forget months worth of training anybody just woke up one morning and forgot how to drive their car or tie your shoesthis isnt wow and there arent wands to wave over a persons head to erase knowledge while there is the penalties for outofdate jump clones they arent selectivenothing in eve lore suggests that we have such precision with memories that we can delete specific areas without harming others and even if something were made up on the spot to serve such a purpose itll only lead to more problems later onso you can not only train but master a skill and then change your mind and erase months of practice and knowledge gained so what would logically follow but being able to backup those skills for later while youre selectively targeting very specific portions of the brain in order to erase them you happen to save a copy now you could be a turret sniper or not depending on what you load up at the time sounds pretty matrixish for one thing in fact why not put that copy of master gunnery onto a disk and sell it now anyone can just upload gunnery v immediately since we know exactly where the memories need to go to make it work now everyone is just as good as you werenow we dont even need a skill training system well just borrow the skills from the best of every field and distribute them around the universe just plop down your isk credit card and walk out the door a genius at everything
i was trying to figure out a way to make a name for myself in eve supporting the worst idea ever seems like it might workthumbs up for the utterly ridiculous
the reward for the low end ores in empire are currently out of order as veldspar is currently the most valuable ore per mUFFFD mined this of course results in all industrialists currently mining veldspar and scordite often leaving noob players with nothing to minesteps should be taken to bring low end ores back into order
if veld is most valuable at the moment isnt it because there arent enough miners mining it
i dunno it seems that a system like this would promote writing like thisapart from being a really cool piece of fiction it just doesnt work with the mechanics and already people are clamoring for space whalesthats a lot of junk for the writers to sift through
there are still some thinks you could do about orders when making a buy order you can not only choose the range but make sure it is only high seclow sec
ive found a solution but i think there is no need for it because of alts marketting around anywaythe solution is when you put a buysell order you put it on your corps own marketthe corp market is the congregate of all corps market you can access   you have  standings with   a general market used by npc corps  the one every player use today  each corps market beside the general would be refreshed each downtime to reduce db stress a little morethe buysell matching algorythm would remain unchanged but it would now work with data coming from smaller tables reducing cpu bandwith  because it work with less data  and cpu  used to match with less data the problem is the refresh when you open your market tab this will fetch data from 2 tables and this would impact performances there must be a solution for thisirl countries dont buysell things to their ennemies and some set blocus to otherto me it should be possible to acheive this but it cost a lot of money to set controls administrative checks and docking rights economic blocus should cost 50mweekalliance like a usual empire war shouldnt it there is three flaws for the contract system to be used for this first you have no visibility from the market second quantities are set  you buy a whole of product instead of just some and just a few  no need for 134m trit when i only need 100k  third it have the same standing problems  
as weve seen throughout the great war and at the start of max large fleet battles bring the unlucky node its in to its knees again and again weve also seen that ccp through one means or another has managed to bulk up nodes with known massive fights in the near future so that the lag is barable or even none existant i would like to see this expanded upon by ccp getting a new game master and tieing him closely to those who handle the server the idea would be that when lets say goons are planning a 500 pilot invasion in one system or another they would contact this gm tell him hay were having a massive fight in xj6d8 in 3 days any chance you could beef up the node and then this gm talks to whoever handles the server s and they reassign some server power during one of the downtimes ideally this would make massive fleet battles more feasible and reduce the reimbursement claims this gm would have to be entirely seperate from the normal crew bound by strict non disclosure policies and have an understanding of what it takes to handle large fleet battles server side
the problem with it being playerbased where you have to report in advance is that lag is a tactic in some cases the gm in question would also need to keep his ear to the ground in other ways that said yes if theres a way to prevent lag in fleet battles and the only problem is the information not percolating to the gm then by all means set up such a contact point im not convinced that lack of information on what systems are busy is the only problem with lag  my fourhour login to jita yesterday would strongly differ with that assessment actually  but if that is the only problem this is a good solution
its not possible to tell days in advance whether youre going to get a fight  theres no guarantee the other side will show up  after the first couple of weeks roadkill more or less noshowed for the bulk of our geminate campaign even when we were hitting their station systems  or exactly where or when that fight is going to be  often the biggest fights arent at a pos as it comes out of reinforced but are unplanned events as fleets bump into each other in a random system and the numbers escalate  so youd have a system where wed have to say umm yeah were invading and we might need extra server resources but it could be anywhere in these 2 regions and at any point over the next 6 weeks or more which is totally impractical theres also the abuse potential of one side giving misinformation of what they intend to do to boost the nodes for quiet systems so that the other side lags out

i am a new player and i have to say i dont mind the learning skill sets it is a little odd the way the whole training thing is handled but thats part of the mechanics personally i have trained some of them up but have mainly piled most of it in to gunnery its all choice i accept that this does indeed look like a limiter and yes it does put some people off but thats eve for youhowever people are entitled to their opinion and i dont have a problem if a valid coherent agrument is put forward what i do find odd is the  might have been intentional  heavy irony in the op you may not like the idea of the learning skill sets being removed but you could surely express yourself a little better youre not only whining yourself about something you also shot yourself in the foot with so any argument of well we had to train them is invalidated by your above statement because as you said its not ment to be fair

i think i found your problemid say that your problem does not lie within the game mechanics itself but the poor organization of your corporation instead of ten directors you could have perhaps 23 directors and the rest of the people assigned specific tasks within the organization without roles to access anything outside the scope of their function if something gets stolen then the culprit is far easier to tracklets face it with ten directors you gave ten people access to every single thing thats in your corporation thats not what you want to do reorganize your corp so that keeping it running does not require director access just to do everyday tasksthere will always be corp thefts but you dont only minimize the damage by relying on nonexistent game features but by creating an environment where the corporate organization is such that the damage will not be severe and the culprit is easier find
makes me want to cry when i hear about faction borefare going in when i cant even load jita for the 7 billionth time or when i load in a fleet fight to find out i died 20 minutes earlier
yes things were improved and yes they do keep adding to the game which is good however if what they add is more then what they improve then and tbh if ccp cant deal with increasing users then they should give that more resources until they canend of the day is this eve is a game people play it when its enjoyable and wont if its not but all the time more people will try it out ing and crying on the forums wont change ccps policy on anything
how about some improved code it seems like the current system sends updates out to some clients but totally ignores others at least we could all lag together instead of some people just getting totally shafted i just jumped into jita at the same time as my friend he loaded and is doing his shopping ive been staring at the loading screen for the last 20 minutes same thing happens with fleet fightsthe other question is when when will i stop lagging its not fun and im paying for it at least give me a date when will they do anything for that matter they are still saying the same things they said in the past we are working on it the whole csm thing seems like a waste of time

please accept this as constructive criticism by now i doubt that this issue has not been raised but i have not been able to find it anywhere and felt it needed to be pointed outlavista vista raised two issues recently in assembly hall both issues are interesting and both issues have positive and negative aspects that require exploration unfortunately in his ops lavista vista only raised the positives i say unfortunately not incorrectly or wrongly if lavista vista believes in these issues or if his constituency wants these issues raised in a positive manner then he is doing exactly as expectedthe unfortunate part is that other members of your council may not either be aware of the negatives or bother to read every post in those threads and may not become exposed to the negativesthis means that an issue that seriously impacts a large number of players in a negative manner may not receive full scrutiny prior to a vote on whether to present it to ccp have you considered means to combat this do you feel this is important how are you currently dealing with the need to read hundreds  if not thousands  of individual posts and pulling valid arguments out from all the spam and flames on a weekly basis have you considered appointing advocates  one for one against  to create short briefs of topics you will be voting on during your weekly meetings obviously there are issues that more than one csm member is well acquainted with and those issues probably receive a large amount of scrutiny prior to the vote my concern is that more obscure issues may squeek through on the advocacy of one or two csm members without anyone opposing them or presenting any form of argument to the other voting membersthanks for taking the time to read this
well i can see where you are coming from but i think you simplify it a bit too much1 it has to receive 7 day worth of debate2 these issues i brought up are very heavily discussed already they were mentioned by ccp themself during the csmccp meetings and there is threads about in the science and industry forum3 when submitting the template one has to list the negative aspects as well this submission template is expected to be read by all council members before a vote happens4 i noted in one of the threads i should have done so too in the other one as well  that i will only raise it if there is enough supportnow the human aspect will always be a weakness but you cant really help that but if a person do get a bad issue trough ccp can tell that person that this is a horrible idea ccp is not unreasonable so its not possible for a single person to make a bad changeso in short sadly i think there is no way to combat this but obviously there will always be issues which might not fall in good ground with everybody but nothing that is suggested will be implemented asis without ccp making sure everything works out as expected
i wont deny that trying to understand issues that i havent come across during my own experience ingame is sometimes problematic it is one reason for having a range of player types on the csm as we each bring different experience to the table for myself where a topic is up for discussion i read each and every posting in the relevant listed thread s  again just before the meeting this is on top of trying to spot the new threads in the assembly hall each day or two and reading them all too  even if not always commenting  i believe there is much to be gained by waiting for more comments to a post before reaching my own conclusions  and asking ingame acquaintances also plays a part in understanding thingswhen a csm member brings up a topic for discussion they produce a document  based on our issue template  which includes pro and con spaces and it is certainly the intention  expectation that they should detail both and others will often query this too in part though we would expect most of the positive and negative aspects of an issue to come out on the forum thread  one reason for it needing to be there for at least seven days  and for myself if i only see people saying yes please i tend to have a worry that something might have been overlooked so try to find itthanks for making a point welliz
good answers thank you both
i disagree with your opinion of the change youre proposing but thats another discussion entirely hey we kill things too  sometimes 
total win i love it makes it so much more plausible and deifnately way better looking
i support this thread as a poor sap working in pos logistics i can state that these things suck royally to put up take down and operateshame on csm and ccp for not at least even mentioning it in the meeting topics

csm members lavista vista ankhesentapemkah serenity steele where are you guys did your internet broke what happened to bringing this idea to ccpyou should be ashamed of yourself but then again you got a free trip to iceland and all that who cares about your word or promises right i am laughing now i was really upset before and i am laughing at myself now because i thought that damn csm might actually do something good i guess what you say csm and what you do csm are two different thing my mistake regretfully i suppose that all the others should remember this come next election
i agree with waratron blackops are so seriously underpowered that they are pretty much useless the whole cynoing is a gimmick which is mostly useless as the ship itself is not up to par i have been in only 1 operation where we cynoed something like 20 stealthbombers onto a target with 3 black ops with the price of blackops being so high and insurance so low i dont understand why they cant be much better ships
we need to be able to activate the covert cynos and covert jump bridges in a system with a cyno jammer leave the jump harmonics as they are only covert ops reconforce recon stealth b and black ops can use them and boom 20 stealth bombers with bombs take out the cyno jammer the force recon activates a regular cyno field and the rest of the fleet warps in with a titanthats what they are made for arent theyoh and yes to the fuel bay
playing it safe by prenerfing is one thing however making the the ship contrary to its namesake is another i suppose its full lethality works in lowsec i havent seen many there though empire nullifies its jump capabilities but then you cant jump in empire eitheras to the ultimate ship dps carriers do what 50  100  damage if not more than a black ops ship maybe then again carriers are support ships really dreadnaughts are primarily pos killers and cap killers titans are not in danger of loosing their place so i cant see black ops displacing cap ships from their roles would battleships be reduced in use i suspect no in general price is still such a factor defenders still have those annoying jump bridges anyways at the cost of half a carrier i cant see the fear it being the ultimate ship in terms of use or powerlet them go in cynojammed systems among other things
lol it would take at least 2500 bombs to disable a cyno jammer that would cost 25 billion isk and take 20 bombers like 2 hours to fire and of course they cant carry that many either
i apologize if this topic has come up before i remember reading something along these lines months and months ago but i dont remember the thread or if the idea existed in this current formmake the blockade runner class transport ship a member of the covertops family do not give it the ability to fit the covertops cloak but allow it to jump with blackops shipswould fix the cargo and fuel issues
nerf nanos
these i posted a thread a while back discussing thisthe problem with blackops is they get combat bonuses but no advantage in combat  weaker tank etc  and the only ship with any real combat viability is the widow since it can jam the heck out of targets and  potentially  escape which is what this thing should be doing with a weaker tank sin agility bonus redeemer tracking bonus panther speed bonus seriously wtf  well panther i guess is ok but doesnt compare to the widows jamming if they arent going to be gifted with a covops cloak so they can move around stealthily  which is reasonable  they need to be given the ability to break locks or immobilize opponents and skedaddle out of the fight even with an ewar bonus its pretty easy to balance these ships utility relative to their recons
as many have said here when i log into the game its because i actually want to play the gameas it stands i could wake up in the morning turn on the computer log onto eve and change a skill before logging out switching off the computer and going to work thats not playing the game however to me playing the game is sitting down for a session going out around systems shooting some things playing the market etcim sorry but as good as the game is logging in first thing in the morning to change a skill is not going to convince me i should be pulling a sickie to go out on a corp op  for example having a next skill queue therefore would be a good thing as then you dont need to be planning your life around eve it allows just the right amount of flexibility to more casual players without making life too easy for character farmersso instead of me thinking that my skill finishes at 3am ill need to set the alarm to get up to change it i would instead think my skill finishes at 3am next skill finishes at 10pm tomorrow i can log in at any time before then to set the next skill upit would even have a benefit while youre playing as you wouldnt have to worry about having to change a skill right in the middle of a firefight the server would change it for you and you could set the next skill once you were in a place you could change it in comfort
yup i vote for now and next  a twoskill queuethis keeps things simple but solves the wakeupinthemiddleofthenightbusinessmeetingetc problem and better than the two skills in parallel solution because i would often want to set skill level x and level x1 as my queueand i dont see why skill training doesnt stop completely when you inactivate an account what possible financial advantage is there to ccp in letting people skillup for free
no no no noirritated of 4am finishing skill set a longer one go to bed finish it another day this just screams character farming and i will gladly do so when this solution is in place
other than possibly spiking the most players online number that ccp likes to tout at times having people to sign on for 10 seconds does not increase play  it just verifies that they have an active account personally i like the idea of a training queue but not parallel trainingworried about somebody setting a long queue and leaving for a year the new code module that does the switch has a simple check first to see if the account is active if it is theres no problem if not clear the queueonce the mechanics of a queue and queue switching are known coding against farmers is easy
so were back to the old arguement of no skill queue because everyone and theyre grandmother will be farming accounts to sell on ebay oh no the sky is falling omg seriously though if this really was the case then youd have a price crash on characters as supply would massively outstrip demand net effect less character farming as it wouldnt be possible to recover your outlay for creating a character especially if a skill queue is tied in with a freeze on skill point gain while an account is inactivethats right when an account goes inactive it should stop training there and then no completing of the current skill level immediate freeze with training restarting only on account reactivationthat way youre encouraged to actually play the game while your skills are completing and not just set an account to skill up passively
personally a skill queue is badly needed and yes with limits limiting a queue to say 12hours is good stack as many skills possible up to 12hoursi dont believe this would encourage farming but would actually encourage more people to playeveryone knows the first skills to train are the learning skills followed by engineering electronics etc getting from lvl1  3 only takes a matter of hours6 fuel conservation i  20 minutes 50 seconds 7 electronic warfare i  26 minutes 27 seconds 8 surgical strike i  31 minutes 51 seconds 9 trajectory analysis i  41 minutes 57 seconds 10 tactical shield manipulation i  52 minutes 54 seconds 11 targeting ii  1 hour 1 minute 38 seconds 12 energy systems operation ii  1 hour 1 minute 38 seconds 13 motion prediction ii  1 hour 18 minutes 25 seconds 14 weapon upgrades ii  1 hour 24 minutes 34 seconds 15 fuel conservation ii  1 hour 38 minutes 1 second 16 electronics upgrades ii  2 hours 3 minutes 13 seconds 17 electronic warfare ii  2 hours 3 minutes 13 seconds 18 shield compensation ii  2 hours 3 minutes 13 seconds 19 surgical strike ii  2 hours 36 minutes 48 seconds 20 shield management ii  3 hours 4 minutes 48 seconds 21 propulsion jamming ii  3 hours 4 minutes 48 seconds 22 trajectory analysis ii  3 hours 16 minutes 1 second so i am forced to login every 3 hours to playtraining the short time skills while online and longer skills offline actually doesnt help muchyour basically forced to login not play cause you dont have the skills to playnot everyone can put more than 23 hours a day onto a game
any eta when it will be implemented and please dont just say soon  tm 
character farming happens right now but only power metagamers who can buy timecards with isk or are willing to shell out more money for more accounts do it the only way that a skill training queue will make this problem worse is if you can queue skill after an account is inactive i am for total skill queuing ability with the rule that the queue turns off once the account isnt payed for anymore this will also help with server load as people will not be logging in and out just to change a skill and others who just leave the client on until the skill is done training
at first you had ice mining mindlink and mining mindlink the ice mining mindlink is completely gonethe micha implant is so rare that it als becoming and like ice mindlinkif they made it so that the skill your mining drones would be effected by the mindlink in on skill lvl then there where no extra skils nessary
ccp said no to the csm i think the csm needs to tell ccp nobring on the battleship 5 carrier 5 dreadnought 5 large turret 5 capital turret 5 recon 5 battle cruiser 5 command ship 5 and so on
personally i think ccp dont give a flying  what we think we pay them money they get rich the greedy s raise the bar to gorge on our playing the game all i saw in the latest csm post  now i dont blame any csm  is that ccp dont listen to them either on these topicsits all the fat cats that make these dictions so they can have that big bonus and payrise just like the rest of the worlds companys that raises prices with no reason the 11eur is total bulle and a scam i buy eve through gtc in dollars and i got a cracking deal but 60d gtc  still cheaper per month than 6 month sub in europe shame i 3 this game but these corporate s are ruining my financial commitment to this game
2 60 gtcs or a 2 month sub as yes a 60gtc should be cheaper than a 6 month sub
my account expires on the 17th today is the 14th i will no longer be supporting this game due to this change
 1  perhaps what we need is a way for corps that are decced to have other corps able to declare loyalty to any corp which in turn gives them full war rights also this would fix the militia corp war issue 2  and along with that if you added in the fact that all deccing corps must declare a monetary value of the war which ends when a value of ships is lost andor isk is transfered if the deccing corp achieves isk value first they win and war is ended immediately they are also unable to redec that same war for 30 days if corp that was declared upon kills the deccing corp and obtains the isk value first they win deccing corp gets war points if they win but if the other corp wins they gain double points while deccing corp loses pointsa bit complicated if you read that lol but it makes for a far better war environment and these war points can be used for something however to deter abuse you only get points if the two corps involved in the war both have more than 40 members 3  finally just increase the cost of wars in relation to the isk being demanded if griefer corp a wants a cheap war then let them pay for a cheap war that can be easily ended with a cheap payment perhaps for every 20mil isk being demanded in a war the war cost 1mil per week costs also double as normal with 2 and 3 wars deccedthis would have to make deccing corps choose wisely demand 100 mil pay 5 mil per week demand 1bil pay 50 mil per week
you pay to declare war add the ability to pay a fee to keep you corp free from war make it a blind bid systemcorp a pays 200mil war insurancecorp b declares war on corp a and pays 150mil  blind bid corp b gets a notice they did not offer enough to overcome the war insurance paid by corp a and gets a 24hour timer before they can offer again  they loose the 150mil offercorp a gets a notice who tried to declare war on them but their insurance prevented it you cannot buy war insurance while you already have it and canceling the insurance starts a 24hour timer before you can buy it again at a higher amountthis would not prevent war but would make it cost a little more and might give a small corp a chance to get ready or protect valuable assets like a pos this would also make it harder for smaller corporations to wardec larger corporations war insurance will only protect a corporation that isnt already at war and lasts for a set amount of time if you buy war insurance while at war it goes into effect as soon as the current war ends
cant see how this could hurt
give the man better mining lasers
oh yes i saw a wts thread for a moros located in highsec if i had the iskies that would have been mine  so for future eventuallities i want this maybe fit it on an erebus eventually  
bumping up this one again with some more referencesi linked my own thread above about making local optional just like the constellation and regional chats the consequences should have been discussed for the most part in that threadnow the issue comes up in how the intel can still be retained in a simple but effective fashion albeit somewhat more limitedan extra function on the overview which would simply display 3 numbers in a seperate area blue white and red which represent the standings and how many pilots of each standing are within x range some aus would be advisable but not systemwide this doesnt replace the scanner as that can still be used to determine precise range and direction and it doesnt show anything else than ships in range how this mechanic would deal with cloaked ships remains to be seen but this is another issue entirely this still provides an early warning system for anyone wary of pirates while not being as overpowered as local is nowyou have to remember that this will make life harder on the attacker aswell everyone is screaming how they wont be able to detect pirates early enough if local is removed in its current form however pirates also wont be able to find you as easily coupled with this small change to overview i think this would be an acceptable solution for everyone  except the whiners p  
if alliances wouldnt try and take control of several regions at once this problem would be trivial as smaller space is easier to control with the same amount of members than larger space this change would force most alliances to reconsider their territorial aspirations giving way to new alliances aswell as making room for a lot more players in betweenalliances being able to control fewer systems at the same time is only a good thing bob ra and goonswarm are the perfect examples why
im surprised noone has mentioned the fact that ccp themselves have commented on the use of local as an intel tool and that it isnt what they wantremoving the list of people in system from local doesnt do anything other than remove the intel tool people can still talk on it if they wish but they might give themselves away
signed
something like a personscanning multispec probe no pinpointing anything but telling you what there is to be foundedit and signed to looking at local a compulsory chat channels member list shouldnt be the intel tool id prefer some kind of fastcycling module to replace local for intel and i wouldnt even be against it giving more information than localoh and preferably dont let cloaked ships show up in this scanner
agreed
the scanning system needs an overhaul when that is done then it will be time to reasess the situation and i believe that is already on teh drawingboard at ccpuntil their is a viable scanning system which doesnt involve the npcer spamming scan and the attacking player getting bored and frustrated then removing local wouldnt be a good idea tbh with the current state of the game removing local would favor the attacker too much in 00 for a start attackers would gravitate toward low truesec systems and just roam the belts all day at least thats what i would do
if you want to remove local you need to replace the scanning system with something that actually works longer scanning ranges automatic scanning  a radar screen in the ui  instead of the current system then you need to deal with cloakers too in some wayattackers do have an advantage they will go to the 10 truesec systems where they know the rattersminers will be sitting there cloaked they will paralyze all of the attractive parts of 00 to the point where they become useless
the idea is terrible unless rewards obtained by being in space in 00lowsec are increased substantially by moving everything to const chat it makes it so a small recon gang can shut down the ratting in a constilation in not just a single system if rewards are increased such that the risk of ratting with these hostiles around is worth the reward then i would be for this change
i agreeas it is now a good fight could happen but one side sees the number in local spike quickly and before the enemy loads or hit warp to the fight the other side calls for an evacuate remove local and you give people who specialize in covert operations a role if people are smart enough to use them then again they dont even need to be covert ops but it just makes them better there are plenty of other situation where local is used purely for intelligence purposes bacon was an extension of that but it will always remain a problem until its ajusted just make it not update until you talki believe one argument ccp brought up in the past is without local space would feel empty and such the game would suffer without it space is big and an empty void it should feel like that spruce up the scanning a bit to compensate and make it not so cumbersome
ccp has a plan
the planned orca should be able to fill the role when rigged and fitted for cargo space
i think this has nothing to do with datacore alts i think what they mean is like you have a 1 chance of getting a t2 bpo after doing mepecopyinginvention work
all of what is said above and moremore damage  or energy neuted or jam chance more radius of damagemore capability  explode no matter what unless shot down do one of the two following regarding maneuverability 1  allow the use of the covert ops cloak2  drastically increase the speed of a cloaked stealth bomber to make approach from off grid a viable tacticmy two isk
how about a way to vote to consolidate shares my corp has a few dozen shareholders  no idea why  and 90 of them are inactive characters effectivly making corp votes meaningless
i dont understand why everyone is trying to take all the risk out of owning stock owning stock is risky that is why the reward can be great here is what i think should be done make stock a physical item like ammo this would allow it to be openly traded on the market the corp would produce stock certificates at the station where it is going to make its ipo the stock would be offered for sale and traders would buy that stock making it a market tradeable object would also provide basic charts that traders could use to work the market the corporation would set up a dividend percentage that they could change through an announcement maybe through an automated email to all stakeholders lowering a dividend would probably cause the price of the stock to fall just like rl the corporation would be required to issue fiscal reports on a quarterly basis the price of the stock would drop if profits were down from the previous quarter just like rl ccp should just let the market take care of things as far as voting stock is concerned there could either be voting and nonvoting stock or the corporation would just have to maintain 51 stake more likely they would need to maintain a much smaller stake as voter apathy permits control with a stake in the 20 range in order to make the stock object work it might be able to function like a reusable neural implant when you buy the stock object you would file it read implant it and that would create a flag that would allow you a vote each one adds up and the voting mechanics would call that property to see how many votes you get ccp shouldnt be too concerned about scams even with a ton of regulation rl still has enron potential look what happened when that scandal broke everyone realized that a previously highly valued stock was worthless and the price plummeted this is exactly what should have happened as i said before owning stock is risky the value of the stock absolutely should not be directly tied to a corp wallet or asset valuation this is because the amount of money in the wallet or assets do not represent future profitability especially for a financial or trading corp future profitability is a factor that typically reflected in price the stock is worth exactly what someone is willing to pay at a given moment from many of the comments it sounds like players think that stocks are bonds and the dividend is the interest stocks create a massive inflow of capital into the corp at the ipo but after that stock value increases help the stake holders in the corp only from the increased valuation if they sell stock or if used by the corporation as assets that can be borrowed againstin conclusion stocks are risky stocks are not bonds stocks should be market tradeable objects that are out of the control of the corp unless they buy them back and go private market tradable objects would automatically enable charting lastly voting stock could be be modeled after implants that would alter a vote property im interested to hear what others think about this idea
no be the whale fit all expanded cargoholds in the low load up on valuables and be sure to enter in the bio that you like the idea of space whaling
space whales should be a top priority
space whales are number 1 
1 to silicon based space lifeform that are harmless some nasty pirate will most likely shove a few heavy missiles into its arse and lol at what happens
simple answer signednot so simple answer make the eve universe a little more interesting with interactive background like the passing comet ideas spacewhales moving asteroids etc etc space is so extremely static right now its rather lifeless
space whales nominiature giant space hamsters yes
ok funnybut lets see a space whale being a multicellular being living of reactions form harvested planetary or gas cloud origins how by chemically reacting those materials they scoop up from said planets or cloudshunt them down and get yourself the endproduct of those reactions of course they depend on the planetsclouds visited by the whale in question  aka pretty random  could be stuff like tungsten carbide fullerides and other reaction results or various drugs  from the clouds visiting variation you know might actually be a good idea
i say put them inhmmmmm does my vote count even though i wrote the story
btw if you do read the story could you post your thoughts thanks
well of course it wouldsign alll ov yu musht shign
well i for one wouldnt mind the odd reference in eve to dune and whales in eve might just be like navigators of the space guild in duneperhaps a religiogenetic experiment gone wrong yet inexplicably brilliant by amarrian scientists on corpses of amarrian devoters mummified and transmogrified into a whalelike navigator with a special ability to traverse empire or something
while whack a mole may be unappealing to large spaceholders  it is not too much to ask that a spaceholding entity commit to regular patrols to ensure that their space is secure some element of whack a mole is actually what is needed to counterbalance the current trench warfareabsentee landlord of pos sovereignty the key is simply to find a balance where a spaceholding defender must exercise the appropriate amount of patrolling in response to roaming incursions by light gangs currently spaceholding defenders can all but ignore light gangs entering their territory but pos maintenance is a grind trading out a large part of the pos grind for a more active patrolling mechanic would i think be fair as long as defense patrols are more fun than pos logisticsthe premise im thinking would work best would be to divvy up the sov benefits amongst more mechanics than just pos so that ccp can make pos logistics easier  reduce the reward from pos and the work that is needed can also be reduced  and one or more fwesque systems can be put in to carry the benefits that have been taken away from pos
i dont agree with the whackamole comment if you feel you are running around too much whacking moles that is probably a sign you have too much spacewhat i would suggest is activity based sovereignty pos could generate some sovereignty points each day but so should mining ratting and pvping that way an alliance that actively uses an area intensively gets to build up more sovereignty than an alliance that just puts down 5 towers and runs off doing other stuff which is also important i think with regard to the if people could easily destroy in a day what took months to build up this would be unfaircomment from wrangler there is no need for building up in the current system five guys with carriers and jumpfreighters could pos a whole constellation in a day boring yes but certainly doable i see no reason why that should take long to dismantle since it took pretty little effort to put up  certainly less effort than it would take to shoot the posses down again if you had a system where a sovereignty was decided on a constellation basis and b sovereignty was based on activity then you make it possible that smaller gangs can get in on the sovereignty game and by spreading it out over a constellation you at least make it easier to spread blobs out a bit as well in basic terms i would assign a number of points that could be earned with different types of activity say 10 per activity per day with posses mining ratting and pvping all getting a max of 10 points a day then assign an attritionrate  say 1 per day  so if an alliance really uses a constellation daily for a long time they would eventually build up sovereignty points up to 4000  at which point the maximum gain of 40 points per day would be equal to the natural 1 attrition per day and sov would be stable at that level then make it possible for people to also lose 10 points per activity per day  in case of ratting and mining people from other alliances ratting or mining in your constellation would cost you points that would lead to a system where an alliance entrenches more and more the longer they live somewhere if they live somewhere for a year it would take about 3 months to degrade their sov completely back to 0  you could also make the maximum loss of sov bigger or smaller depending on how fastslow you want it to be possible to lose longheld spacei think it would make it sufficiently difficult for people not to just take your space in a few days time and with posses also adding sov in this system a defender could even afford not to show up for minor incursions without being immediately threatened in their sovereignty at the same time if a defender would let a group of 20 recons constantly haunt them in their stationsystems their sov gain would stop and probably start to decline slowly

agreed this is a pretty important part of the game especially with so many khanid and achuran players involved in major rp

yes achura need some love
i was told to sign this as a proud boma minion i do so
the yuraitenshin zaibatsu has more intelligent and educated work put into the achura backstory than the writers at ccp could ever hope towe have been working on it for a solid year we would glady get together with gingerabraxas and folks to get something worked out  we will even do all the work for free seriously though this is absurdly overdue and now all we have is a bunch of achura running around like the the deteis version of data from star trek the jinmei are even more of a mystery and i am sure there have to be some individuals or groups running around out there trying to create some culture same with the vherokior and khanidmore than anything else this just reeks of the complex fullerene shard fiasco you have people who are working their asses off to move the storyline along or at least branch it out and get some canonical info and you write chronicles about gallentean spraypaint afficianados anything you introduce in game needs to be a much higher priority than some fantasy  material for everyone who already got tired of roleplaying i fully support this initiative but i am going to pod grak repeatedly if this results in the loss of a years worth of both public and private storyline development tread lightly but you have my support
signedthere are enough of us achurans out therewe should have some history of our own
more then needed
pretty please with sugar on top more prime fiction  good but more prime fiction with information were all dying to know  even better its not just doing those that  role play the third bloodlines a favor but everyone who interacts with them too
i agree with this 100 and would like to add that whats needed is not simply the shortstory style of chronicle that weve been seeing lately but rather chronicles with actual background information such as the crystal boulevard vitoc and the sarpati family

as a slave in bomas nation i am forced to agree with him
link to previous post which is lockedshort version of the above tldr as far i am aware nothing has changed since last posting about this problem as mission mining having lower income at least compare to actually mining which make them extreme unattractive for the solo miner
eh i have encountered the first bug i think though not sure but pretty much what happens is i will lock onto like 4 targets or whatever and the drones pick a random target from either of these and sometimes pick multiple targets which honestly lol kinda helps i dont have to pick one target and tell my drones to sick him and switch back they are already attacking another lolalthough there is something that might be a bug that i have encountered it is the annoying things of trackingi brought my mega to a mission area loaded w 5 heavies there were 2 frigs left i sicked the drones on them expecting them to go down easily but the drones werent hitting i figure it is probably because they are pretty big so i go and get some medium drones   i have been using medium drones for a long time now and have like never had a problem w them not hitting npc frigates   anyway i load up these drones and still they are not hitting these are medium drones not hitting so i say hmm thats weird so i go get a full set of 5 small drones and i just sit there cant go any smaller and it takes like 2030 minutes to kill 2 frigs w my dronesi know your probably asking why i didnt use smaller guns but 1 this is a hard l3 mission which kinda requires my bs and i dont have a bc atm or cruiser  lost the cruiser to fw and the bc to a gate camp a while ago  so this is another issue that should be addressed as i said i have been using mediums for the longest time and have never had a problem w them hitting small targets in fact i would frequently in l2s just warp in my vexor and spit out my drones and agress the whole mission and let my drones kill them all  was to lazy to train drones to lvl 5 was going to take a while   but anyway this might be another bug that needs to be fixed as wellalso 1 for your topic i havent encountered these bugs but they seem problematic
proof of this plzoh and thumbs up for this support
yes this would be a useful change
for goddess sake stop this replace it with more lp you know or should know that is the equivalent of saying nerf it to the ground if you add more lp the value will drop to 10 isklp in no time re read this thread removing loot t1 plenty of discussion since your last visit but ccp dont like people blitzing missions it will increase the speed at wick isk enter the game they like mission that require time to complete and time to salvage ccp has tried to reduce straight isk acquisition from mission for years moving as much as possible to lootsalvage
ill certainly agree on that adding more lp is not a buff at all  2x the lp equals half the isklp most of the rewards for missions come from killing not from completing ive gotten a rash of angel extravaganza level 4 recently so use those i make 31 million in bounties probably 2030 million in loot and salvage on average and less than 10 million from completing the mission in pure cash terms neglecting lp loot and salvage over 90 of my earnings come from bounties blitzing missions will hardly increase the rate of isk addition  it would lower it dramatically which is why people dont do it even with bigger completion rewards the only mission i would do any differently is recon 13  i wouldnt stand around killing hacs id just kill the bbs and bcs and move on making the blitz tactic less pathetic isnt going to result in an explosion of the money supply
if lp is worth so little why to people still flock to the high quality agents oh and i just turned in 200k lp for 200million iskand when you blitz a mission you arent getting all the bounties from all the rats but you are getting the rewardbonus faster overall i think that would be less isk entering than running the full mission i do support removing meta0 loot from wrecks but i cannot support removing meta 14 loot at this time
true but that is the reason of the 70 km from acceleration gate to gate and half of the reward from lootsalvage with the right set up you can farm missions for bounties but removing looting wioll make it more common not less1000 isklp but the conversion before the lp store was nearer to 5000 isk lp
who said lp is worth little we said its highly prone to inflation  if you double the supply of lp youll halve the profit it produces per unit roughly speaking everything bought for pure lp and cash will crash in price everything that requires tags as its limiting reagent ie faction gear  will stay about the same since the supply of tags isnt changing and the price of tags will go up to compensate for the price of lp going down you might get a few l5 missioners extra who adjust to these new prices but i expect that effect to be minimal since so few people are at all interested in l5s or lowsec in general  and capable of running them i cant do a full analysis without good data on the demand curves of assorted faction gear but i can safely say that adding lp will not increase the total return on lp earned in the game significantly itll be a paper bonus only
interesting idea
removing t1 meta0 loot drops will help the t1 market for sure but will drastically influence the mid and high end mineral market in highsec spacethis is not necessarily a bad thing
removing tech 1 nonnamed drops sounds fine to memaking named items into produceable hmmmm sounds pretty boring as all items will drop to researched bpo prices after a few weeks and not really change much besides ccp in one of those threads said it might be something like instead of looting a malkuth cruise missile launcher you loot a meta 2 component and then turn it into a malkuth cruise missile launcher via the bpo sounds like an unneccesary step to me
i hardly ever post on the forums as id rather just play but id like to offer 2 cents on thisi agree completely that flying an industrial into 00 with no plan is asking for trouble on the other hand theres a variety of gank situations which happen  particularly to new players  which are deeply annoying put people off the game and which are sometimes not very realistic insofar as nobody would tolerate such a situationa few random examples from my younger days1 youre doing your first trading run in a lowsec system you fly in a shuttle case it out looks ok you go back and get your main ship fly in check it out aain make it to port and pick up your cargo you undock and someone blows you away with a single cruise missile while youre still reaching for the warp control huh2 you go  npc  ratting in 00 for the first time feeling very brave after a nailbiting struggle you finally destroy your first battleship  victory what a sense of accomplishment until you get blobbed by 10 ships while youre still bruised and bleeding3 gate campers enough said someone suggested above that security grading should mean something rather than just being highsec and lowsec and having different npcs i tend to agree and thought it worked the same way as that person did at first its wellbalanced for a single player game but as a solo rather than a team player i just give the lowsec systems a big pass right now because it doesnt seem worth exploring in search of juicier npcs unless youre flying anything smaller than a battleship  i exaggerate but you get the idea some brief suggestions1 yes lose insurance if concord kills you this is realistic2 even in 00 some radius around gates and stations  eg 5km  should have a risk of causing concord or faction ships to appear stations and gates are the economic infrastructure of eve no society allows its infrastructure to be degraded in the real world we have real crime where ships or trucks are ganked by criminals but it doesnt usually happen right outside ports or at freeway intersections it happens in remote places3 players dont leave it all up to ccp when you get ganked and you know youre doomed selfdestruct and deny the gankers their spoils that cuts their lulz short faster than anything else but i would like eve not to tell gankers i am sding let them find out the hard way  just as i did when i got ganked 
please read before you throw your two cents in this is about high sec and your examples are all low and nul sec also totally off topic and no not enough said but thats a whole different ball of waxrealism has nothing to do with this argument the insurance hits on concord death will not stop the suiciding of multibillion isk haulers it will hurt new players who dont yet understand the sec status of systems and want to blast someoneagain real world analogies fail also off topic in the real world someone who just blew up a truck would not watch the police destroy their car and then have to stand on the street corner they would be hauled into custody and tried asuming they werent killed fighting the police at the scene of course in the real world the police often fail to get their man they do not have superweapons and they can be killed by return fireconcord and insurance have no real world paralells they are game mechanics one designed to offer retribution for crime in high sec and the other designed to ofset the cost of pew pewyour first sentence here is the only part i completely agree with sadly you didnt follow up with get a scout fly smart and warp to zeroit takes two minutes to complete a self destruct the action will all be over by then unless you want to pod yourself after the gankgalanps if you would like to argue about any of the above please start a thread in gd this is about suicide ganking in empire and you are totally off topic
bounty huntingrequirements to become a bounty hunterstandings with the bounty hunting corporation blah blah inc of 20 or better to even speak to a bounty agenthave a scannable list of locally placed bounties available or an option to name the bountied player you intend to killregister your intent to hunt this pilot flagging you both as kos to one another  red flashy to one another if your killed by your bountied target you must reregister your intent to kill said pilot but now with a 20k isk reregistration fee this fee scales up each time you return after failing to kill your intended target until it reaches a balance with the bountied players bounty at which point you will no longer be able to register to hunt said playerbounty hunters and their targets are immune from sec status hits for attacking andor killing one another until the bounty is either collected or the bounty hunter unregisters their intent to kill a bountied playerthere are no kill rights generated by a bounty hunter killing a bountied player ie the bountied player does not have a 24 hr period were hesheit can go hunt down and kill the bounty hunter that killed them  may need to be tweaked some the reverse of this is also true the bounty hunter does not get kill rights if killed by the bountied player rather they must reregister their intent to kill the bountied player  see above corporations of bounty hunters can register intent to kill a bountied player for a nominal fee at which point every member of the corporation becomes kos to the bountied player  this may need some standings tweaking etc to register intent to collect this doesnt address suicide ganking but it does at least open and make viable the profession of the bounty hunterstormwind
uhm just have concord instantly jam you or something and be done with it why even waste time on something such as this just pull a ultima online guards type thing might as well you die anyways just make it quicker
they already do insta jam web scramble and energy neut you and your drones
with a slight change shift the insurance payouts to the gankee instead if the gank ships arent insured the gankee gets the default payment also if you make a mistake and shoot a friend thats in a different corp he can return your insurance back to youthis system wouldnt change any of the real mechanics of suicide ganking it would just shift the riskreward a bit
for christ sakewhere is the problem1 there is and should be no 100 safe place in eve   go play wow if you dont like it 2 there should be no insurance payout for ships killed by concord  simple solutionrisk vs reward just for the record i dont suicide gank  except macro miners  and i as such dont like suicide gankers but this is eve no insurancepayout for ships killed by concord  problem solved 
i dont think you understand what i am talking about they are not going to force people to go into low sec and shoot other people by forcing them into a pvp npc corp they reduce their ability to travel freely in high sec raise the risk of being ganked legally anywhere and give them good reason to join player corps which can then be war deced where as right now you cant compete with some afk macro miners setting in caldari provisionsif they would pull the guards away from the gates and put them at the stations then militias could roam around in high sec attacking the opposing militias logistics but the stations themselves would be safe unless the militias were feeling brave enough to take down those tough npc fleets and pvp at the same time then the militias could legally camp stations and entire high sec systems while players would be either forced to move into a player corp or risk being hunted this would also allow for smuggling as long as the customs agents and stuff are not much like the instagank concord gods honestly i dont know if they are my only run in with them was in a frig a long time ago and i got instantly popped but was surrounded by bss so didnt surprise me if you made their damage per ship realistic though people could tank just long enough to get the goods into the station if they warped to zero and fitted for tanking and fast running
considerthe motive for suicide ganking is usually one of the following1 thievery2 logistical assault3 griefthe reason for thievery is simple people hauling 1 billion isk worth of material in a 500000 isk ship with no defenses make for an appetizing targetthe reason for logistical assault is simple alliances and corporations hide their logistical and industrial base behind alts who live in npc corporationsthe reason behind grief is usually a mixture of boredom and schadenfreudeof these 1 and 2 can be dealt with while 3 will be an eternal problem no matter what mechanics are built to bar them as for 1 i suggest that the main reason people take to suicide ganking for thieving is twofold first its incredibly profitable in the short term second besides can flipping there is no real mechanism in eve online to steal from other players  for good or ill  i would suggest that a reasonable solution to this would be to create a module which allows one to steal from other players a pickpocket module if you must activation time of the module would take x minutes and upon activation the individual would become flagged to the target and their corporation limitations for the module could be built in as to what it can and cannot steal as well as where it can and cannot be used also a defensive module could be designed  similar to warp stabs for warp scramsas to 2 at some point characters should be ejected from npc corporations and forced into a corporation that is war decable the npc corporations exist as a solution for new characters and yet whenever i meet someone with a character 4 or 5 years old it would seem heshe is in an npc corporation im left to believe that all freighter pilots are in npc corporations perhaps limiting the size of ship one can fly in an npc corporation to cruisers or battlecruisers would go a long way to eliminating the scourge of logistical alts hiding in npc corporationsi would say its devastatingly boring to the point of making me miss grinding in everquest not painful there are no options available to being a legitimate pirate in high security make it so that individuals with outlaw status can engage without instant concord death and are chased through the system by faction ships and engaged by gatestation guns  even to podding  and i bet youll see a marked increase in empire pvp but decrease in suicide ganking im willing to wager that a number of the suicide gankers out there would rather be fighting targets that fight back  and are in fact trying to provoke such a response over the long term  and given the option of hunting in belts and planets versus gatecamping and cargo scanning afk industrials they would take the formerlegitimize piracy the problem you are seeing is a reaction to 1 boredom2 safety of npc corporationspeople who want small gang or solo pvp are becoming bored because lowsec and 00 is filled with gatecamps and blobs and empty of targets  the wolves own lowsec and 00 and the sheep have fled to high sec the predators are merely following the prey find a way to make piracy viable and you find the means to decrease suicide ganking and mission breakinscreate a pirate faction that can be joined by players and corporations make them kos to militias let them steal
ive been thinking about the quoted things for a while i think a larger sec hit is too harsh even worse it is more likely to stop the pirates than the griefers i am a missionrunner myself but i would not want to see hisec ganks disappear forcing them to use some more brains for the job would be really great on the other handi think most of the established mission runners would agree with me on that this is why the void insurance for concord victims idea is so popular this stops griefers nicely while having lesser impact on those who actually do in for the profitthat is why i am sad to see that ccp is reluctant to implement this simple solution they say that it may impact newer players too muchok i dont know if its been proposed before but i think i have a solutiontiered insurance loss1  full payout to concord victims in frigate sized ships2  75 payout for cruiser size hulls lost to concord3  50 payout for battlecruiser size hulls4  25 payout for battleship size hulls  roughly an insurance fee refund the reasoning is obvious you cant really be considered a new player if you pilot a battleship numbers can be tweaked but thats the basic idea
there are plenty of ways to steal from people in eve if it was actually about getting a return the pirates would be raiding corporate and alliance logistics in 0 and making a fortune the reason why they are not is because they are not easy targets and pirates are a middle ground of individual that are not willing and not able to pvp with the big boys out in no sec there is nothing wrong with that but this is the path they choose and there is no reason for it to be easy killing macroers and afk pilots is fine by me but there is an equally large majority of pilots that are being targeted for little to no reason as pointed out by numerous testimonies herethe pickpocket thing is just dumb if you want to chase people around and kill them for a profit fight a corp war there is plenty of places where you can run around and be pirates unfortunately those targets have teeth which is the point of low and no sec if your going to go down there you had better be ready to deal with the consequences i do agree that people being inside npc corps is the worst thing for the game as i stated above and will repeat a million timesi agree totallyi am almost 5 years old as a char  and the only time i have spent in an npc corp is when i wasnt playing the gameummmmno wtf are you crazy this is what people are trying to avoidof course you would see a marked increase in empire pvp half the population of the game would turn to piracy because you couldnt be stopped and the whole game would basically be low secno sec everywhere if they wanted to pvp why the hell are they saying that killing afk people is the primary reason to keep ganking i will give you a break to take your foot out of your mouth
better nowabsolutely and i list a way to make pirates legit but they have stipulations if they are in the npc pirate corp they cant come into high security at all if they are in an player corp that is allied with say the guristas as part of faction warfare then they can come into empire space and raid against players that are declared for a militia this would require that player be kicked out of npc corps after a month or so and place into the militia yes what your talking about is old and frustrating but thats why the carebears dont go there there is nothing there worth doing for carebears the few places to run missions and complexes are so amazingly over camped by pirates and alliances that going there is an exercise in futility is it a mission runners fault that they enjoy running missions no its ccps fault for placing about 80 of the agents in caldari space 19 in the other empire space and 1 outside of high secthe wolves are not following the prey the wolves are down in 0 and the carebears are in high sec and the buzzards are the majority of pirates that are spending their day ganking people that are asleep at the wheel or macro mining then there is the refuse that are ganking people just to gank people and that is the problem with why its too profitable and to easy to do every time a freighter with a few billion in cargo is ganked i salute the pirates who did the job their job admirably every time a shuttle is ganked with no cargo and a noob pilot because its funny i post a link to this thread as others have pointed out the pirates are bringing this upon themselvesmission break ins have nothing to do with it if a pirate wants to break into my mission in high sec to steal my loot i will invite him to join my fleet so i can get fleet bonuses if he wants to break into my mission and shoot me in high sec i would like to ask him to wait until i can get fraps running so i can replay this for him later as a what not to do instructional video if he wants to break into a mission in low sec and try to gank me well thats a risk people take going to low sec to run missionsi agree and have said so many times myself in fact i dont see why the pirate factions cant capture control bunkers and such for themselves and make low sec systems fall under the jurisdiction of the guristas sanshas or whoever
suiciding an industrial hauling 5 peoplecharging into iac space to kill a hulk 20 peoplethe problem comes down to one of scale to successfully raid 00 the current feeling is that frigates and cruisers just arent going to cut it having done a good number of runs through 00 i tend to concur where i do encounter a miner hes already out the door to one of 20 poss in system and the defense channel is lighting up like a christmas tree  cva response time 5 minutes on frisun 15 minutes other days   iac 5 minutes     and the response that shows up ive never seen so many battleships in my life show up to kill 1 frigate  given the lack of choices of course people will suicide gank to earn money never said it was good just lobbing idea grenades we dothe chief consequence being that almost 50 of the game is effectively locked out  the 50 where everyone hides i love lowsec lots of fun im just not allowed to go there anymore until i grind my sec status back up and i cant do 00  effectively  because i dont belong to a omg check out our size alliance that has planted a flag in p1554 sure i can run in and out in my frigate but getting chased out by 30 guys in hacs interceptors bships and 5 interdictors gets old the 17th timei think i spent my first month in an npc corp then i joined up with my friends for some piratingwhat people are trying to avoid is the repercussions for hiding behind the fuzzy pillow of empire that ccp has designed everyone kept telling me how brutal and cut throat eve was before i started playing and i have to say this is the biggest bunch of carebears in history the creators and the destroyers hide behind the shield of npc corporations everyone uses stations as base as if it were a game of tag and short of being an idiot there really is no risk to anyone hanging out in high sec empire im willing to bet i could run from one end of empire to the other in a shuttle flagged to everyone in the game and survive and im sure i would win that bet just as im sure i bet i could make 1 billion isk mining my brains out in some ice field in gallente spacei know my anecdotal evidence doesnt matter but when my 1000000 bounty self can afkauto pilot 30 jumps in a hoarder with 3 jaguars and a pile of tech 2 im not scared
have the pirate faction work just like the militia and this sounds like a great ideathe people in 00 are not wolves they are more like wild sheep wolves travel in small packs and are incredibly territorial but also wander far afield in the search for prey  wolves do not hold territory so much as chase off anything that enters while they are around wild sheep on the other hand herd together in huge numbers and declare dominion over the fields and they respond to invasion by gathering together and chargingthe wild sheep are still the same sheep as the ones in the fences and pens of the farmers  the ones the wolves want to get to but cant because an electric fence keeps them out theyre just sheep that have realized that they can actually fight backthematically capturing and holding a position isnt really a pirates cup pirates charge in loot what they can carry and get out before the sheep notice whats going on and organize a response
so what the goonies are doing in hisec is kind of like sheep on sheep action sounds kind of dirty
lol the goons are just exposing the natural flaws in a game mechanic that tries to segregate safe and dangerous space  pvp versus pve if you will the same thing happens in every game where there is segregated play space ccp likes to talk big but lets be honest high sec empire is safespace for 90 of the population there members of empire npc corporations  with the exception of militias  are 99 safe as a function of character kills per day i would be surprised to discover if suicide ganking killed more than 3 as a function of character kills of the entire population i would be surprised to discover that more than 1 of the characters in game had been suicide gankedid actually like to see the statistics from the game rather than just assume that what we see on the forum is reflective of reality in any way whatsoever
come on arkania dont play it off like that is a realistic option by not posting what you originally wrote which is a license to simply gank people in empire space under the guise of it being an attempt at provoking pvp i totally agree with you that npcs corps are the majority of the problem but giving pirates free roam is a horrible idea its not a matter of making things completely safe its a matter of reducing random violence inside high sec to a bare minimum players would be forced to settle for one risky proposition or another but at least they know the risk and the risk of pirates attacking a group of 5 that run lvl 4s for 24 hours 3 nights a week is pretty slim compared to a group of 2 that hauls down 10 billion in ice mining a week i am writing up a proposal about that stuff right now and will link it when i post it but with success comes risk and it allows folks who want to be incognito to remain incognito but makes those hiding behind the npc corps walls that are making billions wide open and lit up like a light house
well most or all whines that are spewed on the forums are based either by emo rage or some personal morality conflict that has no basis on any type of logic or reality with in the frame work of the game players are trying to use rl scenarios to support their argument in game which makes little or no sense either since half of the crap they say happens in real life is either only half correct or just plain wrong
i think a discussion is pointless ccp should continue to design this game according with their ground philosophies the ground philosophies that  in my view  are  sandbox   as is the players to the greatest extent decide what happens in the eveuniverse good or bad in this case the original faction warfaredesign  asis  goes against this very philosophy any alliance that dedicates a lot of time to doing factional warfare can still do so now what i mean by that is that any negative consequences that follows with allowing alliances to participate are already there the shielding of new pvpers already comes through the militia corps and extending faction warfare to further deepen the complexities of this game by bringing it out into 00 seems in line with reason and good game designfaction warfare in essence is not just a way for people new to the game to easily get into pvp it also is a means to deepen the involvment for all players those in alliances or not with the storylines of this game not just hardcore rpalliances wish to make a stand for a faction other alliances do as well to address the argument where people mean that fw would become too dangerous if big entities moved into it well what are the faction other than big entities if goons decided to stop dedicating themselves to 00 and pursued total dominance of faction warfare then alliance mechanics isnt going to stop them corporations can already support thousands of players so that is pretty much a moot point no the argument against allowing alliances in has nothing to do with the quantity of players into it it has nothing to do with skilled pvpers making younger pvpers miserable  because thats already happening with organized corps already being in fw  the argument against fw doesnt even have anything to do with the fact that choices should matter  eg you either choose to be in an alliance or you do not   because any alliance that join fw and dedicate itself to that already made a choice to stand for that faction thats the choice involved the consequence is that said alliance now can be attacked anywhere by the opposing faction any alliance that choose not to join will be able to roam free without that same consequencei strongly hope ccp will move allowing alliances into fw to the top of the prioritylist and urge people to stand up for this as well
signgreat work that this is possible at all but now were hooked and neeeed dataaa
i would like to have a prepackaged os and game that i can download from ccp just give me everything i need to run the game on supported hardware
count me in for the closed beta toolinux rocksxen
heh heh grid lags for five minutes as the enemy fleet jumps their second titan and support ships inwhen lag is gone everyone  and i mean everyone titans included  is in pods looking at their wrecks and the 45 dreadnoughts that mordus legion brought in to take down the titan pilot whos been eluding them for the last 6 monthsmission running is more or less a different version of mining both activities are dead boring the macro miners have macros to automate the process of mining why cant we atthekeyboard players have the same advantages have a module that pipes ore directly from our hulks to nearby gantries which hold the ore while waiting for another hauler to pull up alongside and empty itbut this is a mission running thread not a mining threadmissions do need a little more variety but not much more  theyre easy because theyre predictable people still lose ships due to killing the triggers in blockade for exampleit would be nice when picking a miningcourier agent that one didnt suddenly have to clear out level 4 serpentis blockade it would also be nice to be able to get missions from an internal security agent without suddenly having to run 40k cubic metres of goods in 3k cubic metre boxes to a system 9 jumps away within 2 hoursid like to see more combat missions that relied on jammingscramblingwebbing  the usual utility functions that are bread and butter for pvp players id like to see escort missions where we have to protect a freighter running goods to a station deep inside deadspace for example this would be a gate camp light for the pve players to get used to some of the more common scenarios in corporate warsmissions that have to be completed by a deadline or they are instantly failed  no early completion bonus just a fail if you take too long  heck pick up a copy of xwing xwing vs tie fighter or xwing alliance for some nifty pve mission ideas which dont take a heck of a lot of workwould more pve be a bad thing if all the new missions served as interactive tutorials in how to do role x in an alliance warzonetackling logistics sniping speed tanking jamming etc  these are all things that players need to learn in order to fully participate in fleet warfare wouldnt it make life easier for established alliances if their new recruits at least had a passing familiarity with how to fit a frigate for tackling battleshipsyes there are corporations which specialise in training but none of them seem to be available for casual 23 hours a week players like myself  
heh  good point i actually like hte idea of them showing up in a mission  appearing out of the blackness of space ok mr mission runner weve been waiting for you for weeks time to pay for your crimes against our people see if you can take this  as a bunch of 7 figure bounty bs bounce into the mission areasafer for the industrialist and yummier
i agree with most of the ops ideas very well thought out and presented posti disagree at the point where a module normally not fit has to be added likely weakening the ship and possibly pushing missions towards a group effortany changes that would push a group effort are counterproductive as most people do not want to rely on others to run those missions and make iskthe rest of the ops ideas i agree with dynamic content would help dampen predictabilityi add an idea about missions for the op to consider as wellthe npcs could further be improved by having revenge as part of their ai your flying home and get pulled out of warp by several npcs of the faction you just destroyed in the mission looking for revenge this wouldnt happen all the time but occasionally it would be an interesting twist
i disagree with many of the proposals hereyes it is silly to see a cloud of rats blissfully standing by while you slaughter their mates 60k away however building a more robust ai has consequences ai like all calculations eat cpu cycles consider the increased server load to improve every nonplayer ship currently engaged in a mission across the eve universe  im not too worried this will be pushed through as i personally dont think it can be done without things grinding to a halt tweaks perhaps by talented programmers but decent ai in missions seem out of reach tarminic for the love of god please stop attempting to make me run missions in groups you are pandering to your own playstyle while ignoring others it might stun you to hear this but sometimes im tired and just want to run a mission alone not always but sometimes its not that i dont have friends its not that im antisocial  generally  sometimes i just want some time to myselfeve pvp is already groupcentric solo fighting has been pushed to the edge of extinction now youd like to push pve in that direction tell you what if you support making 00 ratting a group effort then ill go along with the missions as group efforts hows that or better yet lets make mining a group effort make em have to have buddies to mine those roids eh even in empire just like youd like to do with missionsdoes your proposal now seem a bit unbalanced in that light missions should have to be done in groups but mining and ratting noti do not support the removal of t1 equipment simply because there always has to be a lower tier of quality currently we have t1nonnamed named t2 and faction removal of t1 nonnamed just makes named modules become the new t1 nonnamed it removes distinctions from the game  note how similar this is to the local fastfood joint which doesnt sell small fries they only have medium large and extralarge finally your statement that removing unnamed t1 loot will make looting a bit faster  is incorrect honestly if youre looting then youre probably salvaging therefore youre close enough to pull crap from the wreck anyway
removing unnamed loot will only remove some mineral income most of my income comes from salvage and highquality named t1 items  specific large laser or projectile turrets will sell for 1m isk in hiematar for example  the unnamed t1 items are entering the market in large numbers from mission runners who dont refine  or cant do multiplicationdivision  my unnamed t1s usually end up as mineralsedit id just like to point out that in my experience graphical lag has more often resulted from nebulas and dust clouds rather than the numbers of enemy ships in the deadspace pocket one nebula appears to be made of hundreds of rotating overlapping intersecting semitransparent cloud pixmaps these cause far more problems than the several hundred polygons used for all the ships in the pocket
someone please think of us poor isk farmers  ok serious note eve is not a porsche while eve players seem more loyal than most gamers tend to be extremely fickle make it unattractive to play eve for one reason or another  such as with a price hike  and youll end up alienating a significant part of your customer basein eve as with all other mmos premium is not the key volume is volume is not achieved by alienating your customers by raising prices volume is achieved by offering a good product and having competitive pricing the key here is competitive pricingraising the price of gtcs  as has been done with the 60 day gtc being more than twice as expensive as the old 30 day gtc and almost as expensive as the old 90 day gtc will only make your customers upsetplease note that im saying this as a gtc seller who made sure to stock up on 90 day gtcs before this happened im making almost 50 more isk on each gtc i sell these days which is good for me ingame but i still think it totally sucks and im no longer sure if i can keep selling gtcs for isk nor keep up running eight accounts of my own
hear hear
probably because ccp wants to make the same money per subscription and youre going through a middle man to get gtcs and said middleman also wants to make moneyyou do realize youre asking why its more expensive to buy at a retail store than directly from the manufacturer right
yes something many of the guys here are missing is that although an established industrialist might be able to build components better themselves it will tie up several of their precious manufacturing job slots in order to be a one man band this idea therefore encourages the formation of proper supply chains in order to produce finished productsthe way i see it newbie builders will be running these component jobs in order to produce components that the more experienced builders need for their jobs thus keeping the experienced builders slots available to react better to changing market forces ideally these components would have an extremely low materialtime cost per unit thus negating the need to tie up research slots for these partsfor example you could haveframework  001m3 each  produces 1 per run material costtritanium 40  so optimal me of 8 time to build 1 minutenow for example a shuttle bp will change from the current requirement of 2500 tritanium toframework 25  40 tritanium each plating 30  50 tritanium each this will have the knock on effect of greatly reducing the research requirements to have a perfect me print of a given bpo  with this example from me 500 down to me 6  thus relieving some of the pressure on the empire research slots yes more blueprints will require researching however the level they need to be researched to is much less than beforeedit for mathematical inaccuracies in my example
it worked to a degree in swg but the part that made it work they are not consideringin order to make the components idea work you need a system like swg had where each component is researched and there is a difference based on materials then they are combined for an end product that is uniquei was a long time crafter in swg until the nge sadly eves system does not provide the necessary quality of goods that swg had id like to see such a system but giving just t1 components for the sake of it in eve without adding in all the other complexities just creates a barrier for new players and does not promote market health or cooperation
t1 construction for ships in particular is far too simple compared to its capital and t2 cousins turn it into a real professionand maybe help keep the minerals i mine myself are free lot away from the market
ill attack this issue from another angle t1 components could effectively allow for mineral compression this would add huge amounts of actually interesting possibilities to the process i dont support the idea of adding any barriers to t1 production ill say that flat out the t1 market is where people cut their teeth on production and it works fairly well in its current incarnationto implement components for t1 while not adding barriers the build times for the end products need a look the total time to build an item shouldnt increase with the addition of components drop the end product time to factor in how long it takes to cook its components to get this to work ccp would have to make t1 components essentially replace minerals for all nont2 items that means wed be looking at a twopatch process before this idea could be completed the first patch would introduce the bps for the components then after a giving people time to research and build up a supply of components ccp could make the actual change releasing it as a oneshot deal would be disastrous for a few weeks
curious what happened
the majority of fights that i have been in and seen in 00 have been nano vs nano sniper bs vs sniper bs etc rarely have i seen nano vs sniper bs etci fly nano ships and sure its nice to choose your fights etc but imagine what happens if nanos are nerfed so they are unplayable you would have 15 battleships spending hours to go like 40 jumps and once you get there they probably wont even fight so great you just wasted a ton of time or you could fly down there in nano ships and not waste as much timenot to mention with the number of titans there are now what is your fleet supposed to do when there is a dictor bubble on a gate with a cloaked titan fly out of the bubble at 150ms but no wait fit a mwd even that probably wont get you out alive and then at that what do you want caldari to do gimp there tanks
the reason for this is actually quite simple and has little to do with nanos being overpowered roaming in a nano gang is much faster which means potential targets have less time to respond and you are better able to disengage  rather than safe spotting and cloaking and waiting till they leave  remote rep battleship gangs are great they arnt that common because it takes a lot of time to move around in them and its relatively hard to catch hose easy ganksi agree with jade here people who are getting killed by nanos in equal numbers are not bringing comparable ship quality if someone shows up in 10 nanohacs and a falcon you need to be showing up with 10 t2 fit battleships and a falcon here is a simple fact 10 pulse armageddons  t2 fit  will volley most nano ships this combined with that in a ten man gang they will have low transversal if they move to range or are at close range  low transversal to part of the gang  high risk of getting webbed  means the ten t2 pulse armageddons  especially if they are rr  will win almost every time if the nano gang engages at all  if you have a bubble you can generally kill one or two even if they run edit  changed t2 battleships to t2 fit battleships like its supposed to be 
thats another thing its not that nano is overpowered it is people not willing to adapt they do the same old thing and when something counters them they complain that its overpowered
i agree that it shouldnt be about whoever blobs wins but the current situation where the fastest wins is no betteras ive said earlier ships have been this fast before with the dual mwdwideboy age of 2004 and in time it was nerfed it was the right thing to do then and its the right thing to do nowben
jade you made your fricken point a million times why they heck you keep coming back like you need to boost your ego back up we all dislike you anyway youre a joke to this game and to the csm now one gives a rats ass about your selfcentered egotistical jade online agenda get over it realize there are two valid sides and your opinion is just that a lame opinion stop trying to defend it like you know whats best for this game thats not your job your job is to listen to the players cuz we know what is best for this game not some asshat that decs noob militia corps and gets his jollies off by camping fw borders puhleeeze get a life
good post s  by jade i fully agree t2 standard nanos are fine and easy to counter now a fully pimped rigged combat boosted snaked out nanoship that goes into crazy territory should a cruiser really be ever able to go over 12kms i dont think so so i fully agree with nerfing the ridiculously fast nanoshipshowever most of the nanowhiners are simply drake pilots who are upset that their drake doesnt pwn t2 pc cruisers like they pwn missionsrats this has been demonstrated by looking at the combat habits of most of the nanowhiners so no i will never support just a nerf to speed modulesshipsalso id like to point out this thread has over 200 replies and only 40ish support thats 20 support doesnt look good for the nanowhiners
nice stereotyping of the petitioning group there considering many pvpers from a wide range of backgrounds think speed has gotten excessive including my favorite friend and polycarbsnake crow  you obviously have no clue20ish support is enough for the forums most people dont actually click the support button and it is not indicative of exact numbers of support within the community that there exists a multitude of threads many pages long attempting to tackle this problem is proof enough that the levelheaded among the community want something done about it
i think that a moderate small nerf to moderate nano fits should be looked at and crazy silly nano fits should be just made less available reworking pirate faction lp stores
no supportnanos are fine learn to pvp
it is not stereotyping it is a simple matter of using google for instance you fly crows and megathrons so if you talk about how a nanohac is totally unbalanced then we know it is certainly a onesided viewpoint in many nanowhine threads i have shown that the op or rabblerousers fly only drakes a few like dhb wildcat actually flies nanos but that is an odditythe thumbsupsupport mechanic is used a lot it is clearly shown to everyone before they make their post and lots of people use it the 3090 day gtc thread has gotten over 70 support tnad that is almost 1000 posts 20 is a very low number for support if you actually looked at popular threads and you know compared them instead of just trolling
cracks his knuckles  stupid filter well first and foremost kyokos very much right about the stereotyping moreover if youd like to check my stats on the morsus mihi killboards out of the 17 different ship types im listed as having flown you
except that this post has a lot of people arguing back and forth and you can only show support once for example no thumbs up on this post because i already posted with a thumbs up earlier look me up on the killboards if you want  ive been flying virtually nothing but nanohacs and nanorapiers so far this year ive killed plenty of nano ships and ive lost a couple of nano shipsnot a drake in sightthe problem with nanos is they essentially have no drawbacks they can choose their fight tank infinite amounts of incoming damage roam fast tackle deal ok damage  all in one handy versatile package im not stupid so i fly them myself  that doesnt mean i think they are balanced or that i will cry when they are gone though
okay ive been largely staying out of this thread but i feel after reading a few of jades posts that i must respondjadefirst and foremost while i generally respect your views quite highly in this area i find myself in very strong disagreement with youto begin with your original argument was that nanos were needed because of blobbing 00 sovereignty and jump bridges it was pointed out that this was not sufficient justification for a universal mechanic that includes both lowsec combat and highsec empire wars at this point you changed tack to your horse archer analogy basically stating that horse archers  nanos  should be completely immune normal infantry  ie anything not nano or nano counter  while i could quibble with your reversal in reasoning i will instead give you the benefit of the doubt and address your current argumentfirst and foremost im going to proceed on the basic assumption that eve is a sandbox and that diversity in pvp is a good thing both of these items reflect statements made by the developers so i feel them to be fairly safe projectionsso lets talk diversity well start with gang setupsprior to the original nano buff you would see pretty much every type of ship in pvp with many different fittings you would see interceptor gangs ganking pretty much anything t1 cruiser gangs making the most of eves diminishing returns by killing much more expensive ships and losing half their gang in the process slow heavy firepower short range bccsbs gangs  not necessarily remote repping  fast moving  in terms of systemtosystem movement  hacrecon gangs electronic warfare whoring gangs snipers supertanked remote reppers capital blobs and  gasp  even nanos whats more all of them were effectivenow lets discuss what you see nowadays thats still effective right now you only see a few of those nanos  for obvious reasons of invulnerability to anything not nano or nanocounter  remote repping gangs  because they can soak up stupid amounts of punishment  capital blobs  because you still have to kill pos  and ewarnanocounter gangs  selfexplanatory what about the items not on the above list wellinterceptorfrig gangs  not much point when nano hacs are just as fast as the old prenano interceptors and have vastly more firepower and survivabilityt1 cruiser gangs  rarely seen because they stand pretty much no chance of killing any of the four still used gang typesheavy nonremoterepping gangs  pretty much nonexistant because they cant kill nanoers very effectively and dont have the tank of the remote repping gang also bc and cs are not much seen in remote gangs due to medium remote reps poor range and repair amount this makes nonfleet command bcs largely irrelevant in todays pvpsnipers  useless without a significant support gang  read blob  due to their vulnerability and the ability of nanoships to be on top of them almost instantaneouslywhile this is by no means an exhaustive list  im too tired to take time for a full list of gang types  it should illustrate fairly effectively that there are a number of playstyles that have been invalidated as a result of the current nano situation this is quite the opposite of diversification and contrary to the developers stated intentions for the gamethis is also quite contrary to the argument that nerfing nanos will reduce diversity the people who make this statement seem to be equating nerf with completely invalidate though for some it may reflect the fact that once nanos are no longer i win buttons vs nonnano and nonnano counter ships they will be useless some people just want their godmode and will resist any change calling for its reduction even if that call for change means they would still be useful afterwards without being omnipotent
the end result of nerfing nanos so that theyre still useful but not i win buttons vs anything but nanos or nanocounters is that you would see more diversity in ships flown and that list of ships and setups would still include nanos funny how that works isnt itnow lets talk playstyles let me begin with an outrageous statementonce upon a time eve was not all about the blobshocking isnt it you used to find a lot more small gang action  as in gang size under ten people not todays small gang ie 30man fleet  and even  gasp  solo work that said lets examine the effect of nanos on each please note that im assuming the nano pilots are competentwell begin with the much despised solo pvp let me preface this with a short disgression eve is a mmo  youre supposed to fly with buddies is a common argument the difference here is that eve is a sandbox mmo meaning its all about choice some people choose to fly solo sometimes to test or show off their skill ships and abilities and theyre still playing with other people the whole timethose people just so happen to be their targets as opposed to their groupmatesanyway back to the effect of nanos on solo pvp simply put if the ship youre flying isnt already a nano counter it will die if it cant get back to the gate or stationor if its not at a gate or station sometimes good piloting can allow you to escape by forcing the nanoer into making a mistake but this can be very difficult especially if youre in a larger slower ship the net result of all of this is that solo pvp in anything not nano or nano counter is pretty much dead blobs have an effect too but while you can avoid blobs if you play your cards right its much harder to avoid nanoerswhat about small gang pvpwell a good nano counter setup requires a number of roles to be filled that are not absolute musthaves in a normal gang you need multiple huginnrapiershyenas to stop the enemy nano gang from moving multiple ewar to jam the nanoers to prevent them from primarying your webbers and taking them out and dps to take out the enemy once you have them locked down optional roles include multiple fast frigates with webs to get into suicide range and lock down the targets and neutralizing ships to kill the enemies cap and stop them from mwding the latter doesnt work all that well due to momentum and the fact that nanoers usually still have time on their current mwd cycle to burn out of range once their cap has been nukedthe upshot of all of this is that it usually takes a goodly number of ships to kill a competent nano gang quite often moving the gang size from small gang to large gangsmall fleetblob this means that in such situations small gangs are pretty much out  and in 00 its almost always a nano situationso there are fewer playstyles that are truly viable as a result of nano unless you wish to fly nano yourself again less diversitylet me also take another moment to digress and address the its a win if you make the enemy run away too pronano crowd simply putno it isntwhy imagine youve been out trying to pvp yet every fight the enemy just runs away from you the moment the fight looks to turn against them now imagine this happening with almost every fight you run into  simply youre not getting any kills and not having much fun eventually youre going to stop bothering because its just not worth the effort after all they have a word for people who keep doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome
an excellent post wayreth i agree wholeheartedly
okay one more thing then ive got to go to bed so i can be up for work in three and a half hoursthe horse archer analogy is bull plain and simple first and foremost theres a reason that most people decry real life comparisons simply put eve is a game and in certain respect should not match real life a good touchstone to determine this is a simple and straightforward question does this mechanic destroy the fun of the game for a large number of people if the response is yes then you have your answerfor instance pos sovereignty  ccp has stated a number of times that theyre not happy with it and that it detracts from the gameas has much of the playerbasethe same holds true for nanos not everyone enjoys flying them or flying their counters to use myself as an example i can fly both the rapier huginn and curse to counter them and can also fly any nano hac or recon in the game excluding those of the gallente racebut it doesnt mean i have fun doing it i enjoy ships that have lots of firepower and lots of tank but the current eve mechanics dont allow me to use them in many situations thanks to nano this is one of two major reasons im flying in lowsec instead of 00 right now and i know a lot of other players who share my viewsback to the horse archer comparison  you say that youre supposed to skirmish with them fine then  skirmish implies that you strike then fade away not stay engaged until your opponents are all dead sadly nanos give you the ability to do just that  unless your opponent is flying nano or nano counter himself youre largely invulnerable to him moreover even if he is flying nanocounter the moment your gang determines this they will just disengage and run your opponent may get one or two kills but unless he significantly outnumbers you  or your gangs pilotsfc are stupid  he wont be able to take down your entire gang again it defeats the point of even tryingto sum it updiversity is goodnerfing nanos while still keeping them useful promotes diversityyou should not be forced into a certain limited playstyle to be effective in pvpeve is not real life or doom horse archersgodmode vs normal ships should not exist iddqd is not an eve keyboard commandanyway i had planned to be more eloquent and address a few other points but as usual when im tired i ended up rambling on hopefully that was coherent and useful but im not certain it was im off to bed cartman voice  screw you guys im going home edit lmao  just realized i forgot to support my own original post
how many im not tryin to be a smartass here but this thread isnt getting alot of support i personally find nano ships to be quite fragile and not invulnerable i dont think it takes more skill numbers or effort to kill a nano ship any battleship fitted with mwd neut and injector will kill any nano ship that stays within 24km range for to longcould you spesify a bit more which ships and setupshow do you reach this conclution i would personally do less pvp if i didnt have the option of flying nano  and i do not prefere to fly nano  assuming people that dont like nano would pvp more if there wasnt any nano doesent mean that it would be more pvp what do you mean by this that every thing should be slowed down  including tracking and explotion velocity  or making speed tanking less effective by reducing just the top speed i guess im not quite clear on what you see as the main problem that they take little dmg when going at top speed or that they have speed enough to disengage when they start to take dmg interesting point im assuming you are talking about sac cerb curse and ishtar here some ships dont have to worry about tracking which is a huge bonus when it comes to speed tanking im not sure those ships need a nerf but if they did i dont think the answer is to nerf speed itselfeven if i did agree with you in some of the nano issues this statment makes it impossible for me to sign this thread personally i think the nano issue could be argued better if you left the recons ew bonus out of it
supporting this
actually thats true ive supported the topic because i think nanos need nerfing but i dont agree that recon ewar does  or to be more accurate i think that is a separate case to be evaluated after the nano nerf is done 
one of eves great strengths is its rockpaperscissors flexibility for every ship type pilots of equal skill and resources may employ counters that are not merely getting more of that ship type this paradigm is broken with nanos they are scissors that can rarely be countered with anything but more scissors
if nothing else it seems like it would be easy to do
bump
agree
woo
i dunno off day maybeok back on track now yeah and if i see the usual we are looking into thatthisthe other kktxbye usual bs ill puke
very nice list there  where are the suggestion threads so people can vote for these issues to be brought up at the next csm meeting
last i checked i have a utilityonly 8th high slot on my drake i also have severe fitting issues with 7x haml iis which the ship was supposedly the posterchild fornighthawk needs a lot of help be it the bastard child of the ferox or the drake you need grid to fit the nifty toys like a command module or a tank grid is sorely lacking herethe added cpu is also required for the command module to fit as well as for added shield tanking that the sleip has more cpu and grid available after fitting its primary weapons means that were in the same situation with the cerb and sacthat the caldari ships are merely poorwatered down versions of other races not asking for pwnage just parity
nvm
the tank is certainly a big part of the nighthawk problem in pve you can get the classic passive tank on fairly easily and it works well enough in pve but its completely useless for pvp meaning that not only does the pvpfit nighthawk have awful pg and a useless precision bonus but also that it doesnt actually tank very well at all anyone saying that the pvp nighthawk has an uber tank is talking about a pve fit that simply doesnt work in pvp you cant get a viable active tank on  you dont have the pg or midslots  and the buffer tank is only slightly better than a comparablyfit drakes buffer tank  100k ehp or so
some caldari  most iirc  t2 ships start with 80 thermal resistance 70 kinetic 50 explosive and 0 em i think id use amarr drones there maybe they could use a touch more damage but i wouldnt call amarr drones a sick joke they are tougher by a small margin and have limited uses
sure those are the base resists basically the same as gallente t2 resists but anyone within a hundred jumps of pvp puts a specific em hardener on a shieldtanked ship with those kind of shield resists when its 55 em resist plus invulns then all of a sudden amarr drones are less damaging than minmatar on top of being slower and only having a tiny bit more hp as for amarr drones being tougher compare them to gallente  they have the same armour hp but about 30 less shield and 50 less structure hp theyre a touch tougher than minmatar and a touch weaker than caldari but not by much in either case gallente drones have the most hp by far like they need the help  not amarr as you imply
yes please im an amarr rper focused on drones as my main combat weapon id really love to be able to effectively use my racial drones like any proud amarrian should
hmm i dont see a problem  but i almost exclusively use sentry drones 
just to make it explicit sentry drones are fine  they split up nicely by damagerangetracking i couldnt reasonably label any of them as best or worst  gardes are ogres without travel time for the mission crowd bouncers and wardens can make surprisingly good sniper domis and curators are a reasonable middle ground theyve all got the same hp too i wouldnt be surprised if the amarr one still sees the least use but its not gimped in any way like the normal amarr drones are its just in a spot on the progression i expect most players to not like very much i dont advocate changes to sentry drones or fighters  just the lightmediumheavy combat drones
caldari drones are awesome nice balance between speed and damage with a good damage type
i agree that amarr drones need a buff
boost amarr drones
sounds good to me
yesand faction dominix  with other faction t1 battleships too pls and tech ii drone upgrades  nav comps control augs and omnidirects pretty please
this idea is a complete waste of resources who cares if you learned an extra skill by mistake
well ive had itthis is the second time ive gotten stuck in jita tonight my account is effectively broken as i cant log in to my main character because of that godforsaken system that all major routes around caldari highsec seem to go through im certain that handling stuck petitions from jita takes up a great deal of the gms time and im certain most of the people who get stuck are people who have to get through the system to go somewhere elsea simple fix to this would be adding a new button to the autopilot prefer less populated this would plot you around systems with a certain number of people determined by a slider bar much the same as the one used for prefer saferprefer less safe this means you have an option to avoid lagriddled overpopulated systems that cause people to crash outseems simple enough what does everyone think

chemal tech is an established hitech company that was at the forefront of electronic warfare technology a few decades back though the fortunes of the company have somewhat dimmed since then it still cranks out top quality ew equipmentdue to faction warfare it is not always possible to enter enemy faction space for invention purposesbeing primarily a gallente player i an familiar with the gallente situation and i would love to see rd agents for chemal techhopefully other community members will step up and give ideas for the other factions as far as what npc corps would be apropriatethank you for your considerationtribe

could you perhaps make it possible for player owned stations that market actions are unavailable to anyone not currently docked in that station then alliances have a choice by making remote buying impossible they could excercise some control over who could buy their stuff without having to flag each transaction
this is excellent can we get any more details on this are you planning on going with ietridentmshtml safariwebkit firefoxgecko operas engine or an anonymous third party will it support multiple windows javascript possibly even plugins  flash etc it would be an excellent choice to support a wellknown browser engine into the game and bonus points for one thats actually standards compliant please dont make this a sidethought the ingame browser is a significant hindrance on expanding the games utility especially with the api making generous improvements
i appreciate the honesty here the logistics involved in running a forum with this much traffic are impressively nasty not to mention the juggling the actual game hosting too that being said mmo forums are universally a gripeill throw my 2 iskies in here and suggest possibly opening up the dev work for the new igb to the public pick an open source engine do the inhouse work you must do for security reasons and then open up the project sourceforge style eve is unique in how technically competent a large portion of its user base is id bet there are legions of people that would gladly put silly amounts of time and effort into a dev project for this game if they were so allowed not only would you get a ton of free  well nearly  dev work it would be a huge pr idea the only mmo that is actively being worked on and improved by its player base my degree is in cs not marketing but you dont to have one to see the possibilities there
yes the igb experience is vital to my corp and i know it is to many others who have the benefit of wizards who can work with it and create applications for it i for one believe the igb revamp should be a major project and not something left on the sideburner for monthsyears in order to bring forth more features ccp itself believes in this method so dont let us down now
i fail support this
no wonder noone can spell hangar properly anymore
youd be right and i thank you for your opinionand thank god for you my friend without you i would be out of a job  well not really because id probably just go do something exciting like mining which is so much more interesting that mission running hard work you didnt just say hard work bwahahahahahahaget friends or give up that little bit of dps or tank i see other people doing it why cant you not enough skills heres a tip train moreok so your training is so scary hard and my training is so scary easy give me a break you make yourself look stupid by your own explanation heres what ccp should do make you have to scan down your missions you couldnt find your ass with both hands so dont go telling me your training is any more importantyes soi can do missions just fine i choose to interact with people instead of machines yes thats right id rather have a relationship with a real person than have a cherry 2000 like you  look it up smart guy heh if they ever change the dynamic well just come back and blow up your ships once you take your shot go ahead change it i dare youwhat you obviously dont know how aggro rules work must be from only running missions  go ahead prove me wrong youre the scary pirate rarely and especially not with nubs like youi cant steal whats not yours start cleaning up your own mess mission boy  oops sorry carebear carebear tears fuel my ship
unless you are going to salvage the wrecks yourself im not sure i see how ninja salvaging is theft of any kind unless i am also looting in which case you would get aggro sure if youre gonna salvage yourself then i guess i am taking some isk from you but otherwise why do you care so much  and dont tell me you dont when you go around blowing up your own loot just so i cant salvage it  i see lots of people comparing ninja salvaging to ore theft but theres a huge difference in ore theft i am stealing the item that the producer plans to sell to make isk when salvaging i am not you didnt run the mission just to salvage it and i am cleaning up a mess you were going to leave behindi know i am new to eve but i really dont see why mission runners get so bent out of shape about the salvaging i dont see how it affects them in the slightest
i like the cut of your jib given any thought to ninja salvaging as a profession
theres this song by justin timberlake called cry me a river maybe you should give him ring
i for one hate bigots they really bother me with a gay brother and a black girlfriend i encounter them daily lol but hell i dont think anyone should have to be subjected to it ingame or on the forums soproposal 1 change the word filter proposal 2 make bigotry a bannable offense on eveo not a permenant ban but a slap down as appropriateproposal 3 make bigotry a mutable offense in eve  1 week  1 month  lifetime  in the local channeli think personally this is a no brainer and should be like this already i would hope 1 and 2 are implemented asap altho i recognize the problems with 3 from a legal perspective leaving homophobic words around while covering racial words is dodgy but tbh its not even an argument it should just happen
two and three are already that way  sort of  as for a word filter get a life seriously theyre words if you dont want to hear them block the person i see gamesitems that implement word filters that are not optional as completely childish and immature
opening poster if people wish you moan let them moan this is a forum so there will be opinions if you cant respect an opinion or in this case a whine they a  dont read it b leave the forumsi honestly am shocked youd get so stressed out over someone complaining in a forum give it a rest take a deep breath and relaxwhinners will always moan and if they do whats it to you if it makes them feel better leave them be and stop breathing fire over it ffs i doubt every player including you has never once moaned about something in his eve life that wouldnt be unusual the game isnt perfect
i wouldnt mind seeing crystal set being shield hp thought it may be unbalancing for passive shield tanking in some cases then again its not like snake sets arent exactly insanely powerful either at timesit is kind of a bummer that the capital shield booster is not effected by the crystal set though to be honest for most pvp with capitals the extra hp buffer would be much more useful
the phoenix gets a double missile bonus which adds 25 more dps though kinetic only is a stupid stupid stupid bonus it does effectively have as much dps as a naglfar also when you fit 23 bcu ii on a phoenix it again adds dps to all its weapons which means tbh a 5th high slot is not neededwhy does the phoenix have a turret hardpoint i have no idea its worthlessi do think citadels do need boosted so they dont get smart bombed so easily and hit targets faster but thats a different story i guess
i left this corp because of decisions such as these i cant believe you dont see the logical picture here theres a lack of common sense and leadership direction this frustrated me all though my time in unvcorpif you appoint 10 directors you increase the chance of theft not only that you appointed people who just 12 months ago were just starting out in eve its always wise to appoint a minority of proven loyal trustworthy individuals to avoid such things as theft i doubt most corp hanger thieves are willing to wait 12 years to raid the hangeryou also had the chance to pick from about 4 people with between 25 years experience in eve and have spent endless months in the corp its unlikely theyd steal this mistake could have been easily avoided a few of these loyal members have now left the corp that once said loyalty and hard work is rewarded that is simply not the case i understand one of the people who got appointed as a director since sold his stake in the corp allowing you to lose majority control he also robbed the hanger this was all caused by poor decision making and total incompetenceyou also made the corp move to 02 when the corp was largely new players inexperienced in pvp and insufficient to fight off even remotely dangerous threats i said from day one this was a mistake and wed lose the system people got podded insufficent dps to take down a pos unwillingness to travel to 02 and ship after ship destroyed no surprise several days ago unv waved the white flags and fled to high sechow is this any surprise it was written in stone i understand the corp is now leaving for another low sec system to try and take that using the same strategy with even less players and experience will not change anything it will bring more death another awful decisioni wish the corp well but you lost 20 members in a few days many very good players and have replaced them with infant pilots im staggered the current leaders cant see the mistakes theyre makingyou should stop blaming game mechanics and start seeing the mistakes that have been made and are being made it will not change until you recognise poor decision making absolutely crazy appointments to senior positions and naive irrational decision makingthis post wont be popular with my friends in unv but sometimes a person must stand up and have the guts to point out the harsh realities of a truely dire leadership reign
donate several million dollars to ccp and theyll be happy to make their servers run better until then just stay the hell out of jita on a saturday afternoon everyone agrees lag is a problem ccp included but whine thread 8472 isnt going to fix it
as long as the size of the player base keeps going up the lag fixes are invariably going to be temporary affairs im not old enough to remember yulai being the hub but i cant imagine it had anywhere near the 5001000 jita regularly entertains today and yet it was probably just as bad if not worse  they still havent had to resort to wrecking jita yet such is life  if it doesnt lag people fear it less and go there more until it lags again maybe if it could handle 3000 concurrent users it could stand up for a while but thats beyond what ccp can reasonably implement lag happens and ill take what fixes i can get to it be they incremental or substantial
i already told hammerhead to fix ur game a couple times so i think hes on the ball
im not really concerned with getting 3000 peeps in a system per say what i wanna see is a server that can make the aoe damage calculation of a titans dd quickly
did this include sitting on him tickling him and making him call uncle
i am kind of interested in the iceland meeting minutesif anyone could please accidentally leak a version 
look in the assembly hall forum  it is now cluttered and spammed to death by the iceland meeting discussion threads
voted for both goum and jade hoping both would get in so there would be an enormous  fightwas disappointed
i agree with the op
i disagree with this proposal the wreckage and surviving modules belong to the victim if he or his friends are in no position to claim the wreck then they may console themselves with the  all too brief  killrights on the thiefby what right does the ships killer claim the surviving goods because he activated weapons got the killing blow or highest damage does this legally entitle him to the goodslaw of the jungle baby if you make a kill but are unable to defend it from other predators then you deserve to go hungry just like the savanna eve has its jackalsits not that im unsympathetic to those who lose loot during an empire war it sucks but saying a ships killer has any legal right to the goods is opening a big can of worms
agreed
i agree with the salvage stealing to be aggrokillright flagged there is no rational reasoning to let the scavengers to just come and take or extract anything from what we just killed and leave without any fear of revenge
support 100
thumbs downid support removing security status loss from stealingbut1  looting a pilots wreck should flag you for that pilot2  looting a wreck that somebody else killed should not be a free flag for the killer
thank god thats not what the original post is about eh nice of you to come out though
o  op here  just waiting to hear whats going on with this issuesummary so far1 thread started2 issue discussed3 issue taken to csm for vote of approval to bring to ccp4 issue taken to ccp5 issue made high priority by ccpcsm6  waiting for decision on issue wow what a process 
dual ownership best answer
ladies and gents how about you all look here upcoming csm meeting  and notice a part about biggest unadressed assembly hall issue i would think we qualify dont you so far csm members issued no statement regarding misinformation they had given us members of the csm had shown support for implementing this pain in the ass ignored by ccp for over 2 years idea that has unilateral support  as i see it and yet they have failed to either answer the questions as to why lie to us and tell us it has been submitted to ccp or if it was submitted why it is missing from ccpcsm meeting notes i suggest you all take a walk there and let them know what you think that is unless we are so apathetic at this point and do not really care if we are blatantly lied to or led on and then ignored in favor of pet projectsi will continue quoting them their own words regarding this till we hear something
replied to this here bottom line its not a conspiracy its just a mess up somewhere along the line and im honestly not sure where this issue got voted through the csm and as far as i know was submitted to ccp for the formal meeting in iceland yet didnt appear on the agenda there at the time we resolved to just make sure it gets resubmitted for the 2nd formal meeting its already been voted on its going on the agenda for 2nd meeting not sure what else i can say about it i have no idea who messed up or how it happened but for whatever reason it didnt get on the formal agenda in iceland and that meant there was no substantive ccp comment in the face to face discussions  hence why its not listed on the minutes feedback
thank you jade  i am sure we will be awaiting some information forthcoming in august the reason for all the shouting is perception that the issue was ignored despite the statements to the contrary by csm mistakes happen especially when so many different issues are involved again i appreciate you actually coming in here and letting everyone know
supported though couldnt csm oversee the balance process ccp doesnt seem to have any hope of getting the slow incremental and cautious approach to balance we either get op stuff or prenerfed stuff from them
definitly need some help with these shipstribe
i have to agree these ships were nerfed pretty horribly situation does need looking at again and your proposal  returning to prenerf strength on that class of bonused ships makes sense supporting thisalso  ccp this is what you made me do to my arazu
this makes sense i was an arazu specialist before the nerf and now it is just gathering dusti like the idea of increasing the range on damps rather than just boosting their strength agani though as that would make them very effective vs snipers and falcons giving them a clear niche rolesomething like  arazu gallente cruiser skill bonus 20 bonus to remote sensor dampener optimal and falloff and 5 bonus to remote sensor dampener effectiveness per levelrecon ships skill bonus 20 bonus to warp disruptor range and 96 to 100 reduction in cloaking device cpu use per levelthis keeps the warp disrupter bonus on the recon ship skill where it needs to be and swaps the hybrid bonus  on a ship with a max of 3 turrets anyway  for a hefty dampner range bonusdampeners have 30km optimal 60km falloff this would change that to 60 and 120  for 180km  skills  on the specialist ships which seems fair to me especially since it is in falloff for much of that distancethe lachesis could swap the turret damage bonus the same way and then the recon ship bonus to missiles could either stay as it is or be changed to a hybrid bonus and increase the number of turret slotsthe celestis would swap its 5 bonus to hybrid damage for a 10 range bonus  so not as good as the t2 ships but still pretty respectablehow does that sound
damps need an increase to their range so they are effective against snipers and jammers trying to stay out of fighting rangethe weakness of damps though is not the only problem with the arazu it also suffers from identity crisis   as does the lachesis   is it supposed to sit back and damp or is it supposed to get in close and tackle it gets bonuses to both but they are mutually exclusive so which does it go withalso why does the lachesis get another mid slot instead of a low slot especially when its description says that it is a roden ship which tend to be weak in ewar the falcon and the rook both have the same number of mids and lows why do the arazu and lachesis differ also since gallente are primarily armor tankers why does the combat recon get the lower number of lows and why does the lachesis get a missile bonus when it clearly prefers to use guns and only has one more slot for a launcherlet the combat recon focus on up close tackling and fighting and the force recon focus on sitting at range and using ewar switch the slot layouts so the lachesis can fit a better armor tank and the arazu can fit more damps let the lachesis go in with the scram web tank and guns change that silly missile damage bonus to turret tracking or range bonus heck roden is supposed to be the big armor tanking corp maybe make it an armor rep bonusit used to be that the arazus dual bonuses complimented each other for solo hunting allowing them to tackle their prey while rendering them unable to fight back the falcon can still do this but the arazu no longer can since even 3 damps can not get most ships lock range less than the arazus scram range maybe instead of boosting the strength of individual damps the stacking penalty should just be removed so that way 3 damps cant disable 3 ships but 3 damps on one ship will disable it
yes please and not just the arazu but id love to have a reason to fly a keres
gallente recons could definitely use a boost id prefer to see the t1 versions get a slight boost and t2 a bigger boost additionally if the t2 versions lost the damage bonus for a range bonus it might help counteract some of the limitations of damps on specialized ships while keeping them at a reduced usefulness on other ships
some ewar that hinders the enemy from attacking your gallante ship thats fitted with the gallentian weapon system of blasters you mean ecm droneswhat are rsds fore i mean realy i havent figured out anything that it kan do that a ecm doesnt do better
supported
definitely needs to be looked at damps currently have very limited use and only seem to be effective in the 3070km range which very few fights take place at in my experience
i have to agree adressing the fuel definciencies of the ship without addressing its ungodly cost and mediocre performance is not a way to fix this class of ship give these ships the ability to use cocsotherwise theyre not worth the training time
a lot of good points i especially like the references to the fact that the only real good hitandrun ships now are nanos which cant really engage against large sniper based fleets ive found a way to fix the issues making it impossible to buff an sb style alphastrike damage dealer without making an overpowered shipblack ops and a better hitandrun damage dealer are begging for each other absolutely would be married and in bed every time you log on to go kill things in systems under hostile controlheres how to do a closerange highalpha ship that is able to hit and run but doesnt become the new nano and doesnt have unnecessary tankfleetsniper rolestactical strike t2 bc  guerrilla adaptation of high damage bc hullsstats are probably in an overpowered state but just focus on how active stealth can really change tanking behavior and provide escape capability without creating an overpowered nanomenace because of its high firepower
please turn the sin into a sentry drone specialist ship i do not care about jump drive and the fule stuff because thats what capitals are fori just want a sentry drone specialised ship with long drone control range and sentry drone optimal bonus   on top of the regular domi bonuses 
that is pretty valid i have been playing for a year and a half and there are still skills i have not trained simply because i cant be bothered with playing the login timing game i know that it is a frustration everyone has no matter how experienced they are because there are always skills that will be finished when it isnt convenient i like that eve doesnt require skillgrinding but i feel like the current skill system could use a good queuei still think the amount of queue time allotted should be reflected in the characters attributes the system that i proposed earlier would allow you to simply draganddrop this pile of skills into a menu which should report to you about how long it will be before each skill transition and even at what eve time it will happen if undisturbed contingencies like training multiple levels of one skill or proper calculation of skills that come after learning skills in the queue can be addressed by ccp in the implementation of it all
ccp is sorely mistaken to believe this switching skills does not encourage play as stated by many people above me just make a skill que 1 skill deep and have it disabled if the account expires
you are right and another flaw in my kind of system would people who pay x isk to autotrain their character for 10 month then unsuscribe both problems could be adressed  for the unsuscribing problem like only finishing the training skill regardless of a skill queue when unsuscribing  but again if you dont pay for this service people will end skill queuing inspace while playingdont forget its suposed to be a im offline for that long tool

do your roids need capital sized equipmenti can see the manufacturing advertisements now
i dont think they can reasonably do this without losing subscriptionsto remove it theyd need a similar almost effortless means of acquiring the same data at the same time for a tech angle it is most likely theyd still have to report the information to your computer so it can interact if you code it such that it doesnt show someone will just make a program that lets them see it so its probably not a wise investment for ccp to program it out
i have more faith in ccp reworking this problem without screwing over everyone than i do in this idea simply removing local and hiking it all over to constellation doesnt work especially in system with a lot of pos activity where parked and empty ships will confuse the scannersthe grand irony is the thought that removing local will increase pvp it wont it will decrease pvp for a few very simple psychological reasons one people already take the risk of being killed on sight in lowsec and nosec now that youve taken away their ability to watch for hostiles theyre less likely to go there in the first place if other profitable avenues exist and there are two more people that do go there will fly cloakcapable ships so they are capable of quickly getting out of a bad situation since they no longer have any way to see it coming and they will run and cloak faster than before three more alts will be made for the purpose of keeping eyes on the gates so people know when something bad has entered system this means a potential pvper has fewer and more paranoid targets which translates into less pvpi say we wait and see what ccp is planning before we start beating this dead horse anew
agree though it needs some good looking at
mhm player chosse to be in local or leave
agreed local need some rebalancing
i like the thought that you have to enter a system open your local scanner and scan to see if anybody is around a lot better than seeing it right awayi favor change a  remove names and pics from local b  introduce a local scanner option that shows people in the system after 30 seconds scan timemy2cent
and see here we go again and this is what the giagantic problem is with ccp they look at local chat and brainstorm all the possibilities on how to feck it up even moar tabs anyone alt key anyone this is so simple its ludicrous1 add an automated scanner function that you can toggle either the way it is now or you hit the auto button and it constantly scans as many times as lagserver calls allow for2 entrance into local chat is delayed for 2 minutes or unless typing into it if you cant scan someone down in 2 minutes you fail3 if you wanna get crazy and i mean crazy have a low hp anchorable within 25km from the gate report to the pilot any gate fires no distiniction between outgoing or incoming and have that show up on the scanner module and thats it 1 2 are perfectly fine 3 is thrown in for the lulz either way what we probably will get is just a bunch of nonsense and overbloated changes to game mechanics that werent really necessary but since ccp loves to go big and lay an egg with the simplest changes or concepts i cant wait

the data would not be available at any range as it is currently the range would be calculated server side before the information is made available to the client so no baconlike hack would workoh and the whole point of this is to remove the effortlessness with which this data is currently acquired
any radar system introduced to replace local would at the very least be permanently available and have a working iff  identification friend or foe  included in it or it wont be properly functional then it also needs considerably extended range compared to current scanners and i dont know if its even feasible with the current cloaks who could ever go mine again in deep 00 if the risk exists there are 20 force recons waiting in the belts for anyone to show up what would be needed i think at the very least is cloaking ships showing up as a blip on radar but never good enough to pinpoint them just a blip that basically says recon within roughly 1 au of planet x otherwise you will screw up most 00 activities outside of moonmining
very simple local shows three different icons 1 pilot s  with  standing in local 2 pilot s  with neutral standing in system 3 pilot s  with  standing in system the endthis would nerf local as the best intel tool but would keep it as a defensive toolcomplete removal of local would be too much for 00making the scanner too strong would nullify the point of local nerfconstellation local is too strong because the majority of constellations have only a few system worth visiting not to mention afk cloaking
i suspect that in addition it would also need to be able to discriminate between piloted and pilotless ships at a minimum and possibly possess such capability as detecting warp and cloak signatures all at varying rangesi kinda disagree on the considerably extended range compared to current scanners bit in my opinion the long range stuff should be left for probe scanningsomething like that
however this information is displayed within the new scanning system  in local or some scanner displaytab  i hope its not available at infinite range as it is currently
a smallfreighter sized hauler would be nice also i would like to see a covert ops industrial something not massive in cargo hold size but something that can be used to get past gate campers also possiblity to add a drone bay to the industrials so they can atleast protect themselfs
i think if ccp did add this ship it would be identical to a freighter in terms of fitting but it would feature less space and better agility eve is a multiplayer game and adding all these slots to let it have a tank cloak drones etc is just supporting the solo players i have nothing wrong with people playing the game solo but i think ccp wants to encourage teamwork and having to take some protection on a freighter move in highsec space should be encouraged i feel this small freighter is the orca but should ccp release an additional ship i think it would be capable of carrying one freight container so i expect a cargohold of 120000 m3 with no fitting slots etc and possibly a bonus to agility per leveledit forgot that ccp mentioned a possible tractor beam bonus so maybe 1 high slot for a tractor beam
i would like something smaller than my obelisk but larger than my occatorthe jump is from 38k m3 to 800k m3 cargosomething say in the 12 freight container range would be nice  120240k m3 the use of cans and tractors would make it very nice for a mining operation  1 ship replacing 36 other haulers 
my idea of a cargo  small freighter call it flat out cargo shiprequires indie v and a new class of skill for cargocargo 75k to 100kspeed halfway between ity v and a freighter2 his 4 mids  obvious reasons and 1 or 2 lows  no huge boost from expanders midsized drone bayright i said drone bayif it cant fight at least allow it some defenseor repair liberty ships in ww2 at least had a small gungotta be able to tank a attack for at least a little while
cant support the idea of t2 bpo from research if its a random slim chance thingthats just a reintoduction of the t2 lottery of old you know the one where players were randomly selected from obscurity to become industrial tycoons by the random number generator on the serverswould be better if t2 bpos were openly available on the marketafterall the corporations lai dai  ishukone etc that invented these shipsitems should profit from themthen leave it to a players business accumen to create the tycoons rather than have them selected at randominvention should be for tech iii and named tech i and ii variants bpcs onlythat should finally level the playing field
1 means i could get one every 27 hours for modules on average 25 days or so for a ship 1 and a half months and invention will be dead with several thousands new t2 bpo i know that 1 is only an example but people doing only 1 job every so often will start screaming that they have no chance if it is much less while any high number like 1 will kill invention very fast i have already suggested a possible system that seem more balanced1  it will require to lock a t1 bpo  not bpc creating a bpo from a bpc is wrong from starter  wit the appropriate rd agent  main field of the final t2 bpo  for several months with missions requiring some serious effort  even simply gathering the needed t2 components from market for the research no need for it to be a combat mission  and giving some serious increase in researchsome minimum number of research missions should be necessary to complete the job to reduce alt farming missions should be on the order of 1week2  the production of a t2 bpo at the end of the process should be guaranteed but the agent used should be locked on working on the bpo only so no datacore production all the rp should go to the bpo time to complete the research would be in several  10  week at least for simple modules to a year or more for the largest ships 3  the meantime the development of new t2 for the game buildable only from invention till the first new bpo come out of development should continue this will give a period while the new t2 items are buildable only by inventors then the new t2 will become more common as bpo start to come out of research this should keep inventing a rewarding profession with he profit from high priced new items in my eyes this will work well with inventors focusing on new items bpc getting a good return for several months before saturation by the new bpo holders while the people focusing on bpo development will get a lower immediate return but with long term profits there is only a drawback  that i see  in this idea it require the development of several new modules to be introduced every 6 months or so and that could create a module escalation with new t2 module a1 being the same thing but better that old t2 module a another option could be to produce t2 bpo with a similar system  always starting from a t1 bpo and requiring months of research  and allowing inventor to create bpc of t1 named and newly developed t2 named  even only tweaking a little the fittingenergy usage of the t2 modules will make them in demand 
1 increase delivery range2 increase explosion velocity  it needs to be effective against all targets not just the bigger ones 3 allow sbs to carry multiple bomb launchers  2 4 slightly increase maximum damage5 remove the bug that causes bombs not to go off when the bomber cloaks6 address build coststhat should about cover it
i just want to collide with them and see what their response will bemwuhahahaha floating flesh waiting to be flashfried and served along long limb roe what a tasty if rocky treat
hell yes current action is just so limpwristedsignage
agreed as a player of a vherokoir alt i think their role is very understated  wanderers who escaped the enslavement mostly what next 
the amarr bloodline without any backstory is definitely the nikunni that said i would like to see more pf for all of the bloodlines to differentiate them a bit to a casual observer the vherokior seem very similar to the thukker the achura and the jinmei may very well be related and the nikunni are almost identical to the ammatar what are their different cultures beliefs and conditions what makes them different even just the little things  like the nikunni being a formerly polygamist race  help to set them apart the solution to this problem is simple more little things
you need background info to build characters well not really but it makes it easier at least for roleplayers
more tech ii bpos with tech iii on the horizon maybe its time to seed them openly with agents as high end loot drops and on the open marketthe problem isnt tech ii bpos its static moon mineral deposits and the monopoly thereif anything me research on tech ii bpos should cut down a lot more on materials needed
ummm the devs have spoken they are happy with the system the way it is and arent going to change it
they have spoken very quietly about it too quietly as if they are not even certain during the fan fest they made a statement that there are and i quote no immediate plans for the tech 2 bpos it has been a while and people do not want to believe that the devs actually said it this thread was meant to shut the whiners up and as an additional benefit a dev blog would be nice that way i could just link it every time someone whines about it you see saying to people developers said this at fan fest and pointing their little noses to a dev blog where they can read it for themselves are two different things
this is not tech 2 bpo discussion denton it is either yes i want to hear what devs think or no i do not want to hear what devs think about t2 bpo future
ccp have already answered the question they have no plans for tech 2 bpos at this time but that may change in the futureof course that could have changed since they said that since it was a year ago so a thumbs up from me
that dr aryadi is the subtle point that many fail to glean for the whole affair as i said many on both sides of the issue would much rather prefer to stick their heads into the proverbial sand than actually ask a question and demand a definitive next few years perhaps answer
well itd be nice if ccp could finally put and end to the  speculation based  debate and make their plans for t2 bpos publicso this issue has my support
yes i want to hear what devs are thinking bau this
free 
no thanksdude may have uncovered some crap and  hopefully  bettered the game for it but the way he went about it nearly nullified it he tried to blackmail ccp with said info to get his own little private revengeyeah saint kug the hero dude can roll another character just like all the others whove been banned for less
support for a response however i dislike the idea of a skill queue if it happens ccp owes me months of lost time
ummm not hard at all really if you can right click on a skill which is currently being trained and pause it there is absolutely no reason why there cant be a mechanism that does the same when a subscription lapses saying it cant be done is just copping out
i agree that t1 meta0 loot should be dropped from the tables but leave the meta drops the way they are now to compensate increase the mission reward and early mission bonus by about 34x its current amount  since its already so comical meta level items should not be able to be created giving the missionrunners and ratters a critical niche in the market the rare mineral difficulty could be easily modified by either making t1 loot easier to make  little or no zyd or mega  or incorporating inefficient ore asteroids in highsec  aka flawed arkanor which only gives 20 of the minerals normal arkanor gives 
i always fancied the idea of fewer trash drops in the can in favor of more salvage items preferably keep it in the tech 1 marketfor instance make metal scraps worth a damn perhaps usable as a superm3efficient material that can be used as a substitute for tech 1 materials in blueprint recipes the more metal scraps you use the fewer tech 1 minerals requiredi dont like the idea of higher bounties or more lp
no dont change the way it works it is fine as it iswhat gets me is why the hell does everything have to be hit with the nerf bat when it works well bad enough they have removed all faction loot drops from ae and wc lets screw something else up for all mission runners devalue lps and stop them from being able to produce usible items from the loot thats gathered keep on with these wonderful ideas
attempt at provoking i run around with a sign around my neck in empire that screams lets fight not being suicidal i tend to turn away the people who bring back ships way out of my class some of my favorites have been the a frigate versus a battlecruiser a cruiser versus a battleship a frigate versus a heavy assault moments where it wasnt just a matter of being outskilled but it was also a matter of being really seriously and totally out gunned in price maybe im unique but if im running around in my cruiser and i can flip a guy and he brings back his cruiser or heavy assault ship then oh yeah were going to fight if im in my heavy assault ship and he brings back his cruiser or battlecruiser sure ill take a stab at thatwhile i admit that a good number of my kills are outright ganks id also like to say that its about the money for me and given the choice of can flipping a guy 3 months old in his retriever or the 4 year old guy in a hulk with hammerhead iis and ecm drones then im rolling up on the hulk in my rifter jaguar rupture or stabber maybe i dont have a good chance of success against the hulk and his hammerheads but the payout for succeeding against him is much larger then the payout against the retriever and id be willing to bet that given the choice between hunting targets and making a reasonable amount of isk per hour versus praying for that 1 big score to come floating into the gate that a lot of suicide gankers would rather be out there hunting the hulks mackinaws mining apocs and brutixsreducing random violence to a bare minimum is making things  effectively  completely safe and i ask why should empire be so safe the only answer i get is the plaintive and unconvincing think of the newbies what newbies you mean the ones in lowsec that i fought last night you mean the week old character i ran into in 00 you mean the one in the caracal that engaged me in 05 space because he wasnt aware that doing so would get him concorded  who had i known he wanted a fight i would have dropped a can gleefully  the only people that seem to want empire to be safe are the mining industrial and transportation alts of the 00 alliances i say hang them let them rot and die let their 6 man alt corps be set on fire  im looking at you lonestar mining with your 1 man 8 character mining corporation when i first asked someone about this game it was oh everyone in eve is awful they will gank you and steal money and do anything they can to win and kill you now its suddenly we cant let people die in high security its an atrocity stop it stop it stop it i say either hug the carebear or cut him open and look for the magic fairy dust that sells for 100000 isk in jitathe way i see it and to be hyperbolicempire 001 risk vs 9999 rewardlowsec 9999 risk vs 001 reward000 100 risk vs 100 rewardthough i would argue that lowsec is more risky then 000 because acts there lock you out of empire and theres the chance that the gate or station guns will rip you up  assuming a nonguntank build
this is also a very general statement that makes it into a half truth in and of itself while the idea of insurance paying for a warship is far fetched people still generally want a semblance of realism in the game there are pirates in real life and there are pirates in the game imagine the problems ccp would have if they were trying to stop piracythey cant stop macro mining and look how well that is going for the minersa sense of reality is what brings an alternative version of reality into an enjoyable medium so straying to far from reality can alienate a player base entirely in this case we have a veritable gothem city that is suddenly being overrun by crime the police are not really effective but the mention of batman sends people into frenzy of course the carebears want to put a stop to it they always will want it to turn every street into a freaking paradise that they can mine the crap out of and exploit pointlessly not knowing that if it wasnt for the madness in low sec and 0 they would not make a dime the pirates always want access to high sec so they can kill all day long without consequences but they dont realize that even that gets boring or else they would still be gate ganking now wouldnt they if it was all no sec then the population would be far less than half this population and the pirates would be getting there asses kicked in by the real wolves down in 0 that band together and eat  like them alive the nosecers dont really hate the carebears they just hate the fact that the npc corps harbor a huge logistical supply chain that helps the nosecers enemies they realize that what goes on in high sec effects them greatly because of the logistical nightmare the npc corps have created
yeah so if you think youre the only person running around high sec with an orange name and a skull youre crazy that doesnt mean you have a sign on your neck saying lets fight that says your security status is low and you have killed people people in my carebear corp have the exact same thing because we have killed a lot of people some more than others but always in defense of us though on occasions your going to take a security hit anyways when i see a pirate starting a fight in high sec its a trap about 95 of the time there is very little one on one combat and if thats what you are looking for your going to be very unhappy in eve because ccp wants people to duke it out in groups corps and alliances and not alone alone is less money you know this and yet you play an mmo and expect the people trying to make money to cater to your single combat ideology that pretty much means you will only engage in what you feel as fair combat or combat in which you have an advantage life isnt fair sorry to burst your bubble and that is why there is high sec the people that dont really want to play the way you do will confine themselves to high security stop trying to force your play style on others ccp will not allow the carebears to stop you from ratting yet you want to stop them from being carebears your argument is that you should have a license to kill without interference and then run from concord quit glorifying your own bs opinion of how the game should be and try to find a balance between your playstyle and other playstyles that is fair to all types of players and to ccpjust to get this started you need to understand i support pirates i just want them on a leash just like everyone else nothing you have said in this entire thread sounds like you want anything resembling a leash you want to crack the whip damn the torpedoes full speed ahead
your not unique you want to fight and win so does everyone else what es you off if when you run around antagonizing players and they dont fight back it never occurs to you that they know they cant win and they know it your talking about riskreward as if killing an afk mammoth hauling a billion isk worth of modules is barely worth the risk to you pirates yet you get insurance payouts that either cover or come close to covering the cost of your loss while the afk pilot just lost a billion isk the fact that the afk pilot is out far more than you is irrelevant he is in high sec and its 9999 secure so he deserved it right why because as you pointed out low sec and no sec are to tough for you you fail to realize the consequences for opening the flood gates the only exodus in eve would be players leaving for your own personal satisfaction and it would be to late by the time you realized how stupid this idea really is and how its going to destroy the game take the cards your dealt and be glad you can do what it is you like to do just like everyone else in the game the only people screwing up the game are the people your leaving untouched because your looking to fight not destroy logistics of 0 corps or else that would be your argument not your preaching about the grandeur of single combat the idea of eve is to have a ton of players paying subscriptions not a bunch of pirates running around at will killing everyone because the facts are there are not many pirates there are a hell of a lot of people in 0 and more than both combined hiding in high sec your asking the devs to bow to the whines of the few how likely is it they are going crap on their subscriber base and let the player pirates flush the toilet
if you can kill any of the things you just listed inside empire space by yourself in a rifter jaguar rupture or stabber before concord shows up i say either the pilot is a complete moron afk or your cheating your ass off even a minimal tank against those ships you listed would take 30 seconds of pounding from the ships you listed so when you get back to reality let me know until then go to 0 and low sec where that stuff your talking about actually happens however again you point out the flaw that everyone else is pointing out since you get an insurance pay out its worth your time wouldnt be otherwise would it to boot its not like this is you flying around to random locations starting fights because there is a high probability if you have to take 2 jumps to get an indy to salvage and loot the can you earned and the can you lost from concord your stuff and hishers are already gone because they had a ship in system that could do the job already your starting to try and blow smoke up everyones ass and it isnt going to work no reducing random violence not intentional violence once again you target a specific point without quoting the proper information i have no problem with pirates ganking afk pilots macro miners and 0 logistics hiding in npc corps what i do have a problem with is it being so easy and so cheap that they kill empty ships shuttles and noobs because its entertaining the risk reward there is out of whack because of insurance if that noob got your insurance check you wouldnt kill him unless he was carrying something that if big if  he dropped would pay for the stuff you lost thats what pirating is not riding the coat tails of the insurance system
i do to whats your point this isnt going to make all of eve your personal stomping ground though sorry yes think about the noobs oh and while your at it think about the other UFFFD of the population of eve that are in empire that dont want to worry about you getting ganked getting gate camped or getting interrupted mid mission with a map full of agro and having to fight a pirate think of them bury their play styles and you bury eve has that ever dawned on you sorry that you were so ill informed lineage and lineage ii are supposedly very brutal enjoy the new player areas there where the high level characters in the game like to sharpen their blades on your corpse go do that for a while and see how much it makes sense then come back and tell us how eve should be your personal noob hunting grounds
this is cute but its not true you see pirates or anyone else can come into high sec and blast whoever they want to as long as they have a reason so no where is safe you can sacrifice a raven for a shuttle if thats what you want to do no where is safe the problem is for you its not a rich enough hunting ground where you are at it can never be rich enough it cant be for anyone in the game thats why its a game its a challenge its entertaining and last time i checked its still a game the devs still need a paycheck and for that they need subscribers the risk in high sec is very low and the reward in high sec is very low the minerals suck the rats suck and missions are tedious unless your willing to spend billions tricking out a ship to blast threw them at record pace and then guess what youre a target for pirates that are smart enough to scan you in your golem instead of ignoring you because there was a shuttle coming threwthe risk in low sec is very high and the reward is very low low sec is like no mans land and its that way because of pvp pvp folks will just shoot people and ask questions later which tends to mean more shooting and less questions so until youre in an area you can cordon off as safe you dont relax and hang out you fly right threw low sec is what people fly threw because you can casually decide to just kill the guy flying threw and there is very little to no consequences for that actionno sec is a different monster because it tends to be cordoned off and heavily patrolled that doesnt mean it cant be attacked it just means when you go there as you said you have 5 minutes to get the job done you have 30 seconds in empire and you are fighting for that so that you can run from concord when youre done but you wont take your 5 minutes to do the job in 0 and run from the alliance you know why it isnt about the excitement of running and getting away its about the stupidity of shooting a person in the face in the middle of a crowd on camera and getting a slap on the wrist and then getting a settlement paid to you for slapping you on the wrist for shooting that person its that your not going to get away most the time in 0 and since its going to take more to get to that miner in 0 and kill him and your probably going to lose that if the alliance locks up the exits from 0 the risk reward was never intended to be high enough for 13 of the eve population to be pirates so its gonna be tough arkania and thats how it is for everyone else that plays the game right those in the high sec hiding in the npc corps should get kicked out but dont try to justify turning the game into a pirate paradise by saying they hide there and its your job to kill them and then give examples of how your killing noobs and trying to find some honorable combatant to face you 1 on 1
oh and one last thingthis is about suicide ganking not pirating so stop with the 1 on 1 lets have a fair fight woe is me crap your a pirate act like a pirate and admit that the whole point is to kill the easiest target with the biggest payout if it was about pvp there are things you can do besides being a pirate that are far easier
to be utterly blunt 1  80 of the player base lives in hisec and never leaves because it offers them the extremely low level of pvp reducing the security of hisec is about making the game more fun for 5 of the players  pirates  and costing ccp the subscription revenues of a large chunk of 80 of its player base 2  power in the interaction between the suicider and the target the target is powerless after the loss of their ship they typically have no effective means of revenge against the suicider if they have the effective means it usually does not net the same return you have the option of hiring mercs  but thats throuwing good money after bad3  4 hours of ratting to recover standing is not comparable with 100 hours spent mining as ccp said the riskreward is unbalanced i look forward to them fixing it i suspect that the numbers they decide on will not even be close to leveling the playing field even if they are moving in the right direction
i got suicide ganked in a transport ship with a full rack of cargo expanders in the low slots at the time i was under the mistaken impressions that nobody attacked transport ships because of the higher resists and that nobody could see the ferrogel zydrine and bpos in the dozen or so cans crammed into the hold  yes 1b of them i have no complaints with the mechanic existing but i do have a couple of problems with the current implementationsuicide ganking is clearly an idiot tax that you should only have to pay once my sad loss taught me to use blockade runners and freighters fit antigank and limit the value of what i transport however popping hulks is not something that is easily avoided as there are no toughfast mining ships to fall back on  it is too difficultimpossible to save a hulk that has a couple of battle cruisers locked on and firing for the this is an mmo get some friends brigade  it is either not profitable  half the income  or not practical  someone has to do a dull job endlessly for nothing because gankers receive full insurance low value haulers are vulnerable  newb12543 that gets his iteron iii full of pyerite blown up is probably not going to feel like laughing it off and breaking out the bantom and miner iis for another dozen hour session of mindless rock smashing  ok nobody ganks pyerite but you get the point again because of full insurance freighters are underused  the value that you can cram into them reaches ganktarget status way before the capacity is reached its worth ganking a freighter load of trit which is just about the cheapest cargo load goingas for ganking being a solution to 00 alt corp logistic disruption  perhaps it is but lets not confuse ourselves here the predominant goals of ganking are to cause grief and can i have ur stuff not logistic disruptionedit reread after posting and realised there are no solutions in this post how about exponentially increasing premiums for regular ship losses premiums decay over time back towards the current rates pay out remain as is
hulks are the tough mining ships and can be tanked to stop anything but the most dedicated group of gankers using nothing more than t2 equipment but even that is irrelevent because simply paying attention to local is more than sufficient to keep you safe 10 times out of 10 mining at maximum efficiency with no risk while afk should not be supported under any circumstanceslmao a freighter full of trit isnt even close to worthwhile even pyerite wont turn a profit i realize the point here is to try and spread that woe is me feeling with regards to moving around empire but try and be the least bit realistic
these numbers are pretty skewed i know that ever since that economic report came out you carebears have been clinging on to it for dear life trying to make the rest of us understand that you are the majority well youre not out of the 80 of people living in high sec id wager at least 20 are pirates migrated from emptied low sec another 20 are alts and hangers on of 00 alliances and 20 are newbs or newish players looking to skill up before venturing out into more dangerous spacethat leaves 20 as dedicated high sec carebears youre just lunch and thats how it should be to give you any kind of right of decision of gameplay would be a major catastrophy for eve as it would ruing what made this game greatwhat you people continuously fail to realise is that when you get suicided you have already made so many mistakes you have voided your right to any kind of payback or leniency the trick is not to get suicided in the first place there are lots of ways to do this suicide ganking is actually a very well balanced game mechanic people are just too stupid to figure out how to play the gameno but 100 hours spent mining in 99 secure space will net you a whole lot more than 4 hour spent ratting in 00 had it been the other way around it would have been more balanced ccp didnt say that the csm did according to the csm a couple of devs have said that they are going to look at it but so far those devs have been really quiet about it wrangler wont even take any responsability for what was said in the op
your assumption here is not what i heard directly out of ccps mouth though when they elaborated on the numbersthe actual number is much much higher than that im affraid in any mmo the majority of the players will be casual players the kind that only logs in a few hours a week for relaxation that doesnt read the forums and more often than not isnt even involved with any corp stuffccp has trouble reaching these people as they do not make themselves heard but they are definately looking at their needs as well as the needs of the 00 alliance people and the lowsec pirates as it should beagreed with this to some extent but that does not change the fact that suicide ganking is way too easy and too biased in the gankers favor and has no meaningful consequence for the criminali have no pity for afk haulers or other people moving their lives investment into something full of cargo expanders and i dont think that ccp has any either 100 hours ratting in 00 already yields more than 100 hours mining in highsec so the riskreward balance is already thereccp literally said that suicide ganking is too biased in the gankers favor and they have some plans in the pipeline to change that you can read that in the minutes and if you dont believe the minutes then i can confirm this as well
so what did you hear ive got to call bs on this eve is not like other mmos eve takes dedication ccp should not balance their game with casual players in mind they havent done so thus far and the game still does extremely well after five years if they start balancing the game so that solo andor casual gameplay becomes the norm or at least much easier the game will die just like all the other games that made this transitionwhat measures are you csm people taking to make low sec a good option to venture to what are you doing to give traditional piracy a boost if you could solve these issues by extension you would solve suicide gankingdisagreed on both counts its not biased in favor of the ganker because its rediculously easy to avoid it has meaningful consequences as it takes pirates out of high sec not all suicide gankers have 00 access and those that do dont really like rattingso what are you doing to punish those further if you nerf the one way we have to punish lazy or afk game play you are in fact boosting it not much more tbh high sec is so ludicrously rewarding right now theres no point for anyone to go to low sec and soon to 00where have they said this to you why dont they say it to the rest of us and explain their reasoning that would put a damper on this debate trust me
so now you feel the world is threatening to remove your free lunch so you actually have to pay for it so you actually have to pick your targets a bit more carefully you do understand that most people think that this just increases the risk a tad bit it would not be the end of gangkingagreed i also believe that people will continue to do these mistakes it is in no way connected to any form of insurance you will still profit from suicide ganking but you will have to put some more effort in choosing your targets is that what it is all really about not amused that you will have to put effort in it i seriously doubt that not compared with the single high sec miner anyway
way to take something out of context heroeffort is already there a suicide ganker puts a whole lot more effort into something than a gankee otherwise the gankee wouldnt be onewhat
was it im not the one referring new players as lunch i did however call them free lunch because that is how many perceive suicide gankingwell here is where we disagree then shipping stuff around eve is so boring i get numb just thinking about it so i acknowledge there is some effort in that to gank these travellers do also require some planning and execution i acknowledge this too but i dont think it is that much more tolling than it is for the poor hauler  i use the word poor since that is how i feel when i have to move stuff  its a matter of perspectivething is if insurance were to be left out for concord targets all that is required of the suicide gankers is to choose their targets a bit more carefully it would effectively remove some of the small fish as potential targets since they would no longer be worth it the amount of extra effort you would to have to put in would not be much and this is probably why i have such a hard time understanding the view of the gankers this is why they usually come across as whiners to meto clarify i seriously doubt that you as a single pilot make more money mining in empire than you do ratting in 00
i wasnt either if you read the quote in context with the post i excluded new players from the lunch part i was referring to those players who do nothing but sit in high sec and run missions never actually playing eve theyre just lunch they should have very little going for them in way of game mechanics and the game certainly shouldnt be balanced with them in mind once again you misunderstand what i and my kind are really saying the effort part we are speaking of is the effort the hauler puts into actually protecting himself from a gank suicide ganking is the risk for high sec haulers there is no other risk most people  carebears  dont acknowledge this and feel slighted when they get popped in their untanked t1 hauler carrying millionsbillions even the lonely high sec miner who feels so threatened by jihadswarm would do well to actually put some effort in he can watch local he can stay aligned if hes in a hulk he can tank up as long as none of these people feel they should have to put any effort in suicide ganking should not be touched it should remain as a lesson to lazy and stupid people to pay attentionright now as i said the suicide ganker puts more effort into ganking someone than the gankee puts into defending himself balancedwe where comparing ratting for 4 hours to mining for 100 not sure how that comparison started
ok then replace new players with dedicated high sec carebears my point still stands i consider that group a free lunch for the suicide gankers with the current mechanics but seriously but sit in high sec and run missions never actually playing eve who are you to tell them what playing eve is they log in they play eve saying that it is anything else is just arrogant and narrow mindedi do not misunderstand i disagreei know there is little effort to avoid ganking that does not mean that hauling is effortless you cannot disregard a large part of a task and then call it effortless because avoiding gankers is the small part having the patience to get from a to b is the challengethis is an entirely different question and seriously there is a humongous amount of effort to not be ganked by the jihad in comparison you understand that they create a warp in point with a neutral covert ops so you will not perceive it as a threat in local staying aligned is very hard for a hulk when you try to move from stone to stone to have a logistic rr you is not realistic since it might as well be ganked at the same time to have an alt or freind in a bb to break the lock of a ganker is also futile when they arrive with smartbombsim not saying it is impossible but it is a lot harder than to avoid suicide gankers personally i feel that if they want to target miners in empire like that then pay for it thats what the wardec is forno there is this thing with risk vs reward while you say that the risk is very small for a hauler who knows what he is doing id say that they have a comparatively small reward attached to it while the ganker what does he lose when he nails that 2 billion hauler really today not much to try and fail is close to free sure you could be pushed in to ratting eventually but that is actually profitable and by choiceso if we remove insurance gankers will leave the small fish  those who actually do not gain much in their hauling compared to the high price targets  they will still profit to the extreme when they nail a good target still with basically the same consequences as before  sec hit  as one who regularly flies t2 ships its hard to grasp why you would oppose this as much as you do when there still is so much money to be made from it regardless of insuranceok lets leave it at that then but do we agree that 00 ratting is more profitable than mining
opening post first line these posts are part of the minutes and the official view of ccpthey explained part of their reasoning to me but i dont think i should be quoting exactly what they said in our meetingsif you look at their planned fixes for these issues you can probably derrive how they came to the conclusion though
when asked about it ccp wrangler said you wrote it and that ccp didnt if its the official view of ccp why dont they say it is also the planned fixes listed in the op was also written by the csm as opposed to ccp right
my point was and still is that ccp shouldnt balance the game around them i call the lunch and claim they dont play the game because i view trying to play a multiplayer pvp game as a single player pve game as somewhat sillyit is effortless if you use the auto pilot guess who gets gankedstay aligned watch local tank your hulk not that much effort imohave you ever tried to wardec an npc corp try it and tell me how it wentsuicide gankers are the risk to high sec dwellers they are the only risk to npc corp high sec dwellers the risk the gankers face include  loot not dropping a smart hauler having tanked his ship mistaking or miscalculating loot value  its hard to calculate in 5 seconds  loot thieves having to grind up sec status every three daysthere is also the fact that suicide gankers would be out of business if people just learned to fly smart wanna get rid of suicide ganks dont ask ccp ask your fellow carebear what the hell hes doing when hes flying billions worth in a t1 ship thats why there are suicide ganks its all your fault
ki anyou seem to have immense hate for high sec carebears im not even going to bother arguing the validity of your facts but you need to stop caring so much on how to punish those lazy carebears jesus you sound like cartman talking about jews hippies and ginger kids in south parkits just a game you want everyone in eve to play your style its an mmo eve caters to all types of players high sec shouldnt be 100 safe but let it cater to those casual players that dont play your game or my game theres plenty of room for pvp ganking griefing and abuse in low sec and 00 let them be for gods sake
but they dont and if you cannot see this then it is you who is silly they play the market thats pvp id even consider that a far bit more of pvp than suicide ganks since they are involved 237 with their orders and contracts still agreed the game should not be balanced with one group in mind but that is true for suicide gankers too now most people consider that there is too little risk in ganking so tell me why should your group be exempt from balance yes it is effortless with the auto pilot however the moment you press that button the risk will skyrocket right so there really is no effortless risk free way to make money now with or without insurancesnot much effort not very effective either though again you cannot stay aligned the entire time local means squat if you are in a busy system in highsec the tank will add few extra seconds against a smartbomb fitted bs and in all practicality not help at all then again it is not impossible but still a lot more effort than avoiding camps in your hauleroh funny but if youre hell bent on nailing a 300m hulk in a npc corp be a man an pay that lessthanathirdofitsprice in a suicide discoball bs even without insurance you come out on top by fari had to break here would that single risk disappear if you would lose your insurance no people would still be ganked and carless afk alleggsinonebasket pilots would still lose billions looking at that list you dont seem to risk very much in isk at all exactly how much money do you lose when a op goes bad again and more importantly how much do you gain when it goes well dont tell me you live a poor life as a ganker because if you are you are a poor gankerand carebears will never cease to exist you could probably gank noobs till the day the server shuts down for every one that gets educated two new will subscribe
high sec mission runners are market pvpers uhm no traders are market pvpers the good traders factor in suicide ganks into their profit calculations nerfing suicide ganking will nerf those who are smart and do take precautions so whats the problem seems balanced to me no effort  high risk effort  low riskthen add one more thing to the list mine in a system which isnt busy theres loads of them around otherwise using those precautions youll escape 95 of all gank attemptsand if i want to nail a 30m hulk there are more of those around after all thats not why im against the removal of insurance im against any nerf to suicide ganking because i feel its a balanced system a system that is very much needed with the current high sec climate there are more reasons against the removal of insurance though ive gone through a lot of them earlier in this thread the most basic of the reasons isit makes no sense to punish one profession by making a special rule for them it makes no sense from an rp angle and it makes no sense from a mechanics angle i dont suicide gankand in eve time  isk suicide ganking is an iskh profession just like ratting or mining in fact while the potential pay out is huge its entirelly dependant on how stupid a person you encounter if people fly smart the iskh drops so low its not worth suiciding any morekeeps the meat on the table im not unhappy about that
i wrote the minutes that is correctccp verified the minutes and signed it offminutes are what was officialy stated during our meetings if it sais in the minutes ccp said x and ccp thinks y then it cant get any more official the planned fixes to issues are what ccp has in the pipeline for these specific issueswhy wrangler said that the csm has to explain why ccp feels a certain way about suicide ganking i do not know as ccp has literally stated that they believe that suicide ganking is currently too biased in the gankers favor but we are under an nda and i do not think we should be disclosing anything that has not been officially disclosed through the minutes and other official documents i have sent him an email about this though
its good that youre trying to clear this mess up i would personally be a lot more satisfied if the named devs in the op would come speak to the community about why they feel the way they do perhaps engage themselves in the debate or at least via a dev blog could you ask them
heh i think that one of the reasons ccp founded the csm is that they do not have to engage in debates on these forumsill wait till there is a reply to the mail so i know what i can and cannot say but i understand you care about this issue and would like some more details on how ccp arrived to their conclusion a dev blog might be an interesting avenue though as ccp is really involved with this and related issues and it affects a lot of players i will consider asking them that if this issue is not elaborated on in a way that satisfies the people here
thank you
um yes what do you think they do with their loot why do you think missionrunners want killrights on those who salvage their wrecks anyone who touches the market do pvp and you do not have to be a true trader by profession to do so so missonrunners do pvp just not the way you are used to or obviously familiar withwell the problem does not lie with the autopilot or the efforteffortlessness of haulers its the gangking were talking about the one that currently has close to no financial consequences that to me is low risk high reward and that is my issue do you have any experience of trying to avoid the jihad if you want ice its very hard to find a system that isnt busy in empire to mine veldspar safely is not hard but its not very profitable either unless your name is chribba and you have a veldnaught up in empire a 30m hulk dont see them much but if you want to gank a cheap miner use a brutix you still come out on topthis is also why people think you are way off it is not balanced since the profits are potentially monstrous and the financial risk or penalty is laughable it is in far worse state considering risk vs reward than what you accuse the profession of the carebeares ofit is not a punishment to one profession it is to bring them in line with others the golden years are about to end cherish the time you had instead of clinging to an imbalance it does make sense in a rp angle lots what does not makes sense in a rp angle is to pay insurance to what concord considers to be a criminal act and why it would not make sense in a mechanical angle you are very welcome to explain furtherthen do you at least have a clue what the financial loss is of a failed suicide op and the potential gain of a successful one if yo do please share so the rest of the readers can be enlightened if you dont then it is perhaps time to call it quitsmost gankers i know do this as a part time profession they do it when the opportunity arise the rest of the time they get their money elsewhere it is very profitable still even if this is only what you did with your time online even if that meant that you had to put endless effort in it it would still be without any real financial consequence and thus ridiculessly profitable and again when players learn to fly smart there will be new players that dont a fact you seemed to be very happy with so not really an argument in it self then
i tend to run around aggress to one or more players stealing from wrecks can flipping breaking into missions and looting and generally being a nuisance with a target painted on me the orange name and skull dont mean im unique it just means i wandered out to lowsec one day and went ugh security hits suck until youre ready to live in lowsec which im notwhen you see anyone starting a fight its a trap 95 of the time people offering 1v1 duels if you just flip their cans outside of stations a lone shuttle ducking into a lowsec system trying to acquire pursuers a can with 7km3 sitting out in space a gate to 00 with a frigate sitting at ityeah all trapsi see a lot of 1 v 1 fighting happening actually as for small group combat that happens a lot too humongous fleet fights that are ridiculous those happen way more often then is healthy reallylet me ask you a question exactly what fleet fight is a 4 million skill point character going to get involved in and where can i find it i guess i could go blob with the militias but that wrecks faction i guess i could sign up with a lowsec or 00 combat corporation except most of the ones worth joining ask for 10 million skill point minimums i guess i could grab my friends and go hunting oh wait did thatits not single combat ideology its a desire to increase the number of potential targets and to get the fights away from the gates and stations and out in space where they belongf this sentence makes no sense contextuallyim proposing a level playing field if the carebears want to stop me from ratting they are welcome to try if i want to interfere with the carebears i should be welcome to trymy argument is that i should be allowed to kill in high sec thats it im welcome to negotiation on the hoops i have to jump through to do so militia warfare seems like a first step but it is really only a halfstepyou have to come to understand that there is no balance between playstyles in a game you either support certain playstyles or you dont balancing playstyles is impossible piracy is freedom pure and simple and i want to fly free
just going to add my voice here these minutes were signed off by csm  ccp over the course of the week or so private discussion and assessment everything that appears in the minutes can be safely assumed to be 100 acceptable to both councils and represent a fair representation of meeting outcomes in iceland i was part of the discussion  obviously  and it was definitely the case that consensus existed between csm and ccp that suicide ganking in eve at the moment is currently unbalanced in favor of the gankers and there are not enough penaltiescounter measures against this playstyle i personally advocated playerled enforcement and some ideas like having suicide gankers denied all concord protection for 714 day periods after the gank but obviously there are some great complexities with automatic enforcement of things like that the items we pretty much all  ccp and csm  agreed on where the equal sec loss penalties for all members of the gank squad  not just the final blow  and removing insurance payouts for victims of concord tradeable killrights were also discussed as longer term solutions to this problem in the player remit anyway mainly posting to back up ank and make it crystal clear to the people posting on this thread that these minutes represent the collective word of csmccp on these discussions and both councils have signed off on the documentation appropriately to this effect
mission runners sell their loot to the highest active buy order or they reprocess the loot to mineral and sell thosebuild ships and sell those comparing that to market pvp is like selling home made apple juice and call yourself a conglomerateagain it has financial consequences the reward is again set by stupid people all the solutions to suicide ganking are in the game already just fly smartno but i have mined during wartimes it was easy for me to find an empty system it was even easier to stay aligned and be halfway to the station once the wts popped into the belt mining veldspar is profitable enough for new players if you want more profit you should have to go to lowsec or 00 you dont have to today you just run missionstry getting a tanked hulk with a brutix try itmy god how many times the profits for suicide ganking potential or real are all set by other people the pilot of the hauler determines the reward of suicide ganking the pilot of the hauler determines his own risk it is a balanced system but people are too thick to get itit is a punishment to one profession a profession that probably is one of the most balanced in eve as it does not rely on artificial limits but rather on people and their stupidity or lack thereof it doesnt make sense in an rp angle as insurance doesnt make sense in an rp angle if we are to model insurance on rl insurance then noone in eve would get any it doesnt make sense in a mechanics angle as it will create more problems than it solves it will not stop suicide ganking it probably wont even limit it it will cause problems for players who makes a mistake in high seccontinued
fair enough answer this one for me though in regards to balancedone side the gankee always loses even if the ship was empty they are out iskiesthe other side the attacker might lose that loss is generally the fact that the expensive part he was after blew upif you pvpd all the time with a 100 guarenteed loss ratio how much time would you spend pvping especially since you would be pvping against people that you could not under any circustances engage firstthat is what is out of kilter the one getting attacked will always lose the other may not make a profit the one getting attacked has no option of fighting backwhen you watch ravens suiciding empty or near empty haulers because they know that they will hit the jackpot at some point the system is borkedi have no issue with suiciding as a tactic or profession i do have an issue with the loss being completely onesided and little recourse for the one attacked agreed doing something that summons concord should result in no insurance doesnt matter if it is a suicide or a mission runner tagging a structure or cloaked mission invader same samethe kill rights resulting from that destruction should be tradeablesellable doesnt matter if it is a suicide or that mission invader i could easily see someone purposely invading missions in defenseless frigs cloaking getting smart bombed and selling the resulting kill rights to you to gank someones faction fitted marauderfair is fair no
yes i do the financial loss of a failed suicide gank depends on what the target was it can be as low as a couple of million or as high as a couple of hundred million financial loss is not the only loss a suicide ganker faces though as explained in an earlier post it has financial consequences and it doesnt have to be ridiculessly profitable it is up to younew players dont have anything worth suicide ganking them over so this is all a strawman much like most of your post
as i have been trying to tell that other guy it just isnt how you describe it to be when you get ganked then yes you will always lose the part of the equation you guys keep ignoring is that fact that you can avoid getting ganked its easy to do and i cant understand why more people dont you arguing this is like me arguing that poses are over powered because i accidentally warped to a moon in low sec and got blasted i could have avoided that moon its my fault entirelly but no im gonna blame it on the postradeable killrights is something i would love to see in the game loss of insurance for invoking concords wrath is something ccp would be very stupid to implement
im sure you know this is wrong ccp is not setting up a task force to see if theres a problem theyve set up a task force because there is a problem and to tell us what theyre going to do about it the very first sentence of the op states ccps view ie todays suicide gank mechanics are too biased in the gankers favor this is a completely accurate view currently suicide ganking is done at will it is done anywhere it is done with very little impact to the suicider s  and often at great cost to the person being gankedthe short term goal stated in the op is a plan of action to increase the sec hit of suicide ganking and make sure everyone involved in the gank receives the hit thats a plan to implement not a plan to investigate the only thing theyre investigating in the short term goal is whether they should add on an additional sec hit penalty based upon the security status of the victimyour intentional misrepresentation of what has been clearly stated and your many posts on this thread indicate a desperation i find pleasant im afraid im finding it difficult to resist gloatingwindjammer
lack of a spine doesnt make me mad its more disheartening then anything plus it represents a lost revenue opportunity  dont make assumptions1 i dont suicide gank  yet though ive been more than tempted when i saw 10 hulks clustered nicely together in an icefield unaligned2 an afk mammoth with a billion isk worth of mods gets what he deserves in my opinion if he has that much money then hes been playing the game long enough to know the risks3 insurance payouts for getting concorded are stupid to be fair insurance in general is a fairly goofy game mechanic in my opinion4 as a friend of mine pointed out the game was designed so that the 1 billion mod hauling carebear should have hired some muscle to protect him on his 20 jump run however almost no one that can shoot things is going to do that because its boring as heck so the solution implemented is infinitely strong and invulnerable police who act as repercussion agents because the designers assumed like the designers of the death penalty that this will stop crime then everyone is surprised that not only does crime continue but now because society has assumed this protection exists people have taken increasingly dumber and dumber chances rather than insuring their safety and security so now the populace clammers for even more protection so that they can sleep comfortably knowing that their autopiloting industrial can go from one end of space to another unmolested the fact that he was stupid is why he deserves it nature favors the quick the strong and the smart everyone else can die outreplace tough with the word boring and filled with characters with 50 times more money than me and you get a closer approximation to the truth if my corp could join bob or iac or red swarm or hydra or insert 00 alliance here and make a meaningful contribution to the fighting trust me we would be there but whos going to recruit a bunch of 5 month old characters in cruisersim willing to accept thisopen up the npc corps and i will core me out some logistical alts on my listthere is granularity between 1v1 and 100v100 i find 510v510 immensely funthe fact that empire has so many characters is telling i think at some point it comes down to being honest to your vision and making it work instead of constantly patching
unfortunately it isnt easy anymore it used to be  year or go ago  it was common wisdom that if you flew with less than xx amount in your cargo hold you were safe only if they were ticked at you were you at risk times have changedi watched this last weekend 2 haulers go down with less than 10m in cargo one i convoed to get the info the other was a corpmate my corpmate was stupid he was afking he is also less than 2 months old and that 10m in t1 missiles were all he had no attempt was made to scan him of course he could have just been blind and not seen ithe could have avoided the other was destroyed in the undock port of jita 44 t1 hauler construction parts t1 fittings total loss of ship and everything was about 10m that ship wasnt even scanned they targetted and blew it up the only chance to avoid quite simply was to not go into a 9 security systemif this was happening only to those that were carrying a bunch of crap and being stupid i wouldnt care it isnt costs are low enough that they are willing to just shoot knowing that if 1 in 20 actually has something they will still make a profitthat is why i think it is borked
ki an since you are the most vocal counteradvocate in this thread my comment is particulary addressed to you but i would apply equally to anyone elseccp has stated that suicide ganking is unbalancedwhile you may disagree with that the reality is that changes are comingeither you can continue to fight in vain to stop the inevitable or you can redirect your efforts to suggesting that the changes that are made are reasonablei am not a fan of suicide ganking as i tend to be on the recieving side more often than the ganking side but even still i am hestitant to see insurance payouts removed from gankers there is a lot of potential fall out from such a drastic changein all honesty do you have a problem with changing the security status hit so that it impacts all attackers or do you seriously believe that only the character laying the final blow should be fully penalized for the attackif the full gank squad needed to grind back their standings instead of just the one laying the final blow we might see people being more selective in their targets and thus see a more reasonable balancethat is a simple change that could bring better balance without making a drastic shift in game balance but it will take some time to see how it affects actually gankersi do not want to see ccp make drastic changes to this game mechanic smaller incrimental changes should be made and tested on tq for a while to see how they actually affect the balanceif fixing security status hits does not establish acceptable balance i would advocate teiring of security hits based on system securityaltering the insurance payout system should be a measure of last resort and if it is altered i would suggest making the change so that it only applies to those who lose their ships to concord after participating in a successful kill without affecting those who only engage in an act of agression
i was talking about provoking a fight through wreck thieving can flipping whatever
yes and its time for 34 of the population to evolve and stop hiding behind moms skirthilariously so but its really hard to play a game where almost no one speaks a language its hard enough in eve trying to ransom a norwegian industrial at least i can sort of understand what hes saying if i stare long enough and ask a friend asian character sets explode my mind sadly  you act like i havent been thereand i dont want to hunt newbs id be happy having any character less than a month old being invulnerable to any sort of pvp outside of lowsec and 00
no inexperienced missionrunners do that experienced missionrunners create sell orders hence they pvp on the market id consider most runners that do lvl 4 missions to be experienced or do you seriously believe that they are incapable of creating sell ordersthere is close to no finacial consequence jesus you do not lose money in relation to what the hauler is carrying its a fixed amount it does not matter if the hauler fly smart or stupid you still get the same insurance pay outtry getting a tanked hulk for 30m try ityes my god no one complains about the reward it is the risk  financial loss  that is the issue here the loss that is the same regardless of what the hauler carriedseriously you can get away with a 4 million loss for an unfitted bs dont tell me that is not cheap
fair enough i know my side has probably lost this fight but ill sure as hell be the first one to stick it in the face of the first carebear who comes crying to gd after having lost his raven to concord ill have my fun then thats probably because you are able to think further than your own nose its a rare trait but admirablenope no problem at all i never actually looked hard at my security status log and i thought it already was like thisagreedthats much better than tiering it on security status of character that would be a real unbalanced mechanicyes last resort and your follow up isnt all bad either first resort should be educating people on how to fly smart that has obviously failed second resort should be gettin tradeable killrights in the game when the whines continue the next step should be sticking a middle finger in the stupid peoples faces long after that ccp could perhaps take a look at the insurance thing
perfectly acceptable to me personally i think that both will need to be done but i cant see any reason not to start with on then add the other if needed tradeable killrights are more in the spirit of eve hence start there more pew pew is good for us carebear industrialists too
no but i seriously still wouldnt call it market pvp id call it market pvp lite perhaps my point is nobody needs high sec mission runners they dont contribute anything all they do is lag out systems suicide ganking is actually good for them they get a place in the food chain at the bottom where they should beyes that is true what you can limit is the payout you chose not to your problemsurercu ii named diagnostics systemmedium shield booster ii em hardener ii invuln ii named heat resistance amp3x modulated stripminer iisrigs 2x core defence field extendersi dont calculate with the rigs in mind as they dont drop and dont factor in the rest except for the strip miners should easily go for under 30m a cheapo hulk like the ones flying around all over empire wont have t2 strips anyway even if it did this one could tank most gank attempts unless the attempt is very dedicated a jihad attempt would failits not too cheap everyone benefits from it also as ive explained to you i dont know how many times the consequences for suicide gankers arent mainly financial
whether youre rich or not is not something im interested in what i am interested in is making you pay for the grief you love to cause payment may be made in a combination of no insurance payout and in time it takes you to recover from the sec hit imposed upon you for your crimehow long should you have to play to recover from a suicide gank im inclined to say weeks rather than days how long will it take your victim to recover currently the source of your pleasure is derived from imposing pain upon others that you in no way shareohhhhi seethe bulk of your victims are macroers why didnt you say so ive misjudged you so badly can you ever forgive me the actions and self advertising of jihadswarm are not aimed at macroers they are aimed at any and all miners your greatest pleasure comes from killing the ships of active players not macroers and goonswarms comments in game and on the forums support that your suggestion that youre helping the game is the same goonswarm drivel used to excuse every grief tactic that goonswarm engages in were killing you miners to get macroers and make eve better for you were can flipping and baiting noobs to teach them how to play eve were destroying poss in 00 to make 00 safe for new playersthe one thing you say here thats accurate is there needs to be some kind of balance i and most others who play eve agree however current conditions are not balanced dont worry though were working to fix thatwindjammer
another factor to concider would be to only drop the platinum insurance for gankers but keep the basic 40 payoutalso take a look at the structure hp and ship bonuses of various haulers a speed bonus does nothing useful on a hauler under current game mechanics changing those to either an agility or structure bonus would have a significant effect on suicide ganking
this is why this debate is so muddled vindictive carebears who cant fend for themselves getting all overzelous you may treat this as some super duper victory but trust me when this is all over and done with youll still be dying to people that play smarter than you
no its not i do agree that they need to get out of npc corps where they can only be suicide ganked but a lot of players are in player corps and are perfectly legitimate targets what your asking for is complete uncontested access to high sec so you can roam around and force you idea of fun on everyone elseyou even said if it destroys eve its fine with you you lost all credibility with your argument there arkania some people just want a higher sense of security than others and thats what high sec should be the npc corps ruin this because it creates bastions of invulnerability that players hide in even i have a problem with this but you have a problem with high sec not being your own personal hunting ground that will simply never happenso your young in the game and not enjoying it a whole lot because people dont fight you 237 too bad a character that is a year old might not be able to fly anything that could fight you if all that character does is mine manufacture and research there is absolutely nothing wrong with that as ccp and the community have worked very hard to make those professions as interesting and entertaining as possible so when you stir up fights in high sec and they dont have a spine your assuming they have a gun to bring back to the fight when they might just have a stick some people dont see any riskreward in fighting the occasional pirate that flips a can so they just move and keep on working so what if you want to fight there are a ton of people to fight you just want to fight those who are ill prepared to do it if they were interested in pvp they wouldnt be mining a rock or running a mission in high sec to begin with you logic is flawed all you care about is your way of playing the game regardless of the consequencesthis thread is about suicide ganking not opening up space as your personal playground suicide ganking as ccp and csm pointed out current has very little risk associated with it and they are looking into ways to address it
your statistics are distorted and exaggerated to the point of being useless pulling statistics out of the air or out of a less pleasant place sort of kills what little credibility you have left trivial to avoid 99 of high sec suicide attacks where could you possibly have gotten such a statistic if youre talking about freighters and haulers i might believe a high percentage could be avoided but certainly not 99 if youre talking about miners youre flat out lying there is no way for an active miner to avoid a solo high sec suicide gank none as part of jihadswarm you know this ive seen hulks with shield hardeners and shield booster going flat out unable to warp out because theyre being bumped out of alignment by a cov op alt taken down by about three salvos from a suicide ganker battlecruiser and this in 07 space thats a long way from zeroe precautions and thats a very long way from balancedcomparing high sec tactics to 00 sec tactics just makes you look foolish and inexperienced i seriously doubt you are either the rules of engagement in 00 and high sec are radically different and that means the tactics have to be radically different this is to say nothing of the difficulty in scanning a high sec local channel for hostiles there are more people in the high sec channel anybody who isnt friend is assumed enemy in 00 and the process in high sec is rendered useless anyway when the hostile is using an out of corp alt in a cloaked cov op shipwindjammer
it would be interesting to see and expand on the amount of risk overall the average player in high sec is taking just sucking on a rock like you mentioned you want the gankers to have more risk fine that works but in the same line of thinking you are removing or minimizing the risk of the miners industrialists or mission runners that is not equal to the reward alreadythere is a lot of banter about making sure that the risk equals the reward but i do not see that equation used for all i would like to see it balanced but it has to be fair everyone has agreed to the terms of play before they sub they agree to it before they log in its player beware they can not expect to come into a game with established frame work and stomp their feet saying its morally wrong and unfair if they do not like taking risks because the games is not conducive with their play style dont you think they might have picked the wrong game to play and this pertains to both carebear and pvpr
this is why this debate is so muddled frightened griefers wishing to maintain an imbalance in game mechanics which allow them a safe pain free profitable way to cause others grief they will say anything regardless of how false or absurd it is to save themselvesassume youre smarter if you wish it makes my job much easier in the meantime cry me a river build a bridge and get over it windjammer
first let me say that i do respect ki an i have read his posts for a long time and do enjoy reading them when he actually responds his responses are normally well thought out and well reasoned that being saidki a question was asked you about the cost of a failed suicide gank and you referred to that cost being based on the target and that is wrong the cost of a failed gank is based on what you are flying your target stopped mattering when it got away  or if you succeeded in killing that ship and some 3rd party looted it before you could the cost of a failed suicide gank iscost  cost of ship  cost of insurance  insurance payoutthis is where the mechanics is messed up this cost is known and minimalif your attack succeeds you get the cargo left over soprofit  cost  lootif the cost value is minimal at best all loot is profit profit with little if any loss  unbalancedif the insurance is removed the cost of the ship becomes the cost and the profit becomes the loot  cost of the ship you still stand to make a good profit when you take out and loot the wreck of that idiot with a few billion in an ity but now its costing you when you fail or the ity you attack is empty  or not carrying anything of sufficient value to cover the ship cost removal of the insurance payout is not aimed and has never been aimed at stopping suicide ganks it has been aimed at increasing the cost of failure just like suicide ganking raises the cost of failure in transporting goodsby the same token basing the security hitbump on the security level of the system means the security cost of suicide ganks in 5 space would be a lot less then 10 space but that it could not be recovered in 00 space thus those who wish to fix a low  or very low  security level will be in lowsec space as they have the biggest rats that will give a bump to your security level
mining is theoretically infinite wealth generation over the long term with theoretically 0 risk i regularly enter systems with 1 to 10 miners in npc corporations in the various mining ships sitting completely still with infinite shield tanks running and npc rats orbiting them ive seen this from 08 to 05 all these people are doing is earning x amount of money per hour by essentially imposing a time debt there is no risk here except in the occasional suicidethey are risking nothing and gaining everything by partaking in this action they are able to fuel their pvp alts which get a reward for killing other people and taking their stuff and their risk is diluted to nothing due to the infinite wealth generation machine that funds the fighting essentially the existing of suicide ganking is at present the only mechanic to combat invulnerable logisticsyes fine 80 of character are in high sec empire im willing to argue that at least 60 of those characters are involved in wealth generation and logistical support for a large portion of the 20 outside of empirethere is no balance to mining as it currently exists and there is no measurable risk to the miners actions
not sure you actually got what i was talking about there the cost is determined by your target if you go for a freighter using lots of bs and fail youll be out more than if you go for a transport using a couple of bs or a t1 hauler using a bc
actually the cost of failure is the difference in the ships cost versus the insurance payoutthe value of the possible loot from the target vessel does not matterif hurting the logistics of a corporation is the aim then even if the cargo is totally lost if your losses  between payout and cost of the ships  is greater than their losses its a win
the problem is that cost is not determined by the target cost is determined by one person flying with too much stuff and that warps the results for everyone because of the low cost of the ship being used you can easily afford to just assault ships without verifying if they are even carrying cargo ever so often you will get an idiot which makes the whole thing worthwhilewe dont want to nessessarily alter the ability to gank those that are being stupid we want to reduce the casual fall off because the attacker knows he will hit the jackpot eventuallyif these alterations were implemented attackers would have to determine whether that ship was actually worth it rather than hauler with stuff blow it oh well only some t1 ammo those that would make a living with this style of play would instead make sure that the ship was scanned and worth attacking as it is too many ships are blown without verification because the attacker knows that 1 in 20 will carry enough to cover his losses we want to make shift the odds so that he has to chose to attack that one that willhope i am clear
thats because we need to take into consideration the time invested not just risk vs rewards by mining in high sec for example youll never make the same as say someone running missions or trading in high sec theoretically i can earn billions of isk killing guristas frigs in a 10 system at virtually no risk assuming its done with a highenough sp character there isnt risk per se but the time required is practically infinintesuicide ganking is inbalanced because it doesnt take much time skill or significant risk to cause relative damage which can amount from nothing but a nuissance to gamebreaking the risk is always constant and minimal the gains vary from nothing to extremely lucrative suicide ganking definitely deserves a place in eve but not in its current form basically there should be stiffer penalties to suicide ganking in high sec for s and gigglesthere should also be tradebacks and high risk associated with professional and highly organized suicide ganks they shouldnt be elminitated just balanced i think ccp and csms are on the right track with this one
as i said well reasoned i went back and read the original question and you are right it was asked about the op so the target would matter in the size of the op but the loss is the same ship cost  insurance cost  insurance payoutif the insurance payout covers the cost of the ship and the insurance even a failed gank op has no cost to the criminalsby your own admission suicide ganks are stupidity based i autopilot an ity 3 with 500 million isk worth of stuff i am being stupid and should pay for that stupidity a point i agree with you on by the same token a stupid ganker should also pay the price your 30 bs op was not enough to kill the freighter you should have brought 40 your bc did not pop my ity 3 should have done something different your cost for stupidity is the cost to replace your ship just like my cost would be a new cheap ship and more cargo to haul i guessi am not advocating lessening my cost as the stupid hauler i am an advocate for raising your cost as a stupid ganker  why i dont support basing the insurance pay out on a destroyed target ship just on concord involvement 
eve is not risk free there is no place in eve that is absolutely safe these things apply to all eve players including suicide gankers if you signed up for something else you signed up for the wrong gamea hulk is the toughest and largest t2 mining barge in all of eve it was designed to endure the rigours of places as dangerous as 00 sec space it can ignore high sec npc rats so when such a vessel is mining in a high sec area with lots of concordpolice running around to help protect it it is in a low risk situation it is not in a no risk situation it can still be suicide ganked as can any ship in eve the rewards for a hulk mining in high sec are quite low compared to the rewards of low sec and 00under current game mechanics a suicide ganker can attack and destroy a hulk in at least as high a sec as 07 using a single t1 battlecruiser the t1 battlecruiser is much cheaper to purchase or build than the t2 hulk the t1 battlecruiser can be insured for an insurance payout of a high percentage of its market value the t2 hulk cannot the successfull suicide ganker rebuilds his sec status in a day or two and his isk loss is nonexistant in fact he makes a profit from the whole thing the hulk pilot may have to mine for weeks to rebuild his assets and thats assuming hes got a hulk to do it withthe above are some of the considerations used for determining the relative riskreward situation for high sec miners and high sec suicide gankers currently this represents an imbalance that is in the process of being correctedwhen people sign on for eve they sign on for a dynamic and evolving game they sign on for a game that does not favor one mode of play or career path over another they sign on for a game that has risk but not overbalanced risk they sign on for a complex deep and involved game they do not sign on for a game that allows minimally trained newbs to risk nothing in destroying the assets of well trained and experienced playersif suicide gankers wish to grief other players they should be prepared to pay they may pay by having to grind away at ratting to rebuild their sec status and they can pay with isk loss from their destroyed ships right now they can regain sec status too quickly in a day or two right now they are for all practical purposes not paying in isk at all quite the oppositeregardswindjammer
i couldnt agree more i would have to change your numbers though arkania because you yourself and most others including the carebears admit that a large part of the people worth ganking or needing to be ganked are hiding in npc corps and those do not by any means account for 60 of the population of high sec if they do then well hell i want them kicked out just as bad as you do and made targets for everyoneyou have to admit mining for 100 hours to get the same reward as ratting for 4 hours and ganking the minerhauler is risk vs reward one of those you can do in a night the other takes a month for anyone less than a hardcore gamer i just want them to be targets legally one way or another to resolve the conflict
i guess from reading the posts from the carebear players that experience little or no risk in their game play demanding others to have their risk increased and rewards minimized it just seems one sided especially when they say its too easy for you it should be harder as they type out these threads while logged in afk mining running missions or hauling watching tv
ill entertain bait i play almost exclusively in low sec and 00 travelling very rarely to high sec and only to shop care in formulating a more accurate generalizationmore obvious troll bait grow up some perhaps we can then have a conversation we both enjoy
it is ccps decision as to whether the rules and the risks meet their vision of the game statements indicate that ccp doesnt believe so dont blame the carebears if people use game mechanics in ways other than intended and result in changes if ccp wanted it this way it would stay this way
about the npc corporations what is different about them being in such a corp compared to being in a similar sized alliance stop and consider how many of those complaining about them would wardec them if tomorrow they were all put in a wardecable alliance  all of one empires npc corps in the same alliance not many i think considering the numbers that would enjoy coming to visit  all those s would suddenly have targets that wouldnt cost them sec hits thing is they cant file wardecs back so their own tactics can be used against them  have a couple folks in battleships pay attention to who the suicides are and return the favor after all neither will be fitting a tank since they are designed to be lost to concord 
windjammerdo you know how long it takes to grind up sec status say if your were just a 5 and also do you know the mechanic for raising sec status only occurs once every 15 minutes and it only pertains to the rat you are killing atm and do you also know that the jumping into other systems to reset the timer no longer works  i bring that up because there is some misconception that it is still in play  so no it does not take a day or two and it would take some one that is pretty hard core and not the casual gamer to make any significant progress at alland this would also assume that they have access to 00 resources but not all of us have that luxury to graze with the 00 sheepi have suicide ganked yes and the target was a macro farmer i do not do it often but once in a great while and very selective i was out quite a bit of cash but it was fun it took a long long long time to grind up 7 on the sec hit scale actually an entire month i am a casual gamer i do not have access to 00
very true cant believe this argument hasnt been put forth before yes there needs to be a stupiditytax on suicide gankers lets see if ccp gets this right
it was an observation if it hit a nerve sorry it was not bait it was a comment like everyone else that has can make comments to what they observe if i keep it clean and not abusive its fair game if you do not like my comments and it is contrary to your views tough deal with it
yes the only sucide ganks i have done sofar was against macrominers  and it takes quite a while to get secstatus up againi am against sucideganking  griefingversion  but this is eve and its good that wayonly thing that should be changed it that there should be no insurance pay out for ships killed by concord greetings belmarduk
observation you say i face little to no risk from what i do when did you make this observation when did you observe me afk mine or afk mission when have you observed me watching tv while hauling ive wasted enough time with your trolls already
where in pvp does it state that you have to fire a gun it seems to me that you read in a lot of things in the abbreviation of player versus player as long as someone through an action have an effect on another player it is pvp not market pvp light and missionrunners lag out systems have you ever seen a fleet in 00 they lag out node they can force the server on its knees they make jita look like turbo so dont give me that crap its just simple bs and no one benefits from you spreading it and where does it say that we have a food chain you really make this up as you go rightwhat i cannot limit the insurance payout you know the issue at handyou just forgot to mention the tiny sum of the hulk itself there though so no if you want to gank a hulk you bring a bs if you want to gank a miner with 30m of ship then you bring a brutix then you started to jabber about 30m hulks and i tried to insinuate that there is no such thing as a 30m hulk my bad i should have said it straight outfor the record you do know that a hulk is a t2 mining barge right as in it gets a useless insurance payout so if you gank one with a bs you will get out ahead by faryou try so hard to miss the point 4m for a battle ship is dirt cheap no way you can spin that in another direction if you seriously believe otherwise then you do not have a cluenow how on earth do everyone benefit from it i sure do not gain anything from it in 00 or in an alliance with functioning logistics and industry there might be a slight increase of prices in jita but that is hardly a benefitas many times you have explained that the concequences for gankers arent mainly finacial you have missed entirely that there is no financial repercussions at all that is what we want some financial downside in addition to the current consequences then its fine the ganker can keep on ganking but has to choose its targets more wisely but those who can adapt will still reap insanely amounts of cash
hey i was referring to the posts not to the decision of what ccp has in mind whatever ccp does is what they do and we have the decision to continue to adapt to the new vision or find something else to do its pretty simpleso basically are you telling me no matter what i say it does not matter because my views are contrary to what you think get real
no id still call it market pvp lite a trader does so much more than just put up sell orders a good trader is worthy of respect for his abilities a mission runner deserves no such respect for reading a mission running guide onlinefor the record i have seen fleets in 00 i flew with your alliance when we pushed iac and a out of 49u where you there thenthe issue at hand has been so blurred by now its hard to keep a straight discussion no you cannot limit insurance payout you can however limit the payout for the suicide ganker by using one of the methods outlined beforeguess we misunderstood each other i was talking about potential loot drop you know the part that interests the suicide ganker i havent heard of any cases where the ship itself drops as lootok 4 mil for a bs is dirt cheap however id like to know where you find bs for 4 mil i cant seem to find them anywherewell i thought you liked cheap ships btw arent you in empire nah that was a mean stab at a good alliance anyway the real reason here seems to be that prices are too low lets have ccp do something about that instead huhthere are financial repercussions if you fail a gank youre not winding up in the green
if you go back and look the 30m isk hulk was a typeo it was quoting a post where the price was 300mthey are currently running about 100m or so
no i was saying quit blaming the situation on someone whos fault it isnt you blame the carebears for whining but it is really ccp that is probably going to alter the rules they dont alter the rules just because someone is whining they alter them to fit their visionbesides i see an awful lot of pvpers whining about things too seems to me not many highsec carebears worry about nos domis nanophoons afk cloakers npc corps etc they arent whining in here that it isnt fair that they are safe or that losing insurance would eliminate their play style either the players you are focusing your anger at are pretty low on the scale of current whine threads
easy dude you are overreacting and being a little defensive and are you dismissing my views and calling me a troll because i do not agree with you well i am sorry you feel that way i hope things work out for you out of game
you may or may not have noticed but it was the whining that made the csm look into it and it was the csm who got ccp to look into it why should high sec carebears worry about those things the only thing a high sec carebear has to worry about is suicide gankers and they are about to be nerfed its a grand day to be an empire carebear a grand day that will end in tears and blood once the suicide ganking picks up againsomeone talked about a false sense of security making people put billions in their cargo what do you think nerfing suicide ganking will do to that false sense of security im not clair voyant but i think i can read the future on this one people will put billions in their cargo get popped and then whine to ccp that suicide ganking is out of control
i underlined and bolden the funny parts for you
just saying that it isnt just hte carebears that do the whining on the forumsagain the problem isnt that people will do it those individuals deserve to get what they do the problem is that the costs of failure for the attackers is low enough that they have stopped even bothering to scan ship before attacking haulers a lot of them are getting destroyed because they might have something not because they do when the profit margins are good enough that those doing the attacking do not need to even scan the ship before hitting it it is out of whackthat is the only thing i would like altered the ability for a lightly loaded hauler not worth anything to be able to fly semisafe in empire you used to be able to in todays eve you cant i would like to make the loss for the idiots who afterwards say whoops only t1 ammo damn actually mean somethingthere are many options on the table two of them discussed even between us in this thread i have no problem in trying either or both in any order and perfectly willing to implement one and wait to see if anything else is needed that is mostly reasonable no
fair enough i missed that in context
i would still like to know just how common this sort of attacks are this is the sort of stupid suicide gankers that really should be made to suffer i have never encountered any of them unless the gank was just for lulz those fail most of the time
this goes hand in hand with dont fly what you cant buy if you cant do the time dont do the crimeas it happens i do know how long it takes to raise sec status i know the ratting mechanic occurs every 15 minutes and that it pertains solely to the rat being killed this is why people intent upon raising their sec status make sure they kill only high level rats once every 15 minutes and use timers to ensure this even casual gamers have access to 00 when they have only a fraction of the eve experience you lay claim toi was not however aware of the change in the mechanism for resetting the 15 minute timer i find this interesting and would appreciate a link to the relevant thread or information however even if this is the case regaining sec status is still too fast under current conditions and still remains an issue of a couple of days rather than weekswith regards to your own suicide ganking activity im pleased that you chose your victim carefully and apparently took care to ensure he was a macroer we could use more suicide ganking like that however given the present mechanics i dont understand how you could be out quite a bit of cash worst case scenario would be a target in 08 to 10 sec space this would almost certainly require a battleship to do the damage necessary inside the space of time it would take for concord to respond to an upper high sec criminal act while battleships are more expensive than battlecruisers its still not in the realm of a lot of cash especially when the t1 battleship has been max insuredand again especially not for someone of your long experience in the gamein your situation you could start a macro killing service did you know that there are actually people who have isk given to them for killing macroers additionally it should be no problem for you to gain access to 00 even if you are a casual player youre a player who has been in the game a long timein the case of a new player who wishes to suicide gank fine let him gank the more experienced player whos miningand then let him pay is he prepared for the price no no more than another new player is prepared to pay the price of losing a ship but thats his choice he made it and he can pay for it it is unreasonable to ask others to pay for him insteadwindjammer
i had one try to pop my occ thinking it was an interon i only dropped me to 30 shields though would have popped the t1s with far less of a tank i see a lot around jita that target as soon as you decloak and begin to align for the next jump gate only reason i got shot at was the overview lagged and had to use the right click to do warp to zero for the next gatebut considering his buddy looted his wreck and the insurance payout i doubt he lost any isk on the attack
i would like numbers too my personal observations are that they are frequent enough i fly a blockade runner with istabs instead of expanders to buy pos fuel even though i could use a t1 hauler and get it in one trip instead of 4 am i paranoid of course ive lived for 15 years in a npc corp in empire 1 jump from jita i see it happening too often to be considered normal in what is the hub of trade in empire most of those ive talked to when its happened have been clueless as to why and have claimed to not have been carrying anything expensiveall im asking for is to weed out the idiots the professionals that stalk their prey chose their targets wisely and hit at the right time should be rewarded with success unless their prey was well prepared and wary the fotm needs to go and is harmful for the game overall
this is not why suicide ganking is being balanced people who put billions in their cargohold go to jita get popped and then whine about it are not taken seriously they have not been taken seriously in the past and they will not be taken seriously in the future by either the player base ccp or a third party youre exagerating an extrapolation to an absurd conclusionadditionally the upcoming changes will not change the frequency with which ships carrying billions in their cargoholds are suicide ganked anyone who believes otherwise needs to be suicide ganked with billions in their cargohold if for no other reason than social darwinismwindjammer
then i can count on you people mocking the hell out of the first carebear who gets suicided after the nerf i mean none of this now this is completely messed up and need to be nerfed crap i mean youll roast that bear for his stupidity right
i mock people for whining about their missions being salvaged right now i have little sympathy for older players getting blown up after reclaiming their ore right nowand if someone flies a 17 billion hauler  like the idiot in general today  by me i would be tempted to suicide it too if i knew about it i have never suicided someone but if the reason is good enough
dear ccpive been pirating for 5 months i would like ccp to calculate how much money the average mining character makes in that time and reimburse me for any disparity i feel that my risk versus reward is significantly and improperly skewed towards risk while the miners risk versus reward is skewed towards reward given the following1  finding a target to can flip can take hours2  on average a can flipped target will retreat from any fight leaving behind a can valued at roughly 500000 to 1000000 isk assuming this is the only person ive can flipped in the past 4 hours this represents 250000 isk per hour significantly less reward than can be earned for no risk and the same amount of time spent mining3  on the rare occasion that a target will fight me i might lose a ship plus fittings or i will destroy them and acquire mods that are worth on average 1 million to 5 million isk as losing a ship results in a net loss after insurance because i lose fittings and ammunition this impacts my isk per hour further stolen mods rarely significantly impact my isk per houras mining acquires more isk per unit of time then my actions and my actions by necessity require the risking of ships mods and pods whereas mining requires no risk on the aggregate of ships mods or pods then i feel it is unfair for ccp to reward miners in such a matter i feel that if the risk vs reward for mining and trading were fairly calculated then i deserve a significant amount of money from ccp for participating in a playstyle which has significantly more risk for significantly less rewardand ive been shipped and podded in high sec by an angry can flip target does that make me a victim of suicide ganking   so suicide ganking is like trading theni agree there should be stiffer penalties for mining and trading as well to balance their unfair risk vs reward advantage
yep i will be there asking for his name to be changed to tutupid tuplay
if somebody puts billions in his t1 hauler and afk autopilots i roast them now ill certainly do it in the future particularly if they advertise the deed by whining about it geez thats right up there with the guy that asks in local for a cyno so he can move his carrier and then whines about some stranger throwing a cyno that lands him in the middle of a bunch of guys who shoot the crud out of himso yeahyou can count upon me to mock them if they do something like ive described above i cant speak for others in this thread but you can rely upon mewindjammer
wheres your mining alt  i think its a fair question people are demanding that suicide ganking be made harder since it represents nearly the only real threat to empire logistics empire wars dont count since you get a 24 hour warning which gives you plenty of time to duck into npc corporations dock up transfer material to alts etc without the capriciousness of suicide ganking there is no real threat to empire logisticsand while they demand that suicide ganking be made more risky in one breath they defend the eversoloveable miners with their infinite reward vs 0 risk my feeling is that either the risk gets turned up on people hiding behind npc corporations or suicide ganking should remain as is to bring balance to the risk vs rewardyou have a pve option that is infinite reward with almost no risk and you have a pvp option that is infinite reward with almost no risk i see this as balanced
i suicide ganked them because they were clearing out all the belts in the system 5 of them grouped together all the other residents did not what to do so we petitioned nothing but no one wanted to step up and take the hit too much risk they claimed so i did killed all five in a 7 system being a one char player  because i like to focus on the development and i am at the age now where multitasking is a hurdle i was no longer welcome there by concord could not collect the loot so i spent a month ratting and ducking pirates so i can get my arse back to high sec yes i had plenty of cash it is just the fact that i lost a wee bit more than what ever one is claiming the actual loss is windjammer my time in game has little weight or any at all my views are my views i have been through a few changes here and there and adapted but now we have the opportunity to make our views heard and what i want to make sure is that it is a truly a balanced fix before ccp would just make changes and then try to fix it much later and we had to live with it i want a balanced fix that will work for everyone and not just a narrow focus on a few knotheads and not thinking whom elses play style it is effecting
wait your saying that crime doesnt pay it never has in all of history crime has returned a lower net return over workings ones ass off once the risk level has been factored in there is a reason that lower gdp is associated with corruption corrupt states are not effective or efficient low sec fits the model compare the value of the goods traded in low sec stations  not the relative prices the total value  with the value of the goods in the hghsec trade hubs jita probably has more assets than all of lowsec unfortunately mining for 23 hours takes dedication and lacks the rush of adrenaline you get traded adrenaline reward for isk your choice your play style

this proposal was not passed for escalation by the csm while i feel it fulfilled the requirements set out by ccp in their call for proposals there was much misinterpretation of the system outlined here and some existing 00 power blocks felt it would threaten their security  although that was neither the intention nor the likely result also please note that all numerical values such as  of ships to capture a stargate capture times percentages etc can be adjusted for balance purposes the intent is simply to outline a mechanic that can be tweaked as neededspecific proposal for 00 sovereignty revampin response to the ccp post here linkagerequesting concrete proposals to achieve the followingthe longterm plan for 00 warfare is to have multiple layers of goals and objectives instead of all fighting occurring over stations this would allow small groups to have an impact on the game instead of needing hundreds of ships to have influence in 00this proposal intends to specifically and concretely outline improvements to 00 warfare and sovereignty to meet that stated goal this proposal intends to hit the following targets for end result attackerdefender dynamics1  infrastructure affords defender advantage  investing in your territory increases your ability to defend it successfully2  time zone warfare doesnt break the system  ie peak and offpeak times for an alliance are mitigated by a need for long term effort to attackdefend territory3  dispersion of forces yields better results than concentrated forces  include a mechanic that contains incentives to fight simultaneous battles on different grids or even different systems to reduce the needincentive for blobbing and encourage small scale pvp4  objectives for small subcapital gangs  include mechanics allowing small gang harassment attacks on territory providing incentive for defenders to maintain control of their spacepart 1 the 3 layersto achieve these goals we will divide the elements of territory warfare into 3 layers each of which will support different styles of gameplay and provide for different benefits and vulnerabilities for the territoryholding alliance the three layers of territory warfare under this model are player controlled stations tactical arrays and stargate capture1 player owned stations  the traditional construction maintenance and sieging of poses that currently exists2 tactical arrays  the anchoring of territory warfare structures outside of gravity wells  ie not at a pos  that affords a defender advantage these arrays govern the familiar cynojammer jump bridge array cyno field generator and system scanner effects as well as new capabilitiesto function a tactical array requires 3 operable units in system a maximum of 5 units of a given type may be anchored thus it is an attackers goal to eliminate 3 of the 5 units in a system in order to bring down the effect in this way attackers and defenders have the option to split their forces and attack multiple units simultaneously these units are balanced for fleet combat in terms of their hit points and have no capacity for automated defenses  they require defender vessels to come to their aid against attack3 stargate capture  stargate capture is a new mechanic that will affect benefits across systems as well as entire constellations stargate control is the first line of defense in this model of territory warfare representing the defenders capacity to field small gangs in response to attacks defenders secure stargates to signify protection of their borders and attackers disrupt the defenders control to signify porous or poorly defended borders
stargate capture is inspired by the proposal made by ccp nozh here linkagea stargate under this model would have three states neutral captured and contested once a defender lays claim to a neutral stargate it enters a 24 hour claiming period  remaining neutral but unable to be claimed or contested  and then becomes captured and begins contributing to the stargate network of the defender an attacker laying a counterclaim to a captured stargate immediately puts it into a 24 hour contested state if a defender fails to reclaim a contested stargate during that 24 hours the stargate reverts to neutral status and can be captured by someone else certain defender benefits will be awarded based on the sum of captured stargates only while others will count both captured and contested stargates to determine if the defender is awarded the advantagestargate capture would be balanced to allow multiple small gangs operating in different systems to contestcapture multiple stargates in parallel faster than a single large gang contestingcapturing the same number of stargates in a linear fashion a minimum gang size to contestcapture a stargate would make this a small gang activity rather than a solo activityin the short term attackers harass defenders by contesting gates and forcing the defender to patrol their space to maintain a network of captured stargates also contesting or neutralizing local insystem stargates is a prerequisite to attacking tactical arrays and sieging poses in the long term the ownership of stargates organically reflects the presence and activity of an alliance in the area part 2 dividing goalsbenefitshaving outlined the basics of the three layers of territory warfare we can take the current sovereignty benefits and divide them amongst these three layers  as well as add some new tools and benefits for defenders the following are the benefits currently gained through sovereignty and the three categories they will be divided into under this proposal  please note that sovereignty levels no longer apply to the top and middle layers under this model only the bottom layer uses the sovereignty levels measure for determining outpost upgrades etc 
stargate capture benefits your alliance is visually represented on the starmap as being the sovereign of the solar system gained by having 100 of the stargates in the system in a claimed  captured or contested  state you can only deploy outposts in solarsystems where you have captured all stargates in the system twinned jump bridge tactical structures can be activated as long as 51 of the stargates in both the origin and destination systems are claimed  captured or contested  all starbase control towers are invulnerable and can not be locked gained by having 51 of the stargates in the constellation in the captured state your starbases get a 25 bonus to their fuel efficiency gained by having 51 of the stargates in the constellation in a claimed  captured or contested  state edit this fuel efficiency bonus could be increased dramatically should the work required to maintain a stargate network prove sufficient to allow a large reduction in the work needed to maintain a pos network a further fuel usage reduction 30 instead of the usual 25 for all alliance owned control towers in the same constellation gained by having 100 of the stargates in the system in the captured state in addition to having the constellationwide requirement above new a captured stargate enables the owner to check the activation logs to see who has used the gate recently and what ship they were in new your tactical array units are invulnerable and cannot be locked gained by having 100 of the stargates in the system in the captured or contested statetactical arraysnote tactical array units are structures anchored at least 1 au from a gravity well or another tactical array unit of the same type 3 tactical array units of a given type must be online insystem to grant the effect a maximum of 5 tactical array units of a given type may be anchored in a system by an alliancethe types of tactical arrays available are scanner arrays  functioning as a system scanner does now cynosural field jammer arrays prevent the activation of cynosural fields just as the current cynojammer does cynosural field generator arrays allow the activation of a cynosural field generator anchored at a pos  ie the actual cyno appears at the pos but the array units are anchored in safe spots and are subject to attack  jump bridge beacon arrays allow the activation of a twinned jump bridge anchored at a pos  ie the actual jump bridge is anchored at a pos but the beacon array units must be online for it to work and are anchored at safe spots and subject to attack  new network security array  this array collects usage data from captured stargates in the same system and uploads it to the alliance database alliance members may access the network security node to see data from all network security arrays owned by the alliance allowing them to monitor incursions into their territoryplayer owned stations outposts and conquerable stations held by your alliance are invulnerable enabled by fulfilling the same requirements as conventional sovereignty your alliance is able to anchor capital shipyard production facilities thus enabling the construction of capital ships and super capital ships enabled by fulfilling the same requirements as conventional sovereignty all outposts within the constellation can receive further upgrades for more information refer to the outpost upgrades articlepart 3 details of stargate capturestargate capture is balanced to be executed by small gangs of subcapital ships as time is a factor in the capture and volume of captures is critical to success it is advantageous to use the minimum number of ships needed to claim a gate and maximize the number of simultaneously active gangs
a sample model of stargate capturestargate states1  neutral  this is the default state2  claimed  captured   when a neutral gate is taken by an alliance it goes to this state3  claimed  contested   a captured gate changes to this state when another alliance attacks the gate if the defending alliance returns and reclaims the gate during the contested period it returns to captured if the defending alliance fails to return and reclaim the gate before the contested period ends the gate becomes neutralminimum ships required to capturecontestreclaim a stargate 10times to capture a neutral stargatecontest a captured stargate10 battleships 10 minutes10 cruisersbattlecruisers 20 minutes10 frigatesdestroyers 30 minutestimes for a defender to reclaim a contested stargate10 battleships 5 minutes10 cruisersbattlecruisers 10 minutes10 frigatesdestroyers 15 minutesto initiate a capturecontestreclaiming the ships must be within 5km of the stargate once the action has begun the claiming ships must remain within 30km of the stargate or be discounted from the claiming totals additional ships may join the claiming action but if the total claiming ships drops below 10 the action is canceled and resetin addition performing a claiming action requires the disabling of on board warp drives for 60 second cycles for the duration of the action if the action is canceled or the claiming ship moves out of range the current cycle must complete before warp drives come back online thus ships attempting to claim stargates are vulnerable to ambushconclusion how it plays outwith a system such as this in place we would see a conflict between two alliances go like thisan attacker invading a defenders territory will first deploy multiple small gangs across the entirety of a defenders space to destabilize their grip on the area attackers will contest the claimed gates of the defender forcing the defender to respond by fielding a similar force of small gangs to counter the actions of the attacker with both sides fielding many small gangs the opportunities for small gang pvp increase if the attacker can gain dominance in the small gang pvp arena and suppress a defenders capacity to respond to contested gates the attacker will eventually disrupt the invulnerability of tactical arrays and pos within defender systemsthen the attacker can take the fight to the tactical arrays fielding multiple fleets within a system to disable enough units to counter the effect once cynojammers are down capital ships can be deployed in the conventional mannera defenders power is based on their ability to first protect their territory from distributed small incursions and then to prevent those incursions from snowballing into fleet attacks on their tactical arrays in specific systems an attacker must strip away each layer to weaken the heart of their enemys empireit is also now possible for one alliance to control the stargates andor tactical structures of a systemconstellationregion while another alliance controls the majority of poses in the same area  opening up the possibility of implementing a treaty system so a military alliance could share the their stargate control fuel efficiency bonuses with an industrial alliance in exchange for access to the industrial alliances posesessentially this proposal seeks to turn the linear posonly territory warfare model into a comprehensive threeprong territory control model consisting of stargate capture tactical arrays deploymentdestruction and pos constructionsieging each element would be designed to be best attackeddefended by a different force configuration capital ships for pos siegedefense battleship fleets for tactical array warfare and multiple small gangs for stargate controlthanks for reading questions comments and concerns appreciated
agreed
what about halving a dual layer pos shield the lesser one is active at fewer than 10 hostiles on grid and uses lesser power the better one activates in response to capitals or more than 10 of any hostile on grid but consumes a large amount of fuel this should be balanced but overall favor 910 very nicely fitted ships to take pos into a reinforced state or maybe only allow them to take pos shields to 50 before the larger kicks in at its 50 the basic premise though is that you have a few lesser ships that will possibly be melted by pos guns offer some damage to posi like your ideas too i am just saying this also puts a usefulness for subcaps into the equation as well
nice idea well presented thumbs up from methis would also combine with my idea which had ways to harass and weaken pos  but not destroy them  using smaller gangs
that sounds fun but i would also like to see the actual pos system modified as well rawr
very good stuff
i like this
im not sure about all the specific details but detail work is essentially ccps domain not the csms i do like this in principle though
on second thought why even bother just put them on the market sold by npcs you already have a pretty hefty drain on player resources by supplying the datacores if t2 production picks up the pace there will be an even higher demand for them having players spend rps to get these bpobpcs would be kind of counterproductive
supported as is being seen irl with the price of gas once something gets too pricey alternatives will be sought or ones that were previously not cost effective put into use so should it be with eve
was it at all touched upon in the meet
i would like to formally apologize  sp  to sf and jade for my direct attack on themthat being said most of the points i could have made without being a jerk now that i have cooled down i see that i still stand by most of my points on alliances and fw thoughi dont speak for my corp only for myself and my behavior on these forums
if fw had been introduced at the same time as the alliance mechanics this would not have been such a big problembut allowing corporations to make themselves ineligible to take part in fw by committing themselves to an alliance without knowing that they were doing so really sucks
no insurance for concord kills just nonsensical
with the introduction of heat and module hp one can easily see the ui damage receivership implementationthe targetting of subsystems with current weaponary doesnt appear to make much sense missiles guns they have sig radii that dont make sense compared to modules nor does sub system targetting make any sense at all to a ship with its shields up  shield tanking it would make more sense for an entirely new weapon type that circumvents those issuesoff the top of my head most common sst weapon would be sst frigate mounted single module targetting sst frigates have built in ship module scanneroriginally i was thinking af role but that would just cloud the core issuebalancing so that people fly sst rather than damageewar well thats not really my problem is it supported
i like a lot of the ideas listed above but the pvp ones kinda concern me the varying agent types could incorporate this without a lot of flak from the playerbaselets have new agent types or redefine the roles that the agents are in here are some of the new mission types per agent division i would like to seeaccountingfinance  lightweight mix of recons 1 and 3  get through these agents to talk to a lost agent or deliver a packageadvisory  pvp training where you have to lock down a ship or stealth through a missionastrosurveyingarchives  scan a few static moons  deadspace only  while fighting small waves of weak enemiesdistributionmarketing  delivering product or crates to other stationsintelligencesurveillance  analyze a certain structure or ship format while encountering enemiesinternal securitysecurity  clear the path for a convoy which will show up later giving fast mission runners an advantagelegaladministration  deliver a subpoena to a ship after defeating his entouragemanufacturingproduction  make or buy x number of a certain product based off a blueprintmining  same as standard mining missionspersonnelpublic relations  deliver troops or rescue them from pirate attack  defeat the enemies before they destroy our assets rd  acquire this item from a deadspace missionthis setup could also use the standard mission sets but add a bit of personality and spice to the mission runners routines
yes indeed a lot of bugs and lag and even before the changes of gtc eve was the most expensive mmo but now will be simply unplayable for many playersand the second thing why the players from europe have to pay more than the rest of the world i mean now the 1 euro is aprox 16 dollars so as an european i have to pay 2392 dollars per month while the rest of the world is paying 1495 even considering that because i am from europe i have to pay vat to but with vat is 1779 so why i am paying an extra 61 dollars a month for the same product buying time codes over the internet was an options  not always a good one but it was  but now i am forced to pay for 2 months in advance if i want to play eve and in this conditions what if you ccp will make a patch and with that patch i will consider that eve is not worth playing any more with this patch but i already pay for 2 months in advance or with a new expansion a horrific bug will be in game  never happened until now because eve is premium   and i will be so angry that i will want to quite eve or i will just get bored at a moment then what i will be forced to play for almost 2 months or simply lose my money this is not a good perspective for me at leastso from my point of view you have 2 choices make the same price for europe and for the rest of the world or make available the 30 days gtc
so you say premium product well that much lag and all these bugs makes it very special even premium on a serious note ccp youve tried to fix whats not broken and you broke it because people already are canceling their accounts and ccp is losing their customers and income bringing back 30d or 90d or reducing 60d gtcs price probably would fix itafterall not being able to enjoy main feature of eve  pvp  because of the lag node crashes  you name it  doesnt make this game premium seriously
same here  thats a very bad move  many people might close second accounts or alltogether their account because of this
speed is not broken just alot of fail pvpers in this thread
agreeing with the problem
imo mwd should be removed from game but the ships that are supposed to be fast should get a bonus for ab use
nerf speed
first point is valid the 13km web sphere of death is pretty much on and offsecond point fails it is not the only viable option in small gang pvp in fact it is quite the opposite you see a lot of bsbcc ships roaming around all the time lets give a real actual ingame example shall we is the majority of ships used in factional warfare nano i think notnano ships certainly do not obsolete anything many people have success against nanogangs and kill them left right and centerfirst you talk about webs then signature radius then missile speed then stacking penalties of nanoships pick one issue and go wtih that dont just say lol i think teh gamesors is broken lets review everythingguys right
what speed issue
well written postone interesting idea would be to make web range dependant on sig radiusfor example base web range could be 10km for a ship with a 100m sig radius ie web range in km   target sig radius in meters   10so an intie with no mwd would only be webbed at 2km an mwd intie would be webbed at 10km an mwd cruiser at 20km or more suddenly sig radius is a real penalty to going fastthe rapier bonus could also be adjusted to being a 4km per level of recon skill  so with recon 5 you get a minimum of 21km  so it is still possible to web an intie at all  hyena could have half that bonus so with eaf 5 they get a minimum of 11km webbing
fully supportedwebs and neuts make small ships for which primary and main tank should be speed  frigs dessies and their t2 versions sadalso how radial speed is calculated is borked we only have transversal that is absolute to the gridto visualize the problem ill borrow example someone else used to illustrate the problem in other thread two hummwies each with a turreted machine gun one is standing still other is circling around the first one mg on stationary jeep has to track the circling one all the time and has to match angular velocity with it mg on the jeep circling the stationary jeep can be pointed normally to its tangential velocity straight toward the stationary target and doesnt have to track at allin eve we only have transversal being same for both ships
yes please the profanity filter on the forums is about the most worthless piece of crap ive ever seen  hmm will it let me say that i seem to recall that people were talking about a storeline event and when using the name of one of the main npcs involved  perhaps it was quoting the initial post made by the isd controlled npc or it might even have been in the isd post itself  part of it would be censoredthis really needs to be made into something we can turn off
agreed  political correctnesswell maybe one can censor political correctness because it is one of the worst concepts ever including hypocrisy asskissing selfdenial and euphemisation all in onepolitical correctness is the coffin nail of democracy and free speechno to political correctness
alrighty for those people who are getting hung up on the statement about minmatar recons and eas possibly needing a balance pass as a result of reducing the speed of nano setups ive clarified the original post by bolding underlining and italicizing the word may it was never my intention to say that it would definitely be needed just something that should be taken into consideration when considering the extended effects of reducing speed
yeah thats the second time youve said that and youre right why not add an explosion velocity bonus to a ship to help counter this problem i mean it wouldnt fix it completely but it sure the hell would help even the oddsexplosion velocity bonus to stealth bombers would be nice but any missile ship would do
polycarbon to nanofiber level narf would fix a lot of things
nerfing nanos would obsolete reconshacs cdinfact battleship gangs would be counter for pretty much everything
stealth bombers are much too fragiles to be a viable counter to nanos if it were the case hyenas would have solved the issue by nowi agree with everything wrayeth stated i too would like to do smallscale pvp with heavy ships but its not possible anymore far too many nanoships running rampantyes i know i could do smallscale pvp if i nanoed myself but i refuse to be part of the problem i will never step so low as to use something i know is out of whackback to the topic its about time mwd get a nerf imho its too much of a musthave module with virtually no drawback since cap boosters became a musthave tooquestion to the pronano crowd assume that you want to take down an enemy nanofleet of 3050 ships they have scouts theyll know if you bring a fleet that vastly outnumber them theyll know if you bring a high number of huginnsrapiers in your gangheres the question how do you decisively defeat them and avoid the bring a full nanogang yourself argument please if you cant answer that question you just admitted that theres little point even trying to kill them and so nano are hurting smallscale pvp a lotwith a nonnano opponent you could use the lightest ships of your gang to run them down and hold them for your heavy units to kill but now you cant really run them down since theyre all as fast than your light units
hello what does tcf do when you bring bses to lj you will wait 30min until tcf has enough battleships to engage once they have that they will jump capitals in just for the fun every 00 halfdecent alliance does this 00 alliances dont blob because they are afraid of nanos they blob because they can and like to minimize losses nanos making it impossible to roam with heavy ships no capitals battleships killboards local did that before anyone even flew a nanophoonnonnano 3050 ship gang wont engage your superior gang either but how do you suggest you decisively defeat them bs gangs can very easily pick fightsavoid being blobbed hardly anything new here besides no nanogang will engage decent bsheavy ship gang because they know the nanos will just fail against a decent gang

as anyone whos tried to scan for people in a system with pos in it can testify the litter of unoccupied ships at the pos makes it a nightmarei suggest an overview option to remove unoccupied ships  which would then also translate on to directional scans  or even just an option in the directional  or something in the ship name to tell us if its unoccupied or not 
it must be annoying to someone other than me
aye
its funny i liked where the discussion was heading in about 90 of the csm minutes until i got to this priority list i propose that this function of the csm be changed it should be where ccp reveals its own internal priority list then ccp and the csm could modify it together based on the issues that where raised in the meetingpriority should be based on time required to implement the feature balanced with playerbase interest something with a high enough interest from the playerbase could be put at the top even if it will take a long time to implement but the top of the list shouldnt only be things that will take 2 years to create this is where the balance should come in with ccp being truthful in relating time to implement  and firm rejecting unrealistic priority lists  in their discussions with the csm this current priority list doesnt have much to do with playerbase support or time required for completion and thats where it fails hard
signedthe astarte is the command ship i spend the most time in but its pretty easy to see that there really is a problem with the nighthawk
im not gonna disagree the drake honestly is a crappy ship noobs love it tho and yes fitting heavy assault launchers is a lost cause on every caldari ship pretty much sleipnir is light years ahead of the nighthawk for sure and it fits a command module with ease tanks better too gooo caldari 
jim raynor bobby chilli and others you guys have shown support for this thread so give it a thumbs up apparently some of the csms think a thread needs lots of thumbs up in order to be worthy of notice
shame we didnt get a csm meeting last sunday due to peoples holidays and what not but fingers crossed this coming sunday happens and we get this issue sorted properly at last i got all your additional notes silence and added the majority of the data straight into the issues document for the rest of the csm to read up prior to the meetingalso as an aside for the nice alts who chose to spam me with accusations that i was only pushing the nh powergrid issue to buff the flavor of command ships i fly fyi jade flies all four races of command ship with pretty much equal skill levels  all racial cruiser battlecruiser inputs at 5  and all weapons systems at tech2 function with good specialization yes i do actually own a nighthawk and at the moment its parked in a ratting system rigged for pve  which is all its actually good for  i also own an absolution that i fleet pvp in a claymore that is uber for roving gangs and an astarte that i fly for ganks and bait and trap its certainly the case that the nighthawk is very poor for pvp usage and doesnt hold a candle to the capabilities of the sleipnir  but rather than joining the horrid cult of nerf this  nerf that aimed at other races lets just for once consider dealing with a problem ship not by nerfing the opposition but by correcting the specific issue and getting the nh the grid it needs for a pvp fit please point of order
thumbs down the game needs npc sold isk exitsi would support the idea of something useful being harvested from planets and stars though just not the proposal of being fully self reliant without need of isk exiting the system
it does open a can of worms and needs to be thought about carefullyin some respects it is nice to have some things still be dependant upon npc supply  not everything but some the empires are the big civilized and developed powers 00 is the fronteer the colonies even if some of the alliances are huge powers theyre still partially dependant upon the empires which is perhaps as it should bestill it is quite an interesting idea and because i think it deserves at least consideration if not implimentation it gets my supportthe rp possibilities of player alliances using slaves in huge numbers to run those factories is reason enough alone that could be fun
the raw materials are obviously in existance since the products exists but they are clearly not in moons or belts so planets would be the logical place to look fore them yesthis would make planets something more then just a it looks good and it should exist in space thing
id like this as well what ccp perhaps could do to reduce some load on the database is make certain things default to certain choices assets is an example if the last time i checked assets i was in all items tab it will open it again the next time how about making it always open in the search tab or the solar system tab instead choices that make less of an automatic strain on the db same with markets it should never just open on browse tab but always on search or quickbar id think that ccp could reduce strain on the db that way
iUFFFDm afraid this has also been discussed and the answer was no it would create too much load on the databaseto be honest i would rather have the current system   i am a very tidy person and only put things into stationcontainers i dont need from a remote location  than have more lag
this seams like a dreadfully obvious exploit that is consistently looked over the only real way to catch people employing this tactic is to use a bubble this thread here
giving support to my own topicanyways my main point is that this while you cannot tell whether someone intentionally disconnects you can tell whether it is reasonable that they disconnected or they are abusing the system if a freighter jumps into a system with 20 guys on the other side is it likely that he suddenly had internet problems and doesnt log back on but a strange noob alt is hanging around that exact spot where the freighter logged off a penalty or marker for disconnects  the ones where you get scrambled by pcs  can help identify and punish the people who abuse the log off mechanics and ruin the gameplay for countless otherslastly the exploit is as followsplayer a is doing whateverplayer a sees player b on his overviewplayer a hits ctrqplayer b scrambles player a and has one minute to kill said ship before it vanishes with no 15 min pvp timer sometimes the ship disappears much quicker than one minute and sometimes player b is not fast enough and player a warps off free as a birdmy solution  which i stole from the devs but was never put into the game  is simple if you log off you sit in space for 15 seconds if someone scrambles you then you stay in space for the 15 minute aggro timer  just like if you logged during combat  if not then you warp off and disappear from scanner per normal
people log off at gates when they see enemy on scanner people log off in ratting systems when a neutral red enters systemetcadd a flag for ctrlq or escquit a if the connection is lost and there is a flag set true let them sit there for a little while before initiating alignwarp why would you quit the game in the middle of the actionb if the connection is lost and there is a flag set false let them warpdisconnecting from the game is an action performed less than most other actions in the game plus i believe connecting and disconnecting is handled by their own server s  adding a truefalse flag to disconnect will not bring more lag or bazooka the servers you already have a check system for disconnect in place adding a and to that check or modifying an if line will not do anything badpeople will say that players can unplug their modems lans etc well i am sure if this was the requirements less people will do it
remember that someone can also just pull out their internet cable
this
did you guys read the last part of my post yes people can fake disconnects but face it less people will fake disconnects than people who use this tactic nowplus in an emergency situation when warping to a camp or when people warp on top of you in a belt it is easier to ctrlq to escape the camp faster as well than to reach for the modem to shut it off or for the network cable to umplug itare you not supporting this simply because people can fake disconnectsat post right under mine no making them remain in space is not ok i will probe all day
the simplest and most logical way to solve the issue is to make logged off ships and pods not disappear after emergency warp unless they have cloak fitted  at which point they should still be in space but cloaked in case some changes are made to the game that make cloakers vulnerable to probing for example no need to debate circumstances and wether someone logged off on purpose or due to network issues the mechanics should be the same and the mechanics that protect you from network issues should never be at the expense of actual gameplay
i am still supporting it as it is my thread it is just that that isnt really a viable solution if they do what you say people will disconnect their modem the problem is not is the logoffski is an exploit or not it is what the solution to it should be ccp may not even have to fix it just make it a petitionable offense or something
pulling your internet cable and ctrlq are not the same thing the game acts differently for eachbasically the game currently gives a user a much quicker lost connection response when they ctrlq than if they actually have a lost connection a lost connection takes awhile to timeout so the knowingly exploiting ctrlqer is more reliably saved than actual disconnects thats pretty bogusthey should plug the ctrlq hole and treat all discos as such  regardless if they are true or user induced  saying that the server cant tell the difference between a ctrlq and a disconnect is simply not truethe server cant tell the difference between a router dying versus a user pulling the plug on their wireless sure but it obviously knows the difference between a disco and a purposeful ctrlq already so why shouldnt it be handled differently
well if that is true then i guess i agree
anything thatll put a damper on a loggers day
sorely needing fixing
i will support it as long as implementation does not overly burden the fact that disconnects do happen and the internet is far from 100 reliabledisconnecting purposely to avoid getting blown up should not be allowed
imo the problem is not the cynojammer its the combination of capitals quickly coming to help a cynojammer getting shot down with current game mechanics the capitals will prevent any offensive if not done with an extreme blob of subcapitals and ewar to stop both the capitals spidertanking and the cynojammer from workingthe individual mechanics are only partly broken bring them together and they will multiply resulting in the huge lagfest capital superblobs of todays alliance warfare the whole thing is broken and jumpbridges cynojammers and capital fighterlagbombs play important parts in itto be perfectly honest i absolutely hate carriers motherships and titans their introduction ruined 00 warfarehaving that said i think the cynojammerjumpbridging capitalsmechanic needs to be addressed as a first step dont allow capitals to use jumpbridges thus fixing a part of the problem
amarr drones need some improvement higher increase in hp is a step in a right direction
actually there is one way you could use orbit distance and range as a boostgive them a 6km orbit and rangethat way you would use them when expecting to come up against smartbombs
couldnt find this issue raised in any of the threads on the front page  couldnt be bothered to look further  and its not really a hot topic right now  it doesnt have 5 new whine threads on gd every day but i really feel its time to raise the issue and perhaps have ccp actually do something about itit has been discussed many times and one of the biggest arguments against it is that it would hurt those with bad connections too much this is of course hard to avoid and still getting this under control but i sincerely feel there are optionsfor one lets look at the timers involved jump through gate cloaked for 30 seconds if you log during that time your ship will disappear after 1 minute wether you get agressed or not same applies in any circumstance if you log before you are agressed your ship disappears after 1 minute this is the time window people exploit to save their ships from pvp situationsi have thought about a solution to this that would limit the impact on legitimate disconnects and ive come up with a fiddling of the timers it goes like thiswhen you log or disconnect your ship is automatically decloaked wether it is a fitted cloak or cloaking from a gate jump the ship will stay motionless in space for 30 seconds during this time it can be agressed to give it the 15 minute agression timer if it isnt agressed during these 30 seconds it will ewarp and then disappear after a full minute if it is agressed but not scrambled it will ewarp and remain in space for 15 minutes just like now if it is scrambled it will remain in space until it stops being scrambled or the 15 minutes are up this should limit the amount of people logging off to save their ships from pvp but without doing too much damage to those with genuine connection problemsthoughts ideas
generally id agree with you only real problem is that there is no safe logout procedure in place for people who just want to logout what i would suggest is that ccp creates a logout procedure that requires you to be uncloaked and not under an aggression timer then with a full view of the area you should be able to logout in 30 seconds but you should be able to be aware of your surroundings until you disappear you should also be able to be flying at full speed but without any modules running  so you are aligned in case something drops in on you during the 30 seconds and you can safely warpout i would also add a visible aggrotimerthe only problem remaining is massive gatecamps perhaps i know it was brought up before that if you make this change it becomes attractive to create more lag at gatecamps to force dcs  for example with drones out  and then shoot anyone who came in
i support but i dont know about getting decloaked if you are using a fitted cloak if you are cloaked anyway you could very likely save your ship by simply remaining logged in so why should loggingdisconnecting reveal your ship you could just stay cloaked anyway and this will hurt people who genuinely get disconnected in situations where their cloak is keeping them alive such as covops
true i was aiming more at the cloaking macro ratters the problem is that if you dont get uncloaked you can always circumvent any measures put in place to avoid loggoffs by just fitting a cloak and then log
what situation could you be in where you would be able to cloak but logging off would be a logoffski i suppose if you jumped through a gate and landed on a camp you could move to decloak engage your own cloak and then log all so fast that nothing could be done about it but at least in that case you have to have a cloak fitted to pull it off and it is possible cloak and hide right on top of a gatecamp if you are fastbeing able to kill cloaking macros would be nice but the real purpose behind preventing logoffskis is to prevent ships escaping from situations where they should die and if you can cloak you have already escaped effectively
true valid point no counter arguments
to help fix the macro problem rats should give agression like they did a year or so ago recon probe launcher cpu requirement should be dropped  atm they are very hard to fit on a normal ship  and the number of scramming rats either needs to increase or they need more brains  ie mwd every time the ratter is 100km away not just 20 of the time and scram more often 
i will support this topic in its spirit provided there is a safe method of logging off in hostile space when you are not under an agression timerlogging off to avoid getting blown up should be prohibited unfortunately the problems with the internet do say that issues will happen so that prohibition needs to be carefully done
the only change needed is that the aggression timer 15 minutes need to be activated at all times if a players ship is shotscrammed etc whether the player is logged in or notlogoffski problems happen because a player is immune to picking up the 15 minute timer if he logs out before he is agressed
seriously i thought this would have stayed on the front page sorry budwell the more threads the sooner itll get fixed if suicide ganking taught us anything its that
another great feature i am not being sarchastic that would be the first thing to get turned off in a 50 fight as it would cause excessive lag in a perfect word yes but in eve no

the issue is as follows i probe out high sec mission runners in an effort to expand my scan network within the system i keep all of my bookmarks i have amassed a collection of roughly 250 bookmarksi find it incredibly annoying that we are unable to have a scrolling drop down menu when we click in space is there any way to grant us this ability this way im not stuck looking only at the bottom of my solar system menu please ccp change this

i have made this post in the hopes that we can help out out fellow caldariour militia is in chaos what i propose is to elect leaders for the factioneg by people voting out of the best fleet commanders in the militia a governing body to take charge of the situation and turn the tide of warsmashing fleets of 50 each against each other is not the way to go about thingstactics are required and battle plans need to be drawn up so that we dont just make a mad rush over nomansland like in ww1 shooting the heck out of each other and then running back to our respective trenchesso for this to happen we all need to think long and hardi would ask that anyone that has had fleet commander experience with the militia to step forward and put there names into the barrelthen once we have a sufficient number of names to begin then it will be cast to a vote so that we can find the best of the best and then start assigning roles for each person as well as backup positions as not everyone is online 247thank you all for taking the time to read thisand happy huntingcontact me in game if you have any questionsmy user name is belowdayne steel

well here come vultures
hohooo hold on man you mean that someone still cares about fw
oh god please no move it back
fw is way more fun than 00 at this point so yeah people care
not enough to make a sensible post it seemsand sorry but i dont either  maybe later
you know those guys leading empire alliances that get their butts kicked by leet five man griefer outfits the same guys who lead those gatherings of fail are now trying to lead the militias governing body yeah that worked swell for the trail of dead empire alliances left in my wakeah newbies you crack me up
move it again please
you could do that but you dont have the right to you are in a player corp in a militia if your so concerned try joining a npc militia corpand tactics can be done and plans can be made just organise stuff between the player corps in the militia its not difficult
if that was an attempt at what i think it was you failed  i like to move it move iti like to move it move iti like to move it move itya like to  move it replace with you for greater justice
you must be talking about cow
what makes you think a leader has to be a fleet commander
leaders in a random group of people wont go down well especially as the ones who put themselves forward are normally clueless noobs with an enourmous egomilitia is not an alliance stop treating it like and and things will be alright

at the moment im only a director not ceo and were a smaller corp but still    i log in see my mail is flashing i open and it and see that its the personal part not corp or alliance or any of the various mailing lists im on someone wants to talk to me i must be special   and then it turns out to be a bill for some office we have its almost as bad as getting junk mail thinking you have actual mail and then finding its a bill   so either a seperate mail tab for corporate related mails or putting them elsewhere  as long as that elsewhere blinks whenever theres something new  would be very niceedit a general revamp of the evemail system would be good  like a lot higher limit on characters so that i dont have to split my message into four parts whenever i come up with a cunning plan i want to tell my fellow directors about
how does a titan remain in space ready to go at a moments notice when a pos one onehundredth of its size requires constant upkeep granted some are only logged in for the dd driveby others are kept online and in cynojammed systems pretty much twenty three hours a dayhow come titans dont require a couple billion in fuel and parts per month to keep running same could be said for carriers and dreads though at a reduced cost of course not talking about jump fuel here just the power to keep these war machines rollingdont really have an idea just curious as to why a titan and a t1 frigate require the same amount of upkeep fully aware of the souldestroying banality that is pos refueling but by and large some fantastic incoming irony here titans and caps do alter the landscape far more than any large control tower ever could
could be a way to balance them a bit something needs to change or otherwise well see an ever increasing number of titans

wasnt aware jita stations sold skillbooks sorry you left your account unsecured this is the horrible horrible price you must now pay instead of asking a development team to devote time money and more time to coding in a fix for you perhaps it would be better to say lesson learned and deal with the consequences of your actionsfor what its worth ive skills trained on my accounts which were mistakes and will never be completed however i firmly believe the basis of eve is that players must suffer the consequences of their own actions for good or ill so ill keep those useless skills there and not ask ccp to erase my mistakeswho knows something may get nerfedboosted someday and ill have a leg up
id like thateven if you lose the sp id still like to remove some ed skills i have d

at 10 you gain 2x more ss increse that on 00ss i dont see problem with it only painfull is that each ss increse is every 10 minutes it should be instant for killing rats
issue people are getting large stacks of navy tags then selling them 1 by 1 at npc stations because the npc buy orders have a limit of 1this means it takes ages to sell some stacks and also means many many transactions which probably aint going to help the lag situationspretty sure this is an oversight on behalf of ccp but raising it here anywaydiscuss and resolve  thanks
considering that market transactions are a significant source of lag i dont see any reason why the buy order volume shouldnt be raised to 100 i think that ccp could just make a 1time script to handle it so i dont think it would be a waste of time for them need for speed right guys
issue is resolvedset up a sell order for exact amount that agents are buying for they will auto buy all your tagsedit set up sell order in same station as purchasing agent obviously hope that helpstribe
how many people utilize that method though i think the vast majority of people who sell these tags probably dont know this wouldnt it be better for everyone involved if the buy order volume was raised
wow  this could be the shortest lifespan of an issue evertheres a workaround to avoid selling them 1 by 1 by clicking the advanced market options and you can sell more than one in one gothanks to dr isk for pointing that out  even if he was an asshat  possibly still an issue since the workaround isnt very intuitive  ive been playing a few years now and never realised this method though it could just be me since im a market noob  according to the dr  hehe
screw 100 people might have more make it a million  whats a few zeros among friends theyre npcs and theyll buy everything might as well make it explicit if titan books sell in stacks of 1159 tags can be bought by the million so what youre saying is that a bad ui isnt a problem because an arcane workaround most people would never think of exists just because its not wholly impossible to do it doesnt mean that its anywhere near as smooth as it should be this needs fixing just like a zillion other uineed for speedstopingaroundyourplayersalready issues
the reason folks prefer to sell them one by one rather than using the advanced option is simple avoidance of broker feeif youre trying to maximise the returns on a stack of tags then the last thing you want to do is lose some to a broker even it is is only 1 it still adds up to a significant amount if you are a relatively new player and have sunk a few million hardearned isk into shifting some nice tagsi did this myself and i sure wasnt going to pay the broker fee even if you train up broker relations im currently at lvl3 so only pay 082 broker fee you still may find that an unacceptable lossi got bored of it though and went back to missioning  salvage
ive just now found this thread but am very interested in solo explorationive put a lot of time and planning into being able to pull off solo exploration its effected which ships ive trained for and ingame behavior patternsthe ships i use any buzzard any covops will do  and pilgrimwhat have effected these decisions are a solo explorers needsthe need to bust through gatecampsthe need to scan effectively and efficientlythe need to tank site ratsthe need to kill site ratsthe need to fit salvager analyzer and codebreaker modulesthe need to hold many probesthe need to carry many sites worth of lootfrom my experience the only reliable way to break through a gatecamp is to immediately cloak and warp if in 00 then to immediately cloak and get the f out of the bubble and pray you dont get bumpedthis is why i insist that an exploration ship be covertan exploration ship should have some kind of astrometrics bonus preferably a 10perlevel explorationonly scanning bonus if thats not possible then maybe a 75 per level astrometrics scanning bonus at least 5 per levelits hard to say how much gank and tank slot layouts and gridcpy should be expected from an exploration ship surely for all of the diversity that i would want the ship to be capable of they should be extremely vulnerable in pvpi will therefore go with the pilgrims stats minus the gun turrets it is imo the most optimal multipurpose exploration ship currently and when set up for exploration extremely weak in pvp yet strong enough to take on bc rat spawns if you know what youre doingin fact there are only 2 things that prevent the pilgrim from being the exploration ship that i would ask for the lack of astrometrics bonus and insufficient cargoholdso do you try to be overly fair to every other ship role or go by need id say need2000m3 would be the maximum cargohold that i would hope for i dont think that would be unfairso my proposition for an exploration ship is modeled after the pilgrim as default stats with the following alterations4high slots 5 mid slots 5 low slots 2 rig slots but no turretsbonuses 10 exploration scan times 10 drone damagehitpoints 96 to 100 cloak cpu use and maybe a bonus to help with probe launcher cpu fitting as a 4th bonus2000m3 cargo capacityid be fine with all kinds of pvp penalties perhaps extremely weak and slow onboards sensors and scanners although it wouldnt make much sense i dunno
really like the idea
just in general i feel there is a need for corps to play a bigger role in corp gains and overall development by that i mean having a corp develop pretty much the same as a playerbased on all the members skills standings and security status inside a corp perhaps the corp should also be able to gain research points loyalty points upgrades  of some sort  etclet corps as a corp develop  let the ceo choose npc corps to run missions for then email the mission out to the corp to complete corps can do research for npc corps  buy upgrades and install them like players train skills more members  faster installs fuel offices with workers janitors paper water food secretaries whatever  theres a whole new dimension out there for corps perhaps this can all be intertwined with the walking in stations development
oo there are belts and belts full of asteroids of all types in high sec untouched maybe you should get out and look morebut the reason for prices is  demand  supply
if mining was fun this wouldnt be an issue trust me on this you do not want to have to persaude your miners to mine veld in 00 as it is the best ore available at the moment
i think that fw should be expanded to provide incentives and goals for nonpvp players in addition to pvpers research agents would be a start
i strongly believe that salvaging should be given an aggression flagid like to give two examples to illustrate this pointfirst example i warp back to my mission and find a frigate there hes salvaged some of my wrecks and stolen loot hes flashing redi jump at this chance warp back to station fit a ceptor warp back and pop the thiefi warp back to station and hes undocked with an abbadoni switch my nighthawk to a close range pvp fit and we do a 1v1 in which he only survives by dockingi have had fun because my preperation has been rewarded and almost got a killhe has fun because he almost ganked a mission running ship but got out played hell be more careful next time or bring friendsif he brought a gang in i would have lost my ship but at least i would have put up a fight i would have respected thatnow lets compare the other situationi dock my onyx in station after low sec pirating i fire up my nighthawk and start mission running i warp out to get my salvage destroyer and find a heron running around salvaging my wrecksi start to tractor my wrecks he changes tactics by bumping my destroyer negating my tractor beam advantagei stop he runs towards the nearest wreck and salvages morethis is not fun he violating my wrecks and im not able to do anything even though i have a half dozen pvp ship fitted im am force to not risk any of them to take out his salvage ship and just force to not do anything as he takes my salvagescorched earth is even more pointless hes still taking my salvage just im paying missiles so i can loose salvage in another mannermany of the people talking of aggression speak as if a  the wreck thief selfdestructs when he activates his salvager or b  the mission runner is forced to auto lock and fire all his guns on the salvagerboth are misconceptionsthe truth is that aggression flagging is an option for the mission runner i can eighter let the salvager run with my loot or risk my ships when he pulls a pvp fit battleship on me as it stands right now im forced with one option loose my salvage thats itim not given a choice concord forces me to loose my salvage to someone else with no option to risk anything to take him outyes i know he could send in a gank squad to ambush me but ive accepted that risk in the first example when i engaged his salvage ship i am given no such option in the second so its just frustrationflagging gives players an option to not defend their wrecks they can just not shoot the salvagerbut it gives them the option to defend their wrecks with their shipsis it balanced yesbecause they now run the risk of a gank squad warping in with 20 guys and blasting them to hellthat being said i would approve of mechanisms to protect salvagers who have been given the right to salvage by mission runners the contract or claim staking proposals work wellwhat i would like to add is this a simple warningby engaging this person you are allowing his corp and him to engage you with whatever ships they have for the next 30 minutes be advised that he may not be working alone andor may have other more combat capable ships readily availablewith a nice tick box to suppress this message in the futurethus if someone got wreck flipped they would have been warnedbefore i post i would like to give yet another real world example not really related to the rest of my post consider this a box inlaid with jewels containing clothes ccp now says if a thief breaks into your house and steals your clothes you can shoot him but if he takes a pliers and prys off the jewels he cannot be shot you protest  they are my jewels but people on the forums say no he took skills and time and resources to break into your house the jewels are not yours he needed skill and a pair of pliers to remove them
the protecting the salvager if they ask idea is great but your post mostly looked like thiswould you like a whaaaaaburger to go with those french cries
i get a kick out of this i am going to assume that with your defence on this you are a ninja salvagerdid this guy even bother to check our corp name
probably not plike teh motto saysour ships are fueled by carebear tearsif you really want to make more isk then leave us the wrecks  they are useless to you really unless you are a noob or are building rigs  and go on to another mission you could make more isk by flying a higher volume of missions rather than cry about a few skimmed wrecks off the top
you have the misconception that the mission deadspace is yours which it is not you are running a mission in free space which i can enter and exit without incidentif the mission space was yours i would expect concord to arrive  like a police officer in rl  or at least i would expect you to have the option to defend it this is not the case making this part of your argument false and negating the rest as wellsorry mate no dice
x the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because i support ccps current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecksyou cry and that make morbid laugh morbid find this very ammusing wahhhh my salvage got eat by ninja
id like to go on record and say right now that i dont actually eat the salvage i mean it looks tasty and all all piled up in my cargohold
x the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because the mission runner owns the wrecks and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamicabsolutelynot infrequently the salvage from a ship exceeds the value of the loot and really when one thinks of it both are things found in a wreck which technically makes all of it salvage  real world definition not eve rules definition  the same rules should apply to boththat said id love to see the ability to contract out loot and salvage rights which would keep salvagers in the game as a profession lots of folks dont do salvage  there have been times i dont bother although only seldom in empire  and there are empire mission runners who have no desire to do so contracting those rights for a flat fee or a percentage would be a cool addition to the game
if you dont want opinions you should ask for them we all know  and in particular the folks from the csm know  the arguments over ninja salvaging yes we all know what ccps position was when the system was created and what it by default history currently isthe question you are asking is effectively what should it bewhen someone offers up an opinion you come back with all the  very old  arguments the chiefest amongst them being ccp made it thus yes they did however ccp knows as do all of us that not everything they have ever done has been right so that argument is moot those who feel a change is needed feel that ccp was wrong even if well intentioned and that the mechanism should change hence arguing that the current position is right because its the current position is simply noiseyou would do better arguing why it should remain the current position on its own merits rather than just because it is the status quo
why yes please do exactly thatin the real world anyone who files a claim to a wreck has exclusive rights to that wreck  at least in territorial waters it gets dicey in international waters as while you can file for rights other countries dont have to recognize themnow consider that all empire space  high sec or low  is the territorial waters of that nationstateso  the missioner blows the ship up and tags it with his hud his computer sends the claim to the nation and he has possession that must happen or he or she could not claim ownership of the loot the missioner has the preeminent legal claimin real world salvage ops there is no strange division between cargo and vessel you get rights to the lot  the only exception being warships which are considered wargraves and property of the nation whose ship it was  if you want to pull the gold out of a spanish treasure ship and you have the valid claim you can should you want to bring up surviving sections of the ships hull  those are yours too  assuming that such has survived so yes please do some real research
i cant speak for anyone else but my argument has nothing to do with what things have been historically under ccp rather my argument is that missionrunners are just going to leave the salvage  or blow it up just to spite me  so its not theft unlike ore theft in which the producer of the ore intends to sell itthere is also the matter of the salvaged vessel not actually belonging to the missionrunner  it belongs to the npc corp it was from in the first place  but i guess that would fall into the argument from history which i guess you are saying is not valid
so if the mission runner is going to salvage it than it is theft how do you know i salvage every one of my wrecks in empire in every mission  the only exception being when the real world intervenes creating an inability to spend the time because im needed doing something not on the computer  or at least not on eve there are holes in that argument if we engage in battle someplace  high or low sec where flagging matters  and i shoot your ship up you can come along and take your modules back taking them wont flag you for theft theyre still yours however i can also take them if i choose and thats not theft either because i blew the ship upin eve currently loot is sort of dual ownership  the killer and the killee however if someone else comes along and steals your stuff theyll be flashy red to me im not positive but i dont think they will be to you even though those were originally your modulespreminent claim would seem to go to the killerreal world or historical examples have limited utility because they all assume that the salvage is just that salvage all of it cannon hull computers cargo wiring copper pipe old cars everything in eve we have a situation where some of that stuff belongs to the killer while some of it is just free up for grabs which is exceedingly odd it would make sense  and the its just junk argument would fly  if the salvage had lowminimal value that required a lot of volume to recoup one could then see folks not caring about salvage rights for what is truly junk then salvage would be a perfectly sane profession but it wouldnt pay well it would be safe downright boring really but it wouldnt pay wellthe disjunct comes when the salvage has considerable value frequently more than the loot suddenly the its just junk argument becomes completely spurious why because something thats worth 16 million isk isnt junk particularly not if it took you only a short time to collect with minimal investment in skills and kitwere salvage lower value  problem solved most mission runners simply wouldnt care and we wouldnt all be here were the costs involved in recouping the salvage really high  or the skills really difficult to obtain then youd see the same effectbut that isnt the case someone is coming along and taking something very valuable from you that would not be present were it not for your effortsthat isnt salvage thats stealing
and yet people still implement them why because other people will get ed if they didntsee on one hand you please some and  off others and on the other hand if you didnt you  off the first group and please the secondits just a matter of numbers more people would like the word filters in either out of comfort in not reading something that jives with their vocabulary may be read by their minor outofcontext etc
really id like to see the stats that say more people want one in
hmmmm while it may not be pleasant these are merely words option 3 is a good idea but the other two dont work free speech is a immutable right and i would side with the bigots to fight for it im new to mmorpgs and computers in general but the most glaring aspect ive noticed is how people interact there is no threat of violence when blogging or gaming it will be interesting to see how this will affect our world when violence reenters the equation
if you encounter activity in game that youd consider to be of a bigot nature or are offended by anything please create a petition here under the harassment categoryi assure you this is not condoned by us and we do take action on a daily basis against it
offended by anything where does it end
thats not very sensitive of you i happen to be 132 polish and my next door neighbors greatgreatgreat aunt passed through botswana once please have some consideration for others when posting
if you didnt want people to talk about it you shouldnt have brought it up in your op oh andyoure whining about whiners
back when ccp first calculated their tracking effectiveness and glancing blows for all of the gun  and missile stuff  they didnt have all of the speed issues there are nowand whether current speeds were originally intended or not i viewed a blog today that made some good points
what i want to know and you all should ask yourselves during that metting  why was this thread ignored pos flogging the dead horse when number of csm have shown support for the idea and we even received feedback that it was submitted to ccp and yet it is mysteriously missing from the ccpcsm meeting notesbasically what some members of csm are doing as i see it was practice their lies on the greater community why say we have submitted the issue to ccp when you did not and if you did where is the evidence of itwhat i see some csm members doing are pushing through pet projects  many of them quite controversial while ignoring a pretty much 100 supported idea i would think something that is unilaterally supported and has little or no controversy over it and the idea which was ignored by ccp for over 2 years although affecting gameplay of thousands would take priority over pet projects
i already explained this to you in another threadwe actually voted on this issue and it was brought onto iceland but a mistake was made when the issues were sent to ccp which means it was not discussed at iceland
could you please point me to the statement and if mistake was made and it was not discussed shouldnt you follow up with ccp  and get assurances that despite the mistake they are indeed officially taking it under advisement again i did not see any statement from you or any other csm in the recent days  this is first time i am seeing you reply and i have been pushing this since i saw the issue missing from the minuteseditagain i tried locating a statement by you or any other csm regarding the issue  and i have failed to do so so please point me there i have looked in all of the 3 threads where the statement might be or rather where it should be and where i have been voicing my concerns 1  initial ccpcsm meeting priority list 2  pos flogging the dead horse thread and 3  the issue thread in the assembly hall  none of them contain a statement from you or any other csm member subsequent to me starting this the other statement still stands if a mistake was made when the issues were sent to ccp what kind of mistake was it just an oversight and ccp is working on ittaking it under advisement or does the mistake mean that ccp can ignore it since it was not officially inaugurated by csm to ccp
i can remember saying something about this too we voted on the issue to take to iceland and for some reason it wasnt listed on the minutes when we were at the face to face meeting im still not sure why at the time we resolved to just add it to the submitted issues for the 2nd meeting in august and ask for developer feedback once again i think a lot of responses have been buried in the enormous assembly hall spam is the main problem bottom line  this issue should have been raised in iceland and im not sure why it wasnt in any case well ensure its submitted with the issues for the 2nd meeting there it is jinx not sure what else we can do bar that  it doesnt need to go before the csm again btw we already voted it onto the formal agenda and theres no need to waste time discussing it again we will just add it straight to the list of issues for submission again 
this is fine then i understand that things might get lost and might get mixed up what really bothered me is that it took me so many days to actually hear from you guys while shouting in three separate threads so basically issue was submitted to ccp as far as you and csm are concerned they  the ccp  are working on it and in august you will let us know what is going on correct
ccp hasnt stated nor suggested they were working on it so really the only thing we can do now is to wait till the next ccpcsm meeting for an answeri was really excited to see ccps response on the issue as its really nicely laid out but oh well nothing we can doaccording to my email ankh suggested that she hadnt received the submission template when she sent the issues off to ccp but they were submitted in the second batch but those werent discussed
the spammed assembly hall is the major problem i think  like i said im pretty sure i already said thered been a problem with this issue and for some reason it hadnt gotten on the agenda but i have no idea how to find that post either with the noise ratio in that forum  but anyways hopefully itll be good for the next meeting for some reason it didnt appear on ccps list of submitted issues so they had no chance to get substantive feedback for the iceland meeting we need to make sure it definitely appears on their list next time around and gives the appropriate developers the neccessary time to reply substantively to the issue  its a major  visionary  game change of the sort weve been invited to submit and its going to need a serious assessment from the appropriate ccp staff fingers crossed all goes well for august and well get appropriate feedback from the 2nd formal meeting all the best
ok excellent so long as it is not swept under the rug we have been waiting for 2 years little more now we can wait a bit longer appreciate your replies guys and lets see what happens in august
access logs does make sense  and would be handy for other things other than tracking down thieves 
as far as i know that issue was only informally discussed there were a few issues that were handed in too late to made it to the official agenda but were discussed after the meetings thus they are on the priority list but not in the minutes
im not much of a killer i didnt even know this was how it workedhave to say i agree completelyedit then i read the guy above me who suggested dual ownership not sure about technical feasibility but yeah it is silly that the corpmates of the dead guy cant grab his loot without getting flaggedagree even more to the dual ownership suggestion
hwo about target painters d they are completly useless in most situations

wanted to train for the arazu however ccp nerfed my ship before i ever got the chance now all i do is sit and cry in the shower
erm what are we even looking at the same shipmy arazu tackles from 40km away why would it ever want to get in close
change the lach and arazu to focus on different rolesarazu fleet support and antisniper20 scram range10 damp falloff5 damp effectivenesscloak fitting bonuslach small gang5 hybrid damage5 missile rof  please stop making me use missiles but thats a different complaint 10 damp effectiveness20 scramone ship gets much longer ranged damps but they operate in falloff so at decreased efficiency this is nice for antisniper rolesthe other gets much greater damp effectiveness and damage but is focused on close range more smallgang or lowsec oriented fighting

as an ewar enthusiast i like seeing these ships used and since the damp nerf i have felt that damps might have been nerfed too much in peparation for bringing this issue to the next csm meeting i was doing research on the subject and i have to admit at first it actually doesnt seem like the rsds need to be boosted arazus and lachesis can still dampen most players to less than 60km while scrambling them with a 60km faction scrambler like they could before it seemed people were upset because their i win button was removedhowever after talking more with gallente ewar pilots it becomes apparent that although the damps might not be bad in their current form there isnt a real need for them ecm can prevent people from getting target locks and an often heard complaint is that in low range combat the dampening doesnt really matter anyway the warp jammer range bonus is nice but many pilots feel it doesnt compete with the recently introduced hics and various warp disruption bubbles in short the gallente ewar doesnt really have a purpose or rolei dont quite feel comfortable bringing this issue to the csm in its current form because in my opinion too many people are simply asking for too big a boost to rsd  returning to pre nerf strength simply adding range bonuses like ecm etc  that would overpower gallente ewar that said i do think its a valid point to discuss and i think we should focus more on what seems to be the root of the problem with remote sensor dampeners what is the role or purpose of gallente ewaronly once we determine what the role or purpose of gallente ewar should be can we start thinking about possible changesfixessolutions as it stands this question seems to be unanswered keep in mind that the role shouldnt be all overpowering i win explosions were looking for a role that sets the gallente ewar ships appart isnt easily covered by other ships and is not overpowered there has to be a counter ill give an example belowone solution i found that i did find interesting was the followingmake gallente ewar antisniper ewar the role of gallente ewar ships would be antisniper being able to force snipers to give up or come closer seems to fit with the gallente preference for close range combatin order to achieve this dampner strength would be reduced further yes i know this sounds like complete fail doesnt it it wouldnt be reduced much only a few percentages at most this will prevent rsd being overpowered on short to mid range to compensate gallente ewar ships  celestis arazu and lachesis  would receive a range bonus similar to their caldari counterparts a fully skilled and rigged arazu or lachesis pilot should be able to succesfully dampen targets at 200km with a few dozen km in falloff this should be a severe problem for sniper ships while still allowing them to counter long range damps by fitting several sensor boostersthe result of this change would be that gallente ewar would be very useful in countering snipers but not be all overpowering like it used to beultimately ofcourse this is just a possible solution  one which i suspect wont be liked by everyone i hope however that it will help get a bit more discussion for a real solution going here instead of simply trying to revert the rsd rebalance
thanks for your thorough replylet me get streight to the point s  should it be mandatory to fit a faction point on the recons  imho no  the recons have the option of a second ewar the celestis does not dampeners dont have the necessary range to reach the snipers  optimal 45 falloff 90 with all 5 skills  compared to ecm it has a much greater chance to fail assuming a 110km sniper standoff plus due to their shorter cycle time the effect is much more likely to be statistical  closer to the projected probability racial ecm has a range of 16242 almost twice as far multispecs reach 10827  assuming t2 all 5 and a caldari recon the damps are already beyond falloff when the ecm is barely stating as long range supression vessels the gallente recons have a slightly shorter locking range
keen reply you are the first to really mention sensor boosters in this entire threadwhy would rsds not be overpowered if they were given a massive strength bonus because any sniper that intends to do any sort of ranged combat  around 150  will be using multiple sensor boosters guess what ewar gets stacking nerfed against sensor boosters you guessed it rsds sensor boosters even though they are scripted are a must fit module even when not considering the availability of rsds on the battlefield because they become a null issue either a  need to have stacking removed or b  need a massive strength boost to overcome it and maintain effectivenessyou are right gallente recon is antisniper since gallente combat is primarily short range  drone travel time  blasters  rsds should force them to engage in mid to short range combat  around 50km  so in order to do that it needs the optimal  150km after bonus  skills  to reach that far and strength to do so needs the math required to reasonably affect a dual sensor boosted rokh
i will support this issue because it requests that these ships are reviewed i agree they need revisitinghowever i dont think the fix is necessarily in the rsds at the moment its possible to damp any t1 ship to below a t2 warp disruptor range on an arazu with one damp albeit only just for the extreme casesbut whats often missed is that dampening ships dont just do dampening an arazu does  what 200dps and tackles and tanks its actually quite dangerously close to being overpowered if it can ecm tank  nano  do damage  its already pretty deadly as a solo ratter slayer but thats a bit of a poor combat niche to be occupying personally i think the fix might be something like investigating increasing the dronebay on these ships or looking at what else they do i mean bad ewar doesnt make a bad ship  just ask a minmatar pilot what they think of target painters especially in reference to the huginnrapierhyena so yes tacitly supported since the issue is revisiting rsd ships not necessarily the rsds themselves
with recon 5 a t2 warp disruptor ii will do 48km with two of those effectiveness rigs an rsd ii will put the longest range locking ship t1 ship  the rokh  to a locking range of 4661km neither does the bellicose nor the arbitrator nor actually the blackbird but hey the celestis does have turret damager bonus and 40m3 of dronebay actually multispec ecm optimal is 54  27km on a 100 range bonused ship thats 10827  your 1 falloff is therefore 135km where on an rsd its  4590km which comes out at exactly he same number its just your second falloff is 3x as long  so an upper edge of 225km youre trading 50 chance of halving their range with the rsd  and thus probably dropping their lock  for a 50 chance of having a chance of jamming them for 20s  6 vs sensor strength means 60 chance against a frigate and 30 chance or so against a bs unless were talking about fitting signal distortion amplifiers here which in turn means using up lowslots as well now i agree that racial jammers do have a longer range but  well theyre racial jammers  that means theyre not all that effective against off race ships thats very definitely a tradeoff and one i cant see being good for damps  damp ships arent just damp ships so theyd be really hurting if you had to fit 4 to be effective against any race of ships theres a racial skew on locking ranges vs scan resolution gallente recons have a shorter locking range but in turn a higher scan resolution either way neither arazu nor falcon can lock to its maximal ranges and thus needs to rig or sensor boostissue supported regardless but as i say the answer i feel is not in the rsds but looking to what else these ships do
i dont think the resulution is making the arazu a anti sniper that would limit it to 00 id rather give the rsd ships a slight bonus to dampning strenght and otherwise keep them as is
no kidding i trained for an arazu realized how worthless it is and sold it in jita but at least i can fly an ishtar now
you didnt support it in this post
you didnt support it in this postsee post above
new question then because of the dampener change what has changed in how you use gallente ewar  both on the gallente ewar ships and on regular ships please be as specific and detailed as possible  what could you do before that you cant do  or not as well  now etci can see merit in supporting a reevaluation of remote sensor dampeners but i want to make sure we can tell ccp something better than please change it back thx  
thats the kind of thing id be looking for having my ship on one monitor is fine because if i could move the chat overview and other windows to a second monitor it would leave me with much more room to see the action
this is a frikin2yrold suggestion you had a chance with trinity ccp and you blew it
well i just got a new 22 monitor and its damn big but hell if i could use two screens i would
i agree
perfect idea
oh yes please eve on one monitor and on the other one the map chat windows directional scanner overview etc
i made a mistake in setting up moon harvesters and silos in one pos  i forgot to drag the minerals the harvesters to silos before onlining everything fixing that cost me over an hour where i had to sit in the pos and watch progress bars i managed to get two or three courier missions done during the 20min breaks to offlineunanchor so it wasnt a total lossplease ccp fix pos management  
ummm you cant connect them unless they are onlinethe time it takes should not be changed but i agree that you should be able to queue it all up and go do something else for the 8 hours it takes it all to anchor and online
covert ops cloaks are not acceptable at least until stealth bombers get a covops cloak bombers are even more useless than black ops right now a black ops at least has the jump bridge ability to make it worth using while the only reason to ever fly a bomber over a recon is the lower mass for use with black ops portals
all i really want is the ability to have slot one additional skill after the one that is training that way i can reasonably do a 5 or 6 hour skill during the workday and have something else start immediately instead of having to wait 3 or 4 hours until i make it back home
i seriously cannot understand the farmer argument theyre farmers theyre already logged into the game you know farming they would never even use a queue a queue would only be useful to people who have large daily chunks of time they cannot be logged in ie work sleeping basically the opposite of farmers of course it would have to shut off the queue when the account went inactive thats pretty common sense one of the key elements of this game is that the gameplay itself is what encourages people to log on and play a queue just makes leveling a bit easier and i dont have to freak out when my horrible isp craps out on me
whats with all the people supporting this idea in their comment but not the checkboxor am i somehow misreading tens of posts
its a minutes thread not a proposal thread and as such the thumb is largely meaningless im using it largely to indicate threads where i think ccp made the right decision for example this is the problem with the thumb  its way too ambiguous give us a proper forum polling mechanism asap
this should go on the top of the list of things to be done
id rather see it give more jump clones 24 hours is plenty short regardless it should require v not iv

what a crock of im putting that politely by the waywhat about us mercs that make our living by accepting contracts for wars all this is going to do is kill off our business and allow even more grief in high sec because people will know they can be asses and get away with it the cost of waring them will be too highwhy dont you just make 05  10 a non pvp area and be done with it absolutely ridiculous
keep local but make it not auto update whos on the system however show total number of ppl in systemmodify constellation channel to show everyone in constellationmake everyone who as spoken i local visible in local to everyone that was in local when the person spoke this way a gang searching for someone in constelation can easily say something like report and all friendlys in system would say something so that the gang can see if any hostile is there  or if a friendly is afk lol 
i like this idea
wonderful news there has been a gaping hole in between 1m industrials and 1b freighters for far too long
somthing in between is needed for sure i figure somewhere around 100km3 to 150km3 cargo spaceable to use jetcans and with tractors capital or normalthis would be a bridge gap ship for miners in empire as well as alowing people who cant afford a billion isk to transport more then the tiny amout alowed with indy and transport ships the the advent of t2 ore ships and nothing new in the hauling department miners are left in the dust trying to move the large amouts of ore they can mine in an efficent way when a small corp mining group has 4 hulds pulling 4000m3 or more each personaly i can pull 4500m3 every 3 minutes after a good day of mining transporting it all to sell or to move it for production is a pain
1 make it more effective against larger targets blobs consist mainly of bs if a bomb shall be antiblob it needs to focus on killing bs at the same time it should not easily wipe out roaming gangs with smaller shipsconsidering the tank that even cruisers have i suggest something like1x damage against frig hulls4x damage against cruiser hulls9x damage against bs hulls16x damage against cap hulls2 bombs need to explode even if the bomber has warped away cloaked is destroyed
i would like to be able to search courier contracts by cargo size payout and collateral can you please add working filters with these in mind
ive had a few ideas as far as contracts go1  courier contracts are basically useless people want 200mil collateral for 50 jumps with 2k reward so my idea is automatically calculate reward based on the contractors estimated collateral that way you know youre getting some percentage of what they asked for up front if im risking life and limb to traverse low sec for your 200mil whatever then id like something that resembles a reward instead of a ripoff at the end2  item contract titles should not be custom sadly there are a lot of suckers complaining in local when someone says hey buy my deimos and sells them a thorax yes i admit its up to the buyer to pay attention to what theyre doing the link in local said deimos and the contract title said deimos but the actual icon said thorax and they should have paid attention but its still grief3  size limit is also an issue if a corp only has a couple freighter pilots who rarely come online and several miners gathering ore and minerals for the corp how many contracts do you expect me to create for transit i understand its a matter of timing and coordination but the system could bend a little to compensate as wellperhaps a slight tweak either for all couriers or maybe just corp couriers but allow larger contracts that could be broken down if you have 500k m3 in ore the freighter can get it at once if several indys are available sooner then they can take bits and pieces until the entire contracts worth has reached the destinationideas
1  dont take a bad contract2  dont take a bad contract3  this would allow a battleship to be moved in a hauler over the course of 10 trips this seems obviously wrong the size cap does need to go up but breaking down has to be limited by the contents of the package
1  dont let them make a bad contract to begin with were paying a fee to someone in order to file the contract in the first place so why dont they read over the thing first and say dont you think thats cheap or umm thats not actually a navy issue ship ya know2  see 13  i would think that is obvious if a single item is 500k m3 then thats what it is but a single contract containing 500k m3 worth of ore and minerals could easily be broken down into smaller portionsi thought it was perfectly clear the first time but ill do it in crayon next time just for you
what id like to see is far more flexibility and transparencyfor example say i want to put a contract on the market to move 100 million tritanium from one station to another1 i would set a reasonable rate for the contract  ie 01 isk per unit per jump 2 i would set a reasonable collateral to cover for items going missing in transit  ie 4 isk per unit 3 i would pay interbus a fee equal to the total rate to complete the contract  in this example say i wanted the tritanium moved 3 jumps the fee would come out as 30 million isk 4 my name would not be tied to the contract anyone accepting would be dealing with interbus5 now heres where it gets interesting its unlikely that anyone would want to try to take on the entire contract in one go this is fine as with this idea a potential hauler would be able to bid on a portion of the contractexample someone has a hauler with 10000m3 of free space they would be able to bid to accept up to that amount of the contract  1 million tritanium  paying scc a fee equal to the collateral for that shipment  4 million isk  on delivery interbus would return the collateral as well as a portion of the fee paid by the contract creator  300000 isk  this would be shown in both parties transaction histories as being a transaction from interbus thus maintaining anonimity for both partiespotentially interbus would also give lp for successfully completing contract deliveries for themso how would you stop scamming simple you would need a minimum standing with interbus to take on expensive jobs  for example you might need 0001 standing to accept a contract with 1000000 isk as its collateral with the maximum collateral acceptable in one run being 999 million isk  at standing 999  failure to complete a delivery within a reasonable period of time  3 days  would result in no standing gain whereas failure to deliver within 7 days would lead to both a standings drop proportional to the collateral paid the collateral would be paid to the contract creator from interbus and an evemail sent to the contract creator informing them of what had failed to be delivered and who was carrying it it would then be up to the two parties to hammer out reasons as to why it didnt get there  for example the hauler could provide a link to the killmail showing the loss of the items if they were destroyed in transit  of course the contract creator would be free to disbelieve this and find other ways to take the value out of the hauler  by war dec an interesting twist on this would be to restrict the acceptance of contracts to players within a player run corporation
1  youre paying a listing fee to be displayed on the contracts page without having to station trade not an is this fair fee and even then the contract is exactly as specified  youre allowed to lie in the title but everything else is guaranteed to be accurate and its petitionable if its not also your original proposal was to have reward be automatically calculated which seems obviously a bad idea moving a given quantity of trit and a given quantity of mega the same number of jumps through highsec justifies basically the same reward but 2000x the collateral you want the game to force me into 2000x the reward youll just be destroying the courier business if you do that also deletion of contract titles yields other problems for example mfo and mro skillbooks exist but they cannot be autolinked or searched on contract the only way to find them is to search the contract title if you delete contract titles you destroy the ability to create public contracts for goods of this nature given that i feel not the slightest bit of sympathy towards those who get scammed by title fraud i cant advocate ruining legitimate businesses just to save people from their own incompetence 3  if it works that way fine could be a bit of a pain organizing the goods to ship and the goods to leave unless you give the shipping container an items window but in principle it works well enough the problem with that is that it forces people into homogeneous contracts what if you want 100 million units of assorted minerals moved from your mission hub to market do you set separate collateral and reward for each of them what if youre moving 100 different kinds of goods you cant set a contract for each of them since you cant have more than 21 so creation of the contract alone would take an hour for big piles of goods i like the idea of allowing separable contracts but it needs to be an option as for doing it through interbus im not really a fan youre forcing collateral limits way too low and standing requirements are bizarre the whole reason for collateral is that if its a scam you dont care because you just sold the goods at a profit to your scammer if you want to pay 4 a unit for my trit be my guest if you arent willing to part with the goods for the collateral set a higher collateral
well to work on that premise say for example you want to move stacks of all 8 minerals from one station to another you would highlight the group you want to contract rightclick to create the contract which would open up a dialogue boxfor example say you were in luminaireitem quantity  volume   unit collateral reward per jump destinationtritanium 1000000  10000m3  36 isk 02isk oursalaert  station pyerite 100000   1000m3  5 isk 02isk rens  station mexallon 50000   500m3  30 isk 02isk amaar  station isogen 10000   100m3  75 isk 02isk hek  station nocxium 1000   10m3  120 isk 02isk jita  station  edit growls at forum software for being unable to set up a simple table once youd set this up your items would be placed on the list of contracts available from that station the hauler would then look at the available jobs might not want to be going near jita but is doing a run down towards amaar so he would be able to accept that portion of the contractthat way you get the functionality of multiple contracts to multiple destinations being able to set the collaterals and rates for each part of the contract all using up only a single contract slotjust brainstorming possible ideas the idea behind making it standing based was to introduce lasting consequences for failing to make deliveries youve committed to  note trips that either begin end or have no other option but to go through low sec should not result in standings loss just loss of collateral interbus accepts that lowsec is dangerous thats why theyve subcontracted you to do the delivery  screw up enough and interbus wont give you any more work  so you wouldnt be able to accept any contract to haul items then  as to the collateral limits it was more an idea that youd need to build up from milk runs to get access to the more lucrative contracts the collateral limits suggested would also be open to discussion they were a starting pointthough if you were getting into the realms where you were having to set collaterals of near on a billion isk for a single item then youd want to be damned sure that the person taking the contract is trustworthy enough that youll see your items at the other end
not a terrible idea i worry a lot about how it would look once implemented but in principle its not badi still disagree on worrying about security on my courier contracts i can easily envision a situation where someone missions a lot in an out of the way system amasses a pile of named goods their local market cant absorb in any reasonable amount of time and wants to move them to jita for sale this is a process i partake in for reference  its not difficult to put together a billion isk of such goods if youre a missioner and dont clean your hangars often and then find yourself unable to move them because you dont fly a big industrial or freighter so ive got maybe 800m worth of stuff im looking to unload and i stick up a courier for it with a billion of collateral if the guy moves it i shuttle over to jita and battle the lag monster for a few hours and if the guy steals it then i just unloaded all my goods at what i think was a good price and dont have to deal with any of the difficulties of actually selling it myself the thief is doing me a service because i set my collateral properly and this is a situation that is quite believable for me to find myself in  probably not at quite that scale but in principle interbus keeping track of your courier performance and rating you on it seems a good mechanism and you could put an interbus standing requirement on the courier for the especially paranoid or for people dealing in timesensitive goods but it should be optional on the contractors part
im seeing where some of the crossed wires are here in this ideathe collateral limits would be an upper limit as to what interbus would entrust you with so with your example of 1 billion isk worth of mission loot remember that its 1 billion across maybe thousands of items so for example someone with a collateral limit would be restricted to only being able to carry cargo with a total collateral equalling his limit say that he had a limit of 200 million then he could do your entire contract in 5 runshowever say you had a juicy officer mod  for example  in the middle of that loot that youve valued for collateral at 500 million for that item alone then no matter how much room he had in his hold he couldnt touch it until hes more trusted with interbus  how do you get more trusted successfully complete hauling runs closer to your limit you get the better the standing increases would be does this help to explain better what the premise of this idea is
now this part i dont like thats saying that courier contracts are a faction mission now and no one can even attempt to run them until they have started running npc missions for interbus firstid say as far as the collateral of a mass shipment with a single pricy item is concerned put a single amount on the whole package or list the pricy stuff separatelygoing back to my suggestion beforewhether youre asking to trek a huge load of veld or a single mega youre asking for 200bil collateral so yes i do think that the reward should be the same for both contracts but the reward should reflect the value of the cargo as well as the travel involved so either shipment carried entirely through high sec wouldnt require as much of a default reward as they would if carried through lownull secroutes are calculated on a contract when you list pickup and delivery so the reward is calculated based on the safestshortest route between if a hauler cant enter high sec due to standings or wants to dip into low sec for a shortcut thats on them
i never miss an oppertunity to get on the soapbox
sure wish i owned t2 bpos so this would really matter to me but the consequences to those as do own them are clear enough
a statement of intent would indeed be a good thing for all the people who own andor are thinking of investing in these
he he he
they are not taking away your t2 bpos yetasking for a definitive answer that they will never change something is a fools question and ccp would be a fool to say they would never change something do we really need over 9000 dev blogs a month saying no we wont change x mechanic yet but maybe in the futureif you think that you will get an answer so you can capitalize on something ingame then you are a fool this is eve at anytime they can trash t2 bpos and wreck your investment dont like it then get out of the t2 bpo market most likely if ccp ever changes t2 bpos there will be a dev blog on it months in advance so calm down you paranoid bearitt fools asking fools questions because they are fools who dropped out of fool school
i havent seen this thread till nowany information is better than no information
i suppose you failed reading comprehension 101 in school or the equivalent perhaps rereading the op and subsequent posts by me should clarify things even for someone who went to mr ts school of etiquette all the information ccp given out so far as the one made by ccp chronotis in the linked text is old and most people who jump to conclusions you should think about that one are also the one who are stirring the pot when it comes to t2 bpos anyway you do not want to know what devs think ok it is your choice i do have a nice day
reading a few of the posts on the topics of sovereignty and poses gave me a few ideas which i post here there are two elements to my proposal  a wide range of useful nonpos anchorable structures and the concept of linked defensesuseful nonpos anchorablesgeneral theory provide a lot more structures that cannot be anchored at a pos that provide benefits for defenders and targets for attackers whose benefits make them worth deploying and worth destroying these structures exist on a spectrum with the smallest providing little benefit and being relatively easy to destroy but requiring no maintenance  anchor and forget  to the larger ones providing great benefits but requiring more complex maintenance  ie fueling some potential building examplesmoon command bunker a small command bunker that can only be deployed at a moon where there is no pos has very limited defenses relatively easily destroyed gives fleetstyle leadership bonuses to friendly ships in combat at the moon requires sovereignty 1 almost no defensive capabilitiesplanetary command bunker a medium sized bunker that must be deployed at a planet coordinates defensive operations for all moons of that planet gives more significant stacking leadership bonuses for any combat at the planet or at any moon of the planet requires sovereignty 2 some defensive capabilitiessystem command bunker can be anchored anywhere except at a traditionally warpable object  and becomes itself a warpable object  coordinates defensive operations for the system gives yet more significant stacking leadership bonuses for any friendly combat in system requires sovereignty 3 has significant selfdefensive capabilities  but far less than a small deathstar pos for example industrial communication controllercomes in small medium and large with relevant sovereignty requirements must be anchored at an asteroid belt provides mining and other leadership bonuses to pilots at the belt in question more or less defenseless maybe larger ones can have very limited refining capabilitiesgeneric combat lookout postcomes in small medium and large perhaps in various flavors of gang bonus  like the leadership skills or even more specialized  etc  form is a nonwarpable anchorable small tower  not a pos tower more like a lookout  which provides bonuses to any pilot in system a large collection of them can provide the same bonuses as a decent fleet booster without requiring all pilots to be in a gang these towers are mostly defenseless but have to be probed out to be destroyedetc etclinked defensive structuresgeneral theory each online defensive structure in the system provides a boost to all other online defensive structures in the system commensurate with the type of structure and difficulty in destroying said structure pos towers count but nothing else at a pos doespotential examplesfrom the above suppose a systemwide bunker gives a 5 bonus a planet bunker 3 a moon bunker 1 and the varying combat based lookout stations do the same the bonuses are initially applied to shield resistances up to a max of 50 and any unused bonuses are applied to shield amount to another maximum of 100 bonuses are added first and then applied more concretely suppose a system with 4 planetary bunkers 7 moon bunkers a system bunker and 4 medium general combat lookout stations the resulting shield resistance bonus is  43  71  15  43   37 while all structures are online they all have in essence a 37 invulnerability hardener  stacking penalized as appropriate  as structures are destroyed the resistances on remaining structures drop while it is possible to simply go right after any pos tower it is much more efficient if possible to destroy the support structures
continued from aboveif a total bonus as calculated above exceeds 50 the remaining bonus is converted to a shield amount bonus thus if a total bonus was calculated to be 73 a 50 acrosstheboard resistance bonus is applied to all defensive structures  stacking penalized as appropriate  and a further 23 shield amount boost is also appliedwhen a structure is destroyed its bonuses are removed from all other structures thus the best way to weaken a strong structure is to destroy all the weaker structures but this step can be bypassed at the penalties of the higher shield resists andor amountsi think the results of this system are1  strong significant bonuses for welldeveloped defensive positions2  a plethora of meaningful targets for small gangsthe biggest challenges of this system are1  balancing the difficulty of destroying a wellboosted building versus the help it is providing to sovereigns2  balancing the costbenefit of deploying these structures3  balancing their inherent defensive capabilitiesi dont necessarily think my examples above are the way to go im really just proposing the general theories of lots of new buildings that benefit pilots around them and the concept of linked structures to decentralize useful points of attack everything else is example fluff  edit heck ill support my own idea  
interesting proposal i expect it to look a lot like parts of kelsins post a few hours ago once the details are hammered out but its definitely a different approach id like to see something along these lines implemented whatever the details though
im in favor of more anchorable structures but i personally would also like to see some noncombat structuresespecially with ambulation coming id like to see habitat modules casinos exotic bars and of course your favorite fast food restaurantplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesif this kind of stuff would be put in a pilots own deadspace complex with a locked acceleration gate would be even better attackers can destroy the gate to disable access to the structure but not directly access the structure unless they have the required passwordutility structures would be things like ore compression stations and repair stations both very small and having only a few hitpoints so that a single battleship can take them out in 10 minutes or soi think we should have a lot more stuff floating around in each solar system and that pilots should be able to live in their own personal structures instead of having to rent rooms at an outpost
yes more stuff in spaceand sov could become a adapted version of fw only that the alliances have to build all the bunkers the fuel bonus through sov could be transferred to a commodity production with several kinds of facilities that can be attacked by opposing alliances could even add a role for systemconstellationregion governor to control and oversee the sov complexes like a turn based or real time civilization gamelots of possibilities
lol  mc in spacehows about remote repair stationsweve seen them in missionsa remote repair station would work like a station except with limited cargo space noninstant repair could use it to resupply as well as change moduleshow it would be different from a normal pos hanger isyour ship is still outside everyone can target it and shoot itwhile parked youre ship cannot repair change modules or activate moduleslike already stated shield capacitor armor and hull repair takes time and costs iskemergency undocks  for example if youre under fire  roll a 20sided dice to see which modules get deactivated before undock p
interesting idea but im skeptical that nonpos anchorable structures can be both balanced and usefula nonpos structure that gives significant bonuses would have to require fuel to remain balanced but this would mean that they would either need to have large fuel bays or require frequent refueling visits once you figure that there might be half a dozen or more of these in a system at once this gets pretty scary either theres a huge amount of fuel in storage just sitting around the system which makes those structures very expensive to lose  especially since these structures not being at a pos dont benefit from a poss defenses  or theres a lot of needlessly tedious frequent refueling trips going on
interesting idea definately  
you misunderstand  im not talking about changes to poses since ccp has said thats not happening im talking about changes to corp offices located in npc stations those arent destructible  so long as you keep paying your rent the lines will keep functioning
why would i ever keep my pos fueled again
because you can buy a caldari control tower and 15 mobile laboratories for 171 billion and get 15 copying 45 me 45 pe and 75 invention slots a slightly more complex setup  3 mobile laboratories and 10 advanced mobile laboratories  will cost you 213 billion and net you 33 copying 29 me 9 pe and 35 invention slots my proposal would net you 40 slots of any one type for a similar price you would need to spend 2 million lp worth at least 2 billion isk if you know what to cash out in  more like 3 billion if youre good  and you still have to pay office fees
i move that kugus ban be considered for removal only if he travels to iceland to appeal itofcourse hed never go there

he wasnt banned for that he was banned for giving ccp a hard time that information on how it went exactly is out there have a look see yourselfi do agree that posting rl info about people should be banable but that stuff popped up here several times and not everyone got banned about it and that is 100 wrongthe point is that even though kug is a utter a hole he still deserves to be treated like any other player every player should be treated exactly the same or otherwise we simply can stop playing because it would be useless anyway
from the looks kug peed into ccps sunday shoes and got slapped into orbit for itccp is perfectly within their right to terminate business relations with individuals they have a justified animosity againsti think there are even legal terms for that someone more proficient in lawspeak could tellno support from me obviously
i think you should go to jail no matter if you committed a crime or not
all i will say is that ccp should not be banning people for messing around with other peoples forums that is not their job and trying to arbitrate disputes about which guild infiltratedhackedsocial engineered their way into which other guilds forum is outside their scope

when i was young to the game i face a similar situation i found another solution even then now that im older and have a fair amount of disposable isk more options are open to me someone like you that has been in the game so long should have no problem coming up with the same options your time in game presents you with more options through your skill level and ability to earn more isk you can go places a new person could not you are more valuable and therefore sought after by corporations both of which provide access to 00 for sec recovery as such your long time in the game has considerable weight in your ability to suicide gank recover from the same andor find alternate options for dealing with the problemwe do have an opportunity and those of us who see the current imbalance in suicide ganking mechanics are taking the opportunitywindjammer
when discussing game theory it is important to note that real life arguments are unconvincing except insofar as the game desires to exhibit verisimilitudehaving said thatmeaningless in the context of talking about a game rephrase and discuss this in terms of playstyle game choices and mechanical balanceyour example is contradictory because you argue crime does not pay and that societies that are corrupt falter and fail yet jita has the highest crime rate in empire with the most illegal murders committed per day it would seem that in jita crime pays exceptionally wellfurther your argument falls flat on its face when presented with empirical evidence crime is perhaps the most profitable business in the world it is just that the definition of what is and what is not a crime is often set by the criminals would you say stealing is criminal then what about the natural resource thefts from the western hemisphere that fueled the european economy from the 1400s until the 1800swould you say slavery is criminal what about war profiteering accounting fraud purposefully negotiating contracts over their value or never intending to follow through a myriad of crimes can be pointed out where individuals merrily profited throughout their livesyes even pirates profited quite well from their actions so well in fact that the primary fear was that they would organize and present a threat to established order fortunately for the european monarchies pirates tended to work alone and their crews tended to be of the incompetent sort that would get drunk on a beach and not notice an approaching manowar until it was too lateif i mine for 23 hours assume i make x million isk i have 0 risknow i pirate in lowsec for 23 hours assume i make y million isk i am risking my ship my pod and my security statusif x  y then a balance needs to be applied to those that mine because they are profiting with no risk while others are risking everything for lesser returnsthis is simple game theory
avoiding ganks while hauling is trivial use a scout fit for tanking and agility make multiple trips warp to zero  dont autopilot or afk  and dont undock from jita 44 during primetime when your screen will be black for more than the 30 seconds of undock invulnerability you get id be shocked if you died on more than 1 of your hauling runs if you followed these precautionsas for miners if i evemail you a proper hulk fitting  hint ki ans suggestion wasnt very good  will you a  promise not to divulge it and b  publicly retract your statement about how its impossible to protect yourself from jihadists like me just because you dont understand and cant figure out how to fit a hulk to defeat me doesnt make it impossible  also ive never once used a covops for a warpin and it certainly hasnt hurt my stats 
this is not to say that there arent any problems with suicide ganking clearly industrial ships getting destroyed on the undock without even being scanned is proof that something is wrong the main problem myself and others have with the proposed solutions is that they reduce the only risk vector most pilots in empire are subject to l4 missions in empire are very nearly equivalent iskhour as ratting in a decent truesec system in 00 space jihadswarm is the only thing keeping afk mining from being completely free isk if you nerf suicide ganking you indirectly buff these other empire activities that are already overpowered as it isthe question is then how to fix some of these minor issues of suicide ganking without causing too much backlash sec status drops for everyone and not just the person getting the final blow will help only a little but still doesnt do anything about solo ganks increasing the sec status hit is another option but the status hit is already pretty severe in terms of time required to recover that sec status so increasing it more than 50 or so over the status quo would start to get incredibly punitive  and if we changing how sec hits work we really should be talking about how to fix lowsec too removing insurance has sideeffects and honestly i expect this will cause a lot more grief for the average carebear than it ever will for suicide gankers nevertheless ive been expecting insurance removal to happen eventually for a while now it does accomplish some things  it makes blind attacks a losing proposition and substantially improves the freighter situation  but overall im simply not convinced its a great solution and as ki an pointed out it will give carebears a false sense of security that will likely offset any reduction in ganking the loss of insurance would cause the primary fear of gankers is that after this solution proves to be no solution at all what next will you come back and whine for even more nerfs to ganking even after getting everything youd asked for where should the line be drawn
right im sure you spend every minute of that 23 hours paying attention to your eve client
ok lets end this we can agree to disagree then i find comfort in that both the csm and ccp share my view though but to remove any misconceptions ill answer a few things thats because you do not know where to look and the market is not the answer it will require an investment but the total loss  not purchase  will be around 4 million for the bs itself plus any lost modules of course this is possible due to the insurance this is not news to any corp or alliance that has a strong industry there is simply nothing that prevents suicide gankers to achieve this so there is my main argument that there is virtually no financial risk what so everto clarify then the financial repercussions are equal to running level 1   missions for a weekend or to participate in a single level 4 mission  that would financially suffice for several ganks 
ki an this isnt 5th grade i know there are exceptions but mocking people  whether deserved or not  isnt why most of us play this game or even read the forums
the argument that its cheap is bs its not cheap its cost effective nerfing suicide ganking for this reason is simply protecting stupid people the pilots who complain for this reason are pilots who are upset their isk faucet got set back a little bit and they had to reset their macro how do the game mechanics favor the ganker someone with low sec status in an alliance or corp that is flagged for such behavior has to enter local which with the recent ui add on sets off an audible alert for all the macro miners i mean hapless potential victims then they face the consequences of their actions their ship gets blown up and they take a sec status hit if anything game mechanics favors the miners they can just make an intel channel and get safe long before their ship is in any danger basically the whole problem with suicide gankers comes down to people who dont want to pvp or take reasonable measures to protect themselves yelling at ccp to change the game so they do not have to pvp or take reasonable measures to protect themselves yet still ccp feels compelled to protect the vast number of miners in empire the accounts that make the game profitable for them nevermind that 00 the vaunted endgame of eve suffers from a riskreward ratio that makes missioning in empire the best way to make isk for an individual pilot
and further ignore that the changes that bring in more players are the changes that make pvp more accessible not less heres a quick and obvious tip for everyone out there the percentage of people in the general population that would want to mine and haul while playing eve is very small the percentage of people that would want to fly spaceships around and shoot each other is exceptionally largejust because eve is currently in a stranglehold by the former does not mean that it should continue catering to their desires its my firm belief that if pvp were more accessible then you would see a lot more accounts being made and a lot less alts its significantly harder to multibox combat characters then it is to multibox a mining alt a transportation alt and a combat character and i think that the rather anemic step taken by ccp with militia warfare has begun to prove me right in this matter im willing to bet that if ccp had opened the throttle a little more and made pvp a core mechanic of the game rather than a something done by people that have been playing for 3 months mechanic you would see a marked increase in playerbaseand the entire issue over suicide ganking is just a symptom of the problem with the current game design ccp wants to have its sandbox industrial and logistics game mixed with its sandbox conquer and combat game its been tried over and over again and it really doesnt work
the fact your post has nothing to do with suicide ganking aside i think it is very sweet that you think ccp cares about the players pvp is extremely accessible even to the few week old character just not solo pvp most alliances have a program to give new pilots free t1 fit frigates so they can make with the tackling immediately ccp cares about accounts the game softwareservers can barely handle 200 people on grid yet ccp is wasting time altering game mechanics so the miners can fly through space unmolested
pirating is more fun to you than mining otherwise you wouldnt be doing it  this is a game right and having fun in the game is the point of it so the riskreward is a bit irrelevant in this case if you are stacking having fun vs not having fun pirating is supposed to be hard  its a hi risk profession for those prepared to go the extra mile and play the game on hard mode means you are separate from the crowd a paragon of independant devilmaycare chutzpah and funky combat chic but to be honest its quite reasonable that making a living is more difficult for pirates than it is for hisec mining people  its supposed to be a hard life and not everyone can cut it if everyone could  well then it wouldnt be half as sexy
i hope suicide ganking will still be a viable activity after this changei dont know about increasing the sec hitsgrinding back sec is painfulthe only problem is that currently the bar for what is a lucrative suicide gank is set far too low this is because suiciders can use insured t1 ships if you remove the insurance for suiciders the bar for what is lucrative becomes a lot more reasonable and you have to be flying something truly valuable in a truly carefree fashion to be a target
so is this thread not about suicide ganking anymore pirating  suicide gankingalso pirates dont pirate for the saucy selfimage they pirate because it is profitable
nope it just makes it so the suicides pick their targets with more carewhen the initial investment is pretty much paid back through insurance on a battleship costing them only maybe 46mil to set up a ship again and that can be made while ratting in missions the minerhauler looses half the ships value or more on the insurance and full loss of the cargosee the problem its easy to say hey im out 6 mil but that poor soul is out a couple hundred millionthe haulers are at far more monetary risk than than the gankersfailed gank  out a few million target gains nothing  quite possibly loses a couple hundred million successful gank  make a couple hundred million target loses a couple hundred millionso its still a viable option you just got to work on picking targets that are worth risking the full price of your ship if the insurance is not paidit cuts out them shooting empty haulers because they got lazy and dont bother to scan anymore
that suicide ganking punishes stupid players that afk haul billions in cardboard boxes through space is not an issue well except for the idiots that haul billions in t1 haulers on autopilotthat a stupid player can blast every hauler they see and come out ahead isthat a player can haul billions in an untanked t1 hauler and with a few minor precautions and not have to worry much is not an issue if they still get ganked is not an issue unless the gank squad is indiscriminately blasting away and just got lucky but that goes back to the stupid player blasting every hauler they seethat the whole gang in a well planned suicide gank operation make a ton of isk is not an issue that they all did not take a security hit is that the pership loss is minimal  making the break even line way too low  is an issuethat a player that repeatedly commits criminal acts is able with a few hours or even a couple of days to totally remove the stigma of those acts is an issue to our goonswarm friends face it kartoom who is credited with over 300 kills should never be able to enter 5 or higher space without being a target for every pilot with a weapon mounted  the link was furnished above kartoom has the most jihadswarm kills that a miner can watch local and go hide when goonswarm shows up is not an issue that a miner that started his miners and went off to eat dinner and gets popped is not an issue that the person who popped him  or her  can be back to do it again in a day or 2  or 3  without the tell tail orange  or red  glow is an issue that a miner aligned and tanked cant jump out in time when a discowhatever shows up that another miner cant align because they are being bumped by a gnat  we all saw ankas mini imagine her trying to bump an 18 wheeler off a road  or a swarm of gnats is an issue and those gnats are left even when raid  spelled concord  shows up because they did not bother to fire a shot
really quick theres a sweet irony to a member of goonswarm snidely complaining about thread jacking  the current furor over suicide ganking is a symptom of ccps big ass sandbox design they started out with a clear high level concept of hey guys wouldnt it be awesome if you had spaceships and you could fly them around and trade and fight and stuff like that old game tradewars but 3d and stuff and we could have players participate in the full vertical of ship and space station creation oh and should be all corporations and stuff because thats scifi punk but some cracks began to show when people actually started using the game the smartbomb plus stargate plus natural trade hub equals gold equation if you willi have no such illusion ccp cares about its bottom line if it has any sense at all and right now its bottom line is 80 in empire and 20 not so anything that makes the 80 happy of course theyre going to doi would suggest that this is the short view which will do something to attempt to placate the 80 but is a step in the wrong direction financiallyassumptions that are extremely validmost people do not come to a game with 10 friendsmost people have an adjustment period during which they are learning the gamemost people have other games hobbies pasttimes what have you in which theycould be participating rather than the gamemost play early in a new players gamelife will be solo playthus i would argue that the lack of solo pvp is a turn off to a sweeping portion of potential players a 7 month average account life is a significant amount of churn especially in a game as small as evei know that being a member of goonswarm means you have around 1000 other people to hang out with but unless i want to accept the somethingawful forum tax and yield to the culture of the goons im stuck with the few i have most new players would not know which alliances you are referring to i have not seen any offers to join an alliance and receive free ships and equipment a few corporations toss out such offers occasionally in local but who can trust whats a recruitment scam and whats notperhaps goonswarm is recruiting brand new players who come to eve from various directions not just the somethingawful forumsi agree ccp is directing much needed energy away from the actual problem to a very small symptom to appease what they see as their customer base what they have not come to realize is that appeasing your current customers will only keep them around for so long at some point you have to appeal to new customers or you become stagnant and begin losing accountsreality check handling 200 person fights across the internet requires a significant hardware and software investment much more so then i would wager ccp can muster with the current playerbase the reality of network latency 3d visualization control processing data interface latency redundancy and security make such large fleet battles as ccp clearly envisions a false pipe dream im not saying that it cant be done but without significant capital investment in infrastructural concerns both real and intellectual its just not possible and significant on the order of blizzard or microsoft
kart is 10 and has been for most of his kills but nice strawman
stop and think about what you just saidyou just inserted fun into the range of player risk vs reward the domain of our equation is risk elements player actions are a function that map risk to the range of our equation which is reward to put it a little more rigorouslyf  player action acting as a functional transformationf risk   rewardwhererisk   ship modules isk pod security status time  reward   ship modules isk security status time we could do some more associations here  all things map to time for example  but this will suffice what youre attempting to say is that my perception ismining f no risk   isk phourpvp f all risk   isk phourwhere fun makes the following true f no risk   f all risk   funthe question i would ask is what about the players that seef no risk   fun  f all risk  first lets go ahead and admit that you cant measure or quantify fun the proof is trivial and can be found in any philosophical argument that starts and ends in utilitarianism this includes further ignoring that mining can be a lot of fun assuming you have a second game open that youre playing while you mine for example your combat alt that is paid for by the proceeds of your miningsecond what i am saying is that all things being equal  including intangibles like fun  if mining produces more reward per hour then pvping then a balance needs to be applied to mining because the amount of risk associated with mining is significantly less than pvp in fact to make this clearmining risk ship modules pod timemining reward isk game structures exist in high security to reduce this risk to negligiblepvp risk ship modules pod security status timepvp reward ship modules isk game structures exist in high security to increase this risk to an absolutesince ships and modules can be abstracted as isk all you have to do is perform the simple calculation of finding total isk over time and you can represent an associative value to compare the two actions if the isk to be gained from mining significantly outweighs that which can be gained from an equivalent amount of pvp then it is clear that more balance needs to be applied in the direction of miningwhat i am saying is that it seems clear to me that mining is significantly more rewarding in game value then pvping when balanced against the risk and honestly ive been polite and havent even pulled out the balance sheet for trading which looks like this in its pure formtrading risk isk timetrading reward iskand i know for a fact that trading generates buckets more isk for significantly less riskwhat i am saying is there should be commiserate reward for such dedication when you play on hard most games give you better items expanded access and exclusive content pirating limits access and forces me to use less effective  cheaper  items oh hey i can access those angel cartel agents in 00 thats great i guessbeing awesome is not a game reward   i have no problem if its hard but the risk needs balance
ok how about youthat kart is at 10 is all well and good that he can rat in the relative safety of goon space to raise that is where i have a problemi added a few of the most effective goons to my friends list and noticed several had positive security ratings how can this be that pilots claiming to have suicide ganked all these exhumers have security ratings approaching 0 i assume its because the sec hit is not high enough and the work to clear it not onerous enough understand me here i have seen 3 suicide gank attempts all in a matter of a few days a few months back with the commiserate bragging in local and the threats to move to minmatar space the most effective was not in goonswarm he took out 2 barges an inty and 2 pods in 1 attack dropped his security level to 62 or so impressive warp in to 0 fire up the smartbombs watch the fireworks concord was already in the area and he still got the kills i do not know what his security level was prior to the attackone of the goonswarm attacks a few days earlier left the pilot in his pod and his pod was still there later after the goonswarm members had long left the systemnothing would have helped in either case the afk guy was not going to try to run concord will not react fast enough most of the time all the attacks will still succeed it will just cost you a tad bit more  something i doubt you are worried about  for a new ship to lose to concord and it will take you longer to recover the loss of standing  another item i doubt you are all that worried about if they change the system so all security changes are multiplied by the posted security level of the system then look at all the people that will be hanging out in low sec space because good old safe goonswarm space will not work to recover

i see what your saying arkania and agree totally however just like you cant quantify fun you cant quantify the risk either because you can get lucky know the right people or be damn good and be just fine in low secno sec as you have mentioned you are young to the game and it restricts your abilities to get into the alliances so right now you a pvperpirate that is young to the game and things are hard because your skills and experience are lacking in the things you need to meet your goals welcome to the game it was made that way intentionally if you wanted to be a high sec miner you could be doing great right now but if you wanted to be a low sec miner you would still be in the same boat right what if you wanted to run missions in low secno sec still in the same boat you can do them yes but the riskreward is significantly different for a person with 4 million skill points and a person with 40 million skill pointsin this context what happens if ccp significantly reduces your risk and reward it takes a lot of time often doing boring tasks to make up for losses yes some are getting vastly wealth in high sec and that needs to be stopped but suicide ganking isnt how you stop it i believe a lot of people are correct to assume a sizable contingent of the high sec miners are alts mining for other players since when did ccp reverse their support of multiple accounts they even offer discounts on occasions to those running multiple accounts so the fact that a person has alts doing stuff is a nonissue because so can you there needs to be a fundamental shift in the way that being a player in high sec is approached that increases the risk but until ccp says that they want to completely eliminate the npc corps all our hands are tiedhowever in the current form macro miners and afk traders are near impossible to distinguish from regular miners and traders the reason why is a miner in a roid field is a miner in a roid field unless those miners are chatting it up in local which i do if i am ever mining then no one knows if i am a macro miner or not except i am in a rohk which is a pretty crappy miner compared to a hulk  i hate mining i hate salvaging and i even hate looting my missions my best friend likes mining loves salvaging and picks up the loot because he is already salvaging the mission should he be punished for activities that make him appear to be an alt his risk is fairly high because he comes with me on lvl 4s and gives me drone support but he is about as new to the game as you are so his skills are very low he flys a dominix but most of his skills are in industry he cant even use active hardeners so when get gets agro if he gets webbed or jammed its almost always fatal he is young his risk is high his reward is high as he gets older his risk will not necessarily go down as he may choose to fly more expensive ships with more expensive equipment but his reward may not necessarily go up as it takes two of us to maintain the current income levels eventually a player will plateau where the risk and reward will level off this is where the balance needs to be done and its going to be tough if you let players hide in npc corps fixing this is the problem
its a good thing killmails arent just a simple text file or you could change the character name before posting it to a killboard
ah forgot to add support for1  removing the insurance payment when killed by concord2  all attackers taking the sec hit not just the last blow3  possible increase in the sec hitiit will still be profitable when there is incentive to actually work hard to pick targets
thats because there is a discussion and most of the post are made by the same people everyone i spoke with so far is enthusiastic about these upcoming changes and so am iits not about turning this into hello kitty online its ironing out an imbalance in the game mechanics which i think is something all of us could agree on we have plenty of pvp people in the csm it is a very diverse group its just that most if not all of us see that there is a big problem with suicide ganking in its current form which needs to be adjustedno clarifying email so far by the way
i believe that you can quantify risk it wont be 100 accurate but thats what a number of game designers try to do is quantify the risk elements of the game and then balance them against character reward thats pretty much the core of most economic theory and game theory honestly sure you cant with 100 accuracy nail down the risk as a quantity but i bet you can get a good idea and within the ballparkand once again what im saying is take the platonic ideal of playstyle x and playstyle y compare their platonic ideal risks and rewards are they completely out of whack now take real game examples of x and y analyze are they completely out of whack if so do somethingdecisions may have resulted in the outcome but it might not have been intentionalonce again all things being relatively equal take a combat character with 4 million and stack him against a miner with 4 million thats finei submit that a game that imposes toil to play it has a flawthis isnt about stopping it so much as weighing the reward for different valid play stylesexcept that it neuters high sec wars and reduces the viability of logistical strikes against empire targets supporting 00 corporations and alliancesthe fundamental question then is why do it justifications vary but in the end they often come down to so i can do something more fun doesnt this sound like a job this is a massive tangentshould i be punished for wanting to pvp by having people blow up my ships its not punishment its balancing the equation in a game with various valid play styles without risk your friend is gaining reward at a rate above other players why must we punish those other players by forcing them to play catch up to your friendthat is his risk as applied to a combat mission he is doubtlessly rewarded for his participation in the combat missionyes his risk for a high level combat mission is high but i suspect the rewards in bounty items and salvage are comensuratei would argue that a proper accounting shows risk decrease with time in combat missions while reward stays more or less equal
thanks for the supports i think a strength of this proposal is that the modular nature of it allows for tweaks to different areas  id be happy to incorporate some bigger changes to pos themselves if some good ideas are brainstormed but im also of the opinion that simply shifting some of the focus of territory warfare off of the pos will help lower the bar for entry and make territory warfare itself less of a grind feel free to give ideas for changes
i like the stargate capture mechanic but as i said about nonpos anchorable structures in another thread im skeptical that nonpos anchorable structures can be both balanced and usefula nonpos structure that gives significant bonuses would have to require fuel to remain balanced but this would mean that they would either need to have large fuel bays or require frequent refueling visits once you figure that there might be half a dozen or more of these in a system at once this gets pretty scary either theres a huge amount of fuel in storage just sitting around the system which makes those structures very expensive to lose  especially since these structures not being at a pos dont benefit from a poss defenses  or theres a lot of needlessly tedious frequent refueling trips going on

i could see special storyline missions from doing 16 rd agent missions give more people a reason to run missions for the rd agents
from another thread about capital mining ships thinking about it though why not some ships that cant enter high sec because  insert rp reason here  that has large bonuses to the low end roids maybe a script for normal mining lasers or a second module that can be set to lowsec or 00 only  similar to how cyno fields are blocked in high sec and warp bubbles arent allowed in low sec  have it only give bonuses to ore found above 5 or above 00 so that mining the big veld roids becomes practical in 00it was just a thought i had reading the quote above allows new ship classes to accomplish a lot without having to redo so much for mining

i agree that learning skills are a needless time sink and add nothing to the game  they are a tedium now to reduce more tedium later there is a broad consensus that all players should train them eventually whenever you do decide to train them  if you know youre in it for the long haul and train them up front or if you get slowly sucked into the game and train them late  theyre just time thats not spent training immediately applicable skills if they are eliminated all skills training time should reflect pilots having all learning skills at level 5 there is already a wide variety of obvious benefits that longtime pilots have by their own choices more money better standings better ships and equipment  including implants  and more skillseliminating learning skills is a great idea but very difficult to implement fairly to compensate older pilots who have foregone other skills to train the learning skills all the way up so honestly i dont expect that this is going to go anywhere
ya learning skills are lame and make starting out a boring pain in the ass but i already trained them i dont give a damn about new players so i dont care to see the devs spend time fixing this problem that they could instead spend on something i care about for myself todaypersonally i didnt even play for the first month on the advice of a friend i just timecarded the isk for the adv learning skillbooks and a set of 4 implants and switched skills until the character was ready to have fun with
also youre crazy if you think the elimination of learning skills will let you ultimately get to fun skills fasterccp has the learning skills in the game as a timesink the point of them is to keep you away from the fun skills for longer so that youll subscribe to the game for longer waiting to get to the fun skills the more time you spend subscribed the more money you pay ccpif they eliminate the learning skills they still wont do anything to help you get to the fun skills any faster
yea the older players have no idea they were given a pass and just skipped them yes the isk were coming out of our ears then so ccp implemented the bling patch and so i am sorry for your sufferingwhats a months worth of training any way you wouldnt mind tossing 12 mil sps away to support this cause would you i mean it is all for the best isnt itso thank you for your sage advice now get off my lawn before i whack you with my cane
good point you and hardin are doing good work on this issue which i very much appreciate so its unfair for me to say there are no people who understand about pvping in caldari ships amend my post to sadly i dont think theres a majority of caldari pvpersmy faith was severely rattled by the off hand manner in which the exhaustively well researched and presented nighthawk issue was dismissed its ok in pveits ok for ships to sucknot worthy of our time too small an issue
this is why threads that have already been taken up by the csm should be locked
ideally locked after posting a link to the minutes where the issue was discussed
i think ccps pricing is rediculious they need to get rid of that service pay by cash im one of the few people who still use cash to pay for games and when i renew my account using their pay by cash thing its flippin almost 20 bucks because of the charges that pay by cash uses ccp needs to get a better system running for that
so i ask to the csm please we beg you keep pushing this
okay 99 of people are going to hate this and kick off so im already expecting a major flaming for this post butsince when should capitals  particularly supercapitals  have the ability to cloak cloaking such a big ship should be impossible and the capacitor requirements of doing so should be enormous but no a titan can still sit 300km off a gate cloaked and sneakdd a hostile fleet  hi tcf  then recloak as soon as the dd is finishedso ive thought of a number of possible solutions to this  some would also resolve other issues with people fitting cloaks to every ship they have as well as sitting cloaked in an enemy system afk for hours 1  base the capacitor use of cloaks on the ships size andor mass bigger ships need more capacitor to cloak and will use a certain amount of capacitor over time a cruiser sized ship for example will use a medium amount of capacitor and the drain over time will be minimal so that in 90 of cruisers the natural regen will still give you more cap than youre using a bs sized ship will use a large amount of capacitor and will slowly drain cap over time  without any capacitor mods  a capital ship will use an enormous amount of capacitor to cloak  think 80  and will drain a large amount over time  lets say the capital can only stay cloaked for 10 minutes as an example ie not long enough for the pvp timer to wear off  a super capital will use about 90 of its cap to cloak and will only be able to cloak for a few minutes before draining completely a titan will only be able to cloak up for 12 minutes and will not be able to fire a dd then cloak straight away2  prevent supercapitals from using cloaks completely3  add in more penalties for cloaks for example not being able to fire a dd for 5 minutes after a decloak or not being able to use fighter drones for 5 minutes after a decloak4  change the fitting requirements based on sizemass of a ship so for example if you want to cloak your carrier you dont have the cpu to fit any remote reps or if you want to cloak your titan you cant fit a dd this means you would have to onlineoffline modules in order to use the cloak but everything would remain unchanged essentially just delaying you from decloaking pressing f1 to dd and cloaking back upcomparing to other universes putting a cloak on a titan is like cloaking a borg cube or the deathstar theres a reason they dont do this flame on
had an awesome post typed and his computer forgot itwithout rewriting all i had the solution isnt to nerf cloaks its to make them sized or to leave them alone1  cloaks dont use cap because they disable every other module onboard that both reflects the energy need being met as well as reduces any extra energy output the cloak has to work towards maskingbesides if we have to pay for cloaking then people would want to be able to fire while cloaked as it stands now the payment for cloaking is the lack of combat functions2  saying they cant be used period isnt fair unless sized modules were introduced then you could say that one is too small to work for this ship so fit a larger version3  cloaks already have penalties and the workaround has always been aoe and targetless weapons  drones fof etc 4  see sized abovespeaking of the death star star wars was the setting where they said no ship that size has a cloaking device which implied that only larger ships could support themwhereas star trek which has a lot more experience with such technologies take a look at a size comparison particularly the gigantic romulan warbird which can disappear at the drop of a hat that little speck at the bottom would be your frigate
 yeah i love this ing idea
yes
pun intended
i dont know what you mean with smallscal pvp but if you have a 5 bs gang and you face a 5 man nano gang the nanos dont have a chance if you lose that battle your doing something horribly wrong only way nano gangs can beat heavy gangs is to either bring more numbers or to take advantage of errors that the heavy gang does i think the problem is that you get blobbed by nano gangs and not nanos if you get swarmed by a nano gang the result would be the same if they were flying bs only difference is that you might kill one or two of them but youll still be outnumbered and loseif the gang knows what you are flying where you are and they dont want to fight you there is no way you can decisivly defeat them it doesent matter if they are flying nanos or not if they dont want to fight you cant defeat them i would suggest baiting them with a gang they will engage as first step in defeating the nano ganginterceptors is faster then nano hacs
definitely supported nanos are the new wcs the old wcs were nerfed because they let you start fights nearly risk free secure in the knowledge you could always bug out if things got bad  barring a ridiculous investment in counter ships nanos not only let you start fights nearly risk free secure in the knowledge you can always bug out if things go bad  barring a ridiculous investment in counter ships  but they also give you a superb tank against most forms of damage and let chase down other ships who might try to leave the engagement however any real change to nanos is going to need changes to capital hot dropping and blobs as right now nanos are the only real alternative theyre still very imbalanced however this is evidenced by the fact that their defenders typically deploy arguments such as but they cost a lot and just use other nano ships to kill them or driving off a nano ship counts as a win or other nonsensical hurf blurfisms a few limited changes could be made soon fix polcyarbons to bring them in line with all other rigs compared to their module equivalent and fix heavy precision missiles but i think major changes to nanos  which should be made as basically if youre not a blob or small nano gang you may as well go home  will involve a bit more thought and will hopefully include a fix to the terrible mwdab relationship
im mostly posting to mock jades terrible analogy to horse archers this is an issue that needs to be addressed because essentially nanos have no drawbacksthat doesnt mean they have no counters or are literally invincible just that you would be an idiot to not fly a nano in the current environmentmany other gang types and smaller ship sizes have been completely invalidated because of the overpoweredness of nanos with excellent tank and ability to engage at will and ability to disengage at willthe fact that t2 cruisers are flying around faster than t1 frigates i consider highly poor design and is obsoleting frigates we need a lot more distance between hulls in terms of speed wrayeth has made several excellent posts in this threadthe fact remains that anyone who has even the decaying carcass of a single brain cell left in his skull can tell that nanos have been terrible for gang diversity in eve and that nerfing them will be good for diversity and open up more choices for players however most nano pilots are very set in their ways and refuse to contemplate having to adapt to flying something other than their imbalanced nano ships

most definitely signed it gets truly annoying trying to figure out if someone is a pos hugger and i should just move on or if that ship on my scanner is actually unoccupied and the person im looking for is 20km off my starboard bow in a cloaked reconblack opsedit forgot to check the little box of doom
ships that arent under the control of a player shouldnt show up on the scanner period imo the minimal power usage wouldnt be found by anything short of howpowered probes or the over views close range sensors
it could be argued that cluttering a system with empty ships to hinder hostile scanning efforts is a valid counterintelligence tool though my initial reaction to this is that being able to filter empty ships from occupied ones makes scanning a little too easy and that if you want to know if a specific ship has been abandoned you should probe it out and get on grid to take a look for yourself
thats an interesting argument  have you ever tried to scan out a belt ratter in a hostile system with multiple pos though i wish i had some screenshots handy but ive actually seen cases where a 360 degree scan does not fit on one screen of the scanner  even expanded  yes you can narrow that scan down but often the moons and belts are close enough together that its virtually impossiblehere is another example you jump into a system and find a lone ship on the gate there are 4 hostiles in local but you decide to risk engaging anyway for fun you open the scanner and hit scan to see if there are any hostiles nearbybut oh look its useless because there is a pos nearby with 17 ships at iti can come up with other examples too but im sure you get the idea  being able to find abandoned ships with the scanner is good but being able to tell the abandoned from the occupied ones is essential
yay
this would most likely result in logged of ships no longer showing uphow would one get the loggofskis than
loggoffskiis ships are still occupied and so detectablebesides it should be a option to ignore unmaned ships
nah its fineid rather make a mark to see if it occupied instead of just removing unmanned ships from scanneror add some options to scannerapprovedcus something must be done
yes signed and all that
actually im in c9n right now and stain empire have empty ships in poss all over the damn place it helps to move around the system and incrementally adjust angles and ranges but yes its still difficult to find anything just with the directional scanner in that situationsome things should be difficult though especially if your opponent has taken time and effort to make it so again i think using empty ships to act as decoys is a pretty smart move and not something that should be disallowed especially when another means of figuring out which ships are empty and which are occupied  recon probe launcher and warping to look for yourself  already exists
make it an option
why no jump clone reduction timer with the inclusion of a skill reducing it by 5 or 10why ccp why24hrs is just bollox and make jump clones totally worthless for what they were meant in the first place  jumping in as reinforcement to a mothership titan or roqual they will just still be used only for implant storage
thorradin i absolutely agree with the rest of your post but the ferox  nighthawk comparison really isnt fair or accurate the nighthawk is essentially a tech ii drake not a tech ii ferox of course the numbers dont look much better when you compare it to a drake  shamelessly stolen from earlier in the thread hurricane 1350  sleipnir 1460 myrmidon 1175  astarte 1450harbinger 1500  absolution 1575drake 850  nighthawk 710  huge decrease wtf i can see no reason whatsoever why a tech ii ship should lose so much powergrid compared to its tech i version moreover this thread is full of excellent work by silence dueugood and gypsio and others comparing the fits and how the nighthawk is weaker due to needing to it way way more fitting mods that this was so summarily rejected at the csm is quite surprising  it was as if the issue wasnt even really considered at all i am glad that jade and hardin at least are on top of the game and that jade is doing good work trying to keep this issue alive
factories on planets that are the only place the bpos for building stuff like mechanical parts and robitics would be nice it would be kind of interesting to have a terrstiral industry that doesnt affect slots for manufacturing in space
well i posted a similar idea heremaybe the 2 ideas can be combined in something that it will be taken in considerations by the devs
all other types of turret have easier fittings on there short range variantsthe heavy assault launcher is the only one that is more difficult to fithere is a comparisonhybrid blaster v rail  18 range 55 more dps 10 easier grid fit  30 easier cpu fitprojectile arty v autocannon  17 range 35 more dps 78 easier grid fit  25 easier cpu fitlaser pulse v beam  50 range 14 more dps 19 easier grid fit  6 easier cpu fitmissile heavy assault v heavy  24 range 25 more dps 20 harder grid fit  11 easier cpu fitclearly this is a mistakebase grid for a heavy assult missile launcher tech i should be 80 grid not 120
this is true of all missile launchers it is a design thing
not truerockets are easier to fit than standard missiles while providing more dpssiege are harder to fit than cruise this might also need looking at   if so then thats a discussion for another thread  everything is by design  it does not mean its good design
you are both wrong nevertheless issue supported hams take too much grid to be viable options on most caldari missile boats its as though they were designed for amarr only
either that or boost the grid on the caldari missile boats  torps arent too bad really as you do get monster dps in exchange for using them but ham arent even that impressive for dps
hamls already require less cpu than hmls to make them require less grid as well would be absurd given their superiority over hmlsif there is a problem its do to with caldari pg the nighthawk unquestionably needs a significant pg buff the other ships drake pg is fine as is onyx  although i dont see the point of putting launchers on an onyx anyway caracal and cerberus could do with a smidgeon more pg though
currently they are 95 useless you only profit form them if you shoot torpedos on cruiser sized ships but these will die quick anywey without them target painters need serious rework make them useful like ecm and damps
mmmm tachys tracking on painted frigates ftw
i suggest that you learn how the tracking formula works then delete this rubbish
then why they are used only on torp ships rarly and nothing else devery pvper is dumb and you pro i suppouse nanoships got 600 signature and how you hit them d
how about we give target painters a bonus with no stacking penalties to improve the tracking of all ships shooting at a target
this would be better than this crap signature bonus
you missed the smilie it was there to indicate that is exactly what the effect of a target painter currently is
well signature helps tracking but by small margin so its not noticable it should be direct bonus
that is why you were refered to the tracking formula earliera 30 increase in your targets signature radius has the exact same effect as a 30 increase in your turrets tracking the effect is identicaledit as for you earlier question about nano ships increasing tracking via signature radius by 65x is only going to do so much when the ships speed is increased by 10x
the names of the t1 named painters abbreviate topwnpwndpwntand pwnagethat wasnt a mistake or coincidence in the right hands in the right situation painters are absolutely lethalin general use theyre averagein mission runner hands theyre pretty little icon like the predators tracking animation and about as dangerous as a pork sausagethey need no love at all
i support this as long as what you mean by not allowed is that it is made nonbeneficial by game mechanics
so punish indirectly the person who has to go in an emergency and cba to go 10 jumps back to a safe system no thanks
if you have an emergency in rl pixelboats should be your very least concern tbqfh
but thats not the point really is ityes an emergency in rl comes first  but then the emergency is over and you want to play pixelboats again and your pixelboat is all blowed up  not really fair
actually it was the rl emergency issue has always been misused as justification to please not harshen the ctrlq mechanics
i love how this is looked upon as an exploit and a grevious sinwhen there are other arguments taking place elsewhere about pirates wanting to do anything and everything in their power to force a player into pvpon one side players are not supposed to run away from a fight but on the other they shouldnt be forced into a playstyle so which is iti understand this tactic is most common at a low sec gate camp where they knew they were at risk before they jumped or in low sec belts where they wish to avoid confrontation while they mine so basically its happening in low sec where life should be dangerousbut i still think its amusing that people can cry for blood and ask for peace with the same breathone note however the idea of flagging a targetif you fire upon a ship they are not flagged at all you are flagged to them and you cant leave for 15 min but making a mechanic where you shoot them and they are bound to finish the fight is forcing a playstyle that mechanic would only mean that if i flip your ore and now you must fight me or die because the flag is on you too
so you basically think its ok that not playing the game provides an in game advantage gotcha its because of players with your attitude that this is a sorely needed fix cheaters should not prosper and you sir are one
you need to read up on pvp timers you are sadly misinformed the timer we are talking about already exists  if a fight starts and someone shoots you  whether you shoot back or not  then you havea 15 minute timerfor the next 15 minutes you stay in space even if you log offso you can warpdockcloakwhatever as normal but you cannot just logthe problem is if someone logs as soon as a hostile appears then they never get that timer triggered and are unkillable
every other mmo ever made has solved this issue with a logout timer the problem is that eves logout timer implementation is broken it is broken for 2 reasons1  you vanish 60 seconds after logging out if you dont have aggro this is just enough time for a skilled prober who was already looking for you to find you warp to you and get off one shot at you before you vanish this timer needs increased to 2 minutes to account for the time it takes to warp to the target2  you vanish regardless of the fact that people have caught you and are shooting you if someone has you locked you should not vanish periodthe other logout mechanic that every other mmo has but eve lacks is the ability to remain connected while the logout countdown runs so that if someone catches you before you log you have the chance to defend yourself
this has needed fixing for ages hell ive even got a thread about this elsewherefix logoffski
do you always charge into conversations without knowing what you are talking about or is this a new thing for you
not signedthe only defense i got is thiswhen i jump 2 losec with freiter wat do u expect me 2 do fight back

well i still love you even when you log on me there are lots of pirates who would cry like that garmon dude but im not one of them

get rid of logoffskis leave the pilot there for 30 seconds in my opinion and decloak any active cloaks then emergency warp after 30 seconds another 30 seconds and finally a proper log off
looks like there is some csm activity again so ill bump this one
agreedlike elite missions with high damage spawns hard to track frigates and cruiser uber tanked bs spawns with high gains something a corp could do together
sounds fun maybe boosting reward for missions when done in a groupnot sure how good this is but whatever
this thread is not for discussiong the merits of the different force recons but rather the one thing they have in common a fairly useless role bonusrole bonus  200unit reduction in liquid ozone consumption for cynosural field generation  50 reduction in cynosural field duration this is a fairly limited bonus1 it requires a capital ship2 the ship deploying the cynosural field is vulnrable for some timefairly limited bonus and i would say maybe mostly usefull when cynoing ships in for non combat stuff  jump frieghters however it is a expensive ship and it is put at risk when deploying the cyno especially if the cyno goes up close to the enemy fleet besides the other force recon bonuses are generally for long range actionnow i would admit that i got limited experience with 00 and the use of capitals in fleet but it is my understanding that recons arent used that much to cyno ships into combat if anyone wants to prove me wrong feel free to do somy suggestion would be to replace the current role bonus with a probing role bonus kinda like the covert ops havei would like to see something along the lines of50 reduction to cpu needed by probe launcher25 reduction to durationactivation time of modules requiring astrometricsthis would make force recons half as good in probing as covert ops ships and still viable in gangsoloit would slightly unnerf the arazu and pilgrim and maybe overpower the falconrapier as wellany thoughts
it seems just fine to me force recons get a cocd so they can get behind enemy lines easily enough and they can light off a cyno more inexpensively and with significantly less risk due to the reduced cycle time  than any other ship theyre capitalsupport ships that also get nice ewar bonuses im not sure how good they are at battlefield deployment of capital ships  you probably use ships with more hp to do that  but theyre unparalleled at strategic movement qualifier ive never flown a capital ship or a cyno generator this is secondhand and may not accurately reflect much of anything i think im right here but if anyone with more firsthand experience wants to correct me go for it
no as you say yourself you havent flown these in 00 or suchlike and it shows  the bonus is very usefulthe reduction in cycle time massively reduces the risks  if stuck at a safe  and tedium  if stuck at a pos  and the fuel consumption bonus is hugeits a role bonus as well so it isnt like you are losing a ship bonus to get this one
its a nice bonus to have and doesnt need change at all
nah rather add a deep space recon  or something  with a astrometrics bonus instead of a combat or cyno bonus that should be about the biggest astrometrics ship around unless the black ops gets a bastard brother
id rather see the cycle time bonus be a no movement penalty bonus that would allow the recon to remain safe and not be annoyingly stuck without reducing the time the enemy has to notice that you have thrown up a cyno and come to investigate possibly catching the capital that jumped in but not finding a totally stuck and defenseless recon
no one lights a cyno in an expensive shipits like ringing a dinner bell to pirates and enemiesand youre stuck there at a warpable object for five minutesmight as well be 5 yearspeople mostly use ruptures
fairly useless for me but i guess its too much of a integral part of the ship then id rather see a dedicated cyno ship tough tbh
its a free role bonus  its not as though its taking up a ship bonus slot  like the assault frig and its resistance bonuses  and being able to light a quick cyno and not needing to restock on ozone each time is extremely useful for getting caps moved aroundbesides giving recons the probing bonuses would be a big step towards making covert ops obsolete whereas at least now there is a niche for covops frigates as greatly superior probers
well for starters youve got the bonus wrongrole bonus 80 reduction in liquid ozone consumption for cynosural field generation and 50 reduction in cynosural field durationsecondly its fine it doesnt detract from these ships at all  they still get the traditional 4 bonuses that a a t2 cruiser gets being able to cyno stuff around with only 60 lo is very handy as too is the ability to not be stuck somewhere for 10 minutes its handy if youve a need for it and completely irrelevant if you dont so just ignore it mkayabout all i would say is that it might be nice if were a larger reduction in cyno time
agreed which is why i dont want to change them much i think theyre balanced a bit below gallente and minmatar so i want to give them a small buff that could happen but then you either have them tracking so slow they can be hit by turrets easily or moving so fast that missiles are useless against them hp has a similar effect without as many odd interactions
amarr drones should get a buff to make them the toughest to kill if there not there allreadycaldari drones should orbit at much bigger ranges leaving them outside bomb range for there class smallmediumlarge
only working ewar drones are ecm ones other are uselessweb drones they count as heavy 5 of these will lower target to 50 speed thx to stacking panelty one gives 30 no mediumlight ones if heavy web drones have 60 medium 40 light 25 they probably woudld work nice new light web drones could help vs nano shipsenergy neutralizing drones 2 heavy works like 1 small neutralizer well its so low amout 2 ogresberskers will do job better if 5 heavy drones would work ilke 12 heavy neutralzier people would consider using themsensor dampening and tracking dmapening droens would be ncie if they werent that stacking panelised liek they are nowtarget painters drones well target painting is preaty useless so droens must be to
target painter drones work pretty well on torp raven setups i dont know of anything else where they are very good though but just saying
nerf ecm drones to the uselessness of the rest rather than boost the resti dont see why as a gallente i get to enjoy the benefits of high class ewar on nearly every ship i fly while others barely get the opportunity to use any ewar at all without taking a specialised ship in the gang
notsignedtheres no true fix for this issue because youre just going to punish those with bad connections andor people having a bad day with their isptraceroute
not true1 add small timer before warp off i 5 seconds timer for example2 want to log off in space warp to safe log by using the normal procedure of ctrlq or escquit timer is small enough to not allow to be scanned or warp in on top3 game disconnects no timer is applied4 aggression mechanics remain as they are with no additional timerabout point 2 a  warp into a camp b  jump into a campc  stay in belt untill pirates warp on top of youd  similar situations of this typein these cases quitting the game in panic by pressing ctrlq will trigger the timer thus allwoing for the enemy to target you and scrambleabout point 3people can fake disconnects but in pvp it is realistic to say people will not jump on the desk to unplug the cable the simple fact of moving yourself form the gamepc to unplug or turn off your modem gives enough time to the attackers to target and scrabmle you  exceptions do apply but please consider the reduced number what this can not fix people ratting in systems and logging off when an enemy gang jumps in but this is not a direct pvp situation direct pvp situations will be fixed by this small timer or at least this is a step forward
the router for my computer is by my feet it would take me 5 seconds to lean down and pull out the power supply people who are prepared to cheat using crtl q will just set up another way to do iti think a 5 second delay before warping off sounds ok  but there is a bigger problem  litterally it can take a carrier or mothership 2 minutes to get into warp they can be probed out in 20 seconds if shooting them triggered the 15 minute timer you would never be able to log off in one againi suggest either that if you log while cloaked you would just sit under cloak for 2 minutes then log  rather than decloaking and warping  orwhen you logctrl qdisconnectwhatever there is a 10 second delayduring that time you start to emergency warp  decloak from gate cloak etc  and if you are attacked it starts the 15 minute timeronce the 10 seconds is up then you are logged off and the current mechanics go on as nowthe other thing i would like to see fixed is the multi relog thing  where you log off then log on then off then on againyou will end up at an instasafe 10k km from where you first logged instead the relogin should remember the destination of the emergency warp it was in and immediately send you back to the same place

at the moment i fly a marauder in missions among other things  which means i have salvaging and killing both going on at the same time in so doing ive been constantly annoyed by the fact that wrecks dont show any information about their tracking their radial velocity or  in situations with multiple people looting a room  velocity i want to be able to see at a glance if the can is being tractored whether im getting closer to it or farther from it and while tracking is very rarely useful i imagine theres some situations where loot gets shot in pvp to make it worth the time to have it show up similarly all other objects on overview that are on grid should have the same stats  i dont think anyone cares about how fast a stargate 14 au away is tracking but if its possible to interact with it other than via warp then it should be possible to see all the information relevant to doing so some people may not like this because it makes it harder to tell apart targets and wrecks and as such this should probably be made an option rather than a forced change that said it should be an option because i cant imagine im the only one who would use it
i run missions in groups this would help speed up our cleaning up efforts
100 totally support this idea this needs to be addressed
edit due to beerthats not itcaod is  has become loooong ago  the place for 00 warfarepoliticspropagandafw is not 00 warfarepoliticspropagandacaod is also comprised of 90 alt posting  im gulity of a few no alt tho  and we do not need any additions to itwhat im saying is that fw needs its own forum as there is no relationship between 00 and fwi am not saying fw sucks or anythingi am saying  and alot of others  that we 00 entitys just do not give a fsck about fw  generalization ftw 
i like you ill hit you up ingameif i cant login now ill try when sober if i rememberoo
actually i was talking about my hobby of crushing ty empire alliances with mercenaries i believe there are numerouls lulz threads about itps you are a spineless coward hiding behind an alt whos opinion matters for moot and i really dont understand this new cow fetish tbh it failed sure but the truly pathetic fail happened long after a war left either way post on your main and perhaps you will be taken seriously and maybe i can show you in person what i meant with what i wrote above
the only reason i actually participate in fw is the fact that there are no leaders no one cares in fw  i mean seriously no one cares cause their is nothing to lose except ones own ship your faction loses the war  who cares no one really loses anything  fw is a place for noobs to learn what pvp is like without the threat of omfg cta now or you get kicked from alliance rawr and those of us who have been in 00 done mission ing shot miners in low sec and just need something new sure fw loses alot of the appeal after the 101st gate camp  but hell its still better then some jk arse crying cause no one showed up for the planned defence gang or alliance mining opid say leave it be for now
fairly accurate i guess trying to create an effective alliance out of fw corpsplayers would only be an exercise in futility fw is a cool idea but was always going to lose its shine for older more experienced players the sheer number of noobs and egos was always going to make sure of that having said that it is also a great avenue for budding pvpers to learn the craftto the op  once it was moved to here the threads fate was sealed stop crying and whining and organise your own gangs and teams and just do itedited psone word of advice is to stay away from the noob gate camps and set yourselves realistic goals and focus your efforts on these  it might just pay off
lmao

oshii salute you good sir
caod quality thread
highlighted the parts i found particularly interesting fw was supposed to be designed as a training ground bridge to pvp and 00 and its succeeding at that raw nublets are being trained up and are becoming quite skilled sure there are still alot of lolfits and ty comms discipline on some ops but ive been on worse in 00 ive also seen quite a few alts of 00 chars recruiting from fw militias  well at least thats whats going on in the fdu secondly the idea that you represent all of 00 is laughable or that there is even a consensus of 00 people or for that matter that caod forum warriors represents said consensus the fact that so many people i know from 00 corps are in fw now clearly conflicts with the idea that people dont care about it maybe you dont but thats something else entirelyi agree with you that fw needs its own seperate forum though not because fw has nothing to do with 00 the real eve but because i would hate to see people get turned off getting involved in arguably the best expansiondirection ccp has taken eve because of all the postssmacktards in caod
as an older more experienced player i can say i have never had more fun playing eve my rl does not allow for alliance crap atm so i log on go solo or join a small gang and combat is never more than a few jumps away there are a lot of vets who lub combat but dont have the rl time to do so fw is the ultimate vehicle to do so noobs yeah there are all in bigassed fleets learning the ropes the vets are out there having fun in one on one i have been in seven alliances  even a few good ones  and none compare to the funlevel fw offersathon
i guess factional warfare is awsome for those who doesnt enjoy pos warfare
not as simple as that  originally npc 00 was meant to be that bridge and tbh it meets it admirably still  syndicate is just a crapload of fun  by and large without pos warfare as wellits just horses for courses i guess
factional warfare more like fictional warfare wheres the fun in following some random fc at risk of losing your ships all over a bunch of fluff written by ccp

oh right so a corp that war decs you just coz they can is a good reason to die have a think about the fluff that is dribbling from your mouth
ja its conscious choice made by a group of corporate pirates not a conflict invented by the game makers you know the opposite to player politics and immersion of which had previously made eve so unique and unlike any other games
in the agregate i can say thats a crock of  the only ones successful in fw are the ones who had any idea what they were doing before fw fw serves to turn new players or lifelong carebears onto pvp and make them seek out ways to get better because they certainly arent going to recieve any quality instruction in the laggy cluster that is the current iteration of fw
caldari milita is full of stupid carebears its 1000000000 times worse to get them to work together than to herd cats

what tactics do you needfollow the minmatar example  beat the  out of your enemies and when they run to highsec for a few days to lick their wounds take their systemsrepeat as necessaryps ccp your forum filter fails hard 
first of all has anyone done a barrel rollsecondly this thread needs more desu desu desu desu desu desuthird i am an fc and will be running small suicide gangs fit cheap obey my orders and we will kill stuff you will die we will go out again  yes i run fleets just like angelonico however i wont call you a ot if you screw up or otherwise  me off ill just order the fleet to primary you and send you home in a pod instead im open to participating wherever i can in militia time allowing we dont need leadership like a 00 alliance with the mandatory ops but we do need leadership in order to have coordination
less forum poasting and moar undocking from squids and slave fondlers please move your ships to the designated kerplosion areas
i have only been in a single fleet so far thanks to being too lazy to log in these days but it was awesomea rag tag pile of  caldari fleet jump 6 jumps and a rag tag bunch of  gallenteminny fleet warp to our gate and the fight beginsminutes later the field is full of the corpses of few month old chars and their civilian fitted riftersflying in mobs is far more entertaining than flying with any form of structure anyway what you are suggesting is totally pointless unless you have the entire militia join a bunch of corps adding structure to what is essentially a mob of alts and new players is a job that is beyond the reach of anyone in eve imoif you want to make an impact then get into a corp with about 20 motivated people and you could probably do more damage in a shorter time than you could if you tried to organise this lot
try advertising this to the fellow militia corps you should get the ceos to join a channel or mailing list announcing specific ops and where to meet ship types etc have everyone grouped up in certain squads things like sniper squads tacklers electronic warfare etc make use of eve voice require it for your fleet  we all know everyone has it  i imagine organizing such a large group of people would be a nightmare but if you can advertise this better to the militia you might gain support the only thing you will gain from caod is a headache because people here are not capable of providing information and support
sorry to say but forming up a fleet for 3 and 12 hours and watching your corpies get ganked by star fraction wasent fun for me at all neither was the part when one of your corpies was begging people in the militia for a free raven because he didnt wanna risk losing his domianyways the taco fleets are kinda cool just just a suggestion form up the fleets quicker and tell your corp mate to leave begging for free ships and mods for corp chat and stop the recruitemnt spam in militiadarth

youll never be able to impose organization  even your bad version thereof  on a random collection of people with no stake in what youre selling you can by force of will beat it into some people for a little while but beyond that you are shouting in the windif you actually want to be successful form your own corporation recruit the people you met in fw that were enjoyable and build a group that fights together and cares about itself treating fw like an alliance is like signing up to join the biggest crppiest alliance youve ever experienced i cant think why youd have wanted to do that before fw i cant see why youd want to now
for someone who loathes 00 alliance politics pos warfare and needing to clear a 2 hour chunk of time just to pvp fw is wonderful im enjoying it so far no need to form up a blob to do something no fc pitching a fit about participation no 30 jumps just to not find a target its great for someone who likes to fight doesnt have the time to travel halfway across the galaxy for a target and can get low sec pvp in without having a sec status hit or requiring sentrytankingits kinda nice having a war with lots of targets no stationcamping  that ive seen  and a nice mix of engagementsme waves at an old enemy posting above
adding leadership to fw will never work for 3 reasons1leaders have no actual control over the fw blocks they cant kick or demote or remove roles from anyone2leaders have no control over the quality of players in their group fw is automatically the lowest common denominator of the worst pilots available3fw groups have no ability to build infrastructure or claim space or build supercapitals as alliances canquality leaders are near impossible to find even when those qualities are met why would leaders flock to the opportunity to be impotent and herd cats sounds like a job made of suck to me
first off i know im being bad by posting here we try to stay off this forum as much as possiblesecond seems people do want a fleet instead of a blob i remember all the ridicule that idea got people claiming there was no difference well there is a huge difference and the effects can clearly be seen in these fw battlesthe rest of our leadership might shoot me for this but the only way you are going to end up with a fleet is by putting some work in ahead of timei am normally against revealing anything that the uni teaches to outsiders but i think i will in this one instance its not like all the spies were riddled with cannot find it out anyway so if you really want a fleet and not a blobits going to take effort on the part of the would be leaders to make it happen i believe even with a pick up gang you can use this information to form an organized group as opposed to a budged up moba few more details on the scwc partwc  has the wing commander skill when called for would put wc into alliancemilitia the skill level this lets the fc know how many squads that wing commander can pass bonuses to sc  squad commander  in militia cases i would simply call for people with leadership 5 to ensure they can pass bonuses to a full squadthis has been a gift to eve online from eve university enjoysilentbrickfleet admiralivy league
qftop has no idea about strategy or hierarchymove along nothing to see
wrongoif you and pilot b are engaged in pvp and pilot a blows up pilot bs ship and pilot c comes along and loots pilot bs wreck he is not flagged to you whatsoeverso by that statement if we were to attribute the same rules to mission runners killing npc rats  see consistency  then if someone entered the mission deadspace and looted the wrecks you would not get aggro on them eitherwant it to change in that respect its a sound argument if were basing things on commonality
if someone entered the mission deadspace and looted the wrecks you will get aggro on them only if they salvage the wrecks you have created by shooting the npc ships you do not get aggro on them  see inconsistency 
thank you for making my argument for me  obviously you didnt see what i was saying and thus provided more proof to my statement bravo 
it cant be theft if it doesnt belong to you im really not sure how many ways to say this unlike loot wrecks do not belong to you if ccp changes this  which seems unlikely  then you can call it theft but just because you want it to be theft that doesnt mean it is
i just fixed your incorrect accusation and you do have a lot of them in almost in every post you make about ninja salvaging since you keep yapping about consistency you should know what inconsistency means and when there is inconsistency it should be fixed those two actions above need to both be aggro flagged or there would be inconsistency
nerf whiners 0
this tbh
huh if whiney noobs will get learning skills removed ill demand five month worth of skillpoints reimbursed doh
funny
this
im not so much in favor of that for one thing i think more time will be spent arguing whether something is or is not the exact same change and whether or not genuinely new information has become available that would be spent on a straight up or down vote if it truly is a recycled issue that was convincingly voted down last time by an informed csm then it should take a few seconds to deal with it the same way the second time but more importantly there have been multiple issues i felt the csm didnt give anywhere near appropriate attention to but simply dismissed out of hand as not impacting their own playstyle much the nighthawk pg and larger exploration hull vessels come to mind i am very much against those issues not being able to be raised again simply because a majority of the csm couldnt be bothered to educate themselves on the issues at hand
i remember seeing a csm answer on this too  maybe it was on the shc forums
the dread is fine the citadel torps need looking into
im amazed there isnt an automated ingame killboardthe game already knows who loses or kills what why is there not an ingame bord that displays minimal intel like this
o7 pitbossfrom your original postany chance you could remove the if it is just salvage part i think its confused more than a few people who are thinking that your request has something to do with salvage aggrojust a question from an interested party for obvious reasons

this i just wanted to add some thoughtsi know i dont represent the regular eve player  im more than 30 years old with a family and lots of obligations and im a casual player  i also know that ccp has always wanted people to do pvp that thats the soul of the game not having a queue has only brought frustration to achieve thati feel that i cant catch more experienced players that i will never have the skills to do proper pvpeve is a complex game it takes a lot of time to understant it it takes a lot of time to know what you want to do and how to do it and it takes time to reach a reasonable level to do what you want to do id like to develop my character in order to have fun to do pvp to go to 00 but you dont do that so easily or fast you need time and experience and a good level that takes time to achievei dont have much time to play sometimes i can sit behind the pc when my kid is sleeping and play a little sometimes i can sacrifice a couple of hours of a weekend to play eve i try to play when i have a chance but its really obnoxious to be forced to turn the pc on and enter the game just to change a skill and if i dont do that i will end up with big learning gaps falling behind the other players feeling unable to reach that pvp goal i have set to myselfa queue will be very nice but i believe that escalating just one skill from lvl 1 to lvl 5 will be enough i dont know why we casual players are being punished so hard for not having time to connect that often that only leads to frustration and that feeling that pvp is very far that youll never be able to play the game as intendedill keep playing the game trying to do my best but without some kind of help  be it a queue or the ability to lear a skill to lvl 5 straight  i think ill be a carebear for a very long time and thats not what i wanted to do in eve and i dont think ccp wants that eitherjust my two cents
yes give us a skill queue the only limit i see that would be important is to have skills stop training after 24 hours to a week after a subscription hasnt been paid afaik you can set some of those crazy long skills and come back in two months and have them train the whole timewhat i really want to see is all characters on my account skill train but of course you ccp  like me paying for 3 accounts to actually have 3 viable characters any other mmo you have multiple character slots that arent gimped because you can only level one of them
i like this idea
i would do rank 3 and decrease by 10 per level for the total of 50 at l5 or 12 hrs still anything that decreases jc time is good i support it i think 24 is a bit long not to mention the standings needed to get the damned thing in the first place
not needed ill make use of jump clones as they are available but i dont particularly like the gameplay they encourage prejump clone implants were a long term investment and you had to think about which were best suited to your gameplaydecreasing the timer between jumps would only promote hopping between different hardwiring sets for different ships and would further reduce pvp risk by making it easier for people to jump into a low value clone temporarily

 signed for a 12h durationcritical to any kind of 00empire coordination not involving alts imho the less alts the better
im in favor of a skill to decrease cooldown after jump clonesim not in favor of a skill to increase the jump clone count but thats not what is being proposed here  
not sure the specifics should be nailed down yet but i support the general idea a way to reduce your jump clone turn around
whats the point of having it as a skill  why not just reduce the time it takes to jump clone to something sensable like 12  18 hrstheres no point in having a skill for the sake of having another skills to learn
i agree with this completely there is no real call for such a long duration betweenfor one thing this story from the chronicles makes reference to the main character attending a meeting in the morning then surfing in the afternoon and having dinner that evening all in different locations thats at least 3 jc hops in a single day not counting where he was before the meeting or after dinneri really dont think we need to justify having a shorter timer with yet another skill it wouldnt be an option some people could take it would be heres what else you need for a jump clonefor ideas like this i always keep one thing in mind people dont want variety they want the bestas for more jump clones how many sets of implants do you need
comon guys vote this we really need more people to make ccp realise jump clones now are just implant storage devices and not actually being used as intended we need at least something that reduces the jump time up to 50
supporting with even more time modifier per level at lvl 5 it should be around 1 hour between jumps this is one of the many slow down feature of eve that i dislike

nope you can still accept contracts for wars the mechanics are being changed due to misues of the systemsyou will have a period of time while folks adapt to them
nerfing mercs will only increase suicide gankssmart bombings because thats the only way people will be able to deal with a corp thief or someone bothering them
its not a nerf by adding terms if would actually help a mercif your contract is do x amount of damage to corp 1 or cost them that much isk in paying off the contractthen you declare war with the terms set to x amount of damage or payoff and can set it so your wardec terminates if you take y amount of damage  based off your contract you still get to play merc and declare war on corporations
i think another option would be to add a bulk transport class shipinstead of a the deep space transports tank it has a cargo bonustake an interon v hull for instance and increase the cargo base by 2x normal keep the slot layout and allow both the industrial and transports skills to apply to cargo bonuses  std 5 per lvl but 10 per level for transports skill would really give an incentive to train up the transports skills so using the interon as an example 12000m3 base cargogal industrial v  25  15000 m3transports v  50 more  22500 m3with 5 cargo expanders 7581122 m3  pair of t1 cargo rigs 10026034m3 if i did my math right 
whats needed most is a ship thats more mobile and less expensive than a freighter can carry more than a standard dst riggedmodded out to its max and features enough options to not require four empirespecific models just to complicate life on par with the speed and agility of an exhumerholds exactly 1 cargo container  120m3 warps at 2aus features a slot configuration of 101 for a cloak and wcs or istab priced at 250m this would be a welcome addition to the smalltomedium industrialtrade segment
i still think that invention should slowly catch up or even surpass t2 bpos but that could be a long processmy suggestion would be that ccp modify the data interfaces let them slowly get better through use thus enabling dedicated industrial players who were never fortunate enough to get a t2 bpo or who started after the lottery had already ended to eventually catch upor in practical terms what would happen if interfaces had a some chance  say 1  of getting an improvement after each succesful invention attempt for example they could get a 1 bonus to the me or the pe of every subsequent invention or a 1 successchance or a 10 to the number of runs that an invention attempt produces over a long period of time and at considerable cost the interfaces would get better and better eventually ending up equal to bpos
well i think one of the main problems at the moment is that invention may have reduced a lot of the profits on t2 ships for t2 producers but they have also caused a huge increase in the price of moonminerals partially of course is that due to higher demand because of lower prices but another big element is that invention with its low me consumes far more t2 components than a t2 bpo which also makes it impossible for inventors to ever compete with t2 bpo holders on price that is something one could call unfair since invention certainly for individual players can be quite costly and risky  what if you fail 25 hulk invention jobs in a row  is thus a lot less profitable than the moneyprinting machine that quite a few bpos still are which dont have the associated risk of failing a lot of inventionjobs in a row
to get industrialists out of highsec there has to be appreciable benefits for doing their business in lowsec one idea id tossed around is to allow for named t1 bpcs to be dropped from officers in lowsec that may only be assembled in lowsec stationsposes this would correspond with a reduction in named t1 loot being dropped by rats in nonzero spacethis would also provide a boost to the courier industry as more of the components would need to be shipped out of lowsec and delivered to major trade hubs to contrast it could also increase the economy of lowsec as more traffic is drawn to stations where the named mods are being manufactured and sold at a lower cost due to a reduction in shipping risks moving manufacturing to lowsec could also invert the current market hierarchy since market hubs typically offer much lower prices due to volume and competition while lowsec systems are known for price gouging due to increased risk
the biggest problem with 1400mm arties in a fleet fight is its ammo capactiyonce the lag monster shows up you dont get to reload anymore therefore your 12 rounds of tremor l per gun are all you get to shoot at the enemy a buff up to 24 rounds with a slight increase in cycle time to keep dps the same would be very beneficial
i agree that they should be looked at however i would be surprised if ccp agree to boost their alpha strike significantly considering oveurs past stance that the importance of alpha strike had to be degraded
is there a subcap instadamage strong alpha shipsupport lowering rof and raise damage to compensate trade some of the weakness for extra strength in the alpha  also softens the clip issue but really shouldnt matter to an alphastrike boat against raising rof rof is about dps and this issue is related to the 1400mm arty losing its place in the sun not needing to be the best piece of longrange weaponry for fleet slugfestsupport damage increase in general increased damage helps with dps but mainly is about increasing the alphasupport giving maelstrom a damage bonus instead of a rof bonus making it fit its racial turrets strong points bettertempest or maelstrom should be able to outalpha an abaddon as it stands they cant and the paladin actually takes the bs crown but doubt it would get used this wayin order for minis to be good hitandrun attackers they need their alpha strike capability fit them with inertia stabs polycarbs cloaks and sensor boosters they cant survive any time in the overview at all but would have the capability to hitandrun against superior numbers which would go a long way to providing a tactical solution for a smaller force to attack a larger fleet
i read back through the hp increase thread oveurs stance was essentially that longer combat is more interesting and reducing the ability to alpha down another ship is a solution to instagank combat which was horridly in favor of the attackerthis was before the 25 hp buff and damage mod stacking penalties had been implemented while i can understand oveurs stance that ships shouldnt be getting alphaganked on the grounds that it essentially avoids engaging in any real sense of the word in favor of a complete hitandrun attack that leaves no options to the defender i must point out other qualities of alphagank combatwhile sufficient firepower to alphagank can allow an attacker to destroy one target and repeatedly reengage always with the advantage of high alphastrike the fact remains that they must reengage repeatedly to continue scoring victories meaning that the defender has not chosen to flee while the attacker disengagedin addition while the mechanics of alphagank lead to quick victories over lone targets with no chance for a flatfooted defender to respond when outnumbered by enough ships to be alphaganked the case is usually that they were completely screwed to begin with alphastrike or not they didnt have a prayerfurthermore the alphagank maneuver being balanced against lower dps after the first volley is a combat tactic that can only work by repeatedly reengaging even at the fleet level making it absolutely unfavorable for a fleet focused on strong alphastrike ships to remain engaged and providing opportunities for escape high dps gangs are for overview domination combat where you desire to stay engaged as much as possible fully aware that the enemy will fall behind quickly and become routedthe obvious balance inherent in mechanics and strategy is that a fleet for protecting capships will focus on dps since they do not have the capability to disengage quickly whereas a fleet that is not fielding capships  a non sovereignty changing fleet  would be better served to focus on alphastrike capability and mobilityhighalpha gangs  which by nature of the size of alphas required have a maximum number of ships in a unit that can contribute  can be a workable strategy even with inferior numbers and will also function well with separate units in your fleet instead of one huge blobin conclusion because of the stance of ccp that the hp buff would make battle more interesting and since ccp has so far left alphastrikes in a state of underbalance they must in fact believe that large dps gangs which must operate as a single large blob unit engage continuously favor the deployment of capital fleets and attempt to dominate the overview are in fact more interesting than splitting up and using tactical maneuvers that require more thought than be bigger than my enemyi have to ask a single rhetorical question summing up the most obvious contradiction in ccps stance if the alphastrike was supposed to be nerfed to make combat more interesting why is it that there is a ship in this game whose sole combat role is to deliver an alphastrike powerful enough to wipe out every ship on overview with less than 75k ehpi rest my caseill reiterate i support a strong buff of the artillery as an alphastrike weapon with no stacking bonuses on damage mods anymore it needs a large damage buff to pull ahead of other weapon systems the tradeoff is lower dps through slower rof and a consequential need to reengage to remain tactically favorable forcing artillery users namely the minmitar bss  of course  to act as hitandrun fighters i think it entirely appropriate in this game and the behavior to be expected of the race that was supposed to have fought a rebellion against a technologically and militarily superior empireU7D42U308FU308A

i am new to the game and i am also fairly new at rp but i agree that there needs to be more background on the third bloodlines for instance my character is an achur so i went to the saisio system to have a look at the planets well not one of them can support human life so if the achurs hail from there they must have lived in domed cities and space stations wich means they originated from elsewhere in the first placesigned
that changes the mechanics of it but it doesnt change my objection you dont need interbus to protect you from theft this is the purpose of collateral if you want to make courier contracts be interbus missions and give standing and then have an option for the paranoid to put a minimum interbus standing on their courier im fine with that in principle though i wonder how itd interact with the npc agents interbus has  but there should be no forced limits on people doing couriers  i dont want people being barred from accepting my contract when they have the ability to carry it out just because theyre lacking npc standings i dont care if theyre 10 to every corp in the game i want them to either get my stuff moved or pay me the collateral and i dont much care which  also what happens if it was an officer mod worth over a billion what if i want to entrust a titan bpo to a courier contract put down 63b and ill let you carry it for me gladly deliver it or i buy a new one and come out a halfbillion ahead  no skin off my back i dont need interbus to protect me the collateral section is already there
so were agreed that wed like to see more functionality in the contract systemhearing your arguements concerning the manditory collateral caps has convinced me that that part of the idea wasnt such a good idea so that can be quietly dropped i do like the idea of the contract creator being able to set a minimum interbus standing to accept his contractso for this ideapros you know precicely what youre hauling so can easily determine if the collateral set is reasonable for the cargo anonimity protects both parties in the contract hauler has no idea who hes hauling for contractor has no idea as to whos accepted the contract would make it much quicker for setting up large contracts with multiple items to multiple destinations would allow people a way to build up faction standings with interbus with a knock on effect with derived standings something people have been asking for as a way of digging their characters out of a standings pit with various factionscons would require a major overhaul of the contract system these arent simple changes scams would be harder to pull off as it would be easier to spot them would only really work for courier contracts other parts of the contract system would need their own fixes
this is a great idea
sure as long as you make it so that i can have my evemail autoforward to my real email and my real email mail people in game without truncation or loss of formatting that is either that or you could just give us a real mail client ingame and save everybody the trouble
definitely support thisthe evemail client badly needs some upgrading in both functionality and its interface something equal to a basic late last century email client would suffice

i ran them because they are a very fast way to get storyline agents and storylines are the only ones that grant faction boosts you can get a decent ship loaded with several missions all in a nearby area and run 56 couriers in about 20 minutes with good luck
absolutely but name me a game that doesnt you wouldnt be here if it existed you keep talking risk vs reward but what about time and effort fun isnt math not for everyone you keep trying to quantify it with math well run the numbers on minmatar arty minmatar and caldari ships and missiles they all suck everyone knows they suck the devs the pirates the carebears and even the low secers you know why they are not being changed because people come here and  about every change ever made to the game without caring what the consequences are for the entire population base its their way or the highway 99 of the time the few people that have rational arguments always get drummed out by stupid crap like 300 comments 30 supporting votes 10 hello kitty online thats not an argument thats just another person griping because you cant argue back this is absolutely about stopping it half of the detractors here use alt mining to support 0 corps without being wardecable as an excuse to have suicide ganking be so easy there should always be a risk of pvp in eve and it shouldnt be a pain in the neck but it is so if you dont like it go play pew pew with the other pvpers or get ccp to fix the source of the problem only if they are in a safe npc corp fix that and you fix the problem suicide ganking will still be too easy and will probably be easier than actually war decing a valid target as it is wanting to pvp doesnt get your ship blown up pvping in a way ccp has deemed in appropriate to the growth of its customer base does youre the one that chooses to do it if its not paying do something else just because you want to gank people 237 and make a fortune doing it doesnt mean its going to happen there are people who like hack and slash games and then there are people who like first person shooters the people who play first person shooter games get laughed out of the game by the devs and the community alike when they want a chaingun for their lvl 36 palidin people who want a sword are almost always welcome in first person shooter games because bringing a sword to a gun fight rarely works out for the swinger youre asking for something that not outside the realm of the game is outside the realm of the intent of the game ganking easy targets is what you want or else you wouldnt be here discussing this as i said he cant do it alone but dont let that stand in your way
your argument would make sense if you never did mission that were any harder which he can do lvl 1s forever if thats what he wants to do in fact i could do lvl 3s without a fear in the world except a gank and make a fortune compared to how well i can mine i am way under selling my time skill and money that i have invested in skills ships modules and experience though the risk reward in your equasion means that because i can infinitely run lvl 3s and makes 5 or so million an hour you should be able to pvp and make the same well i bet you can in fact i bet you can make way more than that the difference is you would have to be pvping sure fire wins every single time then you would have to be salvaging their wrecks and looting their cans to make your cash remember i dont do this in missions  the problem is you choose to do something inherently riskier that you are not capable of doing at the same level i am capable of doing my stuff at and want an equal reward all things being equal 4 months into a game your going to be running 3s solo and making less than 5 mil an hour unless your salvaging and looting a pirate can have a suicide rigged ship 4 months into the game and make way more than 5 mill an hour if he picks his targets right because if insurance missions get pretty tricky unless your willing to risk a setup with mods worth more than your ship because my corps m8s have been ganked for having an xlarge gisti x type shield booster installed in a raven with everything else being tech ii why because even 10 battleships getting nailed by concord would be a drop in the bucket compared to looting that module because of insurance risk vs reward is dead on if you pick your targets just because there isnt a ton of people out their worth killing to you doesnt mean there isnt a ton of people out there worth killing they just might take more effort than you are willing to give
it does not protect stupid people if insurance payouts would be removed it would protect people with less than 100 million in cargo today people get ganked if they have stuff above 10 million or is it stupid to exit jita 44 with anything above 10m in cargo because we are not only talking about hauling stuff afk herestupid people would still be ganked just as long as they carry stupid amounts of valuable cargo in their hold the same desired targets as always
but they would have to work and scan the targets rather than shooting anything that looks promising
this thread is still no more than people discussing the best way to fight symptomsthe root cause is the ability to stay in an npc corp to avoid the war declaration mechanic and with no real penalty and it is that which is unbalancedwhen that situation is addressed then ill be all in favour of a big nerf to suicide ganking doing anything before that only skews the game balance further towards those who abuse the free protection meant for newer players
so what happens when all of them form 1 man corporations then you can target one but that leaves the others operating just fine people would be wasting isk trying to catch them all with wardecs for no actual successif they wanted to they would make the war mutual and leave an alt holding it open while forming a new corp for the main costing you more isk in the long run for future wardecs  or locking a corps limited wardecs 
chessenjoyment of an activity can be done even if it has flaws for example i enjoy spicy food but my body has a natural flaw that makes it almost intolerable and yet i find myself chewing through the pain similarly i like spaceships and shooting things and i just chew through the annoyanceswhen you design a game you make game decisions and you hope the players have fun some decisions sound like good ideas until put into play some decisions sound like terrible ideas until put into play thats the reality and its okay as long as you keep an open mind to refine your game and risk vs reward isnt the only game theory model out there but its fairly good one that can help you analyze a game and find obvious flaws what im saying is that there seems to be an obvious and overwhelming imbalance of rvr in eve right now its not intractable but it should be looked atfirst i really dont see suicide ganking as affecting the playerbase so much as affecting a small number of extremely wealthy individualssecond when you attempt to support multiple playstyles but segregate them the players will eventually push on the wall and find a way over itthird eve online does not have much in the way of support for pvp that doesnt require n  10 people and that seems to have been a design choice but i would submit it was a poor design choice and ccp should look at the n  10 pvp arena once again militias are a great half or quarter step if it didnt irrevocably wreck your faction with 2 of the other empires then it would be a great half stepthe primary problem with war decing in empire is that the targets inevitably go to ground and there is no way to eliminate their ability to do soits a definite risk what im saying is that considering the risk of getting your ship blown up while actively pursuing pvp is roughly 100 versus the risk while mining is roughly lets say significantly less than 50 pvpers are not being rewarded enough for their admittedly hard workbut im having fun   and it does pay just not as well as staring at a rock for hours on end with an alt or station camping marketmore like 145tangentially i like playing paladins divine imperative clarifies moral choice  you dont play a lot of halo do youi dont see that i see reactionary changes that have moved the intentbut he can feasibly do it every time with 1 other person and i dont let it stand in my way just wish there were more options to exercise
in the context of the quote which you missed he was talking about a new player doing level 4 missions with him and how his reward never increases what i was stating is the obvious assertion that while level 4 missions are risky for a new player over time his risk will actually decrease and his relative reward will increase this is trivially trueedit i think i need some sleep
id just like to throw a grenade out and point out that i regularly undock from jita 44 with more than 10 million in my hold way more of course i do it in a battleship   has just become a target
dont think this is the right thread to discuss this but avon has got it right so ill do that all the sameof course to nerf npc corps you would have to nerf corp hopping as well  to oblivion preferrably  eve is a game revolving around pvp and for people to be able to opt out of pvp makes no sense at all suicide ganking is mainly just what avon described a symptom of a much greater problem ccp needs to nerf npc corps badly and corp hopping  to avoid war decs  would need to be either removed or a bannable offense then suicide ganking could be removed entirelly for all i care
hardly solves the problemit just makes the whine about a ton of one man corporations at which point there will be screams for a minimum number of members within x days or the corp gets disbandedbecause it leaves you needing an alliance and large pockets to wardec the 20man group of 1person corps mining in an empire system someone claims as theirsit wouldnt solve anything it just gives people far far more targets to worry about and complain over
youve used a lot of words in an attempt to compare can flipping to mining what does this have to do with suicide ganking additionally ive heard a very different story from can flippers regarding their iskhour income perhaps youre not doing it rightthat argument aside youre not calculating fun into the equation this is a quantitativequalitative analysis were doing here you cant just go by how much iskhour youre making and how much iskhour you expend doing what youre doing how much fun do you have hunting for and flipping cans versus how much fun someone mining is having ever try mining its not as exciting as you might imagine certainly not as exciting and fun as flipping cans im sure thats why you choose to flip cans rather than spend hours miningwindjammer
i have on several occasions posted how npc corps should be redesigned and it is a far more useful way to approach suicide ganking along with a host of other balance issuesthis however is not the thread for itthe whole problem with this thread is that it does not look at the whole problem  and thus it is doomed to fail to find a complete and balanced solutioni expect that from the majority of the community but i am somewhat surprised that some members of the csm actually seem to encourage patching the symptoms rather than looking to cure the root cause of this and other related issues
while i am still amazed that players can somehow tie this issue to npc corps when every hauler ive seen go down in the last 3 weeks or so have been in pc corps
security status hits wont affect gankers wallet hits willi fully support the removal of insurance payouts to ships targetted by concord as the simplest most elegant and most logical solution to the current issue its a deterrent without being a bar it doesnt reward the target for being unlucky and it realigns the riskreward balance to something more appropriateif the mechanic is simply ships killed by concord then it opens the loophole of a cooperating corp wardeccing the gankers and popping them before concord gets the last shot in
but all those haulers are still vulnerable if  in an extreme example  suicide ganking was totally removed whereas those in npc corps would be invulnerablewhilst the hyperbole of the example is clear it also serves to clarify the bounding of the balance issuesuicide attacks can not be balanced whilst the underlying mechanics of conflict in empire space remain unchanged
no people are demanding that suicide ganking be made harder because it is currently too easy and does not carry penalties sufficient to disuade extremely casual suicide ganking making the penalties stiffer will not eliminate or even touch the rate of serious suicide ganking for the purpose of this discussion i define serious suicide ganking as that which aims to gain billions or deny an enemy billions in assets whether your a suicide attempt is made upon a mission runner with a ship containing billions of faction modules or of a freighter containing billions in ships and modules destined for your enemy its serious casually blowing up everything that comes along without scanning it or blowing up any ice miner you catch is not serious its casual and only pursued because its so easy and also because the practitioners take their pay in whines from the victims as well as in iskwhere do you get this infinite reward versus zero risk its only infinite reward for miners if the miner in question is immortal im almost sure there are no immortals in the game while time is infinite the amount we have as mortals is notzero risk if you define risk as containing a significant amount of uncertainty then yes a miner knows what heshe is losing theres no uncertainty about it if they go mining they are going to lose time further they know that time will be spent in a relatively boring activity this is payment for what they gain and most would argue its a heavy payment to makeit might also be argued that a suicide ganker has zero risk since that individual has no uncertainty regarding what theyre going to losea suicide ganker currently wins no matter what the outcome of hisher attempt they do what they do not just for isk but for the fun they gain from doing it this is their quantitativequalitative reward right now what they pay for their reward is unbalancedwindjammer
is there a thread here asking to changenerfmodify npc corps i will be more then happy to support it because in a way i suspect you are rightbut here is where the issue runs afoul of that suicide ganks are not limited to ships in npc corps or in fact by pilots in npc corps are the invulnerable npc corps an issue yes very much so but they are not the only problem here and while perhaps somewhat related not the issue at handthe bias toward the ganker has made it an issue that ccp has come to recognize corp alliance or what ever do not change that but the npc corp issue means suicide ganking must be preserved the cost of suicide ganking the alt of a war target is part of the cost of that war suicide ganking for profit should require enough work to make the profit  i have to figure out how much it cost me to build something before i put it up for sale and point at all the profit i did not really make 
again your equation is incomplete because you ignore qualitative issues when running the risk versus reward calculation moreover you completely ignore the paymentreward calculationrisk is not just about isk and the potential for losing it you must also acknowledge time and the quality of the time that can be lost ie how much fun per unit of time youre havingor not havingreward is not just about how many iskhour you gain from a given activity it is also about the quality of fun youre gaining fun is not subject to a quantitative analysis but it most certainly is subject to a qualitative onewhat you pay for what you gain is the bottom line in your 23 hour example who gained more in terms of total iskfun your choice of career in eve answers that question at least from your point of viewthe purpose of ccps plan is to get a bit of equality back into the situation and get suiciders to pay something more commensurate with what they gainalso what they cost otherswindjammer
i agree with the body of what you say here as i did already in the quote of me youve used the only place we disagree is in the percentage i think your estimate is exagerated though i dont think by that much as long as we restrict ourselves to the specific context of haulers and freighters in high sec situationsone of the thins which affects your stastic is the practice of suiciding haulers etc which are not carrying valuable cargo this is done for laughs its also done in places like jita through use of hit or miss tactics instead of scanning a target for an informed suicide attempt sometimes what they suicide is a hit  valuable cargo  and sometimes its a miss  empty cargohold  penalties being what they currently are this is not an unprofitable practice its one of the reasons that balance in suicide ganking is being pursuedno i honor my word and will not give it in a situation where i either have no intention of keeping it or lack information as to what im giving it on or fordo not evemail me your fit a i will divulge it even if it is practical to implement b the best you could hope for from me would be a partial andor conditional retraction since im giving you that below you would gain nothingin my quote i said there is no way for an active miner what i should have said was there is no practical way for an active miner ive taken care in previous posts to include the concept of practical solutions and for some reason forgot to include it in the post youve quotedeven though you yourself may not use the cov op alt ploy in your suicide ganking we both know some of your collegues do and theres nothing stopping you or any other suicider from doing the samewindjammer
so on the aggregate its basically impossible for can flipping to be more profitable than mining why do i say its impossible consider the hypotheticalminer a mines for time t in seconds he always jetcan mines assume that the time it takes him to mine a full hull is n seconds  s  the time it takes him to mine a full jetcan is o s the time it takes him to haul a full hull is p s the time it takes for him to haul a jetcan is q s the reward for a hulls worth of ore is a ore and the reward for a jetcans worth is b ore f a  and f b  transform ore to isk assume rats are not fought and his time is optimizedfor an investment of n  o  p  q he gets a reward of a  b his reward per unit of time is  f  ab ore  nopq s now assume i come along and i always can flip this miner when his can is full assume the times are the same no combat occurs and i steal all of his jetcaned ore then we get an investment of noq with a reward of ab my reward per unit of time is  f  b ore isk noq s  the miners is nopq with a reward of a so over time  f  a ore isk nop s  assume b  6a ore is mined in linear time so o6n and ore is hauled in linear time and q  3p assume n900s  15 minutes  and p300s  5 minutes  so n3pthen f  6a ore isk 24p s for me and f  a ore isk 22p s for the miner f x  is linear so f 6a   6f a  so 6f a isk24ps and f a isk22ps which gives 025f a iskps versus 00454545f a iskps so the flipper gets about 55 times the reward the miner does in this  perfect for the pirate  hypotheticalnow reality states that few if any miners will continue mining to a full can after being can flipped so our miner returns and sets to mining only this time he doesnt can mine so he gets f a isk4ps  so 025f a iskp  and the pirate gets 0isk3ps  he has to wait until the miners hull is full to see if he can mines so now we look at total average over two cycles which for the miner is 2f a isk26ps versus 6f a isk27ps  007692f a iskps and 022222f a iskps assume the miner comes back for a third cycle and i wait now the balance is 3f a isk30ps versus 6f a isk30ps 10 versus 20do you see whats happening assuming that a pirate flies up and steals a completely full jetcan he gets an instantaneous reward of 6f a  at a cost of 24ps and he is now aggressd to the victim and the victims corporation however as time passes the thief acquires no further reward for his time and the balance shifts to the miner over the aggregateso the question becomes how many hull mining cycles does it take to equal 1 full can flip with the assumptions above roughly 6 so this means i have to steal 1 full can every 7 mining cycles to be equivalent to a target that means 1 full can every 8400 seconds or the equivalent of 1 full can every 23 hoursmaybe im the worst can thief in history but i get 1 full can every 25 game days  between 1 and 4 hours per game day  and i visit between 10 and 20 systems a game day looking for cans i even have a database showing where i hit who and for how much oreiskthe risk a miner takes for his 6 loads of ore effectively 0 the risk i take aggressing myself to one or more individuals and losing my shipit seems a little offtheres a much larger discussion contained within that statement suffice to say i am focusing on the economics of action to avoid muddying the waters of the much larger issue that lies behind suicide ganking
we arent talking about removing their ability to be suicided if that was the question i wouldnt support itwe are talking about raising the bar on the cost so that you actually have to chose your targets based on information rather than knowing that you will hit the jackpot pcnpc corp doesnt fit into that equation as both are suffering equally from this tactici disagree empire space is supposed to be the most civilized area of space where trade abounds it is supposed to be canted more towards the peaceful otherwise ccp would not have faster response times in higher security for concord security hits for breaking the law etc they have allowed those playstyles for the fun and variety but they have also curtailed it high security is supposed to be just that considerably safer right now it is not especially for the weakest parts of the game that have no ability to fight backwhat we are asking for is that the attackers be required to hit specific targets not just spray ammo around knowing that enough will drop out of exploding ships eventually to cover their losses we are asking that the attacker be required to hit that armored car in front of 711 to make money not just shoot every person that walks out of the door once every 15 minutes knowing that if the person has a 20 in their wallet they break even
im glad you see some of the problems with suicide ganking these problems are why balance is being implementedthe planned solutions will not reduce the risk vector for valid suicide gank targets it will reduce casual suiciding of targets of no particular importance if you scan a haulerfreighter with billions youre still going after it the planned changes wont stop that or even have a significant impact upon its frequency the same can be said for mission runners who pimp their ride typically a caldari navy raven with billion isk faction modules you telling me youre suddenly going to pass on those because you wont get insurance money or you take a harder sec hit the profit in terms of giggles and raw isk is too great to pass up if you find an enemy mining operation and are determined to stop them for purposes of logistics well youre going to bite the bullet and take one for the ole goon team arent youyour suggestion that jihadswarm is cleaning up eve of macro or afk miners is  interesting you guys dont bother to determine the afk or active status of your targets in fact based upon available evidence you fellows take your pay in the grief you cause others kind of hard to cause a macro grief suicide ganking of macroers is at best a tactic with limited success rate it doesnt stop the macroer theyre just back the next day or next hour the very best of the suicide ganking of macroers occurs when more than one ship is taken out at one time and even then the previously mentioned situation prevails the most success you can hope for is that the macroer will move to another systemwindjammer
i dont believe the planned balance actions will have any backlash i beleive you even said it would only encourage you to continue perhaps it was another suicider who stated that in this threadi cant see how the planned actions will cause any grief for carebears or even such as i a bear in point of fact they will alleviate some of our grief for instance as you point out it will diminish blind attacksas far as giving carebears a false sense of security come on man youre really worried about that of course not in any case as ive said before those people silly enough to feel a false sense of security deserve to lose this we both agree uponwhile i truly enjoy the fear of suicide gankers and even more their whinesno whine like the whine of a suicider when a suicider whines his whine i dont think their fears are justified of course youre going to get whines from those that are suicided andor ganked doesnt matter what the situation is the credibility of their complaint must be examined the line you ask be drawn is drawn at the point of credibilty and validityhigh sec is not supposed to be absolutely safe but it is supposed to be safer high sec dwellers have a right to believe that things like concord and sec hits will provide some kind of deterrent to so called criminals simply put that deterrence is currently insufficient to the task and therefore needs the planned balancewindjammer
well thought out idea i like it  
thumbs up
i think this idea is great
this is getting closer but i still couldnt get behind this exact plan some of the problems i have with itmost of the stargatebased bonuses are lost too easily by the defender to timezone games because the contested state provides no bonus the only empire that will ever enjoy those bonuses is one with no enemiesthe idea talks about layers but nothing like an empire border is described here the idea doesnt address the porousness of sovholders borders even if a defender has control of a stargate for example that doesnt at all inhibit enemy aggressors from using it to enter the defenders territory we could at least get something like gate guns that side with the entity who has captured the gatenoone who lives in conq 00 is seriously going to go for jump bridge endpoints and cynobeacons being out in empty space away from pos shields really the entire middle layer as presented doesnt feel right to me the progression from the stargate level to the tactical structure level is done poorly as presented you can skip taking stargates almost entirely  only capturing one  and move a bs fleet in to take out say the cynojammer and in fact thats what everone would do take down the cynojammer move caps in to own the system then capture the remaining stargates in that systemthe idea doesnt really distribute out the objectives to prevent blobbing there will still be blobs to defendassault tactical structures  everyone will put all their tactical structures in the same place to make them blobdefensible  and there will still be blobs to defendassault pos you added the stargates as an objective that can be captured by many small groups in parallel but theyre th least meaningful objective to take and you only have to take one stargate to begin assaulting the tactical structuresand the best way to take one target is with a big blob of ships all on that targetso at best youve given an objective of little strategic significance for small gangssmall ships to accomplish in sov warfare and added an extra step that will require blobbing im not really on boardedit we need an idea where the game mechanics intrinsically discourage blobbing at every single step step and where there is something strategically useful for frigatescruisersbattleships to do at every stepedit 2 i really dont like how easy it is for casual harassment to take down jump bridges that part of the change starts to get into discouraging people to live in 00 period under this system jbs would pretty much always be down due to casual harrasmentthink carefully about how hard you want to make life for people who live in 00 i can see that the stargate aspects of this proposal will result in a significant contraction in the size of the current 00 empires and that would be a good thing but territory cannot become so difficult timeconsuming or tedious  timezone games  to defend that it becomes very difficult to hold enough conq space to make living that space worthwhile for the number of people needed to defend itfor example if it takes a population of 50 guysnight just to keep up the jump bridges pos bonuses etc in a constellation but the constellation can only really provide enough income  belts complexes moons  to support 30 guys then thats a problem
good points i think many of these can be addressed in the details this depends on which bonus were talking about the first fuel efficiency bonus  the 25 one  is here based on the total of captured andor contested gates in the entire constellation  so an attacker needs to engage in a serious extended campaign of stargate neutralization to eliminate this bonus and the defender has to actually cede control of a majority of the stargates in the constellation to lose it the extra 5 is easier to knock off as you said because it is based on captured insystem stargate totals only  but if that proves unfair we can change itlikewise the control tower invulnerability is based on constellationwide totals and while an attacker could potentially contest more than half the stargate in a constellation during a defenders offtime it can be balanced to require a coordinated force of a certain size operating in small groups simultaneously across the constellation we just have to determine how long it takes to capturecontest a gate and what the minimum ships to do it are and compare that to the number of gates theyd need to take during offpeak hourssome fixes for this could include putting the bridge and cyno field themselves inside a pos but have them require some kind of beacon module that are out on their own and subject to attackas for skipping past the stargate capture phase  maybe the best thing to do is to put tactical structure invulnerability as a constellationwide effect just like the fuel efficiency then youd have to first attack a majority of the stargates in the constellation before you move in to a specific system to begin picking apart its tactical structuresi think maybe the answer here is to make the tactical structures themselves distributed  at least for the cynojammer to jam a system could require 3 active cynojammers somewhere in the system  some minimum distance from one another  and allow a maximum of 5 anchored cynojammers total  so a wise defender would keep 5 cynojammer modules in system and an attacker would need to take out 3 of the 5 in order to eliminate the jamming effect
maybe then all bonuses should be based on totaling captured and contested gates so casual harassment doesnt knock out defender advantages but consistent and continous neutralization and capture of defender stargates by an attacker wouldas far as population support ideally id want it to be balanced so that defenders have to patrol and recap stargates about as much as attackers are harassingattacking in other words it will only take 50 guysnight to maintain if there are about 50 enemiesnight roaming your territory and we can balance it so that it is maybe a tad easier for the defender because of home field advantage even if its just because they have access to jump bridges to get from place to placebut i would like to hear more about how many people a constellation can support incomewise and how that can play into this
not perfect but damn good ive been trying to come up with a new sovereignty system ever since fw came out and this is better than anything ive come up with
thanks for the responses you described some reasonable improvements regarding skipping stargate assaults to attack tactical structures i think that requiring a constellationlevel stargate assault is too much in the defenders favor i think the right balance falls more on the side of requiring all of the stargates in the system where the tactical structure lies to either be in the contested state or be captured by the attacker its a balancepoint in the system that can be tweakedand another concerneven without bringing timezone differences into this i think that stargate assault gangs conducting sov warfare  not just looking for good fights  will probably focus on undefended stargates avoiding patrols etc so two suggestionsfirst assaulting a gate should require a commitment it should not be easy to stop the process of assaulting a gate the moment that resistance arrives and flee im thinking about how assaulting a pos with dreads requires a tenminute commitment  putting them into siege mode  or how popping a cyno requires a commitment if someone shows up to defend a gate you are attemting to contest you should have to fight them at least for awhilesecond i would like some mechanism whereby the members of an organization who have captured gates can tune into a channel that broadcasts alerts about assaults on their gates then if the defenders move quickly enough they can force a fight with those who attack their stargates
this could be achieved by something as simple as giving stargates a certain amount of pos style powergrid and cpu  for example 200kmw as a maximum and without the pos structure resistance bonus then you can anchor a disrupter or a couple of guns at the gate  which are not enough to threaten even a small gang but will harass gate camps and warp scramble one of the attackers if hostiles are just flying through they have time to warp off before the scrambler catches them unless flying something really slow 200kmw would allow a few warp scramblers or one disrupter  maybe on gun to be fielded nothing massive but enough to slow attackers down as a downside though that is then assets in space that can be destroyed  and they dont have the pos structure bonus to stop people doing so
an alliance who is strong in one regional timezone will have to daily repair the damage done in 23 other regional timezones when none of them are playing think of say a russion sov holder who every day has to repair the damage done by european us and australian roaming gangs just to use their jump bridges probably none of those enemies are coordinated or even really waging sov warfare theyre typically just going to be guys who are disappointed that they didnt get a fight while roaming or camping a gate and decided to contest a few stargates just for the hell of it and theyll often be guys who are based out of lowsec or empire and dont hold any conquerable space themselves so you cant even retaliatethat just doesnt sound funi dont have a better idea yetedit possibly the solution is to require some consumable resource for contesting a stargate analogous to lo for popping a cyno or stront for dreads so if someone is going to contest a stargate they have to have at least planned ahead and brought the resource and they have to have paid something to acquire the resource in the first place this way contesting a stargate isnt something you would typically do just on a lark to mess with someone because why not it doesnt cost us anything it will make the act morepremeditated and intentional
okay i think i have some ideas for these1  the act of a gang interfacing with a gate to contest capture or recapture it can disable the warp drive of the ships involved this way if they are interrupted midcapture they have to disengage and wait for the warp drive to come back online2  the incursion alarm was something i figured would be included with the network security node tactical structure  so you could fly out and interface with it to monitor the stargate network and see if anything is up3  also as far as the 31 time zone difference i think we can balance that just by having a difference in the time it takes to contest vs the time it takes to recapture a contested gate like if it takes 30 minutes to contest a gate but only 15 minutes to recapture it that helps the defending alliance out a bit in that regard
was thinking of something like the following rough ideathe contest stargate action has to be performed by four ships positioned no more than 50km from the gate simultaneously for 10 minutes before it succeeds during that time none of the ships performing that action can move more than 50 km from the gate or they blow up any extra ships along to support the four ships that are actually doing the contest stargate action can do whatever they wantso if defenders come those four ships can fight or spidertank or whatever within 50 km of the gate until they finish the contest stargate action then they can leave their buddies can leave anytime or stay and fight but at least something worth some isk is committed to remaining near the gate for at least 10 minutes if you want to contest the gateand maybe make the contest stargate action require a specific module that can only be fitted on ships that are worth a damn to keep people from using alpha clones in noob frigates to do the risky part
sounds good i think that with some dev refinement a plan along the lines of the one discussed in this thread could be funi especially like the general mechanism for avoiding blobbing of having a distributed set of multiple attack points for a single structure for example to take down a pos you dont shoot the pos you instead have to take down some  of structures that are related to the pos but all lie on different grids from each other and from the pos this way both the attacker and the defender have to split up
i really love this idea there were a few similar ideas in the ccp thread but i think this is better then all of them still some balance issues to workout but well have to impliment the system and deal with those as they comei think it might be even cooler if you could when youve captured an entire region  have sov over all constellations  then you could elect to have a system with an outpost as the region capital this would entitle that systems constellation to be immune to any attacks on gates this will then force an attacker to take another constellation rather then just go right for the jugulari have not been involved in sov warfare in a long time so im just throwing this out
thanks guys  heres what is slated to be addedmodified at the momentstargate capturemake the tactical structure invulnerability benefit harder to disrupt currently thinking ts invulnerability is held as long as 100 of the insystem stargates are captured or contested by the owning alliance in this way an attacker would first engage in a constellationwide small gang effort to disrupt defender stargate control as soon as a defender allows a contested stargate to lapse to neutral status that systems tactical structures are vulnerable to attack and the battle moves to a systemwide effort to destroy tses second flesh out the capturecontestrecapture mechanic as follows capturing or contesting a stargate requires x  lets say 10  ships in proximity to the gate to interface with it for y  lets say 30  minutes this interfacing disables the warp drive of the ships in 60 second cycles  so if you break off the interfacing because of enemy attack it will be up to 60 seconds before warp drives come back online a defender recapturing a contested stargate requires only half the normal time  so 15 minutes in this example tactical structuresfirst jump bridges and cyno field generators are put back inside a poss shields for transit safety purposes instead in order for them to operate they require jump bridge beacons and cyno field generator beacons placed in safe spots away from gravity wellssecond tactical structures cannot be placed within less than 1 au of another tactical structure of the same namethird change tactical structures function as follows instead of placing a single structure to create the effect a system requires 3 active tss of a given type to generate the given effect a maximum of 5 tss of a given type may be anchored in a system thus a defending alliance will choose to anchor the maximum of 5 tss of a type and attackers will need to eliminate 3 or more in order to neutralize the effectfor more discussionthere has already been talk of the interaction of the cynojammer and the jump bridge  should they be mutually exclusive only mutually exclusive in regards to capships
perhaps allow a noncap ship sized jump bridge then make cynojammers and capital jump bridges exclusive this allows defending gangs to roam easier and prevents one side from having a capital blob while another is forced to use conventional ships
updated the ops with the changes discussed  changed tactical structures to tactical arrays to better describe their distributed nature also added more detail about how stargate capture works
ccp says no we are way to lazy to fix anything important like this
remove tracking disrupter bonus and add give nosneut rangeand leave my goddamn drone bonus alone
needs fixed badly
the pilgrim  and curse for that matter  need to be restored to gangsta status
can we get some ccp or csm luvin in here
i wub option 1 gief me ogre iis wiht mah pelgrem
yes
the point of this thread was not to make the cerberus a sacrilege i am not asking for thatwhat i am saying is that just like the nighthawk the cerberus also is very hard to fit the other missile hac the sacrilege is incredibly easy to fit and generally more effective than the cerberuscerberus could use more grid have its missile flight time bonus changed to another velocity bonus for missiles and dare i say get damage to all missiles not just kinetics  caldariwide racial issue yes not asking for a drone bay not asking for more speed not asking for less mass of the ship not asking for any of that not asking for more capacitor or capacitor recharge or shield hp or shield resistseasier to fit better bonuses ability to fit hams and make it actually worth it thats it
lets just all be honest here the sacrilege is a great ship let the amarr have a uber missile boat all i am asking for here is that the cerberus at least get boosted somewhat thats right folks im not even asking for the cerberus to be equal to the sacrilege its that good if the cerberus was more powerful than the sacrilege than it would be insanely overpowered the sac is again that goodi am pretty sure if the cerberus was turned into a zealot except with more hp more dps more speed better bonuses ect ect everyone would cry bloody murder but this is exactly what happened ccp took the sacrilege and simply turned it into a cerberus except tons and tons better why its a missile ship with the capacitor and grid of a laser boat and better bonuses to missiles than the cerberus and it even gets capacitor and armor resist bonuses now that is one hell of a shipheavy assault launchers they need to fit better on caldari ships right now its almost as if they were custom tailored for a friggin amarr hac the sac fits them plus everything and a pony right now cant say that for the cerberus nighthawk or any tier 1 caldari bccruiserbonuses kinetic only i hate this bonus i will forever hate this bonus caldari are the missile race bonus for all missiles types please the missile flight time bonus on the cerberus is quite dubious it could be replaced with something usefulanyways ill add more if people respond i am very curious as to how anyone could possibly defend the cerberus or even in my mind make me believe the ship is any longer of any use now if you tell me to go snipe in this ship i will hate you forever for one the eagle is already a sniper and missiles arent for sniping so if that is your response well that will not change my mind one bitagain discuss

fixed for you cerberus isnt good for sniping i repeat not good for snipingi am aware the cerberus is not a true short range ship though with heavy assaults it should have that option the cerberus is the front line dps hac for caldari the eagle is the sniper please do not tell me to drop on a target mwd 150km away and then watch it warp away before a single missile hits thank youalso you are ignoring the fact that1 cerberus bonuses suck2 cerberus is defensively speaking much weaker3 cerberus capacitor wise is weaker4 cerberus is quite a bit slower5 cerberus has a harder time with fittings by farthats just off the top of my head again i ask why the sacrilege an amarr ship such a better missile hac than the cerberus which is caldari and using the primary weapon of the caldari missiles why not just make the cerberus a zealot but better makes no sense folks 
eve is not a sologame
this isnt about solo though of course caldari are by far the worst at it i do not understand that when it comes to caldari ships and their inability to engage a target without an entire fleet with them we get this stop trying to solo noob stuff seriously does it have to be a joke to engage in a caldari ship i dont always have 5 friends in my back pocket other races ships can do this why not caldaritrain reading comprehension and then reread the post please this is about a head on view of the sacrilege and cerberus
you just described a solosituation to explain why the cerb sucks
so what you are telling me is basically this1 missiles are caldari weapons2 heavy assault launchers are introduced into the game as a short range high dps cruiser weapon3 sorry caldari cant fit them and be viable in short range pvp only amarr get that in fact were gonna boost the hell out of the amarr hac and make it the bestest missile cruiser ever well even leave those tanking and capacitor bonuses in there too just so you feel completely stupid about flying a ceberus instead of just sorta stupidnow we have a ship like the raven which can fit cruise missile launchers or torpedoes and work at a long range or a short range role depending on the type of launchers and setup usedon the cruiser  and battlecruiser  side for caldari we get lol sorry folks gotta go mwd 150km away and shoot heavys or die horribly cause every other hac outclasses you under 50km cant set your ship up for any type of midshort range combat lol go train amarr if you wanna do that with your races weapons stupidperhaps they should take amarr medium pulse lasers away and make them impossible to fit on their ships and let caldari have those since they got our heavy assault launchersterrific game balance i say
the cerberus is just fine as long as you dont try to nano fit it stop thinking of it as a close range ship and actaully use that double range bonus which by the way works just fine as a gang ship in smaller fights flight time isnt as much of a problem as people claim and in larger fights youre antisupport and not hitting the primary anyway the only problems the cerberus has are1  gridcpu are too tight this is the one thing youre right about its too hard to fit this ship compared to the other hacs 2  javelin hams are way too good and allow the sacrilege to steal some of the cerberus longrange role they either need a damage reduction or a major range reductionsure the lack of a good nano setup is annoying but nano cruisers are long overdue for a major nerf so we shouldnt balance the cerberus around them
if cerberus is long range and obviously eagle is a sniper why do caldari lack a short range hacare caldari only useful for sniping and electronicsi have started a second race of ships just cause caldari sucks
stop comparing the sacrilege with the cerberus they have completely different roles and arguably the cerbs roles are more important  many ships can apply closerange dps while going quickly like the sacrilege but none can compete with the cerberus in its nichethe cerb may deserve a bit more pg and cpu though  its fittings are unnecessarily tight oh and i agree that jav hams are overpowered both in general capabilities and when applied to the ham saccerb comparison
no cerb is a long range missile spammer the person who gave you the 150km snipe setup is correctly using the ship  although i would put ewar on it  if you refuse to use tactics and just want a f1f8 solopwnage machine  see sig  then that is not the fault of the ship or its deisgncaldari  range they can use short range missiles and blasters but the gallente does blasters better and the sacrilege does hams better and i think there are some amarr frigsdessies that do rockets better if a race cannot overlap with another races specialty then i guess you wouldnt mind if the crow went a max of 4kms righttech 2 ships are highly specialized ships that no one forces you to train for if you like the ham damage and close rangeness of the sacrilege then by all means train for it
why do caldari need  or want  a closerange hac caldari are for fleet pvp if you want a disorganized blob train gallentewhich hacs are actually good in a proper fleet cerberus eagle vagabond zealot  kind of  hey two of the four are caldari and where is the gallente hac on that list
so you are telling the the cerberus is perfectly fine so long as you do not fit it in a fashion which makes it survivable in a roaming gang great idea ill slow boat and totally kick ass from now on this fixes everythingagain i ask you all why were heavy assault launchers added if caldari ships in particular their heavy assault cruiser the cerberus in completely inept and out shined by an amarr hac please give me a logicalreasonforthispleasemissile ships arent snipers missile ships arent snipers hey did you hear that missile ships are not snipers true storywell at least we agree on somethingi dont think its the missiles it is the ships again i ask why is the cerberus a sniper missile ship missiles arent for sniping you are putting the ship in a role that by design doesnt work for missile ships making the cerberus utter fail i always assumed heavy assault missiles would be for caldari ships i really had no idea ccps true intention was to make them not fit on caldari ships and then buff the sacrilege to teh moon some how this did not actually cross my mind boy was i wrongwhile i would not cry if every single polycarb rig in eve was loaded onto a freighter and piloted straight into a star and exploded it still doesnt change the fact that the cerberus is junkif i hear missile and sniper in the same sentence one more time i think my head will asplode that is an oxymoron also the eagle yanno it already snipes we dont really need two ships especially one that tries to do it with the wrong weapons  we dont need two of those pantload ships
i am so glad to know that i need to have 20150 friends logged into properly use my caldari vesseli will gladly answer your question of why do caldari need  or want  a closerange hacanswer warp disruptors are fitted into ships that are fitted for speed in small gang fights which hac are the best atif you are in a roaming gang and promptly mwd 150km away and fire missiles that go 8kmsec at best at a target while your friends are fighting in their close range ships and using their warp disruptors to actually kill targets you will be kindly kicked out of the gang and asked to please delete the eve clientalso ever since ccp added heavy assault launchers and waited every so patiently for them to be introduced into the game we had this crazy notion that they would be usable and effective on our caldari ships considering caldari use missiles and heavy assault launchers oddly enough fire missiles this is all crazy stuff i know but try to followi could go into the why everything caldari is awful for pvp right now but i will resist that argument since its all over the eve forumsagain the raven  it can fit cruise or torpedoes and be effective in both roles the cerberus nighthawk caracal drake  all screwed thanks to bad bonuses and the fitting requirements of hams only ship able to effectively use hams an amarr ship you seriously do not see a problem with thisso every caldari ship has to be a sniper even the ones that use weapons which are completely unacceptable for the sniper role even though hams were introduced because caldari ships were lacking a short range launcher we need understand that caldari cant really fit or use them effectively because they are not intended for caldari ships i am so very confused when do i get my caldari laser pwnmobile i dont think training for the sacrilege really helps restore game balance it just sweeps it under the rug and really bones every player who trains caldari with the crazy notion that their ships are designed for missiles both short and long rangethe eagle is already the hac sniper for caldari we dont need two whats the point in specializing a hac when you give us both with the same role shouldnt the other hac have a different role wouldnt that like make sense sortaalso my head asplode
cerberus isnt as good as sacrilege if you nano them for overall pvp however im sure the cerberus does better against kinthermal damage it is designed to tank  ie gallente this is the intended role
yes im well aware of the speed problem in roaming gangs right now fix the broken nano setups and the fact that the cerberus cant go 999999999999kms wont be a problem anymore a cerberus with a mwd isnt all that slow its only when you compare it to overpowered nano setups that it looks badre fleet deal with it caldari trade solosmall gang ability for the best fleet ships in the game if you dont like it train minmatar or gallente and you can have some awesome solosmall gang ships but be worthless in a fleetre hams yes they were obviously released without much effort made to balance them properly the grid requirements on caldari ships obviously werent even looked at and anyone who thinks javelin hams are balanced is insaneas for the cerberus vs the eagle the cerberus has two key advantages1  it has much more dps than the eagle the cerberus puts out almost 400 dps well past 150km which just rips apart hostile cruiserbcsize support the eagle on the other hand is usually limited to frigates2  it doesnt have the closerange blind spot of the eagle sure the eagle hits very well at 200km but it has major problems tracking closerange targets the cerberus on the other hand hits for full damage from 0180km
oh okay now i get it this argument really makes total sense to meforget everything i said cerberus is meant to tank blasters and ogre iis now i guessyou are absolutely right the cerberus tanks way better against kinetic and thermal damage way better than the hac that is faster does more dps has higher resists 50100 more buffer hp and the ability to actively tankif im ever surrounded by ogre iis and dying to an ishtar i will know for sure my intended role has been met that extra themeral resist will totally save me and i will be totally glad i am not in a sacrilege which would actually have a chanceon a side note racial resistances on t2 ships have about zero to do with this issue yanno in case you are all wondering
lets focus on this this actually has something to do with what i am trying to say heretake the spike m out and uh against fast targets you will find the cerberus to be quite useless as well afterall precision heavy missiles are completely broken you actually do fly a cerberus correct
yes i do know how to fly an eagle even faction ammo has problems hitting at close range reducing the eagles alreadylow dps as for precision missiles maybe i wasnt clear enough the roleseagle kill small fast targets at long rangecerberus kill cruiserbcsize targets  such as those annoying ewar ships  at all rangesrapier kill small fast targets at close rangethe cerberus is also useful in more situations the eagle is pretty much limited to the fleet role while the cerberus is good even in small gangs  though the drake is arguably just as good but cheaper  it provides a good amount of dps does so consistently  the eft damage of that blaster boat goes down quite a bit once you count falloff and tracking  and keeps the ability to deal with longrange targets if needed  such as that blackbird causing you trouble  the main threat to this usefulness is not the sacrilege itself its the broken javelin hams that let the sacrilege hit targets well beyond what a closerange ship is supposed to be capable of nerf javelin hams and id gladly trade 85 dps for 150km of range
i think all can be solved by1  a bit better cpugrid to cerb as suggested above2  cerb missile bonus apply to ham and all ammo types as well3  fix precision heavy missiles
all of this is nice and all and probably true but it still doesnt have anything to do with this thread we could talk about what is useful in fleets all day but it doesnt mean anythinglets get back to the pointheavy assault launchers why are they so difficult to use on caldari shipswhy are they only good on sacrileges an amarr shipwhy does the cerberus  and various other caldari ships  get a kinetic only bonus when the sacrilege gets its bonuses to all assault missilesis the flight time bonus on the cerberus useful  no why is a cerberus so difficult to fit and yet a sacrilege is so damn easydo we need two caldari hac snipers also missiles are utter fail for the sniper roleyou could in theory fit a sacrilege with javelin heavy assault missiles do any damage type and kill cruisersbattlecruisers from almost 90km away which is stretching it for a missile sniper if you ask me youll have a larger buffer tank better resistances ect ect so even at longish range the cerberus is utter fail vs the sacrilegethough this is all again very moot if you bring an eagle cerberus or sacrilege to an actual fleet fight youll probably be disgraced or at the very least induce groansvultures snipe support better than eagles and can provide gang linksravens splatter ewar support way better than cerberus and are more resistance to jammingjust for the record  id rather not discuss this further this isnt about fleet stuff really 
cerb missile bonus does apply to hamthe main problem is the grid  either ham need easier fitting or the caldari cruisers need a grid boost preferably the second
jim youre trying to use the cerberus like a sacrilege and then complaining when you find that the sacrilege is better at being a sacrilege also missile sniping while certainly rather niche is far from useless a cerberus can deliver missiles to 240 km sure you have to wait 20 seconds for the missiles to arrive but the dps advantage over say an eagle once they do arrive is so great that it only takes a few volleys for the cerb to gain the upper hand in damage delivered and as merin said youre just as good at shooting stuff closer to youalternatively fit your cerb with aml iis and precision lights with explosion velocity rigs and create a 60km nofly zone for unpimped inties youll also deal full damage to almost all nanocruisers you cant do that in a sacrilege not without webbing your target firstif there is a problem its to do with jav hams and the cerbs pgcpu rather than the concepts of the cerberus and sacrilege or the launcher fittings
you are comparing two totally different ships
that and also what gypsio saidplus when you talk about tank you are really too much into eft eft will show you some nice ehp with a dual lse tankbut have a look at the resistances with a basic 20 thermal on the shield 30 if you use a low slot for a dc ii the probably most used damage type in game your tank is much thinner than it appears in eft add to that that thermal is also the lowest resist on the armorand the power of the cerbs range cant be overestimated really providing dps from 180km out makes you pretty much immune to all ecm and nearly all hostile shipsadmittedly i make a lot of my kills in a sacrilege being amarr specced and having a tad for close combat but for ranged combat i have to resort to a navy issue caracal cause the sacrilege just cant compare to even that let alone a cerberus
thumb up just for the ham launcher reviewand cerb should be looked at too  id happily trade one of the range bonuses for a launcher rof bonusrange bonuses have their use on turrets where ammo damage goes down as range increase however they are almost worthless on missiles  or at least double range bonuses are  missile speed is ok missile flight time is rubbish
you are seriously going to tell me that a sacrilege is less survivable than a cerberus this is absurd and untrue if you want to complain about resistance holes look at that 0 em on the cerberus the cerbs overall resists arent that great it has less of a tank than the sac it has harder time fitting lse than the sac it does everything worse than the sac outside of being able to toss heavy missiles out at extreme range which is not that useful of an ability in actual pvpnow you are going to tell me to effectively use a cerberus you must be 180km away from the target where it can not fire back at you what is wrong with you people why is being able to fit a friggin caldari ship for midshort range pvp and not suck such a huge deal every other race can do it why not caldari why not the cerberus sacrilege gets everything and a pony and you can not see thisnavy issue caracals what you are going to bring faction ships into this please dont we going to compare navy megathrons to hyperions next
you might have a batter time getting support if you were willing to be less of an asshat about it
theyre not that differentmake a cerberus a laser boat and make it a zealot but make every aspect of it better give it a better tank more cap more speed more dps but take away the laser optimal range bonus then when amarr guys come ranting and raving to the forum i will gladly tell them to chill out cause they are two totally different ships cause like hey i dont have an optimal range bonus and you do go mwd 100km away and snipe loser
gahresists are just a small part of survivabilitycheck the prices of cerberus and navy caracalsand most importantly figure out what the cerberus can do that the sacrilege cant and exploit those capabilitiesits awful threads like this that give caldari pvp a bad name
google the sons of tangra killboard check out the most used ship oh yeah its a cerberus running in nano sniping gangs if you dont know what those are dont bother posting here
uhhhhhhh resists are useful effective hp is useful sacrilege has about 816k more than the cerberus just as in every other aspect the sacrilege is betteri dont care about navy caracals they have nothing to do with thisthe only thing a cerberus can do over a sac is range which with missiles isnt that useful nor is it practical to mwd insanely far away from targets and fire missilescaldari pvp is hurting right now really badly you might have noticed one or two threads about this im guessing you will tell me next that the nighthawk is perfectly fine too correctim glad you like my thread
i dont like this thread its a stupid threadtank is only useful when youre being shot at the cerberus like the falcon should not be getting shot at thats why resists and ehp are only part of the storyyou should care about navy caracals and the navy osprey dont be so narrowminded theyre the caldari nanoships if you want to fly something that isnt a sacrilege like a sacrilege is flown use one of those shipscaldari pvp is fine i think i have one kill not using a caldari ship  i was in a prowler and it was an accident the races are rather well balanced right now actually certain ships have problems and i agree that the cerberus could do with a bit more pg and cpu but its intended role and actual capabilities are solid enoughnighthawk hmmm i wonder whos put in hours of donkey work on that thread modelling and describing the problems and suggested solutions the main problem with this thread is that its hopelessly vague you need to identify a specific problem with the cerberus prove that it is a problem then suggest specific changes complete with modelling indicating their expected effects maybe pg or cpu buffs or you might argue that the problem is really one of jav ham range
me falls down laughingshows your knowledge about the issue the quality of your research and your general overviewcerberus shield resists 0807050sacrilege shield resists 0205085and the sacrilege actually has to operate under fireplease do your homework before starting an issue next time  thanks alot
sacrilege can fit 8k shield buffer  medium rep and gets armor resists thanks a lot
dude chilli agree with you but plz calm the  down
sniper missile boat pfft whoevers pimping that idea must not have been in plenty of 00 alliances that  and laugh if you try to bring one of those and they have reasonwtf bring a drake or bb instead you wont do  with that thingincrease missile speed for lights heavies lolcruise and torps increase explosion velocity take a real look at the awfull t2 junk ammo rethink caldari crap inherent ship bonuses if we are the missile race let us be the missile raceso yeah
no no no pvery few have invested teh same into learning skills this makes most pilots different becasue they will not train their skills as fast or slow as others couple this with implants adn initial attributes and we get the cool diversityno u
if i remember correctly ccp already wants to remove learning skills cuz they feel like its makeing it harder for new players to get in to the gameand also needless to say training learning skills sux hard since they dint give u  the ability to use  any new cool stuff
link it
i disagree wholeheartedly with the complete removal of learning skills under the argument that it makes it harder for new players to complete effectively that issue is almost completely dealt with in the fact that skills are exponential in required points for levels  level 1 is superfast level 2 fast level 3 slow level 4 really slow level 5 takes a looong time  with fixed payoffson the other hand i think learning skills are perhaps overpowered eve is about specialization but specialization in learning grants you a significant specialization bonus in every skill category i can see why thats badbut eve is about specialization i would only support a proposal to remove general learning skills if new skills were invented to take their place ie gunnery training which gives the same benefits as the learning skills but only to skills in the gunnery subtree etc one per category is probably about rightjust saying that removal of learning skills should be done to make it easier for new players to compete is the same as saying we should remove all gunnery support skills  rapid fire sharpshooting etc  because veteran controlled guns hit harder and track better from farther away than n00b controlled guns and that makes it harder for n00bs to compete at some point the game is fun because you can be better at something than someone else if you want a truly level playing field for new players the veterans arent going to have any reason to stick aroundtldr  learning skills are overpowered but removing them is wrong specializing them might be much betterno support here for op suggestion
unfortunately i have no idea how the npc ai is handled at ccps end so anything i theorize about how it works are just guestimates however im a software engineer myself and as such i tried to come up with ideas that can be implemented without  theoretically  eating up additional cpu time as to whether it will or not id just have to place my faith in ccpactually i usually run missions solo the point of these ideas is not to force people to run missions in groups which is why im a little hesitant regarding the change to half the number of npcs and increase their damage however i do think that missions should offer some more advantages for working in groups for example you could forgo a scrambler on your ship to make sure you can tank the npcs but then youll earn less in bounties as the leader warps out youll still make plenty of money but not quite as much as if you had a buddy in a frig to hold down your targets  which may not even be worth it depending on how you split the bounties  i dont want to force people to do anything as its against the spirit of eve but i think that we should encourage people to cooperate more for missionsthat being said i dont want to significantly harm the ability and profitability of running missions solo  which would he how these changes would affect me personally  im not for removing it from the entire game just from mission loot fair enough the difference between 5000 meters and 1500 meters is pretty smallthanks for the feedback even if you didnt support it
i really hope you mean from all the npc mission belt and exploration rats
my proposal deals only with missions but overall i would like to see that the only source of unnamed t1 equipment should be other players
1  fewer better npcs if the overall mission difficulty and rewards remain the same why bother if we are going to make some unsoloable level 4 missions thats just frustrating for a lot of solo players i dont see a big win here i would rather just see more new missions2  no more unnamed t1 loot that mineral supply is probably important given the number of absolutely stripped highsec belts could force more players to mine in lowsec but probably just causes a lot of price hikes on manufactured goods also if all missions just dropped higherend named loot that loot just becomes the new low end and totally crashes in value almost immediately i dont see a big win here either3  mission leaders that arent totally stupid okay thats something new and interesting other people have voiced concerns but generally more intelligent npc tactics are a good thing im in favor of that im not sure im in favor of npcs that warp out and back etc however mostly just in favor of improving ai generally4  more dynamic spawns absolutely in favor of i think it would be great to have occasional factionofficer spawns  much less frequent than in belts etc but just that 1 in 10000 chance would be nice  to spice up life in missions this would have to be done somewhat intelligently though it would be very irritating to run a long highly dynamic mission in which all spawns were very low end  how many hundred coreli initiates must one kill exactly all in all against the first two in favor of the last two in a general sense the op is too specific for me to support
signedgood post i hope the csm gives this serious consideration
i agree that there are 2 different issues raised by this thread ccps customer service and lag in the past i experienced server side lag and my friend lost his ship i can prove without a doubt that the lag was not on my side via a wireshark trap of the entire session that and the fact that i am on a 3gbps connection over a solid carrier as close to the internet as you can get and my box is well above the recommended specs i saw nothing hitting his ship his shields were full and then pop gone ccp denied his petition for reimbursement citing that the logs showed no indication of lag obviously both issues raised here were to blame the fact that the system wasnt crowded  i can say nothing about the node as a whole though  it took their gateway 2300ms to send a tcp ack to a packet  yes eve goes over tcp not udp if you doubt me trap it with wireshark  and it was out of sequence goes to show the issue is on their end not mine not my friends the response from the gm was downright insulting i very much doubt that they log the lag to every ip connected to them at all times i admit i may be wrong about them logging lag to every ip connected to them i dont do it at my job unless its needed and i work with something that over 100ms of lag can seriously impact and result in a large loss of revenue
yes to no cloaking capitalsno to everything else
a nerf to the cloak isnt necessarya sized capital cloak that takes more energy and fitting would be a good pathanother would be a module that can disrupt cloaking
smartbombs bombs drones  comedy doomsday option as well qedposting vigorously to show that i am an angry individual and hate this idea rage quit etc etc
smartbombs have to low an effect to be effective drones work though and have used that many times bombs though expensive could be used in this manner effectively
this sounds like the mwd talk back in the days when one mwd fitted on all sizesperhaps it is then needed to introduce different classes of cloaks which i think would be a pain thopersonally because of the carebear i am i want to keep my mining ships cloaked at all times if possible so i would not like this idea
sized cloaks sure if they can still be run 237 or at least can be run for say 15min  should be much longer for the covops cloak  and then gets into a deactivation faze so that the pilot has to update his cloaked state  to prevent the ppl from going afk cloaked in hostile space all day effect ppl can still be cloaked for long periods of time but if they dont have time to play theyl have to log of tactics that involve cloaking  hit and run  are still viable sized cloaks would make fitting a capital cloak on a capital ship gimp the ship more in terms of cpupg usage
this suggestion is horribly unbalanced it would essentially make capital ships undeployable unless you had a huge fleet or a pos to hide at and massively skew the game  even more  to the defenders advantageyou should know the titan pilots name if hes in local then take precautions or get a bait and trap ready
quasisupport with penalties as suggested in op 3ddcynosiege modes are unavailable for 5 minutes after decloak and cloaking is unavailable for 5 minutes from performing either of those functions
thisand titans are broke as hell anyway cant really use them as an example of cloaking abuse since theyre basically abused as it isstill maintain that titans are themonuclear ninjas that dont exist in actual combat unless someone is stupid they dont have to exist in actual combat to gain most of their value
i propose a mining cloak that can allow a dreadnaught to mine while cloaked and seiged  also adding a mining laser seige bonus  but only in high security spacehows that
if the issue is capital cloaks then i think sized modules would be a simple solutionsmallmedlargecapital all with the exact same functionality as we have todayif the issue is cloakers that keep going afk then id like to point to a suggestion i had a while back
i noticed this thread today and i dont see any evidence that it is getting any attention linkagei was unaware of this but apparently smartbombs are sufficient to completely disable incoming citadel torpedo fire  and a few other issues as well in my mind this makes the phoenix  and half the naglfar  a worthless ship capital weapons should be able to hit capital ships it shouldnt be possible to fit a single module and thereby be able to tank an infinitely large fleet of phoenixesi think the thread above describes a problem that desperately needs some attention i dont see that it has gotten any in the game development forum where it is now so i submit it to the assembly hall  
i am in favor obviously  
yes i would also say  remove insurance completley from the game or make it more expensive
i agree   or to be fairer on newer players maybe leave 100 insurance on tech 1 frigatesdestroyers and 50 on tech 1 cruisersbut then i never insure anything anyway
ive done some more thinking on the topic of t2 insurance given the opposition that the topic has raised and i realized that i want it to exist and be useful but i dont want it to be on as sweet of terms as t1 insurance is the 12 ratio of insurance premium to insurance is fine but the 40 basic payout is not as such it seems like there should be 5 levels of t2 insurance  1020304050 of market price in premiums gives you a payout of 20406080100 of market price its significantly more expensive than t1 and more appropriate to the higherend players who will be using it but it will at least eliminate the problem of uninsurability for t2 ships alternately use the definition of mineral costs to lower effective insurance  dont include datacores invention time t2 component production costs or anything below a perfectme bpo
my suggestion would be do away with insurance entirely at least on the bigger ships losing a big ship should be a painful loss currently you pretty much just lose the cost of the modules on a t1 bs i dont know how much capitals insure for and what  of the cost it is but i find it ridiculous that capital ships can be insured at all theyre meant to be a big investment not something you can get hundreds of millions back on if you lose
please remove insurance from the game in its entirety its just stupid
welcome to april
this is exactly the problem under my plan an insured battleship will still cost you 30 of market or 1845 million plus modulerig costs these are not cheap  itd be cheaper for t2 but significantly more expensive than the bare handfuls of millions it costs now for t1 costs for a suicidefit ship would roughly quintuple and costs for a t2fit ship would go up by a lower proportion but still a lot as for capitals you buy a carrier on market for about 900 mil it insures for its 600 mil mineral costs the rest is pos fuel and blueprint amortization  and that insurance costs you 180 million you get back 420 on your 900 or more like 1200 fitted  when it dies putting you down circa 23 of your price is that painful enough for you this plan acts as a major nerf to capital insurance
i just had an interesting and related ideahere is an idea for youtake tractor beams  or maybe a new version of them  and have them be usable on ships as well as wreckscansit gives those ships an acceleration towards you of 500 ms  smaller ships affected more than big  a couple of tractor beams would pull them into range of the web and then lets a normal web take effect naturally they could fly against the tractor beam but it does make it harder for them to get away from you and multiple tractors would become nasty but you are giving up high slots to achieve thatthis also gives marauders a role in pvp
lets face it bombs are useless they are too expensive difficult to apply properly and  if made much easier too use  would destroy small gang warfare and overpower gate camping they need a role that is more useful while not rendering small gangs obsoletemy proposal is this  bombs should only be capable of being launched at a cap ship they will fly toward their target  lets say at about 2k a sec  and then stick or adhere to the cap ship from the moment they are launched they are on a timer  id propose around 1 minute  when they explode they do ae damage  they will not detonate inflight   for example base damage  5000area of effect  5kall targets within the aoe will receive full damage  resistances withstanding what this would amount to is that stealth bombers would now be capable of seriously harassing enemy cap ships and providing effective damage to cap ships only the trick is that any ships or drones within 5k of the ae would take the damage also this means the attackers would have to be cautious in effectively deploying drones against the target without having them annihilated by friendly bombs far more strategy would have to be used coordinated attackers willing to field a small wing of stealth bombers could deal a tremendous amount of burst damage to a cap shipthe defending forces would also have to deal with the bombs differently repair drones would have to be recalled and any repair ships would have to stay outside of the 5k ae however there is one defense against bombs  the utterly useless defender missilenow defender missiles would become an antibomb countermeasure defender missile launchers  new module  would become similar to bomb launchers  5000 cpu 10 grid  and all logistics ships would receive a 99 role bonus to fitting defender missile launchers this would make logistics ships far more useful and flexible across setups and would be invaluable to have present during cap ship opsonce active a defender missile launcher would remain active until deactivated  no cap use 20 sec rof  and would launch a defender missile which autotarget any active bomb within 20k that is stuck to a capship in gangthe trick is a bomb explosion would slightly rock the cap ship  akin to bumping the ship  making alignment slightly more difficult however the ae damage removes the desire for many ships to constantly bump the cap ship meaning a more strategically aware and coordinated force will be able to use the bombs to their advantage while those ignoring their use will lose their own drones and shipsso in one fell swoop both bombs and defender missiles are incredibly useful and both stealth bombers and logistics ships get a shot in the arm
get rid of the bio instead
we need other things more practical than the stupid biothe lenght si neough for you to write some non sensical stuffhell no
basicly the claw has the worst locking range of all interceptors of the same tier and i for one cant find any good reason for thatclaw has 17km locking rangecrusader and taranis has 20km and the crow has a whooping 30km locking range base stats btw the simple fix would be to buff the locking range to 20km to keep it line with the other interceptors
i think all the intys should get a locking range boost especially those that get the scram range boost what is the point of having a 30 km scram when i can lock at 27km
nice checkbox there will be good
except that they havent taken time and effort they just havent bothered to tidy up their pos and have left ships in space instead of in the maint bayhell bring back pos bowling and then we can steal them and they can store them in the maint bay instead of leaving them in spacethe trouble is that all those things take far too much time  you cant realistically scan out a belt ratter or look for reinforcements coming to a fight or anything else which needs to give you the information in just a few seconds
add a toggle x show unboarded shipsproblem solvedand yes it is annoying
i agree fully
yup thats almost exactly what i had in mind  although overview settings andor another column showing the boarded status of scanned ships would both also fix the problem
several of these topics excite me good job csm

all of these setups are fairly solid but all of them suffer with one major problem  they are command ships that are setup to solo and the absolution and the nighthawk are not using their last high slot the sleip and the astarte are filling their final high with a gang mod and a turret respectively the abso and the nighthawk are not
i never said the nighthawk was good p i just said those setups dont give a fair comparison basically your setups significantly understated the night hawk i do agree it needs a boost but its not that weakalso they arnt just setup to solo gang mods on field command ships isnt a must even if it is nice leaving highslots unfit is a common practice than can increase any ships effectiveness  see torp raven re the drake yes while the nighthawk is marginally better than one the drake really is much better for the price btw drop an lse and change out the rcu for a dc to get about 85k effective
i did you cant thumbs up twice i fully support fixing the nighthawk
a keep in mind that hams do not receive a bonus on the nighthawk the nighthawk is designed to be an antisupport shipb as ive stated multiple times in this thread my posted setups are as close to being realistic while remaining both true to each ships role and analogous to one another such a restriction means that for the sake of an accurate comparison the setups must lean a little out of the norm ive already explained this facti understand your point however the torp raven does not receive a bonus to that last empty slot so its not a proper comparison throwing away the gang mod bonus on a command ship is a waste in my humble opinion as such i balanced my opening setups to make full use of the ship its bonuses and to remain as true to each ships inherent advantages as possibleregardless thats not to say your setups or comparisons arent illuminating i simply believe that if proper comparisons are to be done then the ship needs to be setup according to its strengths and bonuses
it does receive bonuses to heavy assaults p interestingly enough while the last two bonuses do not appear to apply to heavy assault missiles in the database it actually looks like they do eft certainly agrees with me i have not confirmed this in game however that could use some fixing while where at italso the warfare link bonus is no different than any bc gets or carrier gets how many carriers and do you see with ganglinks
this isnt a question of whether field cs should be fitting gang mods the question is are they capable of doing so with sensible fitting choices the nighthawk is not hence the required 140150 pg boost
a reread the bolded portions of your quote as you pointed out the description does not reflect a bonus and from my understanding the bolded syntax is how the bonuses operate ingame not to mention the missile precision portion of the bonuses is essentially useless however that is for another thread another day have to fight one battle at a timeb carriers rarely use gang links for two reasons  1 command ships in gang should be using them 2 they have better things to use in those highs  and the gridcpu to fit them however gypsio stated above a better explanation of the problem any ship that can fit a module and is designed to do so should be judged according to its design philosophy it would be akin to saying that exhumers make fine substitutes for logistics ships when fit properly sure they may but look at the purpose behind a ships bonuses in order to put it to its proper use
looking at the database as far as i can tell the bonus applies to both the description is wrong however i dont have a nighthawk pilot anymore if someone can confirmdeny this in game  eg undock a ham nighthawk and shoot something unresisted with scourge and with something else to see if one does more damage why should field command ships use them certainly fleet should with the bonus to effectiveness but why should field field command ships also have better things to do with those highs and the gridcpu to fit thembasically the issue with the nighthawk isnt that i am not fitting it with a ganglink its that i need a reactor control ii and awuv to have a prayer of fitting it so yes boost the pg but not because it cant fit a ganglink
that would be news to me and is good news concerning the damage but the missile precision bonus is still utterly worthlessthe nighthawk does not have the grid to fit anything meaningful in that last high slot hell the nighthawk doesnt even have the grid to fit a basic heavy missile launcher setup to quote my opening post regardless im preaching to the choir here youve clearly read the thread and have eloquently stated your case i cant say i disagree with any of it other than i believe in fitting gang mods on command ships whether they are field commands or not
this is wrong question to ask the correct question to ask is are the field cs able to fit gang mods the answer of course is that three of them can do so without too much trouble but the nighthawk cannotin any case theres little point flying a field cs without a gang mod  youd normally be better off in a bs the nanosleip is the exception but nobodys asking for the sleipnir to be nerfed
i fully support this idea
just adding the blue cross red star etc on the targeting icon would be enoughid also like a never fire hostile effects on friendlies option i can tick as i hate that thing that happens when a target dies as you are activating weapons and your cursor jumps to another target  that can end up with you shooting friends
thumbs up for this good idea
signed again please make this append 3
this item is being discussed next csm meetin  i think both bane and myself brought it up oo 
well in a general sense i have no huge problem with different ships in different races being different i wouldnt want there to be 4 carbon copies of the thorax each with a different paint job i agree entirely with your point that the carriers are a bit samey at the same time though theres some shipclasses that exist solely to fill a particular combat niche interceptors would one that springs to mind  they exist to be fast and tackle stuff and maybe do a bit of damage as far as im concerned blockade runners are quite comparable  theyre not all that variant but thats as much because they have about the same slot count as an inty anyway but like an inty core to their operation as a viable ship is the ability to fit a mwd i can see the furore right now if ccp decided that actually crows and raptors should be afterburner ships  although to be fair the craptor might as well be  its not like you can actually fit guns and a mwd but thats less of a problem because the crow exists 
this poster has interesting and fun ideas i think these ideas could easily be extended to the empire stations that exist as well  as in it turns out that jita iv4  the planet  is able to produce a lot of hightech trade goods so those are available cheap in the iv4 station etc kind of like tradewars 2002  hahahaha sweet bbs games  brought to eve but it makes rp sense and makes tradegood hauling a potentially useful and interesting miniprofession especially if done in real time  player a and player b both pick up huge loads of trade good x for delivery at planet z player a gets there first and makes a killing player b gets there second and  is stuck with a load of trade good x  have to manage this in terms of not revolving it around dt like the old trade goods system used to do so freighter pilots in some tzs got rich but i really like the ideaneeds balancing like everything else but great initial idea hope it goes somewhere will lead to some neurotic traders constantly refreshing their market windows d
it would be nice to have a logistics ship with a high sensor strength and bonuses to projected eccm optimal rangestrength at present you can either be jammed or waste one or two medslots for eccm modules on each ship in the fleet which can sometimes be very hard  especially for amarr due to the lack of med slots  projected eccm on the other hand is unviable because it requires two ships to boost each others sensor strength if one ship is jammed the other is much easier to jam option a a new logistics ship would introduce a new attractive way to combat jamming and would add greater flexibility to fleet setups it would also encourage specialization and teamwork option b cdedit aarh paragraphs
this problem is pretty well known among the outlaw portion of players if you assist an outlaw  ill use remote repair as an example  it gives the repairer a criminal flag regardless of the outlaws current status this means that the sentry guns will attack a character who remote reps an outlaw even if the outlaw has no flag and is not being attacked by sentries there is also a sec hit of 025 half of the hit for criminal aggressionmy question is why is it like this if you assist someone at war you are flagged to his war targets if you assist someone under sentry fire you come under fire too that makes sense but why should you come under fire and have a sec hit simply for helping an outlaw i suggest the mechanic is changed to give the repairer the temporary equivalent of an outlaw flag anyone would be able to shoot him but he would not come under sentry fire without further aggression from either him or the people he is assistingedit im not sure if people are quite understanding the distinction im making between outlaw and global criminal flag outlaws dont automatically take sentry fire unless they perform a further criminal act so why should someone assisting the outlaw be treated as a criminal if you assist someone with a global criminal flag nothing needs changing from the current mechanicsedit 2 a further thing that ive just had pointed out to me its legal for someone to kill and pod their corpmates in high sec yet its illegal for someone to remote repair an outlaw corpmate do you still not see the problem here
because technically the outlaw is at war with the ruling societies hence the gcc making you in effect an accomplice to the outlaw
i dont see what the issue is here if anything there should be more penalties right
my point is that an outlaw could be sitting at a station doing nothing taking no sentry fire because he has not attacked someone another player activating a remote rep on the outlaw would take a sec hit and sentry fire for doing soto give a good example of why this is a problem ill give you a scenario of a gang of outlaws fighting a gang of war targets the war targets are legal targets so the outlaws can engage without taking sentry fire if one of those outlaws attempts to assist a gang mate with a remote rep he gets a criminal flag and starts taking sentry fire this makes no sense to me  the sentry guns are happy to let the outlaws fight without interfering but they arent allowed to assist each other
ugh i knew this sort of argument would come up you effectively want outlaws to be under constant fire everywhere making it very difficult to fly small ships maybe we shouldnt be allowed to dock either oh and sorry if you were joking its hard to tell in text
yes i was joking do to aggro for criminals in a logical fashion would hurt more gameplay than it would help and remove a style that ccp has actively encouragedthat said i dont see any issue with the current game mechanics it was specifically put in not that long ago shrugs
was it its not a change i remember it just seems odd to me that the penalty for helping an outlaw is harsher than the penalty for simply being an outlaw making the repairer a legal target for everyone for 15 minutes would make more sense
the system should be more like thisif you assist an outlaw you get 15minute global allowed to shoot however if the player you are assisting does something which flags him it should than flag you
that is exactly what i was suggesting thanks for putting it more concisely than i managed
this is another area of the game about which i know nothing but it is silly for you to be penalized for helping an outlaw more than the outlaw is penalizedassisting an outlaw should put you in the same security boat as the outlaw is currently in  if under fire you come under fire if a legal but unfired upon target in highsec you become a legal but unfired upon target in highsec with the standard timerssupporting giving consideration to this issue since it seems silly right now
i want that the csm will bring to the ccp the following issuewhy the european player need to play more than the rest of world for the same product paying with credit card is a 1495 euro per month for europe  including vat  and 1495 for the rest of the world if we consider that i need to pay vat for the 1495 the price is 177905 but at current euro  dollar exchange 1 euro  15852 dollars today so we from europe need to pay 2369874 instead of 177905 so there are 590824 more than the rest of the world  33 more in fact  when the 30 days gtc where still in we from europe we had at least the options to buy a gtc and so paying aprox the same price as the rest of the world but now we dont have no option
perhaps you should take up this vat related issue with your government and ask them why they are charging it
yep welcome to the european unionin order for ccp to provide you the ability to play eve the governments are going to charge them vat on the service  just like they do all mmorpgs now 
as i mentioned the problem is not the vat because with vat i will need to pay 177905 and i accept that but ccp is charging me 2369874  33 more  and again why i should pay 33 more than the rest of the world  more is considered what is above 177905  1495  vat 
are there international charges on your debitcredit card added ini know many companiesbanks add them in as well
tax and bank charges are besides the point ccp has nothing to do with those surchargesthe problem is that european players are paying about a third more for the same service that has to changeeditto clarify there will always be fluctuations in exchange rate and i certainly dont expect ccp to follow the daily exchange rate a small difference isnt a problem the price difference has become unreasonably large though im sure ccps records show massive amounts of european players switching from credit card to gtc but we shouldnt have to
get a breakdown of the bill so you know what the price is5 is likely a bank surcharge added in with the vat or simply a conversion of currency valuestill you have a detailed bill showing what makes up what on the bill you dont knowand its not ccps fault if they have to charge more for vat and related charges the price listed doesnt include them
quick lets be gots and base the price of every good and service on the planet off of the united states dollar and drive it into the groundif you dont know how currency exchange works then stfu please
thats as much speculation on your part as it is on mine fact is ccp is charging the exact same ticket price in two different currencies when one of those currencies is a little over 150 the value of the other one its a reasonable assumption theyre not using math voodoo to determine the exact pretax price point where both currencies meet after their their respecive taxes and surcharges have been applied
please check stats before you postall medium weapon types get lower cpu for short range fitall medium weapons except hams get lower grid fit for short range while hams get a rather stiff penalty that means losing tankdamage modifiersgun users get to fit more damage mods and tank if they go for short range weaponerymissile users have to use more fitting mods if they go for ham short range weaponerythis means dropping tank and damage modsbasically putting the ham user back where he started dps wise but still suffering the range decreasethis is a issue for any ship fitting hams not just caldarilets not get into ship issues here there are other threads for thatbtw what would you fit on a onyx if not launchers  it has no turret slots 
your comparison is irrelevant weapons are not balanced on the basis of pretty patterns but on their abilities jav hams do almost the dps of faction hms to almost the same range making hamls unquestionably a better weapon system than hmls  the inability to fit fofs and the larger explosion radii are largely inconsequential giving hamls lower pg than hmls as well as cpu would be absurddps on an onyx is also irrelevant its there to tackle so it needs mods that help it tackle therefore nos as defence against neuts and smartbombs as defence against drones  particularly ecm drones  are a better choice
so youll be happu if fe medium autocannons needed 20 more pg than artilery and had 300 resolution  i mean you cannot rely on pretty patterns so why bother 
yes fix this
i said that weapons are balanced based on their abilities youre being silly
from what i have read this is my best idea for sovereignty control in 00 space we need to keep the pos in 00 since there are so many of them would not be fair to just make them all disappear but i would suggest adding a smaller defensive building that can help claim space in 00 make it a defensive platform with low or none fuel cost so large and small corporation can expand more easily without needing superhuman players mining round the clockthe other feature that would be necessary to maintain this kind mass empire growth would be a small siege mode ship make it about cruiser class ship that has the ability to take down the defensive platforms and the poses in 10 to 12 blast this will force larger alliances to claim only the amount of space they can upkeep it will also make it easier for smaller corps to take part in 00 interaction there is the issue that 12 siege ships could just shot at once to counter that these ships could take a bit of time to setup and that the reduction in empire size would help alliance be more aware of the space they ownthe last thing i had in mind is a method to exchange a pos for isk so that not all the pos that are active will be destroy by these new cruisersthanks for reading i do have to give credit to a gax blogger sara pickell for the siege cruiser idea
there is a big difference in beams and lasers the fitting requirements on beams is terrible meanwhile i can fit blasters and rails on gallenteacs and artys on minmatarand missles or rails on caldari without sacrficing to much tank i got empty slots on alot of my amarr ships because i cant fit the rest of my tank when fitting beams a decrease in powergrid for beams has been long over due please lets bring this topic up and get a resolution of some kind
completely agree logoffski is brokenif you log at a gate and are scrammed before you emergency warp  you are held there until either you are blown up or let goif you emergency warp to a safe spot you stay for 2 minutes during which time if youre not scrammed your ship leaves the gameif you are pvpd flag at any time you maintain a 15 minute timer before your ship leaves the game  regardless of connection state
wel if ur gona delete my only defense then atlest giv freiters huighslots an medium slots adn maybe lowslots so i can atlest defend my self
there are defenses corpmates alt scoutswhoever jumps a friggin freighter unscouted into lowsec deserves to lose iti think youre trolling us anyways so gtfo
missions or mining hard i think not
im against being pushed into anything having the option to group up is fine but being forced to do it would be stupid it removes the elements of choice and freedom from the eve experience and eves supposed to be a sandboxfor instance right now im in a 2man corp with me myself and my zero skill training sameaccount placeholder alt what would someone like me do if i couldnt make decent isk by myselfim taking a break from the corporate lifestyle  after 4 years of it i got tired of expectations mandatory ops and all of the other stuff you have to do as a member of an active corporation im enjoying the freedom to do whatever the  i want when i want and be damned to anyone who says otherwise and i dont want to be in a corp with other people trying to tell me what to do right nowedit plus the ability to log on and just go make some decent isk without having to spam 55 million sp pvper lfg to do missionz for 1530 minutes after logging on is one of the reasons i much prefer eve to traditional mmosmost definitely not supported
fix lvl 5 missions and make them a profitable group activity do not let cap ships go in those missions just battleships
exactly and you want to make somewhat mandatory the wait till the rest of your friend is on line game stile for missions it is more than sufficient to have to wait hours for a 00 gang in mission it is the worst possible thing to add
i think people are missing that these are new things to be added so the existing solo earning methods would remaingiven that i support this as a goal  although id be interested to see some more concrete examples than the current vague ones
op is mostly a whine thread albeit a very good one  identifies a problem identifies a lot of nonsolutions but doesnt really propose anything new but im supporting it anyway because i want more people to think about thisi will suggest some concrete possibilities both based on the idea of triggered activities involving gang size1  make mission spawns scalable in terms of the number of people in the gang and maybe the ship types if applicable of the player owning the mission for a given spawn assign points to npc combat ship types and determine the number of points to spawn in based on the spawntriggering gang size on a slowgrowth exponential one possibility might be that the normal spawn is 3 battlecruisers for a single player but with 2 players you might get a battleship and two battlecruisers or 5 battlecruisers out of the spawn more players in gang  larger more interesting more lucrative spawns  win probably have to cap gang sizes for missions lest 100 mangangs hop into missions and spawn hundreds of battleships to kill of course tanking that would be interesting in its own right d needs balancing but the idea has some merit i think2  apply this same idea to other areas of the game particularly exploration even a mining site could be spawned bigger  more rocks higher quality etc  if there are multiple people in system for the explorer that first triggers the spawn in that explorers gang and of course any guards get spawned bigger too  more interesting npcs would help a lot here too imagine jumping into a mission with 3 friends only to get jumped by a bunch of multiple kms tacking scramblers and a nanohac npc gang thatd be interesting  just some thoughts i am in favor with the ops idea of making the game more amenable to group play thats always a good idea
supported but needs to be worked out everyone would like a pew pew mode of earning iskies with your corpmates
there is a very big problem with this exp can only apply to one character but with isk it can be transfered around so if someone makes like 10 alts just to go ratting they get 10x the isk for no extra work rawr you lose
the problemthere have been in the past incidents that have led to the erosion of trust that ccp employees are not abusing their positions to favor their own in game alliance or corporation over others most notably the t2 bpo scandal of a year ago which was partially responsible for the formation of the csmnow i want ccp employees to enjoy the game just as much as i do indeed i wouldnt want to play a mmo that the devs didnt also enjoy because the results are usually disastrous  star wars galaxies the devs didnt play nor liked it altered it to suit them lost 200k players however given that the 00 endgame and even the empire economic game are political and can be affected game wide by the powers that devs and other ccp employees have it is important that we as players are able to trust that in game as a player no ccp employee will be able to do anything that any of us cannot do there is a perception out there that certain alliances get favored treatment because of the number of ccp employees who are members backed up by the fact that this has happened in the past  aforementioned t2 bpo scandal  something more than the csm and internal affairs needs to be done to rebuild this bridge of trustproposed solutionthe answer to speculation and rumor of course is fact so i propose that on a monthly basis that ccp release a count  not names  of employee characters that are members of each alliance all ccp employees should be required to report to ccp how many charactersaccounts they have to internal affairs and any event of joining or leaving any non npc corpalliancethee count would be released to us as statistics only no names just foom alliance 3 employees etcwhat this would achievesince it would now be known how many employees are in each alliance this would serve as a serious disincentive for any ccp employee to intervene on behalf of their own in game interests and to be covert as in making sure that no one knows their true identities this would force ccp employees to self policeexample if foom alliance which has 3 ccp employees as members suddenly starts getting ships reimbursed left and right whilst their rival boom alliance with 0 ccp employees dont even in the same battle with lets say a node crash happened there could be an investigation to see if improprieties were committed my feeling is no such thing would ever happen as alliances that knew they had employees in them would themselves be on their toes to prevent any perception of favoritism
do you honestly believe this would lead to anyone trusting ccp more look at caod and alliance politics in general  the only thing this would create is more distrust as people will immediately blame any loss to their rivals on ccp  they have more ccp employees than us thats why they won in addition wouldnt this lead to witch hunts as alliance leaders tried to determine which of their members were actually developers for the purpose of either outing them trying to take advantage of them or unfairly influence themi think that we need more transparency but sadly this isnt the correct way to go about it
if you dont trust ccp to begin with why would you trust any numbers given out by ccp this addresses a nonissue really waste of resources
we actually had a discussion about this during our meetinginternal affairs is already aware which employees have which characters where in addition as far as i know all previous characters are deleted when someone becomes a ccp employee and they continously monitor all ingame activity of all employees with screening of all their logsany further abuse would be highly unlikely
while that is good  if true  its not good enough too much of the fox guarding the henhouse ccp took a serious credibility hit with the t20 scandal and trust is harder to rebuild than it is to buildi think transparency in the form of making the count public is still the best way to do this even with ia knowing  what is reported anyway  where their characters are and what they are doing its not enough ccp cant stop isk farmers from a third world country from operating they certainly cant stop their employees from maintaining accounts and characters they dont know about if they are determined to do so this is why its important to know where the devs are playing ccp isnt going to act on anything unless we know about it and force them to hell they never even fired the dev who caused this to begin with a dev determined to cheat could very well be on the level with the accounts he reported but not with the one s  that he does not unless ia has a reason to check they likely wont
these two statements dont make much sense when put together if the devs are playing on a different account with different billing information  ie using their spouserelatives name  how will this suggestion change any of that
just having it known that there is a dev in the alliance will prevent shenanigans those hidden accounts wouldnt be so hidden at that point
but how will they know if the dev is using different billing information
hmm lets see ccp announce that there are 2 devs and a gm in insert alliance name here insert alliance name here internal forum admin automatically searches for ip addresses originating from iceland  ding ding ding now we know who the devs aresorry no thumb for this one
problem 0 and o look the sameeffect they can be mistaken for each other this problem is extremely annoying if one is trying to pronounce system names so that others can type it in and does not know whether that circle is an o and an 0 if a system name contains more than one o or 0 the possible variations space expands exponentially  proposed solution fix the font make o thicker or strike through the 0 diagonally
6 and g are also hard to tell apart in the in game font
so are the 6 and 
for me its 8s and 9s could just be the size of the font though
the only solution use a font with serifs
i want to hold him to pet him to squeeze him and love him i will call him mr scruffles and he will be the bestest puppy in new edenhuggles
i suppwort my cuteness
introduction of puppies will take a minimum of developer time and add something new and interesting for empiredwellers and carebears in general to use supported
my personal viewshould all capitals be allowed to us jbs i would say no if you were to prevent motherships and titans from utilising a jb network you would vastly neuter the big complaint about titan blobs in cynojammed systems if the defenders were limited to normal caps things would be a bit more balancedthe reason im in favour of not killing the whole mechanic is capital industrials if you cant move a jf or rorqual around cynojammed space you might as well not have them any change made to prevent capital blobs needs to remember that not all caps are offensive
i support that post i quoted before any salvage thief repeats the same old failed logic that the wreck is not owned by anyone we could change it to cant be salvaged by players that are not in the same gangcorpalliance as the player whose name is on the wreck
so does this mean that caod is the official militia subforum
i most certainly not hope so too much 00 entities around here who never give a  about fw but feel the need to post and actually read it anyway but they dont give a fuk about fwactually i like the chaos in fw that keeps the fun in it instead of fat 00 blokes being all damn serious about the fights backstabbing blobbing bubbeling smacking etc great tactics in 00i do not mind you guys giving advice but keep the smack in other threads
what are you talking about i think you have me confused for someone elseas of right now the only fleets i have led the past 2 months were 2 amarr militia fleets early onas of right now i have led no caldari fleets and i am also just a member of tacos revolution not a director not a ceo not a founder this toon is the only alt in caldari militia all the others are not involved in fwthe actions of the corp that i am involved in are not my responsibility i have no leadership position other then fcing my own fleets which i can do from any corp including the npc ones if i really wanted to
in other news i plan to run a roaming gang tonight if no one else is running any good gangs nothing is going onill tell you what to fly when the time comes
killing caldari is a dirty job but someones got to do it
but the inconsistency with that is  of which i am speaking and you are ignoring  when a pvp battle occurs and player a blows up player bs ship the loot in player bs ship belongs to  wait for it  player b  this is why player a is usually angry when scavengers come and loot the wrecks because they cannot shoot them  to be consistent if you blow up a rat the loot should also belong the rat itself and that would mean no aggro to anyone when the looted itif you want consistency lets go all the way the loot from the missions is also fair gamethere fixed happyoh and by the way i didnt invent ninja salvaging but i did perfect it so the next time you want to shoot your mouth off and say i dont know what im talking about dont
lets go the other way the salvage from the missions is also aggro flaggedthere fixed happy
me facepalmsok then while were throwing out stupid ideas how about if you shoot me while im in your mission after i get aggro for salvaging the wrecks my entire corp gets aggro on youi mean since were throwing out our best moronic ideas after allme mutters these mission runners just never learn
i would check what ship you are flying and would act accordingly
im sorry  youre confusing morality with legalitycurrently stealing it is legal which doesnt make it rightin the real world if i walk onto your property beat you up take your crap and kick you off your own land with no compensation i expect you would agree with me that such behaviour is unethicalhowever in zimbabwe if you are the government or one of their buds  its legal which doesnt make it the least bit more righti however still see taking my salvage as stealing and you may count on me treating it as such even if i have to pop some of my own profit warp out to let the rats have the ninja or jump them in a ship fitted for suicide gankeveryone is entitled to their opinion of course  but i plan on backing mine up with blasters
so one thing that makes this game pretty great is the fact that over time you can get into better ships and have more power behind those ships but i have been thinking that unfortunately while at the same time it makes it great it might turn off the newer players to eve this game is dominated by the older players with no way of anyone new coming tot he game of really competing i thought that maybe if some kind of newb player areas were introduced that perhaps it would bring more folks to eve get them into the action faster and i dont mean like high security space i mean like newb low sec or some such where those nwere to eve could pvp each other without the older players poping them or harassing them till they are ready to get out into that kind of thing alot of the newer players i believe get turned off by the fact that it takes so long to get anywhere even close to the older players and they can hardly compete in anything like pvp or what not with them this game certainly takes a long while to get into alot of exciting things but i believe if some newb areas were introduced it would be alot more interesting right off the bat
if only there was something like oh i dont know a faction warfare system where the ship sizes were limited to cheap low end craft making it easier for new players to compete on the same playing field as older players learn some starter pvp skills and get generally get their feet wetif only eh
ah but thats where your wrong the faction warfare system also has other more skilled players competing in it what im talking about is with only those players of the lower skill in the area not all the players a small cheap ship fitted with t2 is still fairly destructive
join a player corp
perhaps but what the point of what i am suggesting is to make the game alittle more interesting at first joining a corp sure it might be interesting depending on the corp and alot of new players dont nessacerily want to join a play corp at first they are too shy too good for it want to get acclimated or whatever to the game first i remember the first corp i was in it wasnt all that excitingrat here etc etc i personally think the best thing about this game is pvp but the newer folks cant compete with the older players in that at all and end up leaving or just not signing on anymore even if they are in a player corp because they are blown out of the sky easily
thats the funny thing about eve everyone is blown out of the sky easilyfinding a corp who will run pvp gangs isnt that hard especially now that faction warfare exists all you have to do is get in a frigate join a gang and hope someone else is primary
yes everyone is but when your new to eve and all you do is get blown out of the sky it becomes very difficult to find reasons to stay and as for joining a corp and such well some can do it some cannot all depends on circumstance and well i just would not rather leave it up to circumstance anymore i think that adding areaas that only newer players can go into would make it easier for them to get into fighting rather than having to join or such
eve if they brought it back it qowuld be mroe expnesiveccp wanted to rais prices to refelct their needs and nothing is going to change that rather close the game down than function at a loss or with limited developement capability
just buff citadel torpedo damage and speed imobetter than changing a bunch of other  to compensate for low dps
what about hp as well one of the other big concerns i see coming up a lot with the phoenix is the fact its easy to just smartbomb citadel torps
1 faction warfare seems to have turned into a great success2 jita have always been laggy and will always be laggy as long as people like you streaming into the systems it will never become betterso you are wrong on both accountssorry but if you are going to whine at least ensure you got your case right
if i remember correct there are no ingame kb because ccp dont want to put the focus on number of kills but raterher on the war itself i think that is a good thing killboards are really too counter strike ie not a good thing
the focus already is on the almighty kb they just mostly lie barring a few notable exceptions shrugs
killboards are the one of the worst player developments to ever tarnish what eve truly isthe only reason my corporation has one is because several of the members wanted to keep track of what they kill and lose if it wasnt for that i wouldnt have botheredto be honest id rather see the removal of killmails all together
the problem of the prechanged dampeners was that you could fit them on almost every ship to have a good portion of ewar with you they were in my opinion just to strong on non specialized shipshowever after the change they are fine on regular ships imho but the gallente recons and the eas are suffering badly from that lets do what have many people done before and compare it to the falcon a single falcon on the battlefield means in any case that at least    one of you ships is completely out of the game in some cases this could of couse also mean 2 or 3 ships the falcon is sitting at 200 km while doing that a range where noone in a usual roaming gang can lock itok back to the gallente ships with an gallente recon you have to be in med or close range combat to get the full effectivenes of your damps a single damp in this combat range is mor the less useless so you have to spend all your damps  lets asume 3  on one single ship after that  because of th weakness of the damps stacking and so on  most ships will still have a locking range of 10 to 20 km if you now think of all the close range ships out there in small gang warfare which have to get closer then 10 km to shoot anyway and also all the speedships which could come in closer in almost no time to tackle you again this isnt very nice at allsome of you guys will now say hey the gallente ships have those cool scram range bonuses as well yeah and they are rightthis was one of the features of these ships because of which i have trainied thembut novadays you have interceptors with their new scram range bonuses and their speed as well as their small signature radius they are the much better tacklers in my personal opinionso the conclusion of this is as followsthere is atm no reason to bring one of those formerly so nice gallente ewar ships if you want a tackler you take a much cheaper ceptor if you want ewar a falcon obviously is the better choiceso what to do about that issue thats of couse not easy because a gallente recon shouldnt be an iwin button i personal favor a dampener strength bonus increase on those ships so that you can take out one  but not more  ships out of the combat which means for me lockrange around 5km if this seems to overpowered in a 1 vs 1 situation then i would think of giving up the damage bonus of the recons and maybe a smaller drone baythese ships are for nasty ewar stuff not for damage a second possibility would be to give an optimal    range bonus to those ships so that they can sit at 150 km while dampening their targets this would make them usefull in some anti sniper situations but of couse the cool scram range bonus would be useless and topic supporting this

i would like to add to the above that currently heavy interdictors with their focused infinipoint can scram at t1scramrangeonagalrecon and do not need to sacrifice any of their other options to achieve thisalso once rsds start having a chance to fail they tecnically become ecm modules lacking the ability to effect close range targets ecm also does not suffer from stacking penalies 2 ecms are twice as effectivei hope you are not suggesting using a celestis as a combat vessel the weaponry on the celestis only suffices to scare off an unexperienced tackler pilot in frigate sized craft  which imho is ok since it is not a combat ship please notice that mentioning a tank in conjuction with celestis class ships  that fit their medslots according to the bonuses  is a bit weirdonce the enemy comes below dampener range the ship is lost with a 100 probability the ecms on the blackbird class or the cap neutralization from arbitrator class vesels have higher chances to prevent destructionyou can not nano and tank and ewar it it makes a bad nano due to insufficient cap and low top speed a buffer tank is possible but it is a weak one it can not gank because even with bonuses it does very little dps 60 of those mentioned 200  which is only true if you use close range antimatter  come from hammerhead t2 drones which have to enter close range an can be destroyedplus the ships have cap issuesthis is not true a single t2 dampener will take 45 off your targeting range  using an arazu with all skills at 5 and a range dampening script  a hurricane can lock 25km  skills at 3  under this condition  45km for a ferrox  if you ment a disruptor on an arazulachesis okyes i took the race with the lowest locking range note however that exactly this race can close the lockout zone very fast and also often uses explosive damage
signed specialized rsd ships should actually function close to what existed prenerfeditto answer the csm quesiton the point of gallente ewar ships should be to force their opponents to get up close and personal that fits right in the whole gallente fighting doctrine  blasters anyone 
im loving this idea but set it so you need a covert cyno to use the portal to jump your friendsbut on a side note the cost of the bo ships is the fact they cost to much there is no point using a ship with this high cost when you can just use a smaller group of eg nano hacks to do similar hit and run strikes
bo was designed to make something behind enemy lines just give them the ability to port a squad in any system eve if have cynojammer  that means 10 players in noncapital ship
a copypaste from my post on a shipsmod threadright time to do this i thinkblack ops proposals1 allow cov ops cloaks nukes the speed bonus  has no real role  so goes base speed removes the scan res problems that have been experienced gives black ops a true guerilla warfare stealth apeal doesnt make them overpowered a force recon that has the movement of a bs  easy to catch when organised2 all black ops to have their roles to be changed to their recon variants widow  ecm strength ecm range same bs bonus  missile velocity  rof  sin  scramble range sensor damp effectiveness same bs bonus  drone damagehp blaster damage  panther  web rangeeffectiveness target painting effectiveness same bs bonus  large proj rof and damage  redeemer  nosneut range  note not nos amount  tracking disrupting effectiveness same bs bonus  cap use reduction turret rof purpose of these changes force recons are somewhat balanced to a greater extent imothe falcon might be somewhat overpowered and thus a battleship variant is again a bit too strong but for such a highly specd and expensive ship i personally believe it should be a bit better than a 70 mil falconp  damage ability the panther bonus i believe is balanced due to the ability to act like a normal bs but with uberstrong webs gives it the bonus of speed  out of their web range  along with damage gives it a nice little combo above the rapier the sin is somewhat underpowered in the most part due to the damps not being that fantastic however the flip side is an 80km scramble range who needs tacklers when you have a bs that can do it from 80km off eh snipe with sentries highsmods as drone modsperfect imo damps play a part for those not sensorboostedthe redeemer some might as about the reason ive suggested range rather than amount is of the current pilgrim crisis the ship is seen as underpowered due to the bonuses the bonus of range is very useful as it stops counterneuting along with the other close range issuesnesessities such as tank  14km neut range  web range  death for speed tankers  along with overall tackling issues replacing the pilgrims bonus with range instead of neutnos amount would be on the road to fixing it likewise would be benifitial to the redeemer scenario here would be low slot tank neuts in high tracking disruptors in low helps the rest of the crew if getting shot at and the redeemer can always tankon the topic of tank i also propose black ops gain a tad bit of tank nothing major but something a bit better than cruiser status  which lets be fairit is  no actual numbers or thoughts on this  other than id like to be able to see my widow atleast stay above 60 shields when a drake launches a single volley at me pfinally jump drives  we need to have more range a fuel bay and personally some other extra for the jump bridge as of right now the jump bridge is rather limited as is the jump range my proposed change is that of  as others have suggedted  allow black ops to jump to a sun of a system by doing so it gives an easy opportunity for folks to restrict black ops movement  laying a bubble at a sun for example  yet adds a role to black ops combined with that it gives a jumpdrive ship the reduced need for a second character scenario where you always have to alt tab just to playfurther to improve this i believe cov ops cynos should work in cynojammed systems this would then allow folks to jump portal covert ships behind enemy lines in complete secrecy  as to location  this is still however possible without a cyno  via the sun  however for organised groups the latter is far more riskyi have no doubt that what ive said is overpowered unbalanced and so on however from where im sitting there a major holes in the black ops atm we need to start somewhere p
yes moar
how were they intended to be used do enlighten us
clearly jump clones were intended to make it so you could be anywhere at any timei hope they never lower the time 24 hours is nothing especially when you factor in that it allows you to be able to be active anywhere you have a clone as long as you havent recently jumped and if need be you can leave your expensive implantfilled main somewhere safe when going into a risky situation
although rank 6 is a bit much i do support a skill that lowers jump time
i would finaly use themsigned
we could just give everyone jump drives and make implants safely removable yeah
agree
that too
thumbs up
do you happen to be a candidate for the next csm term  youd get my support just for this post 
so buy the etc with real money instead of isk or use a  prepaid  credit card and pay less than a method that has a middle man
i agree theres nothing really wrong with the war dec system i used to belong to a small corp of about 20 or so players who deced other corps larger than us for fights if they didnt fight and just ran to a station and hid wed move on war decing is a way to still pvp without going into low sec to gate camp and get a sec penalty hit or going into 00 and getting wtfblobbed by large alliancesi do think there needs to be more substance to the war dec system but like you mentioned avoiding death is not that hard if you have a head on your shoulders its not my fault if i happen to blow up your dominix because you were autopiloting 6 jumps to jita during a war dec
support for this also the same thing should apply to constelation chat there you should have only the numbers not the actual playersfor those concerned that removing local will brake 00 activities it will not happen it will hurt a little only those big alliances with huge chunks of undefended space behind chokepoints well some will no longer be able to pay for 5 accounts with farmed isk then
i support this idea and would like to put forth an additional idea which might better support itas locater agents are an attainable resource  yet only available to a character who has worked at missioning to achieve  i would recommend enhancing the structure so that when one is stationside they would be able to perform a scan that could provide them with intel on where a group of war targets might bethis could be a whole other skill set such as science officer or some such whereby scanning the system would be based upon chance with improved identification of war target location based upon the level of skill achievedlets say that my corporation is at war and im docked up the warring corporation is currently camped outside my station and by checking the new local i get no information on whether or not they are in my system i use my science officer skills to do a scan of the system to find out that there are 2 war targets identified as being within range of my scanaware that my war targets usually fly small ships like cruisers i say ok ill take my chances and undock in my battleshipwhen i undock i find out that my skills only identified 2 war targets out of the 10 actual war targets that are camped outside  failed my saving throw ftl  and get omgwtfbbqdi do support the removal of local as an intel device however i think we also need the ability to have some type of visibility when undocking so that we wont need to lose a ship just to test the waters and see if its safe to undock the rest of our corporation fleet
local change is needed im not too bothered about the details as long as you can no longer instantly see the occupants of a system the constellation chat option would be fine
i support this thread and would like to see formal discussion of the issue with ccp  will be adding it to the agenda for csm discussion on 2072008
thats good newshas anyone thought how this would effect gate travel in 00 currently if the system youve entered is empty you just warp to the next gate with the local gone every gate would require a scanning bm maybe ccp could just give us a dropoutawarp button
less ability to pick and choose engagements meansless throwing together really expensive ships and expecting to be able to only partake in opportunistic engagementsmore surprises and ships looking at each other 30km away wondering if they want to commit to the engagement or not are we both flying bating ships arazus and rapiers get huge boost to importanceboosts to t1 ships you dont have to worry about losing because you have to worry about losing everything when any target can be a trapmore traps and shady tacticsmore ninja carebear action especially at complexes since they could deploy for a long time in a system without drawing attention and the image of getting ganked while going after a hauler will be in many peoples mindscloakers could use a bit more sensor nerfing its a fair trade to lose the ability to force engagements offensively in cases where you want to pick and choose engagementsmajor changes to undocking risk mechanics could use some help there
well its freightening how unimaginative ccp isyou tell them change all and whats their first idea do it really all at oncehell noone said that people merely want to save themselves the chore of having to click through each turred and select the proper ammo to reload then reload the guns where they misclicked againinstead you could just create a simple option that does this for them on the client side it will not generate more anything than what the player alone would have generated it would merely save your customers some time they could spend working around all the other issues there are with the ui
notes date of postlooks at calendarwonders how long week is to ccp
hahaha good one  support
well a year on jupiter is twelve years on earth so a week there would be about three months here if ccp were on jupiter then we should expect a response in about two more months
mining supportedbut really the mining missions could get a big lookover as they pretty much suck imo how i dunno but something would be nice to change
agreed chribbawhy is this thread really overlooked the 9 month old post too
definitely needed saves having to hope for a reply just so you can remember what you wrote
yes please making general improvements to the evemail system in general would help smaller corps to get off the ground making it more like a real mail client would really help corp ceos and directors to organize their corps things like a priority system  for those perma mails with links to kb and corp forums  a way to save drafts  instead of alttabing out to word  a more normal inbox or atleast a way to change the organization not just by sender but also by date and conversation just a few more ideas for an improved mail system
he was unjustly banned he only hacked the forums to get proof to post on eve forums for the players to see after he tried telling ccp and they blew him offhe exposed what is most likely the greatest scandal in eve so farunban 
i think you are all out place the asm forum is not the place to discuss bannings let alone request ccp tp ban or unban any player at all whats next ask to have the result of petitions reconsidered
i never said we werethe point of an upper bounds example is to demonstrate the underlying problemthe more you nerf suicide ganking the more desireable you make it for players to be in npc corpsthe protection provided by those corps is free and asking for it to be increased is somewhat disturbing  especially when the people in those corps also moan that suicide ganking should have a higher cost involvedthey ask for a cost increase for attack and yet are happy to indulge in free protection  i know it isnt absolute protection but it is an npc spawn to help you which is not available to members of player corps if they are a victim of a war declaration concord does not sanction random acts of violence in the space they protect but they do sanction wars however so long as people have a free mechanic they can use to avoid a war with no penalty many will abuse it with no regard to how it upsets the general game balance just so long as they are alrightrenforcing that mindset is ultimately bad for the development of the game and is a much broader issue than the symptom which is getting all the attention in this threadthe proposal i made for nonnewbie npc corps managed to bring together some factional protection and penalties for attackers which would heavily discourage prolonged war but would make selective targeting of ships viablei agree that there needs to be a level of protection as currently exists for new players  which would also restrict some player activities and development so as to encourage migration to either player run or the new style npc corps  but unfortunately it is being abused to an unbalancing extent by players who really are ready to stand on their own two feetasking for the penalties for suicide ganking to be increased without addressing those issues is playing in to the hands of those who already abuse the situationthe calls from those who gain free npc help to increase the cost for those who would do them harm are distasteful especially because they make those calls mainly so they can further absolve themselves from any personal responsibility for their own protectioni am not particularly fond of suicide ganking but i feel that nerfing it without tackling the larger inbalance is like taking asprin for a brain tumor because your head hurtsthat is what annoys me about the csm approach to this whole issue they are looking at gaining glory by dishing out kneejerk responses to flavour of the month problems without actually considering how the whole thing can be used as a jumping off point for widespread game improvementshow about using it to suggest item ownership as a hidden stat on thingsif it is in the posession of someone else that person is flagged to the owner an his player corp  a stolen module fitted to a ship or something in the cargo whateverwith skills the theif might be able to clean the item but they would never know 100 for sure if it was tagged in the first place and failure to remove a tag  if it exists or not  would result in the item being destroyedthat is just an idea off the top of my head used as an example to point out that there are far more interesting ways to tackle this issue rather than just trying to go with the flowthat is what the csm should be doing
oh pleasethey can operate just as well out of 1 man player corporationsor even larger ones the only benefit to many for being in a npc corporation is lack of politics and being hassled with wardecshere is a clue drive players out of the npc corporations and instead of being able to complain about the evil npc corporation youll be complaining about the thousands of 1 man corporations rather than post what i posted here ill give a link versus derailing the topic farther from the issue at handthis nerf is bringing things into balance because the risk to reward is out of whack currently with suicide ganksthey risk a couple million isk that they will make up while recovering security hits  and then some  to make easily a couple hundred millions if they pick the right shipsits so out of whack right now with reward versus risk that they dont bother to scan and pop ships left and right because a few million in loot pushes them into the black due to the insurance payout
i believe you have it wrong honestlysuicide ganking and protection from has no impact as to whether someone is in a npc corp or not if anything npc corpers are at more risk since there is no one to retaliate with a wardec or organized counter suicidewhat you are talking about is a completely seperate issue the wardec mechanics in the opinion of many players is broken that is what keeps them in npc corps whether it is accurate or not is up for debate right now but the more you whine that there is no way to wardec them the more your affirm that thoughtthere is one way to get more players out of npc corps increase the sense of security you get being in one there is a reason why when ccp asked the reason many players were in npc corps for a long time and the response of the vast majority was wardecssuiciding is a broken mechanic that has nothing to do with npc corps or not the wardec system is the reason why npc corps are a potentially broken mechanic fixing one will not effect the other
if the only way to attack a player is via a suicide attack then a suicide attack must remain a viable game mechanicif there is an alternative way to attack a player then there is no reason to defend suicide attacksso long as players can choose free immunity from war then suicide attacks are a fair game mechanic responsewar declarations and suicide attacks are interrelated and wishing it were not so does not make you rightyou will not be able to fairly balance suicide ganks whilst they remain the only way to attack some players even if they are a cheap way to attack anyonethe problem isnt that the attacks are too cheap it is that the cost of avoiding the alternative method of attack is even cheaperif everyone was a potential war target then it would be perfectly possible  from a balance perspective  to remove high sec suicide ganking completely because an equal and fair alternative mechanic to attack people would existhonestly the solution is a revamp of the war and npc corp systems  anything else is a bandaid for a heartattackhell i dont even think making it more expensive would work anywaypeople used to do it even when insurance fell well short of the market price of ships although ships were easier to kill back then
i think you wildly misunderstand my position on this and maybe you should look up previous posts i have made on this subjectall my suggestions for changing npc corps have imposed heavy and very real penalties on people who declare war on them which tie in very nicely with factional warfarepersonally think the problem isnt with the attitude of people wanting to stay in npc corps to avoid wardecs but that the possibility even existswhat exactly are they actively doing to gain an immunity that other players can not have no matter how hard they work at it in a player corpwhy should we have 2 classes of playerswhy should some be able to absolve themselves of a certain level of personal responsibility with no cost or effort and yet compete on an equal footing with those who take that responsibilitythat whole mindset is bad enough  but then when they moan that the bubble they live in still isnt strong enough  eve need the whole wardec npc corp suicide ganking kill rights contraband bounty systems looking at not in isolation but as part of a holistic approach to improving the general feel and balance of the game especially as it exists in empire spacetrying to tackle any one of these issues alone is bad enough but tackling multiple issues without consideration for the others is a recipe for disasterto be cleari am not in favour of suicide gankingi am not in favour of npc corps being open season for war decstrying to represent me as being 100 either of those positions would be at best disingenuous
drum roll suicides are still an option you just dont have a risk of 5mil vs a reward gained simply by popping any ship you feel likeyou now have to pick your targetsand stop the bs about the npc corps seriously that record gets old quick would there be much more difference if they formed 1 man corporations by the thousands where instead of one group of corps you could whinge about there were legionsbecause you know its not economically feasible to wardec a 12 man corporation much less tactically worth itso what would you do then spew the same blame them spiel but ask for minimum corporate members after x time
i seriously dont understand where youre getting this from you ignoremiss avons entire argument and instead rule out any change in the npc corp mechanism because you feel that the particular solution you offered up wasnt good enough as if what you could dream up was the only possible way to change the systemavon is completely right that suicide ganking is a part of a much greater problem that divides players up into those that are more or less completely secluded from the rest and those that are a part of the sand box npc corps have far too few  any  drawbacks and a ton of advantages and in a game where competition is everything that just doesnt make any sensetrying to patch together a fix for suicide ganking without fixing the underlaying problems is idiotic at best disclaimer i am not saying that all suicide gank victims are in npc corps i am merely stating that because npc corps are completely safe suicide ganking is a needed game mechanic otherwise the balance is shifted even more in favor of staying in the npc corpsas this is a thread about a symptom we havent really entered any discussion about solutions to the overlying problem but rest assured what you noted as the only solution is far from
please there is no problemyou have all the complaints but i cant wardec them because they are in npc corporations with no incentive to leavenerfrestrict the npc corporation and you get a legion of 1 man corporations so you can wardec them 1 at a timemost are still going to be protected since there are legit ways to counter a wardec  or even boost the price for one up to make it prohibitively expensive  war targets dont have to engage each other even with mutual wardecs  in a way similar to a spider tankread the link instead of one target adjusting npc corporations gives you a ton more of them that you cant  about anymore  unless its about how all these damn 1 man corporations are annoying since you cant wardec or deal with them all this patch changes the equation it does not remove the suicide gank  you actually have to work to break even or profit from the gank vs being out a piddling amount on a failed gank or for picking an empty ship 
did you not read my post at all i mean i know some people have this tldr problem but then they really shouldnt be engaging in a debate should theywhat you did in your post  again  was ignoring the overall argument and focus on setting up a strawman nobody has said that we should change the system so that instead of an npc corp we have tons of 1player corps thats not a feasable change and we all understand this the problem is that nobody is discussing that we are just arguing that a change to npc corp mechanics is needed because they offer too much protectiong with too little disadvantages now stop making up strawman arguments and discuss this properly or kindly stfu
and suiciding will remain a valid tactic the difference is that you will have to want to kill the person if you dont want them dead enough to pay the cost of the ship you dont really want them after all what is the price of a ship domi or geddon fitted is some 60m 23rds that if you build it yourselfif they were in a pc corp and your wardecs were full you would probably spend several hundred million on mercs to wardec them the cost of a suicide ship is cheap even without insurance compared to either you or them hiring mercs during a warthe cost of a suicide ship right now its nonexistant
and they still will use it the difference is they will use it when they want the person dead or against targets that are guarenteed to make them a profitthe haulers moving 1020m of junk wont be a viable target anymore targets will have to actually be chosen rather than just randomly blown up
you forget adding disadvantages will be incentive for them to create those corporations i saw one that couldnt understand that say limiting them to t1 ships wouldnt help because they would simply roll individual corporations to keep operating pretty much as they were  with the added bonus of flooding the database with a load more corporations people are going to adapt to the restrictions even if it means saying okay ill take a level in corporation management and see how many are going to waste the isk trying to play whack a mole with a legion of usadd in the fact the smart gankers would realize they can boost your costs of wardecing them if they operate as an impromptu alliance with spider wardecs to raise the price of declaring against them  with just 5 and spending less than a battleship they can push the price for declaring on one into the 5th level of cost and making them mutual at no further cost  nothing says you have to shoot a war target you have the ability to do so without a sec hitthink farther than you do now if people are dropping into them to avoid wardecs imagine the market when some alliances get formed just to offer mutual wardec services just to provide a bit of protection from others  you pay the cost of the wardec then a set fee for the service 
facepalmall the things you listed already happens there have already been alliances that let in anyone just to up the wardec costs all these things are symptoms of the same problem this is the problem we are speaking about this is why the mechanics has to change i cant give you a solution to all of this if i could i would work for ccp and it would already be in game all i can tell you is that you need to stop thinking in terms of existing mechanics and try to understand that we are speaking about changing those mechanics the underlying problem remains the same people have a way of opting out of the dangerous parts of eve these people can still compete at the same level as people who dont opt out this means that the path of least resistance leads to the npc corp this is why we have so many people staying in the npc corps year after year and that is why so many new players never leave their starting corp or move back into an npc corp after a brief foray into a pc corp all of this is a balance issue what needs done is a system that actually encourages conflict not just on a its fun basis but also on an ingame economical basis it needs to be lucrative to engage in combat this means boosting piracy rather than nerfing it it means completely reworking existing war npccorp and high sec agression mechanics it means we cant just go around applying bandaids to the gushing wounds in the game while suicide ganking may or may not  i still say not  be imbalanced as it currently stands fixing just that and ignoring all the myriad of other problems connected to it is trying to stop the hudson river by throwing yourself in the water its futile will lead to more problems and will get you wet  well maybe not that last part 
the system does for those that want that style of playthat is the key not everyone plays eve for the ship to ship combatsome prefer pve combat some prefer market pvpccp is going to make the game work for as many play styles as possiblethe problem is people dont play how you think they should but in a way that is acceptable to ccp right now its out of whack that a suicide gank of a cargo frigate loaded with 500m3 of t1 missiles can almost be considered profitable  even if the missiles are simply reprocessed and sold with mineral loss  just because a couple of the cargo hold expanders might drop
you missed the point  again  and im not really surprised anymore this game we have here  eve online just in case you thought i was talking of another game  is a fairly complex economic model this model is based on a number of factors such as supply and demand any nutter can provide a supply in this game as it is easy to manufacture the problem is demand mainly comes from one end  loss thusly we need loss of equipment in the game in order for the economic model to work loss of equipment  due to the inadequacies of the npcs  predominantly comes from combat encounters with other players thus we have established we require combat in the gamenow in order for us to have a somewhat fair economic model every player needs to be subject to potential equipment loss this means we cant have players that are virtually or actually immune to it this in turn means that every player  regardless if he likes combat encounters or not  needs to have a chance of suffering such encounters finally this means we cant have a system like we have today todays system in eve is setup in a manner that you can virtually opt out from combat if you just remain in high security and stay in an npc corp alternatively you can create a player corp  with all its benefits  and just jump ship when you eventually run into a combat encounter by just switching corp the only reason this system works is that we have suicide gankers who indiscriminally targets players in high sec they provide a modicum of balance to the otherwise risk free high sec life this balance is required as we have already established now there are two problems1 suicide ganking does not balance high sec enough there needs to be a complete rewrite of the mechanics to bring high sec life in line with other types of play styles this can be achieved in a number of ways like upping the risk of high sec or lowering the rewards the opting out has to be removed as well2 people who are used to the risk free high sec life see suicide ganking as a problem and want to nerf it they dont understand the underlying problems and just want to patch up this particular problem with no thought given to the consequencesso we are now in a situation where we face a nerf to suicide ganking what kind of nerf its going to be is as of yet not clear but something is coming at the same time nothing is being done to the other problems the reason for that being that noone is whining loud enough about them for the game to be balanced after a nerf to suicide ganking the other issues need to be adressed at once we can already see all the symptoms of the true problem
001 isk say this thread is never gonna see another dev reply
you forget risk vs rewardright now empire makes decent isk while operating there and it feeds the war machines in the lownull sec space  as well as the empire conflicts suicide ganking will say with the proposed changes it just makes it a focused attack vs spraying a random person and hoping they got at least 6mil in lootsalvage to recoup your costs with a profit what this does is make it so the ganker actually has risk related to the rewardso what if people can opt out of combat with players ships are lost hourly to npcs in missions and while rattingsuiciders are burning ships  and will slow slightly if they have to pick targets but they will focus on high reward targets vs the random ganks  for themselves and othersguess what its not fair it will never be fair a character can sit in a station and simply use buysell to make a fortune and you cant compete against them with guns its combat of sorts it manipulates the marketright now they see suicide ganks as being enough out of whack that they need a look at the cost to do one is nothing compared to the possible rewardsyes you have a bit of space that is reasonably safebut that sector is also home to faction warfare corporate warfare piracy suicides and simple npc kills so there is losses regardless of them being in position for a wardecit may cost more to cause them loss especially if no insurance for concord kills but just pick the targets that matter blaming all the ills on the npc corporations or people that opt out of player based ship to ship combat is a bit of a cop out to be honest it forgets the fact you are competing with the playbase 1 as is they are working on the problems  wardecs are being looked intobut the thing you fail to consider most of all they know where the majority of the paying customers are they know the skill makeups they know what corporations they are in and they know where their income is basedyou dont burn the money tree down you find ways to cultivate it
sorry explain to me how profiting from that playstyle is less valid than mining for exampleminers dont have to pay to suck on a roid to profit but gankers should have a cost involved in their tradeby your arguement people should have to carefully pick and choose their asteroids in case they actually make a loss  or does your arguement only apply to people who adopt a playstyle you personally do not supportas to the choice over loads of 1 man corps vs npc corps i would take the 1 man corps thank you very muchhowever the proposals i made are not so as inane as yours and allow for a balanced way to continue with npc corps with advantages and disadvantages  rather than a stupid example which does not even support the position you try to representi am not as you are so keen to imply trying to grief people out of the game  but rather looking for a way of expanding and enriching the entire game whilst bringing more balance and less extreme gameplayi envision a system where members of npc corps  not starter corps  are part of the eve story rather than opting out of it they gain benefits from the corps they are in and with the empire they are part of people who would attack them would suffer penalties to that corp and the empire if at war they would take penalties in line with factional warfare or even moreimagine a npc corp where you benefit from the backstory advantages of the actual corp and their relations with other corps effecting youa corp which would help defend its interests and its membersempires providing assistance to those who are being attacked even in concord sanctioned warsthose corps and empires penalising those who would bring violence to bear against them  factional hits station sentry guns docking rights and even the factional navy being part of a scaled responsethat is a better vision than nerf ganking or zomg 1 man corpsthe csm should be about vision not reaction  and it certainly shouldnt pander to those who still think that digital watches are a pretty neat idea
no i dont risk vs reward is at the very center of my entire argument im not surprised you didnt pick up on itwell congratulations youve managed to identify one of the biggest problems of all however it seems you actually see it as a good thing having a system where warring enteties are able to safely build up is not only unfair it is extremely stupid this is at the very top of the list of things that need to changeseems you just really cant get to grips what i am actually saying im not going to bother explaining it to you again instead im going to ask you to reread my posts im sorry but this is just a ludicrous argument npc losses are such a small part of total ship losses to be completely insignificant barring massive lag you really have to be a complete moron to loose a ship in a mission or belt ratthen why the hell are you so adamant about making suicide ganks fair he sure can if hes good enough of a trader to never have to leave his station all the more power to him truth is though that these players are extremely rare and most often an alt of a player that actually does leave the stationwhich is completely beside the point in what we are discussing right now take a look at that snippet from your post again try to spot the lapse of logicand we are asking for a rework of the entire system to make suicide ganking redundant by actually solving the real problems no its not a cop out its not forgetting the facts its actually stating the facts because you are competing with the player base the player base has to be open to any kind of agression econimical or physicalmhmm and they still dont solve the underlying problem just another treatment of symptomscontinued
a miner balances risk vs reward by1  picking the systems  security rating risk of suicides competition for asteroids 2  mining style  secure cans hold mining jet can 3  time  distance from trade hubs isk perhr of the ore so yes there are risks and other factors that affect mining besides pew pew so what would you do about a person that sits an alt in a station and makes millions and soon billions in isk by day trading goods you cant shoot them even with a wardec so they are invulnerable to you
and this is the biggest load of bs anyone can possibly put forth into this debate you are actually saying that ccp should change their game because  you believe  most of their income comes from players who dont really like the entire game but just parts of it you are saying ccp should remove the parts you dont like because in your demented little carebare brain you actually think you are in the majority truth is youre not most people who come to this game do so because of the way the game is set up if they wanted a carebear game they would play wow or everquest or any of the myriad of other games that caters specifically to that play style eve doesnt eve caters to the dedicated gamer  who might happen to build stuff up or destroy it  that realises the most important part in eve eve is a game that thrives on pvp without pvp the game is nothing without carebears like you we could still operate but without us pvpers or industrialist who actually recognize that you need a competitive nature to survive this game would be deadthink about that for a while you arent needed
my god youre dumb
indulge my stupidity  which one of those risks is it that means a miner may actually make a loss if he activates his lasers on the wrong asteroid as opposed to not making a good profitpeople having isk isnt actually an issue  it is about logistics and how people can use npc corps to protect activities which support pvp activitiesi dont care if someone makes billions of isk a day in a station  it is meaningless if he doesnt use that isk to project power
risk is subjective and include more than combat risks best to consider it risk  cost vs profitcombat you cant use combat against a larger corporationalliance or group of them operating in concert there is no equality thereyou want it to be 00 everywhere with no safe areas take away any chance for many to play with safty and you wind up with a repeat of ultima onlinewhen it went full pvpthe underlying problem is there is more than one play style  it will never be fair but there is balancea miner has no chance against a dedicated attacka ganker has little chance of losing isk where the minerhauleretc does so that gets balanced a bit more to be inline with the other ways of playingguess what if country a is at war with country b country c will sell both arms and equipment  when possible or company d will sell to the other  in eve its corporationsalliances vs countriesits part of the economy because the shooters are not going to bother with industry while they enjoy their play style while others enjoy theirsyou seem to see a diversity of play styles as a bad thing but it keeps the game going by paying the billsconsider this you make it no longer enjoyable for all the care bearsindustrialists and they leave what then who will provide the material for the war machines short of ccp suddenly deciding to run it like the test server but then you would have to go pve for isk in missionsbut then you face the fact ccp will likely lose customers hence them repeatedly mentioning they will not do anything that forces players out of the npc corporations  which includes applying restrictions or altering their function which is penalizing their playstyle and a miner does not make a couple hundred million isk while risking a few million isk at a shot right now a gank attack does it takes them time to make the couple hundred million a days mining in empire is nothing compared to a days suicide attacks
a miner picks which roids he goes after one choses empire ore one goes lownull one can make more isk than the other by taking a greater risk  compare prices on empire ice vs lownull ice versions for a quick one cost  isk  time   risk are factors that affect profitso what would you do if every ship hauling in a convoy was in 1 man corporations spend a couple billion in wardec fees to go after them
ki an i love you in before the lock
and you cant see beyond the gunsights risk isnt just about possible ship lossreward includes accounting for other factorsa miner corp sees a buy order they mines in a system near the buy location fighting with other miners for roids even going so far as to wardec some of them they get enough to fill a good portion of the order but its been filled so they lose profit plus they lost more through the wardecswhere the corp that was a couple jumps farther away mined without competition and fills the order completely in a day by simply picking a better system to mine inwardecs dont make you able to better compete they are a tool that is broken so is assuming that conflict will make it magically perfect for you to compete so what if an npc corporation cant be wardeced its no different than having several corporations working to fill the need for the lownull contracts that can be wardeccedyou cant get them all its not tactically or economically feasibleso you learn to adapt and balance the reward vs the risks and costsright now after review ccp is planing changes to two of the systems that are out of whack with their idea of a money making game
ok so explain againwhat risk does a miner in an npc corp in high sec have after the proposed changes to suicide ganks
they can still be suicide gankedthey can still have their ore stolen if they are using jettison canistersif they are in a frigate still the npc rats can eat their ship alive while they go to take a leaksame as alwayswhat risk does a miner in 00 with over watch havewhat risk does a miner in low sec with over watch havehow long does it take miner a in high sec to make as much isk as the miners in lownull with overwatch limiting them to worry about nothing but a wardec a wardec that can be avoided or rendered a non issue by picking a system that is easy to defend and offers plenty of belts with scouts in the neighboring systems to watch for hostilesthe changes dont remove any options it just balances things a bitand balanced  fairall use the equation of comparing x risk  y time  and z cost  in regards to possible rewardscurrently miners missions and the like balance out xy and z to one part or anotheras it stands the way suicides are operating xy and z are all extremely low for the possible rewards  low cost due to insurance payout no risk in none can shoot unless you are a wartarget low time since you can almost simply shoot any large industrialship and break even on dropped modules if not make a profit only real time factor is grinding back security status which is ratting and making isk at the same time with a bonus of being able to come back and spend a little risktimecost and possibly make 100s of thousands in a single gank
you are just trolling i get ityou are just trolling right
if the system was broken with the npc corporations then nobody would be able to compete with thembut people can and do compete quite well with them and all the rest without shooting a single war targetyou claim to be worried about the economy of loss if that was a factor then even t2 ships would cost less than the insurance because demand would be less than supplyhell many t1 ships where platinum insurance is a loss but the amount of loss is not too bad on some all i see is complaints about having to scan a target and consider it worth ganking or notand complaints over neutrals hauling in materials for warfare you cant stop that they will just put a buy order in a system they can take their transports to and let them be filled by whoever you cant wardec all the corporations and individuals who would jump to fill those orders and you know itits like mining you wardec a corporation to claim a sector of empire  yeah right  you tie them up but that doesnt stop another corporation from simply filling the gap and getting ahead while you worry about locking down the systemadapt to something other than pressing f1f8
stop with the ad hominem attacks please it doesnt lead anywhereto illustrate what ashen says do you seriously believe that this would not happen if insurances were left outyes thats a 20m brutix pinching a 100m hulk there is plenty more examples from that killboard and yes they would still come out far on top if insurances were left outedit apparently it can even be done in a thorax thats a 4m ship uninsured
so now anyone who does not agree with your warped view on what eve should be all about is a troll great arguingi suppose that if you were a manu fan and some chelsea player inentionally fouled cristiano ronaldo so that he breaks leg knee ankle and whatever else can break which puts ronaldo out for like a year and suspends the chelsea guy for 5 matches you would cheer for the chelsea guy since he did maximum damage for minimal penalty and spit on ronaldo because he was dumb enough to let it happen to him and actually encourage on other players to do the same because all the risk should lie with the creators and all the rewards with the destroyersplease get a grip removing insurance would not and should not remove suicide ganking from the game it would just make it less attractive to the masses of bored s which is a good thing for the game as a whole  well probably not in your ideal game world where every system is 00 and there is no lag because user peak on sunday night would be 400 and not 40k 
ashendont waste your time with ki an hes the one trolling you he really doesnt care or worry about economy newbies or anything but running all carebears out of eve
oh i know i just want to see if hes willing to risk wardecing a one man corporationi dont mind being docked up with my limited play time right now and i can hurt his or any corporation that wardecs me far more than they can mei can sit here and change skills and cost them money without even touching the marketand without dropping out or disbanding my corporation
boy the carebear brigade really came to your aid there ashen too bad they never do the same in game and the reason im trolling you is that what you are saying has absolutely no bearing on the discussion at hand either that or you are so hard pressed expressing yourself in english that you cant make yourself understood we are talking about an underlying problem being the reason for suicide ganks you reply by setting up strawmen and then answering to some other post as your replies seldom has anything to do with what you quoted i gave up on trying to explain to you that you should read mine and avons posts again to understand what we where actually talking about you replied with more nonsense and a few strawmen so now im just trolling you instead keeps me happy keeps the forum bears weepy and makes you keep spewing nonensical rethoric
because your straw man failsyou claim its the fact the npc corporations are immune to wardecswhich is utter bsbecause you can get the npc corps reworked but guess what you cant stop the logistics machine feeding the beasts you can only wardec so many then it becomes more costly to try itrework the corporations and people will form fleets using small corporations  even 1 man ones  file a wardec they make it mutual then switch corps with whatever delay is necessary or simply dock and ransom your bottom line because till you surrender or disband that war slot is usedplus it raises the wardec fees for all future wars and i dont expect them toaccept surrenders without a fee so the option would be pay the fee or disbandso that tool used to defend your bottom line can easily be reversed on you its a sword that cuts both ways
just give up matethey dont want a better game they want an easier onethe silly thing is isk is so easy to make now i could suicide t2 ships all day long just for the lulz with no concern for lossthey hope that putting a price barrier up will stop people killing stuff for fun  but they fail to realise that fun is the whole point of a game it wont stop people ganking because on the whole they enjoy itlet them have their nerf no doubt they will be back a couple of weeks afterwards crying about how ccp didnt do enough to protect their playstyle and how eve had no place for griefers although those whines will hopefully be drowned out by those from mission runners and new players who have screwed up somehow and found out that their insurance was invalidated due to a misguided carebear crusadeshame really i honestly thought that the eve community would have been able to see how this could have been tackled by expanding and enriching gameplay rather than kneejerk reactions which will i fear prove futile and add nothingagain i am not in favour of suicide attacks but i am pragmatic enough to realise that they are currently a required mechanic and that the attempts to restrict them will not have the desired resultwithout tackling the underlying problems the situation will change little or will become further unbalancedreally the ultimate question is should we approach things like this with a mind to restrict gameplay or to enrich it
i have not used straw men in my arguments you havei have never claimed that i have claimed that there is an underlying issue regarding the unbalanced high sec mechanics npc corps being virtually immune is one aspect of this try actually readin my postsno it really isnt im not sure what youre getting at here are you saying that the alliances that use alts in npc corps for logistics would use another way if npc corps are changed if so i would agree the difference would be that we would be able to actually hurt those people without suicide ganking them if the npc corp system was reworked that is one reason for it read my posts and avons for further reasonsand thats why i wont singlehandedly stop every alliance alt corp in the eve universe im fairly awesome but not that awesome fortunately there are a few more people in the game than just me wut whats wrong with that this is why i keep insisting that you might be a bit shy in the intelligence department this is entirelly incorrect and id urge you to actually read up on the mechanics before trying to act smart on the forumsswords are good they are vaguelly phallic in appearance and extremely sharp both qualities are excellent
so your arguement is that if npc corps are reworked  without actually making any effort to look at the proposed systems which would make random attacks highly undesireable  players should then be encourage to protect their playstyle by exploiting flaws in the current war declaration systemi think that speaks volumes about youagain you try to construct your position around taking things in solitude if only you would use your ideas to try to construct a better system embracing tweaks and changes to all related game mechanics rather than picking and choosing extreme examples as an excuse to maintain the status quo or worse push your own agenda then maybe it would be so frustrating reading your postsyou obviously have good ideas and understand some of the issues involved  if only you could step away from your playstyle and see how a changed system could better embrace and balance other ways of enjoying eve
so spell out the underlying problem chuckles or accept its a tweak that doesnt remove anything but insurance payments and adds a bit more cost to the activitythe supposed invulnerability of npc corps isnt going to cut it because short of turning all of eve into the failure that was ultima online when it went full pvp there will always be ways to be near invunerable to wardecsthere is no restriction on the gameplay it just raises the equation up to the point you have to think before popping a ship in war the reward is if your cost  then the loss in piracy your rewards is loot  salvage  your cost fun it doesnt matter the cost
but cost will not stop people having fun  you think there is much profit for me in alliance warfare  and removing insurance payouts has knock on effects to people who are not suicide gankersgame mechanics and in particular selective insurance can not determine intentit will not solve anything no matter how much you hope it will
i see how changes can be abused i see how things can be changes and how others will react to them to adaptive been pirate merc miner and industrialist on this and other accounts ive seen most of the options and i know those that see the npc corps as a way around wardecs will use what legal tactics they can to make them a nonconcern again be it mutual wardecs to raise the costs up to teh point most wouldnt spend the isk to bother to staying too small to be worth attackingif its been declared legal its not an exploit no matter how anyone whinges on itwhat is odd is i come back after a long time and its the same arguments high security is too safe i cant compete with the npc corporations never mind there are ways corporations are operating effectively and doing well and have been from day 1its considering all playstyles are valid and recognizing how some ideas hurt the game as a whole versus least impact on the playerbase make the game all 00 and then it dies even if there were npc corporations that were of benefit the fact they would be open to wardecs means someone would wardec them which makes them less attractive to a portion of the playerbase that pays the bills for ccpcombat is not the sole focus of the gamelearn to use tools other than the guns and wardecs
no you fail to realise that most people here do not want ganking to end its just that it is silly cheap right now and as you state isk is so easy to make it hardly makes it less relevant to take a hard look at the insurance policyyou seem totally convinced that it is only the targets of ganks that argue for a change i can assure you that this is not the casei do not exclude a more thorough examination of all aspects by ccp but that could take years literary so what it would add or rather what i expect it would remove is the ganks of targets with pocket change in their holdi agree i do also consider myself pragmatic and what i see is a simple adjustment that would make the eveuniverse a tiny bit more balanced while we wait for the enrichment of its gameplay
it would impact the ones that are not in it for gigglesthey would actually operate like professionals and pick targets worth killingsome lessons are going to be painful not checking your target sucks but you dont do it twice
if you had ever read any of my proposals you would never have made such an inane response to mei am totally against making all of eve 00 but if you had done any research you would have already known that
it is a game everyone is in it for gigglesjust because some people get giggles from avoiding combat it does not make their fun more valid than people who like looking at pretty explosionsyou have already stated that ccp must pander to those who dislike combat for fear of losing subscriptions  but i guess they dont need money from people who like blowing stuff upoh as a side note you really really really need to stop with the uo references because you clearly have no idea of how much influence it had on the people who brought you eveyou are so far of the mark it isnt even funny
look at the graphs for the games out there most populated are the pve servers eve has one shard empire is the pure pve server of sortsthere is still risks of pvp combat  far more than in most games but with penalties  but most of the pvp is markettrade based in empirewardecs mean little really to be honest when it comes to stopping groups pulling resources down they can set up buy orders what ever corporationindividual that fills it gets the isk while they get their supplies only so many can be stopped before they get what they need main advantage is hitting their logistics train if youre good enough to find the routes they usething is eve is more than pvp it has to be to be profitable ccp knows this and works to try and balance things so they dont really favor one group or the other they know there needs to be a safe spot for those that dont like player combat they dont prevent it completely they just limit the options  with a cost 
dear god make him stop with the nonsenseno ccp bloody well knows that if they start pandering to tossers like you theyll end up deep in a hole just like swg ccp has always been clear in their vision if they stray from it this time itll be a first we are posting here to remind them of what they used to stand for stop it with your we carebears are in the majority bs that economics report was the worst thing to ever happen to the game it made the carebears think anyone actually cared about them no one does you can all quit honest
actually most of the complaints in swg were the pvp crowd since the pve players had a choice in engaging in combat so balance issues were brought up by the hardcore combat junkies in the factionsand if it really bothers you so much put on the ruby slippers and click your heels together repeating there is no place like home maybe youll wake up in kansas again and itll all be a deam or you can accept the reality of the numbers and what they show
youre damn right it was the pvp crowd complaining after the nge there was no place left for pvpers the game had become pve centered and it wasnt good enough at it to compete on the already very tight market for pve games so it diedit also sucked because everyone was jedis thats because of people like youwhy dont you tell me what the numbers show id prefer it if youd make a detailed listing of what exactly it is ccp has released to the player base also provide links i like links
oh please pre and post nge the whine fest was from the pvp crowdand i got a better idea prove your arguments if you can instead of resorting to attacks and comments  lets see you display facts
so ashen is it your intention to push for a nonpvp zone with in eve
nope there are no pure combat safe spotsthe cost of engaging in the high security ones should be high thoughits one thing to shoot someone in the face out in the middle of the back woods00 and another to do it on the steps of the courthouse10the npc corporations are not invulnerable there are ways to work around the lack of wardecs not easy or cheap but there are waysbut the old saying by undocking you consent to nonconsensual pvpshould read by undocking you consent to nonconsensual pvp combat but you are not guaranteed any pvp combat
yeah despite the fact that almost anyone who has played the game says that the nge ruined the game and that it was a cheap cop out to placate the whiners who wanted the game to be easier youre probably right i mean you said so right that means its truei asked you first chump whats the matter afraid the numbers you cling on to will turn out to show something elseive pretty much proved my arguments already in this very thread but ill sum them up for you since youre too stupid to actually read postsargument voiding insurance for suicide ganks wont solve the issue of suicide ganks and is actually just a way for vindictive carebears to get back at those that wronged themproof posts from angry bears in this very thread pretty much proves my point but furthermore as you yourself have admitted suicide ganks will not disappearargument voiding insurance for suicide ganks does not make sense from an rp perspectiveproof insurance doesnt make sense from an rp perspective period if we where to apply rl logic to it noone would get insuranceargument voiding insurance for suicide ganks does not make sense from a mechanics perspectiveproof arguing that suiciding needs a cost is pretty much futile as other professions in eve apparently doesnt require a cost also there has never been proven to exist a suicide ganking problem noone has been able to state how many suicide ganks would be too few or just enough as has earlier been shown suicide ganking is actually a required game mechanic and any nerf to it now with existing mechanics still in place would hurt the balance of the game rather than improve it argument the real problem in eve is actually that the market is set up to require loss  losses from pvp encounters by far outweighs losses from pve  and people are abusing npc corps designed to help new players to keep themselves virtually immune in high sec free to make profits at a steady paceproof well the proof is right there in the argument itself eve is designed this way eve requires pvp to function it is not a pve game it has pve in it but thats to fuel pvp this is not an opinion its just restating what has been said by the devs over the years eve has existed argument if the underlying issues where solved suicide ganking would be solved as wellproof if all players where equally vulnerable there wouldnt be a need to suicide gank someone it could and would probably still happen but at a much much smaller scale due to the fact that if youve got it in for someone you could actually put the hurt on that person through much simpler means a reworking of the mechanics would also have the side effect to actually inform players that they need to protect themselves this would serve as a wake up call for many and they would start flying smarterright im done now lets see your evidence i wanna talk numbers
actually ive never seen you provide numbers so rather than waste much time on a dedicated whinge troll that complains about every change to a game ive decided to let you post the facts in links with numbers before i consider you worth my time lets see you put up something other than opinions and assumptions on your partprenge the complaints were about combat balance with buffs and composite armor amongst other things  and the fotm builds and such how everyone focused on mind attacks because they couldnt be healed off like the rest argument 1  it raises the cost of business a mission ship exhumer or other nonsuicide ship loss is quite a bit of isk loss a suicide ship can actually be worth less than the payment of the insurance even taking in modules  which can be recovered at times from their own wrecks reducing the cost across the board argument 2  there is high risk insurance in real life ship insurance would fall in that category argument 3  there are costs for all other professions in consumables time etc argument 4  people are using large empire alliances to make themselves too big to be wardeced and rake in profits or they are too small to be worth the cost to wardec or they are using the tools available to make it not worth being wardeced the npc corps are not the ultimate evil monstrosity that you seem to think they areargument 5  a suicide gank is often far more effective than declaring against a corp scan a target do some number crunching real fast pop the ship if its worth it where wardecs mean they finish the trade run because there is a time period before you can engage that juicy target besides the cost of the ganks can often be less than the cost of a wardec if you are already at war with several corporations based on the cost of the wardec and the possible loot to be recovered
look it is actually you that isnt worth my time i should have known from your first inane response you have continuously failed to recognize my arguments and you have consistently failed to respond to them in an intelligent fashion you have proven your lack of knowledge of game mechanics and you obviously have no sense of logic as you even in the post quoted above make one logical mistake after another the only conclusions i can come to are that you are either too stupid to actually understand the issues being discussed or you are a huge troll and just here to muddle up an already complicated debate either way you are not worth replying to and either way you should stfui would welcome a debate on this issue but not with you as you have proven yourself too stupid to partake anyone else wanna take me up on this offer ashen keep spamming please each post just makes you look worse
must be tough when you cant post real facts and only opinions and so many people call you a troll for it ever thread ive read with you in its the same whinge and insults again and againpost something with links and not just your opinion and maybe people will consider you something other than a whinge troll with anger issues when the world ignores you as such
why dont you war dec me over it afraid i would make it mutual so you would never be rid of the dec
hint thats not actually how it works i only posted it to make you realise how stupid you are
considering how long its been since i delt with them i dont care though search showed it was still working that wayso kindly go ask mommy for cookies and milk while you play
actually it never worked like that its a common misconceptions among carebears like you the point is try to know your  before talking because now your talking  about things you dont know
like youwhen the site search turns up one type of information its what people go byso lets see you post data that supports your ego and views i want to see hard facts from you something search shows as lacking in most if not all of your posts
like me what i post  i dont know about no its the other way around i know my  so i postyeah stupid people smart people make sure the info is correct before looking like an ass on the forumsyou know ive posted enough responses to feed your idiocy for one night if you want i can start a new thread entitled how eve works just for you the data that supports my view is presented in this thread the dev comments can be found by looking around the forums im sure some friendly soul has a link for you because i cant be bothered to do your work for you when you post something that is actually backed up by either solid facts or sound reasoning ill respond to you politely until then ill just keep trolling you
you assume one thing that i care about the forums they are fun to visit and listen to people whine about any change all i see looking at your posts is a forum warrior that spends too much time stroking his own ego thinking these forums matter much when youre barking after the truck has turned the corner
no id rather assume that you realised your own inadequacies when it comes to rational thought and stayed away from the forums as much as possible by all mean continue having fun making yourself look stupid i know im having a ball well you could argue that this particular section of the forum actually matters as this is the community outlet on design issues in here people try to apply reason to make their voice heard i understand that might be a bit too complicated for you the whole reason bit
how sadif you see the forums as a form of entertainment rather than a way that the people who really matter in eve the players can discuss openly how they would like to see the game develop why postwhy come here and disrupt open discourse which as you have just said you have no real interest inmaybe you could at least have the courtesy of letting people who are interested in having a discussion do so in peaceafter all you have made it abundantly clear that you have no constructive input to makeunless of course it is impossible for you to put the game before your own forum ego stroking
actually i dont let the forums get to me the way a troll wantsi speak my piece others speak theirseven when i disagree i dont resort to a stfu or the other troll style postings till they haveall i see in some is nothing but troll others just a disagreement
how many times have you been suicide gankedserious question here
first hauler alt 3 times  2 just after undocking at a trade hub 1 by them clicking the wrong target in overview versus the mackinaw i was piloting this char 1 time lag spike on the way to jita and they tried to pop me thinking i was in a plain interon damage was shields only 10 is not the best spot to try that 2 if you count them trying to pop my mackinawall of course while i was in a player corporation so they dont just target the npc corporations
how much isk has this cost youalso how many years have you been playingalso serious questions
hmm3 bestowers all with 4 ce i 3mse i 1 sse i  cheap fit for the alt only one had cargo and that iirc was a couple shuttles and some t1 missilesso after insurance and all about enough that i mined an hour and made up the losses so about 2mil at most after insurancewhere in all 3 cases the aggressor managed to at least break evenif i got cargo thats worth it its in the occ or my drake based on sizeas for playing off an on for over 2 to 25 years now rerolled a few times
if youre going to do it that way just have jump bridge  subcapital and use a cyno generator module for capital movement they can jump already just need to give them a target and of course cynogens and cynojams would be mutually exclusive
i like this ideai think that doing exploration sites should also fit into sovereignty benefits i find the plexes in faction warfare very enjoyable and would like to see this in 00the big thing is to reduce pos sieges sieging a pos is like watching paint dry
i would also like to potentially flesh this out with some improvements to pos logistics to compensate for the reduced importance of pos in the overall territory warfare picture please toss some ideas my way about what might tie into this system that would make fueling etc less of a grind
deploying a pos in a system should require the deploying organization to have captured 100 of the stargates in that systemthis will reduce the number of pos that people will feel the need to deploy to hold sovless pos deployed means less of a logistic burdenbasically every pos should have a productive purpose mining research or production not to be a big sovholding gunnedout deathstar that does nothing but stake a claim and eat fuel
quite frankly anything that can help mine veld  andor other lowends  faster in highsec too would really be appreciated think t3 miners and t3 mining crystals i mean the first t2 item was the miner ii it wouldnt be that farfetched to introduce t3 tentatively with just the mining lasers first
because im too lazy to read through the whole thread to see if its been suggested already let me state my support for the following fixt2 modsships when reprocessed give back 2550  depending on refinery efficiency skill standings the weather etc  of their construction components
they already give back up to 100 of their base components sure when manufacturing off an invented blueprint  negative me  theres a lot of waste but thats something else entirelyif you would have manufactured off a highly researched bpo the build and recycle material list would be almost identical  the base t1 item is not obtained but autorecycled into minerals   only the ram is actually lost
yes i demand for the curse to return to multiplebspwning modeseriously the curse is evil as hell still the pilgrim should probably be reworked although if they gave it about 2k cargo i think itd be awesome the amarr would have a force recon indy and as silly as that sounds to some i think itd actually be pretty badass
nicely written and thought out postto a certain extent while in general agreement that the pilgrim can use something i believe your suggestions to improve the ship are heading in the wrong direction and detract from the overall unique scaryinyourface nature of the shipflyingas you sayoutside the box is not a bad thing at allnosneut range bonuswhy is this needed so the pilgrim too can become another variation on speed fits the curse does this just fine prior to the nos balance nobody complained the pilgrim was too slow or suffered in any real fashion by being a short range attacker since the nos balance the pilgrim simply needs more pilot skill and creativity in order to fly with effectiveness and lets admit itprenos balancedrone bandwidth changes the pilgrim was overpoweredcurrent examples1i know for a fact the verone  veto  engaged multiple cruisers solokilling a couple and actually ransoming the remainder this is postbalancing btw 2i put a lot of thought into the pilgrim when i crosstrained amarr specifically for the pilgrimcurse  i am a fullspec minmatar recon pilot btw  after a lot of thought and testing i came up with what i believe is a pretty solid fit resulting in  just last week victim xxxxxxxcorp xxxxxxxalliance xxxxxxxfaction nonedestroyed vagabondsystem frerstornsecurity 03damage taken 13369involved partiesname ruleofthebone  laid the final blow security 97corp xxxxxxxxalliance xxxxxxxfaction noneship pilgrimweapon hammerhead iidamage done 10831name angel hunter  archangelsdamage done 2538vagabond was a generic vanilla fit caught stalking noob dessies in belts pilot was taken completely by surprise  as it should be  upon decloaking and instantly found himself with zero cap webbed and tracking disrupted  turret destab iv on my part  the only weapon of his remaining useful were his 5 warrior iis that eventually burned off my shields while barely scratching my armor tank  details shortly  before he dropped after roughly 4 minutes i expended exactly one cap booster 800and that was mostly to make room for loot please refrain from pointing at the above and yelling about epeen boasting while a very satisfactory kill from a personal standpoint it just illustrates how nasty the pilgrim can be with a bit of thought patience and franklypilot skill it also shows why vaga pilots should carry ewar drones solo my pilgrim fitpilgrim final1600mm reinforced rolled tungsten plates idark blood adaptive nano platingdark blood adaptive nano platingmedium armor repairer iiinternal force field array i10mn afterburner iidomination warp scramblerfleeting propulsion inhibitor ibalmer series targeting inhibitor i tracking speed disruptionmedium capacitor booster ii cap booster 800covert ops cloaking device iirecon probe launcher i snoop scanner probe imedium unstable power fluctuator ismall energy neutralizer iiantithermic pump iantikinetic pump ivalkyrie ii x5hammerhead ii x5hornet ec300 x5warrior ii x5requires recon v and excellent support skills despite faction fittings the ship cost is roughly what my typical rapier setup runsyesits slow but 1v1 with cloak advantage this is generally irrelevant and properly fit it has a beastly tank  both buffer and resistwise yessuccess depends on correct target selection yet the same applies to my rapierhuginn and those ships solo rely on proper target selection too  trust mei have beaten my head against enough drakes and other passive tank missile spammers to know better   cont 
the solution as you mention in one of your options beefing up the armor tank is a possibility that i could support as an alternative  and my preference  beefing up the capacitor warfare aspect is more inline with this unique closerange ship at the present time the only viable way i can see to fly this ship is with an injector and forget using an mwdthat utterly gimps the pilgrim unless you happen to be one of those clever folks fitting lasers  although i have not seen many do that with any degree of success or usefulness something along the lines of the sacriledge capuse bonus would suit the pilgrim perfectly enabling options like dropping the injector maybe fittingusing an mwd stronger dual rep options and so forth plus more room for loot but turning the pilgrim into yet another mustgofaster winboat wouldin my opinionruin the nature of the ship i enjoy flying speedfits and love my polycarbd permarunning mwdneut2xtd cursebut i also enjoy a patient relaxed stalk ending in the death of a thousand cuts upcloseandpersonal fight that even the victim can appreciate soin closing i will agree the pilgrim can use a boostbut the nosneut range extension is not the answerediti am honestly not sure why any of us bother posting anything in these threads given the apparent lack of interest displayed by the csm  outside thier own generally crap agendas  and ccps lack of direct feedbackit would be nice to be proved wrong on both accountsbut i am not holding my breath
agree
signed
absolutely agree not sure on the ops ideas but this ship needs love
the pilgrim needs a boost this is due to many factors such as the fact that neuts are the only recon ewar that is size based also the fact that basically pvp fits require 4 basic modules a warp disruptor webifier mwd and a cap booster the cap booster is basicaly the direct counter to amarr recon ew you do not see everyone else running around with eccm fitted on all ships do youi propose this boost be done in this fashion as to keep all of the recon families in lineswitch the drone hp and damage bonus with the neut range bonus that the curse recieves this will in effect take away the comabt dps from the pilgrim which balances with all of the other force recon ships also the curse will actually be the combat recon now as the pilgrim will no longer be able to dish out the same kind of damage
neuts are not ewar it is an offensive  and sometimes defensive  moduletds are ewarps i forgot to indicate support for something useful to happen to the pilgrim but making it a cloaked curse is mehpps hey lavista vistawhats going on in dis thread eh
i am supporting this topic but i do not like any of the solutions brought forth by the opfirst of all the pilgrim is lacking in cpu lacking badly in cpu i mean extremely badly in cpu i know cue the idiot who says recon v ftw but yeah im sure all the falcons and rapiers are terribly fit and they completely fail without recon v ship needs more cpu maybe more grid  been awhile since ive flown it  and probably a range bonus i mean does it makes sense that the sentinel can neut farter than the pilgrim i like the idea of the pilgrim being a short range heavy tanked force recon but the fact is that it cant really do that very well ever since the hp boost a long time ago tanking your hacrecon has been pretty much fail
considering that pandemic legion sot bobiron all have a loss or kill with a cerberus  multiple usually  in the past week in a sniping setup you clearly have no idea what you are talking about
i am very passionate about my caldari and the ignorance towards the current caldari in pvp situation hurts me mightily 
if amar is so good and caldari so bad why amar is least popualted race and caldari most
this tbh i have two nighthawks that just sit in dock continuously i never bothered replacing my last cerb my widow has been used exactly once since i bought it  though thats more a black ops issue  and my ravens though they have nice dps posttorp boost cant tackle due to the need to fit a target painter and thus just sit in station forsaken for more effective battleships of other races give me a reason to fly caldari like i originally wanted to dammitriiiightbecause the sacrileges tanking attribute is shields ohwait  thats right its actually armor the shieldtanking nanolameness was  gasp  not its intended role who would of thought what with the armor resist bonus and allsocare to run the stats again on armor with the resist bonus factored inps i own a fullykitted sacrilege
because training for ravens and running missions is the easiest way for new players to make moneyalso amarr look like crusty old men  caldari look a lot cooler tough dudes also they have cute asian chicks
no wrayeth this guy is sooo right i mean a sacrilege with 32k effective hp and a medium armor rep that is faster than a cerberus is paper thin compared to a cerberus that is at least 500600ms slower with 16k effective hp and no tank what so everits just sooo obvious
jim much as i find your phrasing and sarcasm amusing and your arguments largely accurate it may be a better idea when replying to your own thread for you to cut back on the sarcasm and present calm reasoned arguments in my forumwhoring experience ive found posting is like being a dog  the more you bark the more people ignore you and tune you out as such its one of the reasons why ive tried not to reply too much to my thread about nanos unless i felt a response was absolutely necessary after my last series of posts ive said my piece and will only reply if theres something i feel i absolutely must respond toor if i have a constructive addition to offertldryouve got good points dont shoot yourself in the foot edit this doesnt stop me from being sarcastic and cynical in other peoples threads  just my own
i havent been able to post on the forums for 2 years its like the floodgates opened im sure i will settle down eventually mmmm nanos
thats all there is to say really we are talking about jims idea that a nano lse cerberus would get owned by a short range nano lse sacrilegeadmittedly the nano sacrilege setup he posted as an issue is fail anyway  any bc will own you even a drake  and i wouldnt want to get caught using it everif you want to talk about actually armor tanking sacrileges we can do that elsewhere this whole thread is not only lacking focus its totally devoid of it lots of different stuff gets thrown around including whiningeither we try to focus on the supposed issue brought up in the op or we can consider this thing pretty much stillbornps i own fully fitted sacrileges and get most solo kills from them but i consider training caldari cruiser v just for the cerberus cause there are simply things the sac cant do eg the cerberus is the most survivable and consistent provider of midlong range dps in nano gangsimho the two are simply not comparable and if you want to emulate a sacrilege using a cerberus you will get the same result as trying to emulate a cerberus using a sacrilege that it fails
if you want to whine about the sacrilege being sturdier and owning a cerberus close up you should actually consider the following2x overdrive ii 2 bcu ii 1 1600mm plate10mn mwd warp disrupter ii stasis webifier ii 1 sb ii or whatever5x ham ii 1x whatever2x polycarbsthis is actually a tad faster than what jim posted if slightly more sluggish  yeah i hear you shouting plate on a nano madman  has 28k ehp these are for real  62551371985  and it can hit other fast ships due to the webfit target specific missiles and rejoice  eg em against cerbs 
your sacrilege only goes 2100ms which is too slow for a nanosetup it also has one other little pesky problem it doesnt fit without a 3 or 5 grid hardwiring implantif you would like i could edit the original post to put more focus into what i am trying to say here in fact i think i willbasically the fact of the matter is that the cerberus is incredibly harder to fit and less effective than the sacrilege in pvpi am quite aware that the sacrilege is meant for short range and the cerberus is meant for long range however i think the cerberus could use a lot of help in the midrange area and as ive said missiles are bad sniper weapons so perhaps ccp should reevaluate thisi feel the cerberus should be able to fit heavy assault launchers a lot more easily there might be a problem with ham fittings in general for caldari in fact i am damn sure there isi would also like to see the cerberus lose the missile flight time bonus i find this bonus useless either make it a double velocity bonus or put something else there that would be usefulwhy not give the cerberus a bonus to all heavy missile damage why just kinetic sacrilege gets a bonus to all heavy assault missile damage would that not be a fair compromise
jim just noticed you included gang boni with all skills at v for the sacrilege and no gang boni at all for the cerberus at least for the speedscould be an oversight but please correct your original post thanks
we dont know if it would be a fair compromise or not because you havent run the numbers stop waffling and actually make some concrete proposals and predictions of their effects
if you want my honest opinion imho the thing that will fix the general problem is a fix for heavy precision missilesthat would allow the cerberus to actually hit other nanoships and smaller stuff while the sacrilege needs to web them to score usable hits and thus have another very nice role compared to nowright now precision heavies are useless and that does of course affect the cerberus somewhatedit the precision heavy thing gets escalated to cpp decision is from the csm meeting on the 6th of july so before i get any more info on that from ccp im unsure if should support any cerberus related issues
no i didnt
check again psacrilege with 1 od ii one nanofibre ii 2 polys 10mn mwd ii3025 ms what you said 3300 which you get with a skirmish warfare 5 gang bonus 2 od make you faster on paper but the sac is much more sluggish than the cerb so in the tight orbit dictated by your range you wont be faster cerberus with 2 overdrives 2 polys 10mn wmd ii2749 ms as you said with gangboni would be 3024 mssmall oversight as the sac is still faster just not that much and i thought lets try to get the numbers right
3025ms 1 od ii 1 nano ii 2 polys 10mn mwd ii no implants
honest mistake its corrected now
before i leave the thread alone a bit again  was admittedly bored the last hour had a horribly boring meeting  the issues i think one can see with the cerberus are this does not mean i personally see all of them as issues just that some people may issue 1 the cerberus is an excellent heavy missile platform but precisions heavies are useless if they werent this would strengthen the cerberus this may change soonishissue 2 the cerberus does not really profit from hams as fitting these often costs you a low slot essentially negating a lot of the dps advantage as you could use a bcu in there insteadi dont really see this an as issue the question is should the cerb be a viable ham platform you get very high ranges with hams compared to other ships so a bit of a drawback is fair imhoissue 3 the cerberus is a tad slow for use as a close to mid range nano ship this causes to you to be more vulnerable to guns and missilesthe question here is should the cerberus be a viable closemid range hac increasing the speed but lowering its agility would be ok for me that way in close orbits the speed stays roughly the same while in mid range you profit this would make the cerberus a perfect midlong range ship while the sacrilege excels at short rangeseditmy personal comment to issue 2 and issue 3i dont see a big problem there more of maybe finetuning if we talk about midrange lets compare it to one of the most famous midrange directdamage nano hacs the zealot not comparing it to the ishtar as you can just shoot its drones making it very different zealot eg 456 dps 3734 ms 405km range 98k ehpham cerberus emulating it eg 368 dps 3229 ms 456km range 101k ehp so expect for the speed it does compare nicely dps actually can be higher for the cerberus as the zealot cant hit even a sitting bc fully if the zealot is at full speed and 40km doing around 400dps for cruiser sized sitting targets the zealot has to slow down considerably to hit anything at allthe zealot can hit fast targets having mwds on generally better though but precision heavy fixes could fix that for the cerbgenerally the cerb has the really nice advantage that you always apply full dps to nonnano targets no matter how fast you go  if you have gang boni and snakes fe with the zealot anything that makes you faster will often reduce your effective dps eg my zealot actually goes faster than 5kms but if the target has no mwd switched on effective dps at that speed sucksin conclusion the cerb being 200ms or so faster for higher survivability wouldnt hurt i guess if it pays in agilitystill the basic concept of the tight powergrid looks sound having a midrange nano hac rivaling the zealot and having some kind of tank would be overpowered and that ship being the king of long range plus being able to rival the sacrilege close up would be definitely too much for one ship
nice list heres some more items to consider1 the sacrilege is intended as the shortrange missile spammer the cerberus as a longrange missile spammer but what of the middle range at what range should the cerberus become superior are jav hams too good do they tip the midrange balance too far towards the sacrilege2 is the limited cpu and pg on the cerberus justified would a cerb with buffed pg and cpu step on the sacrileges rolesince its jims thread i look forward to his analyses of these issues
gypsio edited in some comment to the issue 2 and 3 and the powergrid thing before seeing your post sorry for thatimho a higher pg would mainly make the zealot useless in comparison see above
ah yes the zealot also needs to be considered as well in the comparison its a tricky comparison because of the differences between missiles and lasers the tackling capabilities and engagement ranges i dont have the experience for that so i wont even tryi think that a big problem in this thread is uncertainty about how the cerberus should be used personally i dont see it as a nanoship  its too slow has difficulty damaging fast targets  except when using precision lights  doesnt have the cap and then has to gimp its damage with speed mods i see range being its tank like the falcon so i have missile velocity rigs on mine and sometimes a full rack of damage mods giving up to 240 km range and excellent dps once the missiles arrive after up to 20 seconds flight so the double range bonus must stay  although tweaking it to a double velocity bonus would be very nice indeed
i agree the strongest point of the cerberus is currently applying a reliable constant stream of dps while being untouchable for all hostilesall i say is that a tiny speed increase in case you want to nano it wouldnt hurt much though im arguing for a cerberus buff here so i must have gone crazyi guess part of the problem is the eagle leaving the cerb as the only nano option for caldari hac pilots so people try to use it for all possible roles
not all hac have to be nanoed
the cerb is currently an insanely useful ship and performs a role which hardly any other ship canif you want the cerb to become a sac just use a saci can fly both but i would never expect them to be used for the same jobthe issue here is with the op thinking that balance means same
completely agree i fly them both as well and they fill an entirely different role in pvp combat cerberus is not a sacrilege and never should be if there is a problem with cerbs it would just be heavy precision missiles and that is already being addressed with another issue csm has already supported
i agree with jim it is a discrace tbh sac totally outperforms the cerb so much so that a nano sac could jump through a gate mwd out to the cerb 200k off and kill the cerb quite comfortably if the sac fits heavies then the cerb still dies if the cerb fits hams then the cerb dies if the sac fits tank and the cerb fits hams then the cerb dies if the cerb brings a baseball bat a can of mace the key to the sac pilots home and ransoms his children then he still diesjust not competative it truely makes me laugh how much trolling racial protectionism goes on in this game i mean here we have an amarr ship which outperforms the cerberus in just about every category that matters tank gank tackle speed and yet we still have a total bunch of completely biased idiots believing that the cerberus should only pvp at 150k with missiles so compared to the other hac missile boat the cerb has less tank less dps less speed and couldnt tackle a happy mealright on actually remember when the amarr whine crowd were moaning about the thorax being better with lasors than some amarr cruiser hullsfunny thatedit if you argue that the cerb performs a role that other ships cannot you must say what role that is you cannot just say it does so there the only other role the cerb performs better is long range heavy missile sniping so lets think about that so a cerberus with no point and no web relies on numerous other ship types to do the tackling for them and waits 10 seconds for his missiles to hit while this is happening 10 other  or if just about every big other 00 alliance then 50  support ships decend on the target and wtf pwn him regardless of the cerbin small engagements the cerb is supposed to smack into support and the opposition isnt supposed to be able to do alot about it  cerb does have good agility so like all caldari ships at least then can run away   problem is though that in small gang other ships may well be more useful like maybe the deimos or perhaps a huggin rapier zealot harbinger drake nano drake  its cheaper and tackles lol  ishtarit just isnt right tbh caldari need effective short range weapons thats the norm among all races so why not caldari

dude even if the cerb could kill the sac in that time  which i doubt it could if u nano the  out of it  it wouldnt mean much since it would still be lame if the sac could travel 150k or 100k and kill the cerb and tbh i think it couldperhaps someone with more time that me could work out exactly how much range the cerb gets for its lack of speed tackle damage and tankactually basically u are arguing that if the cerb legs it  nano fitted  he either wins  kills the sac by tackling with the power of the mind since why on earth would the sac stick around with a couple of people shooting him and if something else is shooting him like perhaps a vagabond or zealot or something that the sac cant easily kill then why not actually have two of that type of ship and leave the cerb at homehonestly
again youre trying to use the cerberus like a sacrilege then complaining that the sacrilege is better at being a sacrilegecerb can hurl missiles over 240 km btw
also could people stop calling the sac an amarrian ship  technically it is a khanid ship it is meant to be good with missiles
i love how this thread is riddled with ppl saying either dont try to do this why do you need something close range or stop trying to fly solo to skirt the actual questionsdoesnt this belong in ships and mods
it takes damned near 15 seconds for a heavy missile to hit at 140k are you actually trying to argue that a pvp ship that can tackle better tank more has superior dps and can permananly run its mwd  without and pesky interfering modules or neutnos  is balanced against a cerb because the cerb can hit at 140k while fitting 2 sensor boosters taking 15 seonds to hit the targetif the guy in the sac is moving toward the cerb he is moving quick and is therefore subject to the customary damage reduction due to explosion velocity so anything over 750kms or 1000 with precisions  lol  is subject to damage reduction unfortunately i dont know the formula but from experience u just do a  load less damagelike i said if you are in a big gang then a few cerbs matter less than more heavy tacklers and in a small gang then bring something else especially if you take the advice on these boards since we should all be shoving 2 sbs on with a nano fit  i would recommend a cloak as well  and then u can sit 140k off and ping missiles at ships and hope they chase u until they are in scram range such a joydont get me wrong im not anti nano and in fact i like speedy stuff and the warfare it promotes and imo the issue comes down to missile explosion velocity issue and powergrid issue with hams at least if these were change u would have a competative short range option
but why do you need onecaldari by design specialise in long range combat in order to counter the shortrange style favoured by the gallente their natural enemiesor would you rather that everything was just the same and the backstory just decided your avatars hairstyle
i dont really get itamarr ships can fit pulse or beamsgallente can fit railguns or blastersminmatar can fit artillery or autocannonsnow on the caldari frigate level you can go rockets or standard launchers no problemcaldari battleships  well raven  does cruise or torpedoes no problem really hell even the rokh in theory can fit blasters and hold its ownnow when you get to cruiserbattlecruiser and heavy assault launchers our ships cant effectively fit the short range weapon and the only ship that can fit them and be effective is an amarr  sorry khanid  shipthis makes no sense to me you guys must all love sacrileges a lot or something im not even asking for it to be nerfed i just think the cerberus needs help when it comes to fitting and perhaps some changes to its kinetic only and flight time bonus  about as useless as the precision bonus on the nighthawk imo not really asking for a lot the sac will still be faster have superior capacitor have armor resists a drone bay more hp ect ecttelling me to simply use the cerberus as a sniper where its defensivefitting weaknesses would stand out less and is a role that its not overly effective at imo doesnt really fix the problem hereand before i head off here if hac are supposed to be specialized and caldari already have the eagle which is a sniper hands down why is the cerberus suddenly a sniper too do we really need 2 sniper ships itd be nice to have a good at the very least midrange hac which the cerberus really should be
why not every other race has short range options across multiple ship types why not try to argue that the range makes up for itthere isnt any reason why variety and fiction should be sacrificed in favor of balance i actually like the cerb but it isnt up to scratch you didnt mention the torp raven blaster rokh blarpy or ham drake as being counter to the backstoryif you get to stuff hams on a cerb  and the nighthawk  with an effective tank and mwd  lets set the tackle issue aside  with the precision to hit nanos in a more balanced way then u get a bit of balance it should be able to compete with the sac long range hams should kill short range hams if the engagement starts at the appropriate range btw when the sac fits heavy launchers it performs better at the whole range is your tank equation while doing the same dps with anything other than kinetic missiles in fact it gets to tank range speed hitpoints and repping if it wants to a speed fitted cerb cant deal dps tank or tackle enough to take out any other hac really
jim jim jim you dont know how to fit a drake let alone a cerberus
actually fitting blasters to any caldari ship is counter to the backstoryblasters are a gallente weapon caldari use railguns for rangei can remember discussions way back in beta and early release how clumping both weapon types in to the hybrid tree would cause balance issues  because ship bonuses are to hybrid not the correct racial subtype   it is one of the biggest flaws in game mechanics and had constantly popped its ugly little head up in balance issuesas to torps they used to be a mid range weapon and as such made sense  mid range being about as close as cladari got to in your face combat  changes were made for balance reasons but they still outrange blasters by a fair margin
why is it people think its perfectly fine that heavy assault ships can be setup for speed that makes them superior fighting machines than their intended designthe problem with the cerb isnt so much that it sucks to fit it since all caldari cruisers and bcs suck to fit hams on but that nano setups are horribly broken bring those in line and the cerbs ability to fight at mid and long range well will make up for it being crap up close
i believe there are methods by which missions can be improved and without coding in serverkiller advanced ai behavior we can modify the existing ratstats to more closely mimic pvp combat1  get rid of the useless ships these are hogging performance and pose no challenge to the player a serpentis navitasclass vessel does not belong in a level 4 mission restrict such craft to lowerlevel missions and place challenging craft in their place2  modify npc ship stats to mimic popular player loadouts tactics and ranges example a serpentis interceptor should scram the player move at mwd speeds and orbit outside of web range all these attributes already exist and only need balancing  in the example above increase speed dramatically and alter the orbit distance value 3  randomize the loadouts a serpentis thoraxclass cruiser might have 23 different possible loadouts npc battlecruisers 45 etc players shouldnt know what damage an ai ship can inflict before they engage  note that damage types remain unchanged serpentis will always do thermalkinetic but the actual value will be dependent upon the selected loadout which will be unknown to the player  4  restrict loot drops to racial module types serpentis should not be dropping large shield booster is restrict them to gallente gear this will eventually influence the local and regional markets  perhaps in unpredictable ways 5 every playerobtainable ship type  within reason  should be mirrored in the npc pirate corporations what the angels have not yet caught on to the abilities of the hurricane battlecruiser6  droneusers will hate me for this one  every npc in a room should automatically aggro when a player enters and switch aggro at random intervals if ccp is worried about overwhelming the player space the groups out so that the player is not blobbed to death spawn triggers should not be known  read randomized  but should alert the player that another group is heading his way offering him time to bail  keep spawns from appearing right on top of the player and he will generally be able to handle things while the enemy closes  7 build new missions which require multiple players working together to complete but clearly state the approximate numbers and ship types which will be needed in the mission description example remember charactername youre taking down a defended serpentis pos you will need to scrounge up at least 4 battleships to handle this task and expect enemy ships to try to snipe you theyre not going to make this easy soloplayers can pass on the mission group players can grab their matesthese are just a few ideas which could improve missions without significantly hampering the servers  ive more but cant seem to locate the napkin i wrote them down on perhaps later  missions can be made more challenging by altering what we already have
not a good idea to limit the suggestion to mission only even if that is the focus of this thread if for some reason it was presented and applied to mission only it would be a disaster
yep
definitelyi would love to see fewer stronger npcs killing 30 cruisers in a lvl 4 missions is very boringcurrently missions are pure grind they are easy and predictableincreasing the intelligence of the npcs would go a very long way to helping
310 cihys
how is it ccps fault that people will willingly form fleets that they know current hardware cannot handle flawlessly also what game has 5600 people in the cities all rendered along with the city and isnt either a beastly computer only able to do it due to lots of processing power or a slideshow
make your mind up dear
remove jade shes a bad role model
rick astley approves of this message
would also support smartbombs not being able to affect them
wordnow to my rocket launcher defender phoenix
their damage is too low their travel time is too slow and the smartbomb issuecitadel tops simply shouldnt be popable
this and theres no short range high dps option for capital missiles
already a topic in the hall on this actually plus it was mentioned that the issue was being addressedincluded in the capital ships online csm topicthough i cant say ive seen it explicitly included
5k is the shields on my geddon i really dont think a capital ship would mind it
i like the general idea of bombs only being used against caps but should do even more damage then and cost less
edit oopsadding this to the agenda for sunday 2072008
2000 does ccp have a time machine im unaware of
what gets me is i got both dates wrong in entirely different ways  
adding this issue to the agenda for the 2072008 meetingedit oops
again with the time machines
for the simple fact that i dont trust the players to determine where this game goes i am going to have to throw in a nonsupport to this idea
against this until after the full force of npc empires are thrown into fw as anything less would be a bogus win this includes giving defenders the perks of the land such as launching capitals in defense of areas with attackers possibly being able to as well assuming concord wouldnt intervene  or theyd just have to suck it up and deal with concord attacking them as well 
i had posted an idea for a fix for docking timers a while back  well before the csm existed  and id like to revisit it for this topicto begin id like to define two scenarios under which dockredock can occurthe first occurs when a ship undocks sees hostile forces camping then redocks as quickly as allows without fighting i see this as a situation caused by lack of intel which should be present but isnt purely to due game mechanic inadequaciesthe second scenario is the classic docking game where a wartarget undocks fights for a period of time while testing his opponent and trying to kill weaker opposing elements then deaggros and redocks to repair damage done i see this situation as an abuse of existing mechanicsthe current docking timer is one minute long and resets each time a pilot performs an aggressive act i fthe pilot stops performing aggressive acts the flag will expire in one minute and the ship can redock my suggestion to fix the the situation is to have the docking counter mechanics depend on the existence of an aggression flag in other words if the pilot has no aggression flag  has not performed and aggressive act within the last fifteen minutes  then the docking timer is one minute as it is now a pilot can undock look around and redock one minute later  assuming he survives that long  regardless of enemy activityif the pilot is flagged for any aggressive acts  this would include weapons fire theft etc  then the redock timer is reset not only each time that pilot aggresses but each time someone aggresses him what this means is that once a pilot makes a choice to engage an opponent the resulting combat will generally speaking last as long as either side continues to fight once flagged a pilot would have to accomplish one of two things to be able to dock1  escape the immediate combat long enough to allow the docking timer to count down then dock before his opponents can reset the timer by attacking him  example fly out of scram range then cloak or warp from safe spot to safe spot until the one minute timer counts down then warp to station and dock  note that even if you manage to dock leaving the station while carrying an aggression flag will still triger the new mechanics2  wait out the aggression flag once a pilot is no longer flagged enemy aggression no longer resets the docking timer  example a heavy ship could simply tank a smaller ship for fifteen minutes so long as hostile reinforcements didnt intervene the resulting mechanics allow for intel gathering  necessary since the windows in a station are not apparently transparent  but make undockredock combat difficult if not impossibleas an aside i suggest that these same mechanics be applied to jump gates so long as you dont carry an aggression flag mechanics work as they do now but once you engage opposing fire resets your gate timer too
id support variable timers or the above idea
until they fix the bumping physics no support herebumping with small ships has always been a borderline exploit
right on i have 22km lock range on my claw with long range targeting 5its just edboost
more lock range yes please
eos  information warfare mindlink  15 extra locking range that is what the eos is now used for providing minmatar interceptors the ability to lock further
problem is you cant warp the eos and keep the link active most of the time you have the claw ahead a system a system apart the link will do nothing the current solution is use a low slot for signal amps or use rigs the thing is if it has such a small locking range it would be nice if it was better in some other regard its hard enough to maneuver in that small envelope and loose your target often enough and have to reacquire with interceptor speeds and little tank that happens quite a bit to avoid getting webbed and killed
 
yeah its annoying but i dont think you should be able to tell on scanner which ships are occupied just deal with it keep towers on overview and learn to directional scan
i have towers on overview i can directional scanbelts and moons both orbit the same planetsimple example jump into a system one hostile hit scanright we have 3 ravens 4 ishtars a falcon 5 belts 2 planets and 2 control towersaim for first planet scan 1 raven 2 ishtar 2 belts 1 planet 1 toweraim for second planet scan 2 raven 2 ishtar falcon 3 belts 1 planet 1 towerwarp to first planet use directional again ahhh ok all the ships are in the towerwarp to second planet use directional they are all in the tower there too  because the raven that was in the belts has had 3 minutes of you warping around eliminating empty ships in which to safe up
unless you have an alt in stain empire or have asked them yourself you dont know what their reasons are and their reasons in that particular case are irrelevant using decoy ships at a pos to lure roaming gankers into a trap  or just make them waste time chasing shadows  is a valid defensive strategy for those willing to spend time setting it up and youre seeking to nerf it for no particularly compelling reason other than that the basic directional scanner only gives you basic information and you dont want to spend 35 seconds probingpos bowling is not the only way to get at hostile ships inside a forcefield  ask roadkill about their password security against a ratting bs who is awake its virtually impossible to enter system and catch them in a belt anyway  if theyre watching local and sensible with their actions and fittings theyll be warping out by the time you decloak on the gate especially if they have a working intel channel to forewarn them of roaming hostiles
its annoying as hell to the attacker and defender if there is actual action going on so its not a defensive strategy in the sense of actual defensethe fact that you have a pos to leave ships at means what you should be using for protection against the lone raider is the pos instead of a pile of trash at your pos to buy you time for being lazy and unaligned
no theres no reason why the directional scan should give a 100 accurate assesment of the tactical situation it needs to leave some room for actual recon work and skill its quite easy to figure out whats in a pos and what isnt just takes a couple more seconds
lets not forget if you dont use kinetic the dps are cut by 25 since theres apparently some mystery about other missile designs that escape the caldari states researchers
to the people who have been asking unless they changed it in the last couple of months and it wasnt in the patch notes only one of the nighthawks missile bonuses fails to apply to hams the precision bonus this was tested with actual damage rof etc against actual shipssorof bonus applies to hamskinetic bonus applies to hamsprecision bonus does not apply to hams
in that case can we amend this to include fix the damn description
amen maybe it can be amended to the issue
or nerf ecm a bitbeing a falcon pilot i find myself using that in 90 of combat engagements and even i find it to be a bit too overpowered with sensor dampening the target can still at least fight anything thats close range like a blasterthron but with ecm theres literally nothing you can do except sit back and lolz while your ship gets chewed awaythere needs to be more diminishing returns on ecm at least in my opinion especially if theres two ships jamming one shipthatd take a lot less resources on ccps part rather than introducing and balancing an entire new ship but youre right eccm does need a look at
remove the basilisks bonuses to energy transfers the guardian already does that and cap is an amarr thing  replace them with remote eccm bonuses and double its sensor strength remove the oneiros bonuses to tracking links the scimitar already does that and speed is a minmatar thing  replace them with bonuses to remote sensor boosters and double its scan resolution the caldari will hate me for this but i think its perfectly reasonable these modules arent good enough to support a new set of logistics ships so renovate the ones weve already got
no
then will there be a logistic ship to be antinos anti target painter and anti sensor dampsits silly to make a ship class based on one type of electronic warfare unless you make them for each type but then gallenete get antiecm which fits in relation to their gang links and amarr get anti target painters minmatar with anti nos watch outgranted i was intrigued at the idea of something that projected eccm at firsteccm is viable it was used in the tournament
afaik there are already ships with bonuses to remote sensor boosters remote cap rechargers
imo it is even more reasonable than my proposal the problem is that basilisk is a shield tanking ship and badly needs med slots fitting projected eccm would instantly kill its tanking then peccm would have to be moved to high slotsalso removing the basilisks cap transfer role would make it less atractive to fly i guess it would have to be boosted in some other way  say boost its tanking ill edit the op to list all options
the rules of the tournament make it much different from actual pvp ships in the tournament didnt have to fit disruptors and sometimes even mwdwebs this gives you 13 empty med slots which you can fill with anything you like in real pvp you have to keep your target in place to deal damage
projected eccm is considerably more effective than nonprojected already as i recall them its 120 sensor strength for projected 96 for standard id say this makes up for the downsides of using it two ships with projected eccm on each other are harder to jam than two ships with their own eccm and the downside is as you say if one gets jammed the other is much easier to jamwe dont need logistics ships available to counter every form of ewar and while i think falcons and rooks are somewhat overpowered thats not a discussion for this thread
true it is different but its not beyond anyone to put on active and passive modules if they feel ecm is going to hurt them but then people have a general consensus that mwd is mandatory especially in 00 general consensus is that its not worth flying with eccm or use projected that of course is until someone shows its effectiveness to a point that it becomes the new fad like rr battleships or whateverwhether you believe there is enough antiecm or not you can not introduce a class of ships to combat one racial type of electronic warfare tell me you dont expect 4 racial versions of your proposalmake it a capital weapon then you might have something hell put on a rorqual just not 4 ships types against one racial ewar because if you ever balance or nerf ecm again then you have 4 less than useful shiptypes
falcons are not overpowered i fly one myself and i know what i am talking about it has no tank it cant deal damage the only thing it can do is disable 2 ships  3 if you are lucky up to 4 if you are very very lucky  not counting the drones get something fast like an inty or a vaga to babysit a falcon and hell be rewarping constantly 5 falcons on the other hand is overpoweredyou can hit jamming with a nerf bat again and make this ship a total crap like it was before the boost or you can provide adequate means to counter jamming one that involves coordination and teamwork the falcon itself is just fine
see option b then i have changed the topic from suggestion to issue the purpose is to find a compromise solution
tone down the falcons ecm bonus by 5 per level this makes it weaker and less effective and might even mean gasp shock horror that people will occasionally fly the rook which is currently definitively worse than the falcon for nearly everything
ecm is quite balanced atm keep in mind your flying a falcon its specialized to do ecm just try that trick on a normal shipon topic i think that more logi ships is a really good idea in general right now i think the healing role in eve is really pathetic mostly because the ships that are available for the role are really not numerous enough nor tankable enough to be really popular really id like to see bs or bc logi ships but still an antiewar logi is a cool idea too in fact adding any new ships is ok in my book
a electronic attack ship is basically asking for a electronic defense ship it shouldnt be purely eccm but instead focus on countering the ewar methods of the opposing faction it even leaves room for both a t and t2 version of different sizes similar to the ewar focused ships already in existence
option b is an interesting proposal but doing so are taking away from the caldari mega tank that the basilisk and guardian can do for their respective types of tanking it also takes away from their ability to sustain longer operations when their direct damage weapons suck juice and possibly their tank as well of course in pvp its generally a passive tankproposing doubling sensor strength and and scan resolution of two of the 4 logistics would make the others extremely unbalanced a logistic ships that was twice as resistant to jam would be a severe boost because not for the projected eccm but for regular shield transfer any logistic pilot fears the jam because it makes their job hard i dont know if shield rep drones would keep repping afterwards however the drones are used less generallychanging the bonuses like that would defiantly make logistics interesting onerioses would make ganking megathrons and anything else even worse at gatecamps your option b is at least much better than your original proposal granted as it is now if this would go through i bet youd get people asking for the scimitar tracking link bonus to change too to what i have no idea but its generally not usedsee the trick is buffing a ship is a one to one ratio for offense for argument say you encounter a 10 man gang with your 10 man gang you have 9 other squad mates and you can tracking link one of them per link or do multiple links for extra efficiency the return side of it when one of your squad gets primaried which is usually the case you can apply all your effects on one person you are attempting to nullify 10 attackers with your one ship and with multiple shield reps usually and you can do a lot generally depending on the situation you get more bang for the buck out of affecting 10 enemies attacking one friend than helping one friend attack one enemy but secondary effects of all logistic ships have this effect then again if you use energy transfer you can supplement your friend in tanking more so in reality it also similarly affects 10 attacks with the mid slot secondary bonus are you sure you want projected eccm on a logistics shipeinstein as part of disclosure can you pilot the onerios as well
when the t20 issue happened we were all promised by ccp that this kind of thing would never happen againccp gave us tribbleswe also all remember issues with gms spawning themselves faction gear but messing up and getting caughtccp gave us tribbleswe have all heard the stories about alliance b having access to priority proxies and using said prioritised proxies to gain unfair fleet battle advantages over alliance i by the reduction in lag thats causedin responce to these alligations ccp gave us yet more tribblesso my questions are as followsare the csm team happy that procedures put in place by ccp to prevent t20gm spawning faction loot type issues from happening again are adequate and workingdo prioritised nodesconnectionsproxieswhatever word theyre called exist and if so are the csm happy that the measures in place are adequate to prevent their abuse eg what stops a gm from using said priorised connection from homenow you may think my questions are pointless but they relate to some of the biggest issues to ever occur in eve and i for one would like to hear a non ccp voice on the matters after all when the idea of the csm was announced by ccp  some years ago  it was issues like these that the csm was stated it would be able to addressso for once a non ccp voice to either confirm or quell these rumours would be appreciated
awe bless w0rmy you are an odd one
tribbles are awesome arent they those furry things from star trek that kept multiplyingalso the gm spawning faction gear was something that came up before the t20 thing and im pretty sure ccp said what happened with the guyid love to hear more about the proxy stuff it sounds like some grade a tinfoil hattery
im not interested in what happened with the guyim interested in the procedures ccp stated they put in place to prevent these types of events happening againits one thing for a ccp rep to say we have put procedures in place to prevent this happening again its another for those procedures to have actually been implimented and to actually be being usedworkingand yes im sure it may be grade a tinfoil hatterybut the csm are our reps and this is a rumour id like to see quelled or confirmed once and for allmaybe so but wouldnt it be nice to have these things put to rest finallyto have some form of confirmation that these secret proxies even exist or notto have it confirmed by the csm that these policies  which go towards protecting you and me  have actually been put in place
priority proxies lol
cripesanyway if you check the accounts of the csm visit to iceland they went out of their way to grill internal affairs about the things that are done these days to make sure employees and gms behave themselves youre not going to get any of the details though because theyre covered by ndas
personally i couldnt care less about any of them what is it i keep getting rammed down my throat oh yes eve isnt fair get over it
1 we had a talk with the head of internal affairs during out time at iceland and they really seem to be trying their best to avoid situations like t20 and things2 whut wts tinfoil hat
assumption is the mother of all fups
yes we really need more tinfoil hattery
lol is assuming these things dont existno smart engineer leaves the customers route as the only means to access their services no smart engineerwhich suggests that their are alternate methods to connect to the servers so enquiring as to whether these alternate methods are policed at all isnt a lol questionlol is you not realising these things are common placetheres a difference between your hauler getting ganked in empire and a gm spawning gear for himselfbest to avoid them happening best to avoid them becoming public  considering it was hiden an denied for months beforehand as mentioned above theres stuff you cant say but i never once stated i wanted details on how they prevent these kinds of events happening again i completely understand that the procedures put in place if any have been arent even known by the gmswhich is why i am asking are the csm team happy that procedures put in place by ccp to prevent t20gm spawning faction loot type issues from happening again are adequate and working which is a question that has never been answered i also feel its a resonable one to ask considering the incident mentioned was a major force behind the implimenting of the csm
if they promised everything was fine you still wouldnt believe them so whats the point
dude are you really not over that yet or just try to build some steam up against alliance b again by bringing up ancient historywe as in you and your buddies from the instituteive heard stories that did involve you and a horse im sure tho that reciting those stories would not be appropriate here and i suspect that there is little truth in those stories to be honest still they are stories we can have an event some day and share these stories with eachother if you wanti didnt see this on the board before they went to iceland so i guess you are a tad late with that question you should have thought about this question sooner and you should have used the proper channel for the csm to bring this question with them they might not be that obsessed with this part of history as you aresame as abovemy advice to you instead of writing speeches and questioning the csm you should try what most other eve citizens manage to dobring up a proper issue and gather enough support for it so the csm will have to take the issue to ccpbiggest is a realtive term i would definitely not call this the biggest issue in eveif you are so curious in finding out these things then i offer my support for you whenever you decide to start an issue for it not that i care that much myself but if it can help to put the minds of some to rest then i sure will help just one thingthe issue should not contain hints at alliances persons and past events i do not like people using the csm as a toy for their in game political agendas these questions can easily be formulated without stepping on anyones toewhats wrong in not telling about it ccp said they did deal with the issue back then when they figured out they just never made it public i dont think that making it public had anything good coming out of it except for ruining ccps reputation which was the obvious goal of the people who brought this to light well except for the formation of the csm which might either be good or bad this only the future will tell
if by we all you mean the voices in your head then yes
oh hey look an answer to the question that has never been answeredstick around and in the next post ill solve the meaning of life too
from our conversation with the internal affairs department i for one am confident ccp does everything they can to prevent any abuse of special privileges i was very impressed with their rules and ways they enforce them internally  something i cannot expand on unfortunately as for your idea of priority nodes while we didnt literally ask about it it seems extremely unlikely to me that they even exist  and we got no indication from ccp that this would be incorrect it seems a severe case of tinfoil hattery
all this nano stuff is getting annoying lets bring the nos domi back kill nanosmake the minmatars no cap use mean something againmake the pilgrim good againpossiably gimp with optimal  fall off or sigradius based aka that interceptor should be able to hold you down for 30sec1min while its gang mates warp in
helllllll nodont you remember the prenos nerf days booooooringbesides i fear a neuting cursedominix way more than i used to fear them with prenerfed nos especially for killing nanos neuts  prenerfed nos
best way to kill nanonos nuets r crap since u loose cap for nuetin the enemy nos ftw
nos and neuts are fine the way they arenosferatus were clearly overpowerd in the past with no drawbacks at all
the nos nerf was one of the best things that happened to eve ever
well nos should be changed it should use your cap also
unnerf it all you like anybody bringing a nos to neut fight is going to lose
no capless neut for youbesides if a nanoship wont get in neutralizer range and neuts and noss have the same range this would help how
so nano ships all stay outside of 25km and i decided to train amarr you know the prenerfed race before the nos nerf so yes i do remember it
how bout instead of making nos overpowered to combat broken nano setups we nerf nanos and make them sane
youre assisting someone who is considered an enemy of the empires and kill on sight dont make me bring in rl yet valid examples
ok i wont make you bring in rl examples because they have zero relevance to eveand to reiterate if im assisting someone who is not considered kill on sight to the sentry guns why should it make me become kill on sight to the sentry guns bear in mind i am mainly talking about low sec here so no concord involvedand if an outlaw were to venture into high sec concord dont spawn to kill him its left up to the navies yet if i assisted said outlaw in high sec concord would spawn to deal with me whats the reasoning behind this you can give me all the crap about enemy of the empires but the simple fact is that there is a harsher response for helping an outlaw than there is for being an outlaw
youof all on the csmshould know better than to toss off silly oneliners like this 
seems silly needs to be looked at and maybe fixed
i have always thought this a stupid game mechanic and i think it should be looked at
bone notice how i actually state it i make no assumption about anything i just ask a question to provoke an answerbut i think this is completely a matter of perspectiveon one hand you have the ideals for how things would be in real life this could arguably lead to the most interesting and fair fightsbut on the other hand you have the gameplay perspective penalties are harsh you dont want to penalize new players nor people who possibly didnt know betterso which one do you subscribe to i dont know which one i doon the first hand i can see that it would be a bit harsh and would invalidate a tactic which is very powerful anybody who has flown a decent rrbattleship gang will know this i remember flying in a gang which went to hedgp we were fitted for 20100km range with different ammo 2 remote reppers and pumped up effective hp we would jump in and approach the keberz gate whenever someone starts taking fire we would start repping him while he disengage if we couldnt take the heat he would jump into highsecit means you either get a win or a stalemate unless someone screws up completely and you can take down things fairly well as long as its not too much nanobut on the other hand increasing penalties would invalidate these arguably overpowered tacticsi quite frankly do not want to make this call at this point hence why i made that question to try and get an argument against increasing penalties
i would say that your response is a matter for a different topic this isnt a question of whether remote repair gangs are overpowered or not and taking sentry fire does not invalidate the tactics there are plenty of difficulties involved with running a remote rep gang already  ewar range lag  and if you wanted there to be more then why should they apply only to outlawsthe current outlaw system is fine i think most people accept this as i dont see any major complaints about it i am trying to highlight an issue where assisting an outlaw has different penalties to those for being an outlaw unlike the penalties for assisting war targets etcif you think the solution to the problem is increasing the standard penalties for outlaws so that they match the penalties for assisting outlaws i would consider that an alternative fix but assuming the current outlaw system to be working as intended i dont think increased penalties are necessary and the best solution would simply be reducing the penalties for assisting an outlaw even keeping the sec loss would be fine if the gcc was removed
alt post 
yeah if youre going to have gcc like this at least make it sensible there are a lot of random ways to get gcc and have it reset without letting you know for instance if you dock with gcc it resets the counter but does not actually reset the counter that you can see on your screen so you dock with 10 minutes left then undock after that counter is up you will be shot by sentries for an additional 5 minutes each shot resetting the counter to 15 minutes againthe whole gcc counter thing needs to be examined and cleared of errors like this
whatnow you are jc juniorsupported and gcc is goofy anyway given that pilots can evade aggro simply by jumping into the next system to clear the timer
an why should the europeans pay more for services just to hold the dollar up i dont care how currency exchange works i dont care if the american economy is down in america the minimum wage is still above 1000month while in my country is 300month so dont expect to feel sorry for the american economy and pay more to cover the dollar losesi dont think that you would like to see a similar price for goods25 dollars for america15 dollars for the rest of the worldand the issue here is way ccp is charging the europeans more in absolute terms
the very problem is with the price listed that is higher for europe than for others
ffs will you stfu about this already the price for those of you who happen to be euro has not changed you are not paying any more of your income than you were previouslyit would seem to me that you are trying to make those of us who happen to be american pay more of our income out of some petty sense of spite seriously are you so hateful that you want a good chunk of the server population to suddenly have to pay a higher percentage of their income if they want to continue playing
no i just want that we pay the same amount as you for the same product there are no extra expenses if i play the game from europe or from other place is not a sense of spite is simple or make 12 euro for everybody or make it 1495 for everybody i dont care as long we all pay the same priceand things has changed with the gtc modifications
becouse americans are used to have everything cheaper and earn more monayif ccp wont price everone same you can rise this metter to some eu governoment dont rember in english what is called but they will make ccp to give same price for everyone
why werent you arguing for the euros to pay more when the dollar was stronger then oh waityou werentmoreover youre acting like your price has gone up when it most definitely has not  youre still paying the same percentage of your income if this had changed then i could see where youre coming from but as it has not this is nothing more than an attempt to make other people pay a higher percentage of their income when that income hasnt changed eitherim not sure if youre aware of how economics work but just because the exchange rate is different now than it was when eve opened up doesnt mean that americans incomes have changed to match the exchange rate our incomes are the same you are simply asking that a good chunk  37 iirc  of the playerbase pay more of their incomes if they want to keep their subscriptions activewhen continuing with the same subscription costs would not affect you in any way thats pretty selfishconsidering the fact that the relative minimum wage here in the us  565hour  is only 50 of what it was in the late 1960s  10hour adjusted for inflation  and the fact that incomes scale up from there  not to mention the fact that the cost of living keeps increasing quickly but with little increase in income  i expect youll see a substantial portion of the player base dropping their subscriptions or at least the subscriptions of any additional accounts if your request was implemented this would result in less money for ccp
avarage salry in my country is 3hour and i need to pay in euro  why cant i schoose to pay in  or euro why america players get discout 
first you dont pay a percentage of you income for eve you pay a fixed subscription if your economy if falling is only your fault and you problem is not my problemsecond i didnt propose to increase the subscription for us players i simply want to know why i need to pay morethird i get something extra for the extra 5 that i pay the answer is noand the last thing the price has gone up for me why because i am from an noneuro country  there are still many countries in eu that are not using euro as currency  and if the euro is going up relative to my currency and my income is in my country currency i indeed pay a greater fraction of my income  if is a problem about fraction 
you dont get itit is 1495euro how much ccp charges this does not include bank transfer fees and all those are extra if the case on another note phone operators charge differently by country so a company like ccp can charge like this too just a comparison just a comparisonit is not fair but is not somethign that uncommonand i would liek to pay less and have some sort of equality  notice the quotation marks  but i do not want for the us guys to pay more with one expception if by any chance  which i do not think is the case  the extra from eu support the lower fee in the us
well a phone company may have different charges because they need to install hardware in every country and if the price of that hardware is different form country to country is normal that the charges will vary but ccp is not buying hardware in every country where they have subscriptions they only provide a service over internet and the costs of providing that service is the same for all the countries in the worldif i want to rent a
why werent you arguing for the euros to pay more when the dollar was stronger then oh waityou werentand when was the dollar stronger than euro in the last 5 years
joseph i would suggest you move to the united states you can help them improve their economy a bit you can make three times as much as you do now  according to your own estimate of average wages  and you will only have to pay 15 every month to play this advice is free dont come crying if you singlehanded get the us economy back on its feet and youre still paying 15 by the time 15 buys 20it works both ways americans have to pay 15 like everyone else if they want to play the game after they move to europe take a look at price development since eve launch changes on the currency markets and reconsidergreetings grismar
while it is clear europeans have to pay more than americans for the same service  this has nothing to do with the bank fees but is because ccp charges 15 dollarseuros a month regardless of the actual value of the currency  people are right in pointing out that it hasnt gotten more expensive for europeans  and it hasnt gotten cheaper for americans everyone still pays the same amount relative to their income  assuming your income hasnt changed the solution here is to use places like shattered crystal to buy game time cards because in this situation we europeans pull ahead pa 60 day gtc is 3499 or 2207 euros meaning for a month of play you only pay 11 euros instead of 15
actually this is not true for that 11 euro you have to pay vat to and with vat is 13 euro and paying for 2 month by credit card is 1295 euro per month so is no gain there any more there was a gain when the 30 days gtc where still in at 1495 dollars and that was ok but with with the 30 day gtc the options of the european player are gone to
seriously this is so ccp instead of changing the mechanics so that the drawbacks are also on when the module is offline just as the bonus they change the bonus so that it has to be online because thats when the drawbacks workguys you slowly deserve your own page in definitions for both overcomplicated and dumb
there is the same pattern in close range vs long range weapons except torps and hamslong range more fitting less damage less tracking more rangeshort range less fitting more damage more tracking less rangenow hams vs hmlsmore fitting more damage less tracking  ie explosion radius  less rangethey follow everything like turrets except fitting even rockets do follow on the pattern
station camping is often fruitless the ardent station camping fans can baiters and above all mercs  because they have to sit their or get kicked from the corp  provide endless opportunities for enjoyment watching 3612 15 people camp a station flooding local calling the guy a shandy drinker for not coming out alone to fight not even realising hes actually gone to do the laundry and when he finally comes back to see local full of smack he quietly undocks and goes on his merry wayi will never support you people who want to take this enjoyment away from me and i will see you all burn in hell first or something
small siege ship  bslow fuel use structure claiming space  smal lcontrol toweranything else
in addition to sig bonus target painters should also get the same  to explosive velocity of missles and gun tracking i think this would make them more useful
target painters are underrated because few understand how they work and underused because few have the midslots to fit anythe issue is not that target painters suck the issue is that too much essential stuff goes into the same slots that they occupymwd web scram injector the magic four of pvp there is almost no single ship below bc size  and in noncaldari races below bs size  that has more than those 4 midslots and in the rare case they do theyre ew specialized shipsthat is the reason why only torp ravens fit painters  nothing else has slots to spare
make it 00 natural selection works nice
already told that but got bashed by caldarai npc corp guys
first off i apologize if this has been brought up recently in some other thread but i wanted to give my views on this subjectbeing an avid falcon pilot i find that in gangs thats all i ever seem to fly anymore ecm at least in my opinion seems a bit too overpowered these days really the only way to counteract it is by using an eccm or backup arrays which almost hurts you more by wasting a slot or two many times i have seen ships get destroyed before even having the chance to fireoff one shot lets face it i know id hate to be permajammed and basically be helpless to do anything too but im taking advantage of that factnow im not saying to boost sensor dampening to offset ecm i believe dampening especially in principal is a much more balanced form of ew as opposed to ecm you may take much longer to lock the target but you can still lock and send your drones you may only be able to lock something 5km away but thats still enough to put up a fight with anything that gets close ie drones blasterthron etcwith ecm most fights are over before the ship ever has a chance to get a lock in then you have to take into account two ecm ships jamming a single ship even if you have an awesome tank and youre holding out against the dps youre more than likely to run out of cap boosters before youre able to get in a lockdont get me wrong i dont want ecm nerfed like it was before making it practically useless but someone needs to look at this issue i do not know what the answer is possibly a better system of diminishing returns on ecm anyways it would be lovely if this could be looked into maybe itll get me out of my falcon more often and into something else either way its a gameplay balance issue that ive noticed and that i think needs to be addressed
ecm is fine compared to dampening tracking disrupting might need alittle love but thatd be about it also its hard to get within 5km of that target when theyre webbing you from 10km or so making certain you never get into lock range
i think you missed my point about getting into a fight at 5km rangeyou may only be able to lock something 5km away but thats still enough to put up a fight with anything that gets close ie drones blasterthron etcso say the scenario is a blasterthron with arazu support against just you the blasterthron is going to web you so you cant get away but its still going to get in your face along with some ogre iis my point is that youll still be able to lock the blasterthron or the ogre iis and put up some kind of fight  you have best chances especially with a megathron using electrons since their optimal is 45km now lets say the scenario is blasterthron with falcon support youre not even going to be able to get a single lock before that blasterthron takes you down you might as well be afk for the entire fight whats worse is that falcon can be sitting 100km away while youre being permajammed even if you do manage to get a lock for most battleships without a sensor booster youre going to lose your lock to another jam cycle before youve finished locking or the falcon will simply warp away before you can get in rangethe saving grace of ecm is that there arent an incredible amount of people in gangs who fly ecm ships because they rather have awesome dps and be top on the kill mail or whatever happens to float their boat
nerf batting ecm would basically make the falcon suck you brought up the arazu the arazu can put up a tank it can put out some dps and it has a special feature of putting a point on someone from a very far distance 40 to 60km i believe pending on skill and module typethe falcon has none of these traits all it has is the ecm to tank and attack it turns like a turd in a bowl its capacitor sucks  warping long distances can make a long day  and the dps is horrid by putting on a tank or increasing the dps of the ship you are effectively nerfing the ecm yourself
note falcon does not  dps you can fit 2 heavy missiles and still have your all out ecm fit if youre soloing in a falcon then something is wrong if youre trying to fit a tank on a falcon other than plates something is wrongfalcon doesnt need ecm to attack it needs it to tank sure i agree but the ability to sit 100km away from the target while aligned is the strategy you use for a paper falcon and your chances of survival are amazingly highim not saying to nerf ecm as in decrease the overall jamming strength however this ability to have an alt permajamming for you needs to be looked at ive exploited this several times as im sure many others have if you look at it this waydampening still gives you the opportunity to attack a target of some type thus increasing your chances of survival if someone is using a blaster fit and is say 3km away from you then youre able to fight them on most occassions or if youre taking forever to get a lock you still have an opportunity to outlast lock and get some shots offwebbing still gives you the chance to attack a target though you may not be in range however you can still lock and send drones to a designated targettracking disruption again still gives you the chance to attack a target you may not be able to hit them with guns but you can still send dronesdo you see this patternhowever with ecm you cant lock a single target you cant send your drones against a specific target you can launch them and hope that a new weapon type is fired on you after theyre launched so they will aggress thats really all you can do unless you happen to use missiles and have some fofs which really wont save you anyways but its a startnow theres nothing wrong with the way ecm works but the ability to permajam someone for over a minute seems a bit too overpowered granted most fights ive encountered with my falcon have lasted 30 seconds or so thats why i think there needs to be some sort of diminishing return on ecm or something comparable to it ecm wouldnt be nerfed to the point where its useless but it helps to balance the different ew typesmost people use turrets how do you combat against sensor dampening with turrets you try and get in range of something close to you how do you combat against being webbed change to longer distance ammo how do you combat against tracking disruption you can web the guy get his transversal down and fire but what are you supposed to do with ecm if youre using turrets there arent many options at least not as many as all the other forms of ew  this is simplified of course but really there arent many options when you cant lock and theres no chance of you lockingof course fleet combat or large scale engagements is much different but if the ratio of ecm ships is the same in small gangs the principal is essentially the same hopefully im explaining what i mean clearly
the keep at range and orbit functions should be an atribute you set to each shipyou should not have to reset it when jumping into differing ships
very good ideaits very annoying how it is nowbeing able to add our own custom distances to the right click menu would be good to
even if you could have a particular setting that sticks youd still have to switch the settings if you used different ammo
yes that is true but this would still be more convenienti find often people tend to use very specific ammo types with given ships and whilst you always want flexibility this change would greatly reduce resetting the ranges
when you move a character into a sub folder in your pp they should not be duplicated but rather moved to that folder onlyprovition should be made so you can make copies for different folders should you wish to do so
your analogy is flawed because salvage is not your property its ffaso business as usual then
ok this is simple a dev as in the guys that made the game said pretty clearly that salvage is nobodys not yours not mine nobodys they arent going to change that as much as you qq here on the forums or in game therefore you are deluded you are trying to place your mark on things not yours which irl is called stealingtake your delusions and morality and go play hello kitty or something
this really isnt the point of what many of us were seeking at allpersonally i am wanting a sufficient large scale exploration ship as a matter of convience sure but it gets old having to use an alt parked in a safe spot and having more than one ship in a given area im trying to work is also just making it easier for me to get scanned out and trust me my outlook on life is just fine as are my skillsi still think the idea of a new exploration ship has some merit so im glad to see the topic still being kicked around even if its on the back burner
im an explorer and id like to see something like this as well  i think there are plenty of ways to make it not an all in one ship looking at the marauders alone there are techniques that can be used to hamstring a ship for pvp but give it pve advantages like the abnormally weak sensor strengthan exploration ship could be made to be incompatible with the recon probe launcher so that it is only used for hunting down exploration sites and not players could have an abnormally large sig radius weak sensor strength etc to counteract a larger hull being equipped with combat and cloaking capabilities for exploration purposestheres also the possibility that it wouldnt need a covops cloak  but these are all details ccp would figure out anyway and its more about the need explorers have for a platform to meet their playstyle
first things first you need to learn how to hit the enter button and make paragraphs grammar wouldnt hurt you eithersecond over twenty thousand players have already gone through the noob mess youre talking about this is a sandbox game every time youre going to try something new itll be in different places around eve and it just doesnt make sense to make noobonly areasif you dont want to be blown up stay in high sec and get the experience you need in order to not get blown up
ignoring the grammar comment seeing as it is irrelevantwhy doesnt it make sense getting experience takes alot of time which is just fine but it is not fine for the fact that it wont keep a lot of potentially long term players interested in the game before hand
the n00b areas already exist 10 through 5 systems they are in a npc corp immune from war decs the only thing have to worry about in these systems are suicide ganks  in which they at this stage they should have little or nothing to give reason to get ganked  and their own stupidity i mean how much codling do you think is needed
im talking about noob low sec areas as well though call it what you will but i think it would get more folks interested in this game if they could face those of their own or similar skill and sp lvl give them something to do and yet have it so that what they do doesnt mean immediate explosion for exploring the funner aspects of this game i would rather help them then hinder them to have more folks in this game
updated the op with additional agenda items  csm please check mailing list for submission docs associated with these 
yeah and about as much hp as a battleship for good measure
agreed to force the enemy into close combatthe damps themselves should stay the same to prevent the old problem with them everyone using themif the ship bonuses are increased to much they may make one damp on an arazu too powerful enabling the pilot to lockbreak many enemies after all damps are 100 certain to dampso how about this give the gallente ewar ships the bonus of not applying stacking penalties for rsds rsds from two celestises on one target would be stacked though with one ship doing 80 damping even though it does 100 damping from two or more of its damps

i have requested this issue to be added to tomorrows csm meeting  
signed should be obvious why
this would really help
if not dualtriple screen support then it would at least be nice for proper multiple client support  and most likely easier to do too  ega shared object cache for every running client on a machine option for a borderless window mode automatic placement on a screen when logging in shared mail state  if i read corp mail on one clientaccount i dont want to read the same again on the other account  shared overview settings  i dont want to repeatedly update my overview settings on every account when theyre all the same 
signed
would be nice but i dont think it should be high priority
standingsissue standing slotscheers
great ideasigned
as the main problems have been posted already like the jump rang fuel cargo bay and the bad lock times i seen some interesting ideas to boost this ship to be more interesting and to have a rolefor example star jumping not sure if this is the right name but i guess most will understand what i mean th ability to jump 1 system and jump to a proximity of a star in the next door system would open loads of options that would make this ship class interesting though its potential of being exploited is big when there arent any restriction1 startjump uses 95 cap and this starjump mod can be activated only once every hour   or so   so you cant really escape losing fights by star jumping out and you cant use it to travel trough hostile systems by jumping trough them all unseen and untouchedthe bo starjumps to next system he opens a cov ops cyno so the second bo can jump up the black ops gangcov ops cloak on a bo would make this ship to powerful in my opinion with a fuelrange adjustment and an better locktime this ship class will be a lot better and then with a starjump option it will get a good role also
how about changes along these linesthey are both if compared to the roles recons have combat variants not forcecombat so instead of one being ewar and cloak and the other ewar and dps  as is the case with recons  one can do the racial ewar one can do the racial damage and both can covops cloakto balance this they retain most of their current weaknesses1 they have low sensor resolution so that they cannot solo  need a covert tackler of some form to actually kill something2 they have low hp so lend themselves poorly to tanking3 they have low numbers of weapon hardpoints as now so you cannot choose to fit say 7 turrets or 7 launchers but are limited as now to 5this way you have a new and different way of distinguishing between the 2 variants  because they are both actually combat variants  and both variants retain the wetwork capabilities granted by the covops cloak  if they dont have it they are by no means covert operations ships if every time you want to move you are visible then you are not a behind the lines ship  unless you are nanoed up the wazoo but that is another matter eg widow  ewar version  jam strengthrange bonuses for bs skill covops cloak cpu bonus and missile damagerof  pick 1  bonus on bo skill  note damage bonus is on the bo skill  reduces dps from all but the most hardcore of pilots and even at 5 damage dealing ability is lower than combat version due to only 1 weapon bonus widow  combat version  missile rofvelocitydamage on bs skill  pick 2  then covops cloak cpu bonus and jam strength bonus on bo skill  again at bo 5 the ships overlap to a degree  jam strength is lower unless bo 5 and even then range is lower to differentiate them this would be a good way of generating 2 flavours of black ops ships i thinki think fuel bay and jump range increases and ability to either jump to stars or jump into cynojammed systems should also be added to black ops functionality though someone had a nice idea of using a deep space transport  name defines which t2 indy can go  as the jumpable fuel bay for a black ops gang

i must admit that bops need a serious looking into as they stand several good ideas above that i like starting with1 dedicated fuel bays increased jump range ability to jump into cynojammed systems  all in conjunction with a portal being lit for you  lastly being able to use a jump portal without having a second character  only make it a randomstar jump into the system and based on cap rather than fuel 2 need to base the bops on there respective recon conterparts as suggested in above posts to give them a defined role3 as most people have said above these ships are supposed to be geurilla warfare types so in that respect i dont like the idea of them having great tanks they should be in and out quickly hitting as hard and fast as they have the abilitytaking into account no3 when stealth bombers are used in conjuntion with the above ships with there new abilities then you will have a decent dpsbut one way or another these ships do need a serious overhaul and not the softly softly approach some are adventing in this thread if all you do is change a small amount then your still not addressing the problem with the ship being underpowered and undefined in its true rolemy twopenneth
exactly my thought on this this is one of the most frustrating things in eve especially when youre new and training a whole bunch of lowranks skills to levels 13 just give us a backupskill to set and be done with it

signedbeing able to jump somewhere and back is what matters could be done by simply not applying the 24 hour counter if youre jumping to a clone that was active less than 24 hours ago ie its still fresh that way if you jump you can jump back and forth between that clone and the one you were in in the first place
yes definitely  
signedthe two main issues mentioned in the post that i dont like area  removal of choice  bring back the 3090 day gtcsb  inconsistency of pricing  cc  gtc should be equivalent and the price should also be independent of currency imo fix the price in euros or dollars and let exchange rates take care of the rest
eve needs to be cheaper than wow end of

i agree with what ccp didi have no problem at all with it and to add to it i do wish that ccp would stop skill training on all accounts that go to inactive status

heres an idea how about making war declaration a bit more complex by as you said setting up war dec goals but also limiting the decs to constellations regions highsec or lowsec for instance that way you can pick and choose what type of war dec you are afterwar decs on a corporation or alliance1 evewide wardec you can attack anyone anywhere but as one goal has been reached the war ends2 region wardec you can attack anyone in that region but as two goals have been reached the war ends3 constellation wardec you can attack anyone in that constellation but as three goals have been reached the war ends4 highsecurity wardec you can attack anyone in highsecurity space for the duration of the wardec5 lowsecurity wardec you can attack anyone in lowsecurity space for the duration of the wardecgoals1 inflict x amount of kills against said entity 2 receive x amount of ransom isk from said entity3 entity x disbands or if an alliance x  of member corporations leave the alliance4 receive x amount of item x  from said entityetc
there are several good ideas above that i believe should get serious consideration due to the fact of the woeful state that bombs are in atmfor the price you pay for the bombs they definitely need to be more powerful with a greater area of effect and falloff this would work well with the idea that a small fast ship with low sig radius would still have a chance of getting away with lesser damage while the slower larger ships will get a greater hit if a ship was caught with its pants down and was stationary then it should recieve the full benefit of the bombs effectsno matter what happens to the deploying ship as long as the bomb was successfully launched the it must detonatei like the idea of having multiple bomb launchers  3  with the ability to also carry 3 bombs in the cargo hold this would allow the pilot to work away from home rather than close to areas where stock is available and also reward a pilot if he stays alive to get another chance at causing trouble  rather than being a one shot wonder im undecided as to whether you would need a cocd on the sb as that i believe would be taking away the role of the covops ship to a certain degree as long as the sb can warp into lets say a covops at 0km  as suggested above  deploy his bomb straight away and then at least have a chance at warping out then in my mind that is a good enough trade off with the above suggestions taken into considerationmy twopenneth
disabling services should also apply to 00 npc stations in my opinionhow can you reliably stop an alliance using npc station services currently you cannot
ccp if my view is of interest the problem isnt that they cannot be destroyed but  they cannot move be moved and thus since a station dont fly anyplace the system cannot be made free of the station if the placement of the station was extremely badly planned in some guys view the constellation just got messed up and blown for eternal timeits like making a commandconquer base in a bad place and get it flooded with engineers who take it badid settle with kicking it as a football into tau space so a titan would be needed to cyno it out again fex in different system same constellation  or a destroyable outpost where its content would be shipped to closest constellation outpost as a fleet of scc and concord ships depart and simply head for closest stationthe destruction of assets are not imho a desired outcome but outposts as non destructible parts of 00 might be undesired in someones viewand i have to add i understand its a lot of designs who would need re evaluation if these lines of ideas was done touching upon database sql design of features and not in the least safe stuff as stationsmy idea with kicking the station into limbo tau space 5 dimention of nether zone or whatever would work best mechanically but then you get ppl logging on to find they cant undock until someone bring the station back into eves world again
interesting i had no idea that simply shifting contents from the hangar to guns could cause such large amounts of lagi would love a more technical explanation of why this is so and what can  or cant  be done to fix it im guessing this is just an issue of lag being caused when any generic item is moved from one container to another though this would be a bit of a hack why not give weapons an ammoquantity attribute and an ammotype attribute where the ammotype attribute references a singleton entity that provides the damage types and modifierscalling a function on a singleton object might be significantly faster than moving items between containers
yes and nomaking multiple commands increases the network load because youre sending change x ammo eight times instead of change 8x ammo from the servers perspective the fact that the commands come in sequentially lets it process the requests as they arrive instead of being slammed by all of them at once im guessing that the server cycles are a greater bottleneck then network bandwidth
biggest problem i have with ccp is that they are far to quick to focus on new shiny at the expense of getting the core gameplay righti have a really hard time believing that fixing the server load problem they describe is harder than for instance introducing a pointless walkinginstations modulesupport the original request dont support this nonsense response from ccp
with every signature of support on this thread we come one step closer to realizing the dream of the cetacea stellarum i am in full support of this idea
this sure could add some interesting new concepts
nice and its a simple thing that fits into existing gameplay rather than requiring whole new mechanics unlike some real ccp projects we could mention
lots of ideas being bandied around and for what its worth heres some of mine1 you cannot just get rid of pos there is so much time and effort been put into established sovereignty and infrastructure that you cannot just nullify them make them more defined in what each type of pos can do and what can be done to them would be a good startif you want to make smallmedium sized gangs more useful in 00 territorial warfare and working towards goal related warfare then make it easier to target small and medium pos make small and medium pos purely logistical with only a very limited array of weapons for defence the likes of jammers bridges cyno gens mining arrays etc can only be put at smallmed pos this makes it easier for those size gangs to be able to actually cause alliances some damagewhen it comes to taking over systems then its back to the normal large deathstar pos for claiming sov but with one change being large pos can only be anchored at planets  thus eliminating pos spammage 2 any help in changing how the pos are fuelled and the general upkeeping of pos would be greatly appreciated making this process less tedious and time consuming for all would be a welcome change and let people get back to having some time ingame for fun againconclusion  to stop quite so much boring pos sieges cut down on the number of large pos needed to get sov in a system ie planets for sovereigntywith this one change alone you will have cut down on the number of large poss being deployed be a factor of 10 and from that point on for ccp to remove the idea of pos claiming sov will be a lot easier on current alliances than just moving towards a fw or multiple layer solution and wasting billions upon billions of isk in regards of current infrastructure that is currently in placei have no problem with ccp moving forward with new ideas for sovereignty in 00 but do believe they need to structure it properly the ideas for getting more smallmed gangs moving through space with dedicated goals to achieve to disableaggrevate an enemies infrastructure is a good idea in principle just dont go rushing into anything too soon like that

probably because its hard to boost mining missions so they arent rewarding way too much or they arent rewarding enough
i think this thread gets little attention because most miners wrote off mining missions as being totally useless months or years ago they take a long time pay badly and are generally just as dull as the real dealthat said i would love to have them have a point being predominantly a miner
the old  first days of the new mining missions  extra reward was nice having some low sec00 ore spawning in the mission  or even some largegood quality high sec ore  will give a reward similar to looting  ie you spend extra time and get extra isk  without being unbalancing  you still need to clear the mission target so the mining yield is less than doing a regular mining op  at worst if ccp fear people farming the missions they can implement a 12 hours mission limit like for militia missions
come on fixand make the gas cloud harvesting mission shorter  with 4 gas harvester it still can take 2 hours of mind numbing  watching  or more rewardable  that the gas is actually useful   spending 2 hours doing really sucky thing  cause you already rejected another gas cloud mish 30 secounds ago  isnt fun
this too
i agree mining missions need some love
id have to think that the only people who benefit from mining missions are those who sell the corresponding minerals at the station at a high price which is then sold to someone getting said mission and not wanting to bother with it buys said high priced ore that still comes under the reward total just to get it over withrun on sentence ftw
yes mining missions need love for one they should put back the generic asteroids maybe limit them in mineable ore amounts or reduce the time until mining mission expires so that farming those missions does not create too much of an imbalanceat least put back some kind of rocks for the scenery because at the moment they look very empty
are you using a full flight of 5 drones are they t2 or t1 drones which damage type are they against which factionmy experience with level 3 missions is that medium sized t2 drones can do everything you want done assuming moderate to well trained drone skills the most popular for missions seem to be the t2 hammerheads it isnt until you get to level 4 missions that the characteristics of fast npc frigates really make the light scout drones a better choice than the mediumsim not sure why the mediums failed you in your mission i can however see why the heavy drones failed your assesment is correct tracking is an issue for those big slow drones also they have a tendency to be too slow to stay in proper range of fast moving frigates even in level 3 missionsthank you for your supportwindjammer
attack patterns for drones where they fly in a fixed formation perhaps
ive not noticed the bumping problem but supported anyway
so essentially you have lost 36 million isk to the suicide ganking issue in the course of 25 years just over a million or two a year  depending how i read your words and you honestly think they broke even or slightly better than even they could have made more money ratting or doing missions than ganking you suicide ganking isnt as severe as you think especially in your caseso you mined an hour to make up your loss and the ganker ratted an hour to burn his sec status back up no one really lost anything
ah but i pay attention to what im doingthe mack would have hurt with t2 harvesters and the named upgrades the one in the ice belt sucked for them the others the mods alone would have covered their losses after insurancenow it really wouldnt hurt any even losing my hulk i got enough isk made off it that its paid for itself plus i got enough in my account i can easily afford a replacement with or without rigs
instead answer this onefor what reason would you go after a miner in highsecif they were funding an enemy the proposed changes would make little to no difference you blow them up if they smacked you in local enough to tick you off you blow them up again no changeif they were sitting there in the belt doing nothing and you wandered by and thought hey maybe i should just blow up a miner now you have to put something on the line as it is right now if 2 t2 strips and 2 t2 expanders drop you break even after insurance while blowing up a ship worth in excess of 300m if they have rigs on a ship that cannot in any situation defend itself from the attack and still do its job with any efficiency when hundreds of these ships are blown up for the lolz with little financial loss and hundreds more ships are beign blown up simply because they are flying through space the costs need turned up a bitwe already discussed tradeable killrights that could be the answer instead of insurance because it again increases the costs against the attacker as they never would know when they are sitting at a station undock port waiting to kill something if that gank ship that just warped in was going to target them instead because they now hold a contract on them
see this is where i think the problem is those making the attacks are willing to do so without making sure they can break even it costs them so little they arent worried about individual targets because they know in the long run they will get an idiot hauling too muchthey can gank all the idiots they want i just want them to have to selectively target the ship that will make them iskies
the very issue with suicide ganks is only that there is no risk nor real effort for the ganker voiding insurance for concord would provide risk for people too lazy to find good targets and more effort for those who do because the measure for good targets goes up a few notches so yes this would solve the problem without destroying that playstyle it would just become limited to those who professionally pursue it or those who can take a fairly hard financial hit for the lulz which is as it should be imhohow insurance doesnt make sense from an rp perspective is beyond me that might be your opinion but certainly no proofonly professions that do not directly hurt other players should require no cost professions that base their success on directly causing loss for other players should and for the most part do have a cost only suicide ganking and scamming which ironically are those that hurt the victim most usually have virtually no consequences and since you need to be fairly stupid to be scammed but can be suicided while just playing the game normally something needs to be fixed therealso suicide ganking has not been a problem for a long time due to external cicumstances there used to be enough of targets in lowsec for the pirates to play with battleships with fittings used to be a more significant loss even with insurance there was no overheat deadspace equipment used to be a lot cheapernow i guess we could also get rid of the easy mode probing of lowsec mission runners remove the drone regions again and get rid of t2 mining ships get rid of overheating and put static plexes back in but nerfing insurance for concord kills is a lot easierif all players were equally vulnerable everywhere you would play with 400 others not 40000 and you would cry about everyone being the same as you and thus no targets to visit grief upon and what is better no targets at all or a lot of targets most of which are invulnerable but some of which are not the only reason to prefer the former is pure spite against those who have the gall of wanting to play the game for themselves rather than being content for youand to avon the proposed nerf to insurance would only kill your insurance if you appear on a killmail so newbies or idiots who accidentally trigger concord would not be affected at all
this is an argument that has been shot down repeatedly there is risk and effort for the ganker however that risk and effort is based entirelly on the precautions and the intelligence of the victim suicide gankers prey on stupid players voiding insurance is a stupidplayer protection scheme no its been proven quite well time and again insurance in eve is not an rp mechanism its completely stupid that any company would pay out as much as they do with so low premiums hell they even have a completely free option where they pay out 13 of the ship cost for no isk in premium in short insurance is a game mechanic to drive the economy not rpwhy should those professions have a cost i dont think they should hurting other players is pretty relative anyway you can argue that miners hurt other miners when they mine their oreno you have to be pretty stupid to get suicide ganked tooso why arent you whining about those things insteadand a complete cop out if you feel the problem lays elsewherethis paragraph is so wrong and i dont have characters left to answer it ill just say its dumb
its just that it is not very reasonable  not that i expect you to understand the meaning of this word  to demand those things changed back as it would be a truckload of work and have far reaching consequences while insurance nerf fixes the problem as well and only has consequences for a few griefers who have it way too easy in the first placeit is not dumb it is just beyond your comprehension to grasp what motivates other people to play a game and anyone tying to enjoy the game in ways not according to your vision is a worthless carebear to you anyway so anything he says is wrong by defaultbut to get down to your level the only dumb thing is trying to argue with you a brick wall is more openminded and has a better understanding of balance
just for you leandro ill explain why the paragraph is indeed dumbno wed probably get rid of some wastes of space that fail to realise that eve is predominantly a pvp game but then again there would be much less animosity among the community if everyone realised what kind of game they are playing a good tradeoff if you ask methere are no targets now im talking low sec here where piracy is supposed to be a driving force people are so scared of losing their pixelboats that they all retreat to high sec we are forced to follow excellent straw man there would always be targets the targets would obviously be smarter on average than your common apple pie but that would just be a good thingno as i have already explained i would rather have a game with a few less stupid players and get rid of all the whines about the game being too hard that in my view would make eve a much better game
dont try to act smart it doesnt become you what is reasonable or not is not up to you to decide i think its very reasonable to expect ccp to look for whats best for the game and make plans for the future i would very much like those plans to entail a complete rework of the entire empire with all the security mechanics revisited that would be very reasonable as right now they are pretty stupid insurance nerf is as even you hinted at a bandaid for the broken leg that is empireit is dumb carebears are pretty worthless as they dont contribute anything to the game they are the parasites of eve not adding anything but demanding that the game should be changed to suit them a carebear does not see reason he wants everything handed to him on a platter preferrably silver i say  off and go back to wowwe have argued before leandro and you lost that argument too know whats best for you and stop posting
if you really believe that you are quite delusional eve is what the players make it and despite the devs having started it as a pkers paradise it has developed into a nicely balanced game for anyone but the most diehard wow carebear and to me that is far preferable to what you suggest and i think you seriously underestimate the number of players in the game not interested at all in hurting others or becoming content for those who are interested in that well it is not our fault that ccp made lowsec missionrunners pirate loot waiting to happen and does not provide proper means to fight back before the pirates have fired the first shot or the silly way docking games work get those things fixed and people will probably come back to lowsec and piracy can go where it belongs again i know i used to enjoy lowsec back when but today there is just no point to living there anymorewell i guess you might actually be honest enough in your crusade against anyone not interested in ganking or being ganked that there is no hypocrisy in you and you would really enjoy only targets that are hard to impossible to catch and yield no great loot but i am afraid most of the few people that would stay in your vision of eve would not enjoy it for longthe players i am campainging for are not stupid they are casual stupid players should get ganked and will still get ganked even when suiciders get no insurance anymore but a mission runner flying a simple faction fitted cnr without using an alt scout a cloaking device andor refitting in the nextdoor system should not be suicider prey imho he should be able to relax and enjoy the game without extreme risk from other players if anything the missions themselves should become more challenging at least against that you could fight back properly but if you jump a mission bs into a suicider camp you are dead no matter what unless you have a cloak on and even that wont help you anymore when the suiciders adapt to people doing this
i would agree with this just that your definition of reasonable seems to be whatever ki an deems right plus imho a band aid is still better than no treatment at all for that broken legwhile i agree that true wowesque carebears those that want instances and pvp flags and stuff truly contribute little to the game the suicide ganking affects a lot of normal players as well those that simply want to play a space game in a fairly relaxed manner and they provide the market with demand they provide ccp with subscriptions they provide other people with someone to chat to they eventually provide pirates with targets and likely someday even go out seeking pvp themselves and one suicide gank in the missionship progression stage of such a players eve career will most likely end it then and there which imho is bad for the game not good like you think i vastly prefer the contribution of this type of player over what suiciders contribute against the gamei dont remember losing any argument to you ever i only remember losing interest in the arguments from time to time because however much i am willing to go towards some sort of compromise you will not budge one inch from your eve is only good if you can grief anyone anywhere anytime attitude
why
all that is needed  without changing mechanics or style and feeling of pk heaven that is eve  is removal of insurance payout for suicide gankers police destroyed your ship after you committed crime insurance corp doesnt pay up
you call them wastes of space ccp calls them customers thankfully your opinion doesnt matter in this instanceand i suppose you wouldnt happen to fall under the category of those obsessed with destroying others pixelboats would youand by smart you really mean players that share your own opinions nothing more nothing less everyone else is just stupidexcept this will make the game harder just not to those you despise so much so by default this proposal gets your thumbs down
gonna leave the rest of your replies as most of it just falls into that agree to disagree cathegory making it futile to discuss however i would like to make a point here that faction fitted faction battleships does not fall into the casual gamer cathegory a casual gamer just looking to run some missions would set up a normal raven with t2 mods on this has a lot of advantages for the casual gamer1 it does not cut into his bottom line he has more liquid isk if he doesnt put it all on his ship2 it actually makes the missions more of a challenge not much of a challenge but still a bit 3 it does not attract suicide gankersa player flying a faction fitted faction bs should be the subject of suicide ganks he has chosen to pimp his ride in order to flaunt his wealth it should not come as a surprise that other people will want a piece of it
this is where i believe you go wrong a faction fitted faction battleship is the pinnacle of the casual gamers gaming but it is nothing in the ranks of real pimp rides he starts running missions in a lowly t1 ship with t1 fittings and as he earns money he progresses in the game by improving his ship and running his missions ever faster may not be your way of play but i can assure you that this kind of playstyle is very rewarding to less aggressive mindsets it took me two years to get slightly bored of it and i still make occasional excursions into itcertainly there should be a point at which the increase in wealth flaunting by far outweighs the increase in mission efficiency and thus makes the ship a valid suicider target but imho that point should not come as low as it currently does where anything with two navy invuls will present 5 suicide ravens with a worthwhile payday voiding concord insurance would pretty much put it at the perfect point imho which is somewhere around 1 billion in fittings
no it hasnt it has been claimed that the only reason this happens is because 1  people are stupid 2  npc corpers we have shown and have had multiple people point out that 1  happens to empty or near empty ships that are undocking and have no option of getting away 2  pc and npc corp ships alike equallyi recommend you do some more looking around and come back with proof for yourselfthink about these two statements and you see where you go wrong first you say we will lose only wastes if things are equally as dangerous but then you say people are so scared of you in lowsec they have moved to high sec that should tell you one thing eve would be as empty as lowsec if your desires were how things were that and you would be fighting blob warfare against people with fleets of titans like you despise since we have to make the danger the same everywherethe majority of gamers do not want to participate in pvp ccp provides for nonconsentual pvp in many ways but at the same time does not guarantee that you can find itno carebears  no targets for you to shoot at no carebears  no one to buy your expensive loots no carebears  no money for ccp no carebears  no servers for youeveryone has a place in this game ccp has stated so repeatedly they have stated that a nonviolent lifestyle is perfectly viable that is why this will be altered the balance has shifted sufficiently against ccps claims of how they want their game
it has been shot down repeatedly read this and the other threads gankers risk time  something ashen admittedly an idiot but anyway has claimed over again is a factor in the risk for miners  they risk kill rights they risk isk  not much but some  and they risk bad standings with npc empires if they fire on npc corpers people are able to mitigate their own risk to a degree where it is either not profitable to hit them or they are very hard to hit what you are speaking about are the exceptions thats not how suicide ganking is normally done and those that do it are pretty bad at suicide ganking whatever the case if they fire at empty haulers noone is loosing anything but the ganker so theres really no problemno if we cleaned up the wussier elements of the game new players would have a chance to grow and become active in the pvp side of the game later on thus fixing low sec right now the carebear population is effectively scaring new players out of low sec with wild tales i know ive seen it in the npc corp chatsthats a pretty rubbish statement its bs because you are stupid if you play a predominantly pvp game with a dislike for pvp i know that goes for many of the posters in this thread but you continuously prove yourself to be on the lower scale of the intelligence graph also you have absolutely no proof so this statement effectively comes right out of your ass let it stay there next timemore bs no carebears we shoot good players no carebears good players buy expensive loots at less expensive price no carebears eve remains a niche game but doesnt die no carebears we all live happyface it nobody needs youviable yes effective no pvp will always rule this game because thats how its setup carebears will always find a way to play the game but they will never ever be a needed and contributing factor
i think suicide ganking is a legitimate mechanic but atm it may be a bit too cheap i dont think insurance should be removed or any of that but i do think the insurance values should be redone  i mean hell regardless of what youre using the ship for 100 insurance is always wayyy over market value of the ship  so just drop the insurance payouts by like 26
you need to spend more time in high sec around trade hubs it is not an exception anymore like has been pointed out previously precisely and if they get blown up now while they are still carebears and lose the whole 10m in t1 missiles they are carrrying they are less likely to stay in the game and try pvp later they are already jaded against it hence the whole reason for safer spaceand yet you just said that you have driven your targets out of lowsec and have to persue them into highsec doesnt that tell you something you are scaring them out more than npc corp chats lowsec is empty because it has been overhunted not because of wild stories start an alt and take a mining barge or ratting cruiser into lowsec in caldari space i give you 20 minutes before it is blown up  ant that is on a quiet night  is this bad no but dont try to paint it as anything elseunnessesary insults aside i have more proof than you have to the contrarythe most visible ones at the moment lowsec being empty you admit that they dont want to fight you there so have left npc corps the main reason given by both the pvpers and the carebears for being there is the wardec system and not wanting to be blown up even the whines about suiciding of miners and haulerswhat do you have for evidance whines on the forums about not being able to attack people because they stay in stations to wait out wardecs corp hop stay in npc corps etc the pvpers whines do more to reinforce my stand than hurt it personally i like the fact that eve is dangerous i shoot back i can also see where broken mechanics are and where that hurts the game because my world and people i talk to in game extends beyond the pvp corps and alliances i play with small corps and alliances with players from 1 mth to 3 years old mostly pve but occasional forays into lowsec for fun i have no issue with pvp i have an issue where broken game mechanics fail to be the detriment they were intended to be
maybe the solution is for ship producers to put up their pricesinsurance pays on a base mineral price  if people are selling ships for less than that price and therefore the gankers can mitigate their costs through insurance then why arent we all just buying and resellingmelting downinsurance frauding all these underpriced ships
doesnt work like that if you sell for x someone else will always sell for y undercutting you by 01 iskif a few manufacturers controlled the market  think the old t2 market  then that would work otherwise they will sell for what they think will move the product and make them a profit it is too easy to build things hence too many producers on the market manyof them also believe that just because an agent gave them their datacores or they mined their own ore that those items are free
simple when one person attempts to sell a ship at higher price someone will inevitably undercut them if possiblethis is made worse when many consider minerals they mined to be free  rather than consider the actual market value of them  or value them as cheaper makes me laugh to see someone say they can make a profit on a module that costs 500k to make and sells for 450k for example because they mined the mineralsonly real way to get the insurance  ship cost for the more popular ships would be npc only sales of all shipsand for awhile people were melting them down and some still do  though its usually more effective to just buy modules to reprocess  shuttles were a good exampleits the amount of market competition  people see which ships are in demand so they work on producing them as cheaply as possible to still make a profit while undercutting the others
i fail to see how ashen angles observation is flawed i know people who sit in station with a trading alt and do this very thing they make an insane amount of money doing it because they know how just to give you persepective i know one who spent over a billion on a new pimped up marauder and 2 days later hed recovered the expenditure through tradewindjammer
so basically there isnt enough risk or loss to drive up costshmmm
hey ive just had an idea say if there was a way for people to randomly attack peaceful miners and the logistics chains that support ship production maybe mineral and ship prices would rise to a point where suicide ganking would be unprofitablemaybe suicide gankers could do it oh waitbut ships still cost less than the insuranceohin that case the only logical conclusion is that suicide ganking does not have enough of an impact to drive up prices to the point where it then nerfs itselfsorry what was the problem again
hehe that is the pvpers mind thinkingthe pveers mind doesnt think that way loss of a mining ship doesnt equate higher cost of doing business it equates grinding 2 months to buy another oneif they could only get their isk back through mining or hauling then yes they would mentally add the costs of lost ships back into their prices but only right until someone else that didnt get blown up kept theirs the same because as soon as they factored their loss in they immediately cannot sell because someone else is lower
there is market competition to fill the demand problem arises when everyone sees that x sells well and jumps to fill the need flooding the marketthere are plenty of t1 ships that cost more than the minerals used in them and make a nice profit  100 insurance on a magnate for example only covers 50 of the ships market value t2 ships are the worst for insurance vs cost there will always be modulesships that dip below the cost to make them due to oversupply at that time when it becomes unprofitable many will move to the next big thingmuch like mining when trit is selling really well most will focus on it and then the rest of the minerals go up as the supply tapers off but once the rest rise up enough and trit drops it happens again with the best mineral availableits the result of a dynamic market
at one time in my life i raced sail boats one of the more prominent racers from that time in my life once stated the following if you cant dazzle them with brilliance baffle them with bull i beleive you are attempting the latter part of that statementwindjammer
the problem is not a lack of demand its an oversupply of minerals because someone had the ingenious brainfart of giving us regions  and to a lesser degree missions  where the npcs drop minerals instead of bounties thus forcing even nonminers to flood the market with themand mineral haulers are not exactly primary targets for suiciders anyway now maybe if the suiciders did go after anything hauling huge amounts on minerals into the production centersbut that is utopic since it is more profitable to gank item haulers on the way tofrom jita or mission runners and disrupting the mineral supply would make them cut their own flesh and suiciders are a lot of things but usually not stupid
i could just as easily say that eliminating suiciding nonconsensual pvp etc from the game will not hurt it either it might actually grow as it becomes safer and more players stay of course it wouldnt be eve anymore but some great wow in space i would leave alsowhat this is doing is hurting gameplay in the weakest areas of the game and driving off younger players before they even have the option of discovering other areas there is also an illogical concept of the government funded insurance rewarding you for performing illegal actions think younger in this case as a mental state not age they havent graduated to attempting other aspects willinglyi would even say that by suiciding mining barges and haulers you are even driving more players to other more pve oriented contect like missions where they are less likely to get ganked because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time we all know how well most people love mission runners and their risk free iski would also say that suiciding miners increases macros and isk sellers every legitimate mining barge you blow up equals a player that has to consider going back into the belts again macros and isk sellers dont care they go right back because it is not a game they play for fun think about that one if you play for fun are you likely to continue an activity that results in you losing your stuff all the time macros dont care about the fun aspect
i can see youre focusing on pure economics to do so is a narrow view designed to aid you in this argument and given the style youve written some of your posts in i really do not think youre overly worried about muddying the watersleaving pertinent data out of an argument of this nature is a lot like manipulating statistics you can make them say anything you want by leaving little things out of the calculationsto leave the concepts of fun and excitement out of this discussion is to ignore an important set of data if you approached playing eve from a pure economic standpoint and you believed miners were making more iskhour than you youd be a miner you say you believe miners make more iskhour than you and yet youre a can flipper whats wrong with this picturewindjammer
so in a nutshell we are saying that it is too easy and too safe to produce minerals and ships  thus prices are rock bottomso we should be looking at ways to encourage more widespread and effective suicide attacks on miners in order to force up prices and thus raising the cost of gankingagreed this twisting logic thing that you guys use is just so much fun 
let me fill in the pieces that you conveniently left outcant wait for the first whine on the forums oh god i accidentally activated a mod in highsec received a warning regarding this action clicked ok anyway got concorded and received no insurance and realized i was an idiot and realized that i should not receive insurancefixed it for you
unworthy of and beneath you im embarrassed for you
im framing this and sticking it next to my pccomedy gold
or we could simply take away all pve content including industry and have npcs issue ships as needed for freeremoves carebear from the equation all together but we all know that would kill the game now dont webesides suiciding miners doesnt cut it i can sit in stations and even without scrap metal reprocessing make more off modules than selling them i can set buy orders at 7580 of module mineral costs and make isk reprocessing them and still have higher buy orders compared to mostyou got too many vectors for minerals right now drone regions reprocessing mining loot some mobs do carry refined minerals 
i dont remember anyone suggesting thatis that your new position
well you and others see everything though combat why do you care about the other play stylessimple fact the market will adapt to compensate markets like eves are dynamic not fixedthe result is lower prices right now increases in risksuicides drives out one play style but its the play style that in this game gives you those wonderful toys to use to shoot each otherisk sellers would love it they could make more money for less isk because there would be a lower number of minersindustrialist so prices would go up and the ship losses could be countered by switching to less efficient and cheaper ones since their product sells for more
im glad i brought pleasure to your life you wanted tangents since that is what your arguements are i gave you tangents they are as accurate as yours are  meaning pretty much crap  
thats an obviously false remark farrqua ashen has already made clear statements regarding thiseve has no nonpvp zone never has and never will ccp has stated this in no uncertain terms i know this ashen knows this pvpers know this the entire subscriber base knows this and you know thiswindjammer
yes i knowoh there was morehis observation is based on circular logic much like yours and anaalys or whatever the hell her name is he lists how miners balance risk vs reward but obviously doesnt realise that those points factor in for a suicide ganker too you know the ones who according to you guys are ubalanced when it comes to risk vs reward its so obvious a mistake that i am led to believe that he is either knowingly trying to twist his argument or that he is completely and utterly stupid later posts of his has proven that the second is true
and that just goes to show how little you understand mei would stongly urge you read over some of my past threads before you make me out to be some pvp meatheadi look for a balanced varied and interesting game that means embracing gameplay which i am not myself paricularly fond of and ensuring that it is balanced and integratedi have have pushed for many changes in eve which would have adverse effect on my own playstyle simply because i want what is best for eve not for me
ki ani agree with you on this god help me however id like to point out that the planned changes to make suicide ganking more meaningful will not in any way stop the suicide ganking of faction fitted ships wave billions of isk in front of a suicide gang and they are going to bite doesnt matter if they spend a week ratting their way back up in sec its worth it worth it in terms of the giggle factor and in terms of raw incomei wish more people would trip to the fact that marauders seem to be designed to alleviate this problem for mission runnerswindjammer
it was not a challenge or a false remark just that ques are wasted on some when they are too focused on banter
okay i see where youre coming from on this one i was thinking of billions in modules not millions those faction shield boosters can cost almost 2 billion for just the one module and thats what i was primarily thinking ofwindjammer
people who devolve their arguments into allegations largely revolving around terms such as stupid and dumb shouldnt really be using terminology beyond their grasp such as circular logic it shows off their level of intellect paraphrasing samuel clemens best not to open your mouth and remove all doubtwindjammer
why not putting a non lootable wreck for when you are not on war against the target you destroywreck only lootable by the owner
ah i see youre with ashen on the whole ill just quote someone smarter than me and maybe ill pass off as smart too deal the reason i continue to lable people stupid and dumb is because they make stupid and dumb arguments ashen as an example has continuously proven his lack of knowledge of game mechanics his inability to find the glaring gaps in his own logic and the lack of common sense enough to know when not to speak about something he doesnt know anything about he has also shown his ulterior motive as a recurring suicide victim what was it five times you on the other hand dont even comment on what was actually written instead you call me out on my labelling people even after i explained to you that said labelling is accuratemoderatedweatherman
let see on the victim part 5 attacks in about 25 yearsnet loss 3 mil whoopie do i make more than that in an hour2 attacks right after undocking no scan just passive targeter and attacks  1 was actually empty 1 attack using a warp to 0 on a covops and locking down the wrong target as my mack warps out again empty hauler 1 attack because my overview loaded too damn slow  which they screwed up and tried to gank a t2 tanked hauler thinking it was the t1 version ps nice reading comprehension skills when you cant count the fact it was 4 attacks 1 of which was mainly an attack on the mack and not the hauleri go by what search shows when i use it when there is no ccp post contradicting it i go by what is postedso where are the links supporting your view till i see them ill not waste more than a few moments to post if i even bother to reply to you
so why are you whining you didnt lose anything people you keep talking about really dont lose anything yet you keep dragging up losses like that as proof that suicide ganking needs a nerf boy you dun gone make yerself silly yet gainnah its just that i prefer not to keep track on how many times you fail 5 was a good enough guesswhere did you find a ccp post claiming that was how it worked could it be that you didnt really search at all could it be that you actually thought it was like that and are no too embarassed to admit it yeah gonna go with the easy answer on this onewhat kind of links do you want links to more people telling you the same thing links to sites where fussy cartoon animals claim suicide is murder what kind of linksthe links i asked of you multiple posts back and which you have as of yet failed to deliver support your claim that most people in this game are carebears like you that should be an easy link to provide you must have read it somewhere so you should be able to link it there is a difference between a reasonable request and a bogus one mine is reasonable yours is bogus
the only whine i see is from you about this is a pure pvp gameand everyone is hiding in empire and npc corporationsand immune to most pvpif it was a pure pvp game there would be no way for them to be anything but targetsyou want the info go look for population statistics compare the combat regions to the empire regionslook into the number of wardecs compared to the number of corporationslook at the numbers for factional warfare compared to the population numbersgo look at the numbers and come back and say that everyone is in for the pvp combat
quit putting words  or anything for that matter  in my mouth i have claimed that eve is predominantly a pvp game that is more or less a direct quote from a dev ccp wrangler hes community manager now and has posted in this thread you can look it uptranslation i cant provide a link because the statistics i based my argument on doesnt exist instead i fell back on the economy report like the good carebear i am and basically made up a bunch of stuff about what the numbers meantwhat does this hint to oh wise one  i dont really think youre wise i think youre an idiot i was merely pulling your leg again what would this mean please provide analysis for your worthless ideasagain with putting stuff  words  in my mouth i never said that it is evident by this very thread that a lot of people dont really enjoy pvp my point is was and shall continue to be that those people should not determine how ccp balances their game the people who dont want to pvp are in the minority i can make this claim because i can look at numbers and actually analyze what they mean unlike you
show me the numbers that show the minoritycome on mr links lets see themor is that an assumption on your part that contradicts the numbers ccp has come up with and shown to all because it doesnt suit you
but there isnt therefore by your own arguement eve is a pure pvp game
you cant shoot a trader in a stationand yet he can shake the very marketyou have industry again something they never need to undock to dothere are pure noncombat styles of playnot everyone is out shooting other players in combatquite a number never engage a target at all
no its simple reason lets start by analyzing econ dev blog 3in it there are numbers speaking of active characters within npc and pc corporations 195 000 characters are active in player corps and somewhat more in npc corps the high amount of npc corp members is interesting here so lets delve deeper into that the blog also makes comparisons about amount of skill points on average per character in the different kinds of corps interesting here is that the average amount of skillpoints for characters in npc corporations is around 27 million whereas characters in pc corporations have an average of around 135 million skillpoints there are two conclusions one might draw from this1 a large number of the characters in npc corps are new players with low amounts of skillpoints2 a large number of the characters in npc corps are unskilled altsthis shows quite clearly that the amount of players with their main character in an npc corporation after some time in the game is pretty low this lets you draw the conclusion that most people tend to gravitate towards the more unsafe player corpsalso supporting this notion is how the most flewn ship in npc corps is the kestrel a caldari frigate requiring little training this again hints to new players and alts in pc corps the most flewn ship is the raven a bird that requires a lot more traininglets move on to the quarterly economic newsletter 4th quarter 2007 which contains some interesting informationduring the last two weeks of quarter 4 of 2007 49 of all characters  not accounts or players  moved only through high sec space numbers you might have heard on the forums such as 80 and the like are wrong the real number is 49 that number is below 50 so we have already established that less than half of eves characters stay in high sec all the time now lets break that figure apart by using reasoning and the numbers we have learned so far we know that there are a high  of new players in the npc corps npc corps make up more than half of eves characters this means we will have a significant  of new players moving about and those tend to stay in high sec let us say that 5 out of the 49 staying in high sec are new players i think this is on the low end but still close enough now we have 44 to account forwe know from earlier reports that eve has around 220 000 payed accounts there are about 500 000 characters on those accounts this means that there are on average more than two characters made per account of these characters one character is designated as the main character the others are alts so we have established that there are a lot of alts in the game we know from common sense that the majority of players have an alt in an npc corp to check prices scout and the likes this means that a lot of the characters in npc corps and the 1man corporations are alts especially market alts dont generally leave the system they are supposed to monitor so a rough estimate is that out of the 44 remaining around 20 or 30 are alts this is also on the low side but it doesnt matter we are now left with 1424 of the total amount of characters in the game that are unaccounted for amongst these are the players who dont like pvp and keep to high secthats a minorityqed
i didnt say combat and neither did you  the term was pvpstop changing the parameters
yes you have 49 that stay only in empirenow did you consider mining operations into low sec  null sec many carebears will do so with the proper coverageyou also have an unknown in the number of players that do cargotravel runs through low sec space in order to reach point b from point a in order to save timenor does it account for those that hop into low sec simply to drop offpick up cargo for trade runs how do the skills break down not just ships flown many industrialist have done missions to build up corporate standing for less tax on station refinery services  i do them for just that reason did they look into combat ships alone or a break down of most common ship for that characterand you are making an assumption in your reasoning that all accounts include a combat main versus the possibility that some are industry oriented players with alts trained for industry or tradeyou use data that does not provide all the data neededthe only ones with the full data set are the developersand they are taking steps to change things that in some waysa  make high security space safer  adjusting the costrisk to reward of suicide attacks b  adjust the wardec system due to it be a griefer tool at the moment  to quote them so from the stance of the developers there is a good portion of noncombat oriented interest in the game
read the whole post and quote the whole postlast line is the key there
yes i have considered those they are by definition not carebears and not unaccustomed to danger thats what living in lowsec and 00 means unknown as in not factoring in on this debate arguing about those is useless but i think we can both agree that the percentage is not high enough to significantly alter my analysisagain that is not worth debating as we have no statistics for it spaceship command tops the list trade is at the bottom this has nothing to do with anything though all ships where taken into account you know this right you have seen the document right rightno i dont i am merely stating the facts that are there the reasoning i apply is all based on the numbers the point is that your claim that most players stay in high sec and dont like pvp is wrong the numbers you have so desperately clung to clearly show itthen do your own analysis of the data it is there for your perusal i stand by my analysis and i believe it to be close to accurateso now you change your tune from the data shows us carebears to be in the majority to the data released in not complete the secret data only the devs have access to shows carebears to be in the majority seriously dude how do you expect anyone to take you seriouslywhich is what we are arguing here i have shown numerous times that it is not necessary however i understand why ccp would do this if i had to read posts like yours every day i would do anything to stop it tooand this proves what exactly no that is just something out of your ass again look i have shown you the numbers you didnt want to show yourself i have broken it down for you it is over you lost the argument now you are just getting desperate and it is pretty patheticlay it off
i used the quote to illustrate what youre doing not to borrow the fame of mr clemensi did not call you out on your labeling of people i called you out on the exact terminology you used ie dumb and stupid honestly i keep expecting you to break out in lete speak at any moment i also called you out on your lack of knowledge with specific respect to the term circular logic you dont really have a firm grasp of ityour logic seems to lead you to conclude that anyone who has been suicide ganked has no valid argument against suicide ganking since they have been victims the same logic could be used to say you have no valid argument against the planned changes since you are a beneficiary of suicide ganking that is to say your logic is no such thing its just a long list of rationlized self serving statements which in many cases do not even have a passing familiarity with logicyour labeling is accurate because you say its accurate for your edification that is circular logic please make a note of itand here you are revealed in all your intellectual superiority holy cow you have to be right you can cuss and everything i meanhow could you be wrong if you know how to do thati have read a good many of your posts and i have to say that the majority of them leave me amazed how is it possible for you to beleive youre making sense lately however ive started skimming them its just not worth my time to bother to read them when youve been reduced to childish name callingwindjammer
stick to the topic you ing 
gosh youre goodwindjammer
getting mad yetperhaps you would like to strike me or we could just continue the debate ive just managed to prove that carebears are in the minority in eve using the very numbers you carebears have been toting as the greatest proof that you are in the majority so i guess youre screwed
miners are carebears having overwatch can mean hiring a merc corp but the ones doing the mining are not combatantsactually it being unknown on several points with no data means any statistical analysis is flawed and subject to be tweaked to suit the need of the person using ita good example is your refusal to consider the gaps in the data because you know there are traders and simply the curious that head to lownullone could argue the numbers just as easy with flawed data the alts are on traders and industrialists monitoring the markets so the majority have no combat alts hence why a far better examination is in orderbut go drink your milk and cookies maybe some day they will post the full dataand we both know they can look at the skills trained data on all the characters the traffic data has a variance due to mission runners  cargo combat and simply better agents taking mission runners into low sec miners headed into low sec traders headed into locations to drop offpick up cargos and transition systems between high sec locations the only whinge is yours because they change the game to make it harder for the combat oriented players to have combat in high sec it still leaves the option but will make the costs associated with it higherif they wanted it to be a mostly pvp combat oriented game things wouldnt be tweaked to make it harder to engage in grief style attacks  suicide attacks and the current wardec system 
two things come to mind one this proposal largely eliminates the need for death stars meaning that said death stars dont need to be fueled two fuel pellets i dont fuel poses so i cant say much more definitively but it seems like those two would reduce a lot of the burden
so many good ideas not sure which one is best but it does need to be looked ati like the idea of more types of reactions
i love this idea personally

scrap the cap warfare pilgrimintroduce the smartbombing pilgrimbonus to fittingcap use  range maybe even damage it will be like a non failboat bombing stealth bomber or hearken back to the days of no recalibration delays with smartbombs on battleships
i agree that having no range bonus the amount bonus is pretty much useless
umm the drake works great with hams
talking about the inability to fit command modules on drakenighthawk specifically
it is quite clear that speed is there intended design but irregardless of that without mobility over larger ships  bcs and bss  there is literally no point in flying a hac if a hac turns into a brick than any battlecruiser or battleship will be able to own it at a fully insurable price
yup just look at all those speed bonuses hacs ge oh wait
well its a light ship if you want a heavy tankingdps ship for that price you are better off with a battleship without speed hacs dont really have any role and will end up similar to the assault frigate
well sounded like you were specifically talking about hams but if you look at most  all  of the other battlecruisers you have to drop turrets to fit command modules too
so tell me jade just how much damage are your heavy missiles doing to that sac going 3kmsec keep in mind the sac has a repper so he can repair that severely reduced damage youre doing to him
id like you to quote to me the backstory that says the caldari favor long range due to the gasllente favoring short rangeim pretty sure those 1 man fighters the caldari used to shred federation battleships werent long range nor were the gallente railgun boats short range
avon those resistshp and larger sigmass are just there for show obviously howe couldnt we see that heavy assault ships are suppose to be flown like interceptors just like their frig counterparts right
yup how stupid i ami should have known they were light ships  having heavy in the name is a dead giveawaysilly me
the gallente railgun boats did not exist iirc  they used blastersif i get the time ill look it upi could be wrong but i am pretty certain that is how things stood
even if this absurd 1v1 was representative of the capabilities of the cerberus it tells us about precision heavies rather than the cerberus and we all know that precision heavies are broken and that the csm is raising it with ccpbut most importantly stop comparing the cerberus with the sacrilege they are completely different ships used in completely different roles the cerberus is not a nanoship  youre confusing it with the navy caracal and navy osprey  and it can do things that the sacrilege cant dream of
even if fixed the precision heavies will do reduced damage to a ship going 3kmsecoh and the cerb will also be going significantly slower due to the speed penalties allowing the sac to get closer much faster allowing the cerb to die soonera long time ago before nano setups became to win button of choice hacs would fit these things called tanks and thanks to being smaller and agile they were able to fight just fine against battleships sometimes even winning 1v1 thanks to their smaller size and base agilitydespite popular yet incorrect belief hacs are not speedbased ships anyone who thinks ccp intended for ships build for extra armor and firepower to become large interceptors is nothing short of insanepeople might have a hard time remembering this because back then youd pay 2x as much for a hac as you would a battleship
wont disagree that that nanos do play a hand in messing balance up
you are a bit off the mark let me tell you what happenedhacs got a 125 increase t1 bcs 5625this caused normal tanking of hacs to become pretty much obsoleteccp essentially killed the concept of tanking hacs that day so dont tell me hacs are meant to be slow and tankedthere is generally no tanked shortmid range hac you couldnt beat 1on1 with a tech 1 battlecruiser for half the price and fully insurablethe same problem exists for command ships if not for gang modules you can do everything they do with a bs only cheaper and better but at least they have the gang module nicheand beating a sensibly fit bs with a nonnano hac nowadays you must be jokingtaking away the ability to nano hacs will essentially make hacs into the real heavy analogon of assault ships meaning absolutely useless for pvpthats the balance problem you got there and thats why you see so many nano hacs nonnanoed ones just cant compete with comparable and cheaper t1 ships except for the niche of extreme rangespeople dont nano hacs cause its so fancy they do it because if you tank a hac its not competable eg a ham drake can have 100k ehp 190 passive shield recharge and 620 dps all at the same time using hms for range or javelins with the hams 500dps try that with a hac the best you can eg do with a cerberus is 400dps 47k hp and 100 shield recharge or 500dps 42k with hams have fun slugging it out with the drake and before you ask the sac would be 550dps and 50k hp no recharge with a much lower range compared to the cerb
you are failing to take in to account the relative resists of the ship classes
id like to see cerb boosted or at least sacrilege nerfed
meaningthe ham drake has 64727882 which is pretty well rounded and 100k effective hp the cerb if he plugs the em hole has 71888269 and 42k effective hp the drake can switch to em still do more damage and have three times the tank effective hp of the cerb vs em are 34keven a heavy missile drake still does 430 dps in emthe 125 vs 56 assume a much larger difference in resistances than the ships actually have 1 hp on the hac is worth 2 on the bc but thats not enough to balance the hp increaseshow me any tanked hac fitting that beats such a drake  preferably without going all officer or something but even that probably wouldnt help  everything else is just vague talk why should one tank a hac if it gets outperformed that much by a tech 1 bc signature radius doesnt play a large enough role if you are slow bc vs hac there is no difference at all an example torp raven where it should make the biggest difference does around 1050dps to the drake and 680 to the cerb still doesnt cut it with other bs the difference is minimal at bestthe drake is admittedly maybe overpowered and so not the best comparison but it doesnt look like its going to be nerfed soon with other bcs you generally get around 80k hp and 4xx dps still beating a hacmy point still being being able to speed tank is the niche of hacs outside that niche they are subpar the niche may be overused currently but taking it completely away will make hacs pretty much useless for clarity if people dont believe the drake stats the fit is 7x hms ii or hams ii 10mn ab i 2x invul iis lse ii large regolith i dm ii 3xbcu ii 3x core defence field extender i hams fit nicely with a 3 pg implant hms you probably need to go 2x regolith cause of cpu issues but then it fits without problems
not supported here  even as a relative n00b bout a month people on the rookie help channel will advise that a new player trains all their learning skills first and if people take this advise then i agree that the game would be very boring for those on a trial not being able to see themselves get better at anything other than learningimo skill training is not only about specialisation its also about balance true specialise in the type of ship you want to fly and the types of weapons you want to use but the learning skills should be balanced among theseone of the biggest things that attracted me to eve was the lack of grinding  im perfectly happy to offset that hugely monotonous task by committing a little of my time to learn and if theres a way i can learn faster fantastic and i dont even have to be here to do iti also believe that it separates those who just wanna blow stuff up from those of us who are willing to put in the time it takes and become a little more committed as already mentioned it creates diversity and diversity is goodanyway i ramble not supported

supported but shouldnt go overboard for example you know a mission is against that type of rats but you dont know exact freaking force composition for every pocket

the stats on these have to have been an oversight that is simply in dire need of being properly fixed
so you guys all think its okay that a titan can decloak fire a dd and recloak in less than 30 secondsno risk 100 rewardsaying smartbombs and drones are the counter doesnt cut it if the titan is 300km away from you when it recloaks all of your small ships capable of doing more than 1kms have had to leave field or been destroyed so youre left with your plated bs and your capital ships all of which do less than 300ms  and thats conservative  itd take at least 1000 seconds or 16 minutes to reach the area that the titan cloaked at in which time the titan can move itself awaycapitals and supercapitals should not have the ability to cloak i fly capitals myself and sometimes fit a cloak but that shouldnt be allowed ever its insanely imbalanced

i didnt vote for jade because i know what hes really like and i know that he like the rest of the csm really have no authority and if he really is disliked so much for being who he is he wont be elected again ever unless people forget what hes likethat said ccp should bar most of the current csm from ever running agin after seeing them during the nh discussion actually say they agreed not to bring up things like ship balance that right there should be grounds for immediate removal you dont get to say oh well we will ignore x and y you are there to voice our concerns and you ignored one with a lot of supportburn all of you that took that cowardly stance youre disgraces to the players that voted for you
signed not only because of those actions listed which i hadnt heard about as i dont really care about csm enough to read the stuff but because i dont like jade in general and think heshe is a carebear
i think the most amusing part of this jade still doesnt realize he and all other cmss are supposed to represent the players not themselves its turned into an arrogant chestpopping position that resembles the likes of a corrupt city council board theyll agree to push objectives in which they only agree with and not what the community sees turning eve into jade online and thinking he has the power to shut up the peoplesurprise jade youre just another one of us the difference is you get to speak for us but you dont you speak for yourself and your own selfish agenda you fail us you fail ccp and you fail at your job

yes please they all need more locking range imo
i can only sign this as the locking range on minmatar intys are way to low
arent minmitar interceptors also the fastest interceptors are already digusting some of these get up to speeds that mean you need to web them twice before you can hit them i fly a stealth bomber my missles hit at 120 km and i can only target to 70 without a signal booster should they increase my targetting range too
materials for war preparation as im sure many of you know is one of the storyline missions you can get what issue could possibly arise from one single mission a couple actually1  it seems to be at least five times as common as every other storyline put together ive gotten it at least six times in a row one corpmate has an ongoing streak of 11 corp agent and mission level do not seem to make a difference in its frequency2  its standings gains are pathetic i believe a level two kill storyline mission gives more faction standings than the level four version of materials for war preparation youd think with the war going on theyd value your efforts a little more3  it usually requires you to buy your minerals especially if youre caldari since the level three ore  omber  only spawns in highsec gravimetric sites and the level four ore  kernite  doesnt appear outside caldari lowsec the missions isk payout usually doesnt cover this cost so if it werent for the implant youd actually be losing money doing this missionplease do something to bring this mission in line with its peers
i would agree to an extent in terms of actually completing the mission this is exactly how i do it  ie buy the minerals then hand them in to be honest that does not bother me at all so i just buy it and complete the mission asapon the other it does not seem that the mission works to fill its purpose  my understanding is such that the mission was intended to induce more people into mining if that is right then this mission in no way induces me into mining but rather makes me to dislike mining very much i think ccp should put some thought into itsupported
only ever had 1 kill mission storyline over 2 accounts something other than buying mins at 2x market value would be a nice change p

itd be a fundamental change to the ship and as such youd change its slot layout to make it midheavy like the scimitar and oneiros instead of highheavy like the guardian itd take some work to make it function properly but it seems fully doablewe already have the antinos ship its the guardian and the basilisk  my proposal would also add the antidamp ship in the new oneiros the antipaint ship would seem to be the curse and pilgrim  tracking disruptors counter painters as well as anythingcaldari ships dont need cap for their primary weapon type as opposed to amarrian ships that eat cap like its going out of style it seems reasonable to make their cap transfers less good also they get more utility highs on battleships than the other races caldari get 4 amarr 1 gallente 1 and minmatar 2  which means they presumably have a bit more room for cap transfers on nonlogistics ships than the other races do thats not a big effect of course and normal cap transfers are nowhere near as good as guardianbasilisk cap transfers but it does compensate a little as for the doubling of sensor strength its effectively a free eccm fitted if you want to dock it a mid slot compared to the 67 it would otherwise get im not wholly opposed but its a bonus the ship needs if it wants to be an eccm boat and given how big of a nerfbat im swinging on a ship that doesnt need it i have no issue with giving it back a bonus or two along the way similarly the doubling of scan resolution is a couple free sensor boosters but its necessary for you to lock allies quickly and rsb them if the bonus is to have any meaning also i know you pointed the question at einstein but given that b is my proposal ill answer it as well yes i fly an oneiros  not particularly well since i just skilled into it recently but i do fly it
problem is you are spreading roles around across different ship platforms but in reality the situation might be from the fact that painters are the red headed step child of electronic warfare tracking disruptors only counter turrets and only in certain situations assigning tracking disruptors as anti paint would be prenerfed with these changes if you are trying to assign every race a protection versus an ewar and you follow the pattern of a race countering its own race until you hit the antipaint and you do it with a class of ship thats not even the one you are changing it will be a hard pill for some to swallowas for missiles being the caldari primary weapon i would argue that every tech one caldari hull has an equal amount of missile and hybrid ships except for frigates which are almost balanced by the destroyer you still end up with only one more missile hull if you want to count a heron as a missile hull its just more popular and easier to skill for missiles so i dont find the energy argument not compelling even amarr got balanced with khanid ships to a degree if pvp could make active tanks more viable then energy transfers might be more in vogue 67 you are being generous both the basilisk and onerios have 5 slots i thought you want to put in a a built in module in a ship for the cost of that slot why not just put the eccm in the mid slot then right then and take it out when you need it and you have no bonus you can take away without it loosing effectiveness unless you take out the drone bonus and you cant take out the drone bonus think of the poor drones they can not be neglected further i see you are trying to be reasonable but it sounds like the thought came to your mind personally i believe you would have better luck if you kept thinking or just use them as is granted the projected eccm is unbonused rangewise so you have to deal with the range problems its not impossible to do on multiples of ships or even logistics the basilisk is one of the logistics that can stay in close especially if you have two but basilisk pilots and logistic pilots in general are more rare than other ship types as a note i am a scimitar pilot
no i dont really fly any logistics ship although i have all the skills for a basilisk i just dont see the point of flying them in pvp i can see them in complexes or repairing pos structures and shields just not in pvpi think there is a major flaw in all logistics ship  they are designed for small gang warfare and at present time tanking doesnt matter very much there considering that another damage dealer or recon would be much more usefull instead of a ship that can only heal a couple of allies requires much attention to fly and doesnt like being primarythe logistics role instead is taken by rr battleships which are very usefull imo thats how it should have been  heavy tanking healers  bc hull may be  with bonuses to cap and shieldarmor transfer and agile electronic defence ships providing sensor resolutionstreangthtracking boosting with both types being capable damage dealers they do after all have increased skill requirementsgiving a second thought rearranging bonuses on existing logistics imo is somewhat like galvanizing a dead horse logistics ships need much love in general perspective
i do fly logistics flew them on the tourney as well i think projected stuff are quite okay they are better than boostyourself modules and you are right that you need to use them in pairs at least to be effective but logistic ships are all about teamwork anyways furthermore any ship can do the remote boosting it doesnt need to be a logistic ship
actually i forgot the two ships that directly counter target painters already  the claymore and the ragnarok both minmatar though obviously neither is a logistics ship problem is that siglowering modules dont exist except the one warfare link so its hard to put together a direct counter to their racial ewar tracking links make the best module for the scimitar were going to get technically youre right but in terms of what actually gets flown the caldari might as well never have heard of railguns and its not that the caldari dont use cap at all its that theyre a lot less needy than the amarr and a lot less capacitorfocused as a result they dont have the curse pilgrim sentinel or avatar im fine with them not having the guardian either im not sure im being that generous when i say 67 mids its 652 as it stands and moving the presumed 2 cap transfers to projected eccms means making 2 highs into 2 mids it needs sensor strength to do its new job effectively though so imo it should just straightup get it as for what bonuses itd get 150 shield transport and remote eccm range and 20 drone shield transport effectiveness per level of caldari cruiser and 15 shield transport cap use and 10 remote eccm effectiveness per level of logistics seems natural similarly the oneiros just replaces the words tracking link with remote sensor booster no need to nerf the drone bonus
i prefer to leave logistic ships as they are now and make electronic support ships a whole new role of its own new t1 hulls new t2 ships both in frigate and cruiser sizes make the counterewar racially separated as the ewar is currently and not all in one ships for greater diversity this would also give room to boost currently subpar ewar methods like the sensor dampener for example as effective counters will then exist
we all know caod is the biggest pile of  on any forum anywhere but its like a car crash no matter how bad it is you just have to look i know there is a no n00b corpshow your corpalliance rule so you can post but id like to suggest thisonly the highest skill point char on an account can post in caod also following the other rules as well this surely would end a lot of the s posts made on there
sorry cant support caod is like the scum filter in the pool shut it down and the scum spreads out
i think if such priority proxies existed that would mean that ccp is capable to do some kind of real time resource allocation this would be great tbh would solve all our problems with fleet lag etc but they cant solve these problems this suggests that they are unable to affect server performance when the lag has already hit in therefore there cant be priority proxies and stuff like that i think they would be very happy if they were able to do something like that but their earlier dev blogs about the network architecture of eve suggest that such things can not really exist i might be wrong of course i wasnt there did not check it i just think that while the t20 problem was really something that could happen and happened this priority thing is just some madeup urban legend
may i ask why an afk cloak supporter its just within the confines of the complex that im talking about here not in the whole system youre not one those s who try to keep these plexes from the rest of eveare you
sorry i didnt see your reply when you made it i agree with you it probably should be 100 random i say 50 of the time to allow the people that conquered the space that they have to still have that space as a valuable asset worth fighting over especially now with the drone regions out mining isnt as lucrative as it once was so the regions with good belts not so attractive now good low trusec systems npc space and areas that are guaranteed to spawn a plex within six or seven systems are valuable assets whether you agree or disagree with this argument the fact remains that even a change to a 50 spawn rate in these constellations would represent a significant decrease in farming and an increase in the amount of regular explorers that could find and profit from this particular plex 100 random would be better but having seen how ccp thinks  and has programmed in the past  about pve im not sure that would be a target worth shooting for

ah lovely insults someone holds a different opinion and automatically its time to toss epithets aroundjohn maynard keynes once said to a detractor who accused him of changing his position on something why yes i did say we shouldnt do that anymore whereas before i said i thought we should when i find out im wrong about something i change my mind what do you dowhat devs said in the past does not affect the present necessarily eve changes all the time and there is quite a lot of support for the salvage system changingmaybe it will happen maybe it wont but if it does i guess youll need to find another line of work or fit some guns on your salvage ship
youre right it could change that would be quite the day when after so many mission runners come to the forums and complain that ninja gankers are now ruining their missions by entering getting shot and returning to blow them upill be sure to direct them to my thread and show them who to blame for it those who make the decision to give salvage aggro might be able to handle the backlash but nobody can guarantee that everybody can
i joined a corp and have been having a great time in low security space if some new players dont enjoy the game because they havent any patience then their leaving is no big loss i manage to compete not very well but getting blown up is halfok so a quarter maybeof the fun one of the best things about eve is that you can go anywhere youve got the blls to go and the other guys got the right to kill you if you doif a new player wants to play against others on a level playing field then he can go to the test serverorhe can join a corp and learn in a group with mentors orhe can have patience
alright i understand where your coming from and i dont really have any arguments against that as that is your opinion about it but i must say i just dont see it that way
if going for only one single type gtc is the most beneficial for ccp in one way or the other then they should have gone for the 30 day type onlyobviously that would satisfy the needs of all players  just buy more gtcs if you want to charge the account for more than 30 days at the time

this issue will be submitted to ccp

yes 
very good idea its a most wanted feature  for me 
i am a programmer hear me roari independently came to the same conclusion as mashie salanda and believe that 24 hours plus one more skill or even 12 hours plus one more skill is the perfect solution to this dilemmaso therefore what we really need is a queue of skills limited to 12 or 24 hours in length plus one more skill the queue should allow for anywhere from 6 to 20 total skills to train the limit for the number of skills should be something sufficient to train several small skills throughout the limited time period the queue should not be disabled when a subscription is endedthis gives you the following benefitsat any time regardless of what skills are available to train it is possible to set a queue length of at least 24 hoursthe system cannot be abused to powertrain unsubscribed characters the only advantage this would give unsubscribed players is an additional 24 hours of skill training and no moreessentially the system described here answers all concerns and solves the problem simultaneously

personally id like to see a switch to allow 2 jumps every 48 hours rather than a marginal reduction in the 24 hour cyclereducing the 24 hour thing slightly just leads to the same problem as 618 hour skills most people play at certain times of the day and waiting anything over 6 hours is effectively the same as 24 hours
or some variation to reduce jump clone timer also something to allow redocking clones on clone vat bays and being able to remotely destroying clones off clone vat bays i feel sorry for those who have a clone on a mom pilots mothership that barely logs in to allow them to use the clone

so were making an arbitrary limit that anyone in a corp must be rich and have high corp standings with someone what a good idea well in which case lets get rid of lowsec and highsec make it all 00 and let the big alliances run everything after all its the big wide world funny people might just object to thatbeats a post of fail from a jarhead with no brain or ability to debatefunny half the people defending the system as is are saying well ive never had any trouble because im rich and good at pvp and cant manage to see beyond their nose that others starting out do have trouble its no small wonder that people dont enjoy socialising in a game when so many are antisocial

yup more of that sort of thing how can i belittle them if i know nothing about them
would be great aye
i dont roleplay in eve but i do enjoy reading the background material id like to see this as well
i do roleplay in eve and i would like to see this  
yep agreed ill bring it to the agenda for meeting 8  the one after this one 
in general more actual knowledge about the background of eve will be a benefit to the rp communityexamplewhy are the achura even part of the caldari state in terms of background it is a basic piece of information that is important to how achura play their characters and everyone is guessing at why

i agree on everything you said but you forget that there are ice mining mission as well  they are not too bad but still averagely about fun as well that youtube video insert the local rat and that it 
i dont even know why there are mining missionsminers mine in belts they dont do missionsmission runners dont minewhy are there missions for minersim not supporting this because i suggest outright removing them they do not make sense and are only an annoyance for mission runners
they only make no sense because you are thinking in artifical categories of playersi am a mineri mine in beltsi mine in missionsi do missionsi do mining missionsi do not fit in any of your pathetic little categories and i dont have tomining missions make perfect sensethey are given out by mining  and astrosurveying  agentsthey are intended to cater exactly to minersthey allow miners to gather lps and standing without having to do combat missions or stay with the silly boring and low yield courier missions  i bet you want those removed too the only thing not making sense with mining missions is your logicstop posting
i cant decide if this was an attempt at trolling or criticism my sarcasm meter must be broken today so i present my criticism of your semiconfusing postwhile i am not saying all miner are the same you do seem to assume they are hint veldnought while there are group of school thoughts granted however not all of us want to mine in belt i am not saying we should left belt gasp untouched except there are reason to not mine belt due to piratemarketwardecetcas for removing mining mission may i ask have you ever tried paid a miner to do them this way you dont have to deal with mining skillship etc btw i think all kill mission should be removed from eve online just because they are annoyance for a miner sarcasm end although we do not have mining storyline yet as it would require at least an overhaul of the current agentstoryline systemseriously although i stop doing kill mission level 4 btw as they were bit of hassle to deal with at least for me with the time i have available to eve online afkdominx is not an optionmining mission are bottom line constant income just like actually mining ores except you get standinglp where as with mining you do not get themheh i agree with you abrazzar but i already wrote this so i might as well post them anyway
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesi meant combat missions i didnt even know there is such thing as a mining mission agent just that there were a chance for agents to give you a terrible mission
ive noticed both as well
very nice idea
it amazes me ashen that even when you are confronted with the numbers  which you obviously hadnt seen despite using them to prove your point  you still refuse to accept that you are wrong no miners are not carebears by definition carebear in this case means someone who has no like for pvp just because someone mines does not mean they dont like pvp i mine i love pvp so your assumption is already proved wronglisten to yourself you have been using this data in your own arguments to prove the point that those that dont like pvp are in the majority in eve now when you actually get to read what the data says you backtrack all over the place trying to dismiss the data as flawed and inaccuratei have considered all the gaps that are essential to my analasys i cannot consider data which i dont have for all i know such data doesnt exist if it does it has not been presented to the players with the data we have it is obvious that you where wrong that is all that matters here yes most probably the alts are not combat alts that is completely beside the point howeverthen ing perform one yourself you toted this data as proof of your argument i proved you where wrong using the data you obviously have never even read the datamy godyes and they have do you want me to post a complete list of the trained groups of skills ok1 spaceship command2 gunnery3 missile launcher operations4 drones5 learning6 engineering7 electronics8 navigation9 science10 industrythose are the 10 most trained groups the others are too small to read out accurately and weigh against each other what the hell did you want this for anywayno nononono for s sake you cannot read that into the data its simply not there based on the data we know that more than half of eves population regularly venture out of high sec that is all that is important here it proves that most people in eve arent people who dislike pvp it doesnt mean more than half of the population engages in pvp either it just shows that more than half of the population are actively going into high risk areas and as such accept pvp as a factorcontinued
no you are refusing to accept what the data shows because it doesnt show what you want it to show by definition that makes you deluded you are also whining about it making you a whinerthey ing arent eve is a predominantly pvp game are you going to argue that too are you going to make me link you to the ing quote from ccp wrangler that clearly states that it is i am getting so fed up with you right now you spend hours arguing and claiming that the evidence proves your point when you are shown that it doesnt you start spewing nonsense and claiming the data is inaccurate ing get a grip man
why are you even arguing this ashen the data shows u were wrong kian might be an ass about it but hes right
so where does it show pvp combat is the main focusthose skills show a predominant focus in ships skills at the top followed by the support and industry skillsgunnery and missile skills are trained on mission runners which dont always mean combat pvpnothing shows the mains as combat pvp oriented eitheryou claim the data to be ambiguous when used against you and then scream its hard facts when others poke holes in it when you use iti have an industrial character yet i have more skill points in spaceship command than anywhere i even have a huge amount in the gunnery and missile skills but for missions and not pvp combat  though i have the skills trained to be useful there and i do know the fastest way to get the skills for a transport character is the various soldier starting paths which means high weapon skillsso all those noncombat hauler alts are in thereand i know the quote and i know they didnt say it was combat oriented pvp that they were focused on
the data is statistics which can be manipulated as needed most times to show what you wantespecially when as he admits he is not even cosnidering the gaps in it because it wouldnt help his argumentplus im bored
you know i know i said you where stupid before now i dont even need to say it im done hereyou were wrong i was right the empirical ccp endorsed data clearly show itgood night
at least he went to the effort to present some facts tbh
then why did u use it to back up ur arguments before u cant just use something to back up ur arguments and then say its wrong when someone proves u wrong with the same data if u r bored u shouldnt post here just to post u r just makind the debate more hard to get into i think that u really should think about accepting that u were wrong here and just move on
everyone in the game is involved in pvp im asking for stats that show a bias towards player to player combatinstead you throw up statistics that have been used to show the opposite and then claim they show your viewand i point out the flaws and you scream and pout and outright admit they lack information that does apply but refuse to consider because it might hurt your argument
my frickin god
i rather think you are the one who is a bit hot under the collar as far as striking you phuuleeze unlike you i havent even been reduced to cursingthe only thing youve proven is how silly your arguments can be youve quoted selections from the 4th quarter 2007 economic report  demograhics section pages 4 through 5  added in some numbers youve pulled out of the air  made up on your own  and come to an erroneous conclusion im sure it looks very impressive to you but its complete rubbish what was that you said about quoting people smarter than yourself to make yourself look smarter oops my mistake you were talking about ashen and myself hmmm look up the word hypocrisywhere people get the 80 statistic is probably from the last two sentences in the summary of demographics for that report which state most pilots arelocated in high security areas or about 70  80 at any giventime this number seems to be rather constant between q3 and q4of 2007 and it will be interesting to see if that changes in 2008 huh what do you suppose theyre doing in high secyour allegation that if a person is in low sec to 00 theyre not carebears regardless of their activity iswords fail mewindjammerps im almost certain all the above has nothing to do with this threads topic
u r just being immature about it now ashen
actually he posted assumptions and opinions based on statisticsmy facts are they are making the changes to cut down on grief style pvp combat opened up faction warfare as an outlet for combat in high sec that makes pvp combat a choice  even offering npc corps to join but as we can see they dont have the numbers of the regular npc corporations 
i made a critical analysis of the data the results are in my post the argument i was trying to disprove was that the majority of the population dont like pvp i think i managed to do that quite welli dunno logging offcarebear in this particular argument was defined as person who dislikes pvp i made the assumption that if you go to a high risk area you dont dislike pvp you might not want to actively engage in it but you are not trying to shield yourself from it either in the context of the argument it makes perfect sensenor has anything you have written for the last million posts or so i dunno how many it is really i like to make up numbers right
nope told him that till he shows something other than a whinge over changes to the game im not wasting much time with himand all i see his him admitting to using flawed data sets and saying that data that would provedisprove his bias is irrelevant  which shows a fear of it being a disproving bit of data 
yes but u said most people in eve dont like pvp what kian did was to prove u wrong he did u just cant accept it u r obviously a bit immature
they are not flawed they are the data sets that you have been using to prove your arguments you just cant accept you have been proven wrong i suppose it must hurt to be wrong as often as you are
key is combat oriented pvp which the changes affectthe numbers in the statistics include mission runners hauler alts etc that never engage another player in combatthe changes affect player vs player combat that is the key noncombat pvp is not being affected
so where does it show most players engage in player vs player combat and shoot at each other
what r u talking about u said that most people in eve dont likee to pvp u where wrong
it doesnt it doesnt have to what it most clearly does not show is that most people in eve dont like pvp like you claimed it didrofl you are so dense its almost not funny anymore almost
u shouldnt go around saying people r dumb either its rude he was wrong dont be an ass about it
tsk tsk my statement has always been they dont like the player to player combatkey word you want to drop combatso yes it has to show itbecause all your whinging is about changes to combat between players
nope my stance has always been ship to ship pvp combat is not the focus of most of eves player basethere is no action that is not player vs player conflict
nothe argument you put forth was that most of eves population does not like pvp combat or not doesnt matter but lets say you said combat pvp just for the hell of itthe data shows that more than half of eves population regularly move about in high risk areas meaning they willingly accept the risk of pvp they dont shelter themselves in high sec like you claimedthe data shows that of those that remain in high sec a large proportion are new players and alts not hard core carebears who dont like pvp like you claimedthis will be my last response to you talking to you is like having a conversation with a brick wall actually i think a brick wall would offer more intelligent observations than you do good night little angel i hope you dont drown in your own droolmozetta i am so ing tired of arguing with this guy i feel no sympathy for your no insults crap sorry
yeah so u meant combat pvp kian still showed you were wrong
ok but its not fun reading swear words and insults on these forums they should be for discussion
your analysis of the data is flawed you polluted the numbers you quoted from the report with assumption speculation and additional numbers you manufactured on the spot that technique is not usually lauded as critical analysisall this to prove something that is inherently and intuitively obvious a lot of people in eve like to shoot at other people for one reason or the other at least some of the time thats a lot of work you did to try and prove something that didnt require proof and in the process further damage your credibility well donewindjammer
using just raw data without any conjecture or reasonable assumption the data still shows that less than half of eves characters only reside in high sec that was all that was needed to win the argumenti wish you would tell that ashen idiot that my argument was with him not youedit also my credibility was never in question by anyone but ashen and maybe you to be honest i really dont give a crap what you think of me i think youre both idiots id expect the same courtesy
actually no he showed people would leave empire but 49 stay in empirehis assumption is that none of those leaving empire did so for reasons other than to shoot at each other
no u r twisting what he said what he said was that if 51 of the characters willingly enter risky areas that means they are not antipvp it is pretty easy to understand it is also easy to understand that of the people who dont enter risky areas a lot of them are alts and newbs again u where wrong just accept it be the bigger man
it means they take the risk for profit or for combat is not knowni have a few trade routes that take me into or through low sec and several others do as well we accept a higher risk for a shorter time or greater profit
sorry mozetta but thats just a bit off the economic report was tracking movement of characters which it assumed were main characters check this quote out the characters that are not accessed or do not move between systems are most likely alternate characters for subscribers we therefore assume that these jumps show us the movement of main characters on each subscription account and are therefore representative for the movement of the main population in eve 4th paragraph of page 4  and 49 of all pilots moved only within high security areas  highsec  1st paragraph of page 5 that means that the 49 theyre talking about who never leave high sec are assumed by the report to be main characters like ive said before ki ans analysis is flawed it contains erroneous interpretations and some of the numbers he just made up the conclusion of such an analysis has almost no hope of being accurate in any waywindjammerps heres the url of the report if you want to check it out for yourself
dont trust any statistics you havent manipulated yourself i guess suffice to say that i move through lowsec plenty currently live in 00 yet do not want the pvp threat to be too prevalent in highsec because i realize a lot of people play a game not for kicks or to vent frustrations but to relax and that is exactly why i myself go back to highseccing from time to time because that is the best way to play if you simply want to relax so your great statistic would count me on the wrong side and i am fairly certain that a lot of other characters play in a similar manner and not counting 00 miners into the carebear crowd gotta be the greatest joke ever i find most 00 miners to be way worse carebears than your average cnr highsec missionrunner
ive read most of this thread and still this response is the best

ashen ever hear of the phrase what you dont do wont hurt you this applies here if the nerf to insurance goes through you will see people quit the game while if it is left alone you will see the subscription trend continue  up  instead of finding ways of nerfing a valid way of playing how about you focus on increasing options for the victim that makes the game more interesting and perhaps more fun tradable killrights is such one idea it allows you to pass off a kill right to someone  persumably you can sell this kill right for isk lessening the isk blow of losing a ship  which increases the pvp options in the game another option is to add a new type of contract called a defense contract a defense contract is this a player can set in the contract how long it is and the payout assuming the contract issuer does not die in addition to a penalty if the contract issuer dies to hostile player action  not npcsconcordself destruct  this would be adding a mechanic to the game that allows a carebear to pay a pvper for active protection where the pvper could end up paying for your loss if he fails another idea would be to introduce modules that would actually transfer a  of your shields to the target ship instead of healing the target ship sheilds for x amount so you lose shield as the target ship gains shield obviously this module would increase the targets shield much faster than current shield transferers but would stop working once you are out of shields yourself it would also be expensive on the capacitor more so than current shield transferers this would be one step on making it possible for players to escort ships through highsec by allowing them to begin to counter the dps of the attacking ships instead of focusing on making one professions life harder find ideas that introduce new ones and new ways to play the game this type of thinking is what expands a game and moves it forward a nerfing mindset only makes people angry one group at a time till you are left with only like minded individuals and declining subscription numbers im not saying in some cases a nerf isnt valid but in this case a nerf is definatly not needed
1  the insurance change is not going to equal the profit potential it dents it replacing a 130mil ship out of the loot spread from a scanned ships still makes it profitable it makes them work for the return  in time cost and risk those that do it for kicks wills till do it for kicks those operating to hurt logistics will still do  the equation there is your loss  target loss then it is a good hit its a raise in the cost of doing businessthing is right now more and more are not bothering to do anything but click target and attack suicide attacks will still be viable just not as profitable unless you pick targetsall those are also options that ccp has decided to look into because they determined the balance was out of whackand kinda hard to argue which causes more loss users an imbalance in favor of people that can target and destroy ships as they undock without bothering to scan for cargo because they have minimal losses compared to the target or making them plan and scan to get the juicy targets
ok i read it nowhere does it claim that the carebears are in the majority it doesnt claim that their in the minority either i guess that both sides of the argument can stop using that report as back up for their arguments as it doesnt really support any of the arguments in this thread kian did an analysis which you think is wrong i dont really agree with the entire analysis either but i think he has a point when he sais it cant be used to show carebears are in the majority like ashen said
debatable the three top ships are caldari missile boats and quite common for mission runners and only the raven being considered by most to be a pvp combat ship  the frigate and cruiser can be used for it though most seem to sneer at missiles caldari also has the largest player populationtill they can break down the mission runners from the combat players there will be a question therebut more telling was the fact mining and industrial ships were also in the the top numbers versus other racial combat ships finishing out the top slotsthe snapshots also showed most operated predominantly in high sec space  with a portion entering low sec  the safe areas of eve  with consideration for travel through low sec 
sigh is this still going on
yes but it was a snapshot it was not a complete summary of the most flewn ships it really doesnt say that most people in the game dont like pvp ashen it just doesnt i think its time to drop this line of reasoning now because that document dont support either argument i think it would be much better to dicuss how we can improve the game because that is waht this discussion should be about if ccp nerfs suicide ganking they do it because they think it will be best for the game but i would hate for this game to turn into a pve based game because there are so much better pve based games out there eve should be pvp based its the only way it can compete turn it into pve based and it will die i am a miner who dont do pvp but i love the fact that people can fly up and gank me at any time it keeps me on my toes
probably one of the reasons why the study found that at any given time around 80 of eve players are in high secwindjammer
characters not playersnow who is twisting
i like a lot of what you have to say here in general i oppose nerfing for the for the very reasons youve outlined im also a fan of tradable kill rights and im a big fan of making positive changes instead of nerfing however the assertion is that suicide ganking is too easy under current conditions and the most reasonable balance is to make the planned changes the suicider can commit the crime and recover from it too easily in terms of economy and sec status this in effect makes high security status of the high sec solar systems a jokeno place in eve should be safe but no place in eve should be so unsafe as to make the mechanics of protection a joke thats the bottom line for the planned changes which will affect suicide gankingwhile you may find some people quitting because of the changes youll also see people stay because of the changes lets face it that happens with any change in the game the question is how many people the changes will not eliminate suicide ganking what the changes are intended to do is cut down on frivolous ganking andor suicide ganking done for the sole purpose of griefing suicide ganking of billion isk haulersfreightors mission running ships fitted with 1 or 2 billion isk shield boosters etc the frequency of those suicide ganks will not be touched that means not too many people are going to be leaving certainly the the subscription trend wont be affected now if you were to do something like force people out of npc corps against their willwellyoud see a big change in the subscription numbersregardswindjammer
i agreewindjammer
since the report assumed the characters were the main characters of each account whats the difference between saying theyre characters and saying theyre players im not trying to twist anythingwindjammer
oh how so i am fairly sure that no suicider would quit the game those who do it as side business  the main target of the nerf  will find other means to cause grief just like they did before suiciding became to popular those who do it professionally can still do it professionally even if the profit margins are more limited nowand if you are referring to n00bs making mistakes the proposal is to only remove insurance if you appear on a killmail related to your concordokken so mistakes in missions or hotrunning modules in highsec would still pay out insurance  unless the n00b actually kills his buddy which is fairly unlikely and if it happens he really had it coming anyway 
lulz  all the suicide ganks getting emo rage about ccp taking away thier you isk is now my isk at no cost to me button and talking about quiting the gameps  can i have your stuff

agreed pilgrim needs a boostimho give it another powergrid bonus to make fitting a mwd an option without gimping the tank or 1 lowslot 1 midthe ship itself doesnt need tampering with its boni just a little more love with fitting  i have recon 5 
but not any of the op fixes
this  and pilgrims never used to fit mwds they arent essential on this ship just like they arent on a falconmore fittingmore capbetter cap rechargeanother low or midslot would be sweet edit failed at supporting
had finally found a ship i likedonly to see it borked to hell and back
i support increasing the usefulness of the pilgrimmaybe instead of it getting a nos amount bonus it could get a bonus on the relative cap amounts percentages so that it can suck cap even when it has more cap than the target ship shrugs
perhaps slow down hac some boost their hpwill not argue that tech 2 cruisers got shafted in the hp boost big time
agree id like to see cerb boosted
more importantly towards what lucai said even if hacs where aligned up hp wise the reason to fly the ship is mobility note that the immobile hacs are very unpopular and not just because they cant speed tank the cerb is still slow but its enough faster than a drake that it is worth getting
i still disagreein a nutshell you are saying that slower ships are tougher  which is generally true  and therefore because hacs are a bit weaker than a battlecruiser they should make up for it by being insanely fast rather than just a bit faster which they areyour arguement is illogicala t1 cruiser is no match for a t1 battlecruiser but a t2 cruiser should beat it is that you arguementshould a t2 frigate also be able to kill a t1 battlecruiser or a battleship or a carrieri really dont understand exactly the basis for your arguement you are comparing t1 apples to t2 oranges
you are missing the point by farwhat you say is a t1 bc should beat a t2 cruiser so all a t2 cruiser is for is to a  kill t1 cruisers and b  die to t1 bcs and bssyou may think this is logical but why should anyone fly uninsurable 80m t2 cruisers thenits not comparing apples and oranges because t1 and t2 are both normal substitutable options for players t2 alone doesnt do anything what should make them oranges if you want medium sized tankdps your options are cruisers hacs and bcs and people of course compare them and do decide between theseits exactly the problem of the assault frigs it may appear to be logical but it kills the ship class for pvp you would have a pretty much useless shiny toy and gameplay would gain nothing from hacs ccp could as well remove themt2 ships are there from a gameplay perspective to provide variety and not the same thing as t1 but with a niftier model a weak bc that is a little bit faster provides nothing
im not missing your point i just dont agreet2 ships should be better than their t1 counterparts of perform a role that their t1 versions can not  i do not think that a t2 ship should pwn any other t1 ship just because it is more expensiveship progression should be by hull type with t2 versions balanced within thati understand your arguement exactly i just think it is flawed
sac was part of the amarr boost cerb is a good ship op just wants to use it differently
tldrcerberus needs a fix whatever the suggestion is and dont nerf the sac
cerberus isnt really a good ship load javelin hams and a sacrilege is just as good as what the cerberus is supposed to be better at that gives the sac about 85km of range about the same speed as the cerberus when you take velocity reduction into account and all of the other advantages of the sac over the cerberus  which are plentiful i am not asking for the cerberus to be a close range powerhouse by any means though i think a ham setup should be much more viable than it is now point of this thread is the cerberus has some really crappy bonuses  flight timekinetic dmg bonus only  and huge fitting issues while on the other hand the sacrilege seems to have about 200 cpu to spare on just about every setup i try and enough grid to fit a kitchen sink a pony and everything else thats needed you honestly have to try pretty hard to make a sacrilege fitting that doesnt fit the ship just has a lot of breathing roomto make things more clear just look at it this waysacrilege has 50 less cpu and 500 more grid than the cerberus with engineering level 5 most sacrilege setups barely break 300 cpu and are fairly cushy on grid fitting a cerberus is so very much much harder why
we agree to disagree then your opinion seems to be that hacs being a bit better than the corresponding t1 hulls would be fine and they then need no special roles as this is what recons hics and so are for while hacs should simply provide a bit more tank and dpsmy opinion is that just being a little better than its corresponding t1 hull does not suffice as a role for hacs cause you will then have the assault ship situation where you have one class being pretty much useless everyone knows assault ships need a change because the just a bit more tank and damage does not work for pvp as you can just use the next bigger class of hulls instead making them uselesslogically seen you may be right heavy assault ships  cruisers with a bit more tank and damage but then they will be more or less useless for pvphaving a ship class that is logical but not used is in my opinion a total waste thats where my arguing comes from and as nearly everyone agrees that assault ships need a change and some role taking one current hac role away and putting them on one level with assault ships without providing alternatives is a tad counterproductivebasically its not comparing apples and oranges cause t1 bcs are a valid substitute for tanked hacs and outperform them generallybut thats not the point of this thread there are probably enough nano threads around so ill stop here
most of my sac fits normally use 400 cpu and fully utilize the powergrid  and the cerberus is as easy to fit as a sacrilege as long as you dont fit hamsthe sacrilege is essentially a onetrick ship and that is close range dps to even get into midrange at all you need to train ham v which is not really of any use for any other ships still then its only midrange no chance to use it long rangethe cerberus is more flexible you can operate at extreme ranges  200km  or you can operate in midrange with high dpsat long range there is no other hac that can rival it and at midrange its definetely servicable and on parwhat you rightly complain about i think is the viability to use it close range in tackling range but you can use it close up you just dont rival dedicated short range ships  which you shouldnt as you have a lot more choices the question is does the cerb need to be competetive there and if yes where should it lose proficiency insteadyou mention the useless flight time bonus there are lots of people using the cerb just for that bonus being immune to damage and ewar while lobbing missiles some would prefer to have a double missile speed bonus i guess but a double range bonus is what many people use the cerberus forjust that it doesnt seem to suit your playstyle does not mean its uselessif you want a short range potentially solo missile boat train for the sacrilege  the cerberus is long range meant for long range and used and appreciated for being long rangeand the problem with the cerb and hams is that with that range boni your ham range is far beyond what you normally get with hams because of that it seems logical that hams are hard to fit as you dont get the normal drawback being range for using themps the kinetic only damage bonus on caldari ships is a general caldari thing btw so its not like one would or should change it on the cerb only so thats a different issue
cerberus needs more fitting to be more competitive i dont fancy the comparison to sac though sac is a closerange boat and should be better at that game
cerberus is not as easy to fit not at all dual lse med nos mwd even a possible med rep  hams all fit on a sac even with just heavy launchers the cerberus has a much tougher time the 6th high slot on the cerberus is basically unusableif you are going to fight at 200km load up on sensor boosters and sling heavy missiles you might as well be in a raven i dont think 200km fighting is what the cerberus was designed for its just a raven that dies faster sweetid gladly give up 50km of heavy missile range for more useful midrange abilitiesan uninsurable raven with less hp and dps sign me upkinetic only is a caldari wide stupid bonus and should be changed cerberus should be at least acceptable with hams the sac is basically an overpowered ship if you ask me so i wont ask ccp to make it as good as the sac considering then the cerberus would be overpowered as welli would find double velocity better than flight time at least then it would be more viable at long range even if its just a watered down raven something tells me you fly sacs 
me laughs heartilyyeah i doi like fighting at close rangesthats why i trained for sacrileges why dont you do that   i was caldari specced before going for the curse  good old times  and then the sacrilege jokes aside the cerberus has 2 range boni so its natural to assume its not supposed to be a close range ganking boatwhat you essentially want is to change the cerberus to fit your playstyle instead of changing your playstyle to fit the ship or training for a ship that fits your playstylebut i do admit the cerb could maybe use some finetuning for midrange usage ie regarding its speed
not supportedbut on that same train of thought why not go the other way part onesome of the reasons we dont have new toons starting with more then 800k sps are the fact that accounts can have alts which can be started at any time and give players an advantage many ppl see the skill paths to get cyno alts trade alts manufacturing alts scout alts research alts and so on make accounts have mains and secondary toons secondary toons start with the 800k we have now and nothing changes mains start with the learnings to 43 and the 800k only one account can have a mainthis should stop some of ccps concerns with ppl starting new accounts just to get quick and dirty advantages it would also allow new players to get into it right away but still leave off that 4th level of advanced learning for them to decide if they want or notpart twoinstead of getting rid of learnings after this first part why not expand them add another set of learnings into the mix where everyone would be able to reduce the training times a bit further this would allow everyone to train a bit faster and in the story line sort of way the governments and corps would probably want to be able to produce deadlier pilots faster anyway so wed have basic learnings advanced learnings and maybe complicated learnings add to that advanced learning skill and genius learning skill  upgraded versions of the learning skill  this would allow some newer players to quickly get into the skills needed for the better items the vets already are in them so they could maybe cross train or find other ways to enjoy the new skillspart threenew players or newbiesn00bs are indeed stuck behind a wall and a hard spot in a way they have to learn the game and try to catchup to the rest of us that have in some instances been around since beta how is this possible why not introduce a new player corp implant set this set would only be available in the starter corp the first set would come after the completion of maybe a multistep story line mission series that could explain alot about eve that is hard to make players learn currently this would work like a halo set upon a new players learnings so the set would give maybe 3 or 4 to each stat but the entire set would give a 15 to 25 bonus to the entire set as well as the cumulative stats of the player so a player with say 17 will and the 3 in would have 20 willpower the set would give 25 bonus making that a 25 but only as long as they stay in the starter corpit could get more complicated with learning advanced and complicated learnings of course but it would give players a quick way to catch up not harm the vets bring in new players yet still force them to learn patience and the game thus fps morons as one player put it would be put off anyway part fourthis one would be more case by case basis but maybe general category skill reducing skills like say electronics learn each level would reduce all skill training times in the electronics tab by 5 to 1 this would let some people try to specialize further or make up for a bad choice in their character creation it is an investment skill to be sure but might let some of the younger players catch upendim one of those weirdos who maxed out the learnings knowing they were going to take 3 years to pay off eve is a game of patience and planning im not sure taking out learnings would keep eve in the niche it fills new mmo players go to wow mediumcasual mmo players go to conan freaky mmo player go to hello kitty adventure island and experienced mmo players gravitate to evehope this helped tried to take the stance of keeping it fair for the most ppl possible compared to the suggestions ive seen so far
i have mixed feelings about this in the end i do not support this at all it is a choice to train those not a requirement like everyone says they are
if you wish to do away with learning skills why not do away with attribute implants as well after all they give a training time advantage to players who have the isk to buy them or the time to spare running missions for the lps to obtain them the current learning skills do not really affect the length of time players take to get into cruisers from frigs ect as some make out it depends upon how wisely a player trains his character a new player can get to level 3 missions and running them successfully solo in about a week and still train thier learning skills
agree i hated spending the few weeks to train up my learning skills as i wasnt really advancing at all people mention the ability to specialize your character more but 90 of players will just train to 44 or 54 across the board anyways  with the possible exception of charisma  i am in big support of a reevaluation of learning skills with my preferred solution being a removal of the skills with a sp reimbursement
super capitals already have massive disadvantages and if youre sitting near a lone titan with a gang and you cant get it your doing something wrong you it dds and then recloaks but there is definitely still ways to get it especially since they are huge and not that hard to missa titan cloaked would do what 4msyeah i believe cloaks should be nerfed but to say said ship class shouldnt have them at all is just flat out ridiculous its like a care bear saying how pvp should be done because you probably dont own one and realize how much of a pain in the ass they actually are already  so much has been done to super capitals in the past few patchs  expansion packs that well have made them near useless already why would someone pay 14 bil for a ship that has a small ammount more hanger space  cant be webbed or jammed and 5 more fighters 
minmatar interceptors isnt even close to being the fastestand on your stealthbomber you have the mids to spare to get better locking range while the claw only have 2 mids
its called sensor boostersignal amplifier
claw has 2 midslots where exactly does the disruptor go with mwdsbsig amp raises lock range to approx 255km barely useful for a 24km disruptor
faction crysatls have a fraction of damgae even if you never shoot them so you cannot cotnract it can contracting or rmote repackage of amarr ships with crystaks be fxed pls
this mission is an abomination
needs to be turned into a mining mission  one of them not marketable ores 
if the mission isnt worth it you could refuse it i do agree that this mission could use a review or we need more storyline missions so this mission comes up less often
problem is this mission is a storyline not a regular mission if you refuse it you lose standing  its not like a regular mission where you get the onetime in 4 hours refusal option and faction standing is a bugger to get up if you lose it in chunksusually with these i look out for the relevant roids in the regular missions  eg the 2 part against the slavers level 3 has 8 50k unit omber roids  and mine them then just store the ore at the storyline station when i get this travesty of a storyline mission i just either shuttle or pod it over complete the mission and fly backthere are definitely more interesting and involving missions that could be done requiring you to actually mine something at the time agree with the above quoted post that we need more storylines though  there only seem to be like half a dozen at each level
this mission is boring and crap either it needs a serious update or a simple removal

3 jade
many thanks to you jade your willingness to be tenacious regarding this issue is very very much appreciated ive put a lot of work into this thread the first time it was shot down i was honestly shocked  and appalled  to see the csm make a 180 is great newshowever i would like to point something out that worries me the text of the meeting essentially shows several csms saying that they finally messed with the ship in eft and now understand the issue why in the freaking hell did those same csms not bother to take 2 minutes out to familiarize themselves with the nighthawk in eft last time its amazing to see csms vote no on an issue that very well might not have gotten another chance only to find out that they simply didnt do a little homework the first time around granted im very thankful for their willingness to do so this time however its discouraging to see some csms so unwilling to do a little work after myself and others busted our humps for months on this threadhopefully theyve learned their lesson i personally pay very close attention to these issues and will be voting for those in the csm that are willing to do a bit of homework to avoid ignorantly voting on issues that others consider importanti wonder if dianecesmila prestocand his other alts will come check this very important thread this time around again many thanks to you jade im glad i voted for you and will be doing so again
i totally agree
iUFFFDm in for it totaly agree
yes this sounds so useful we definitely need it
this issue was discussed and recieved enough support to end up on the to ccp pile
thank you for the fun idea compliment i have not taken the time to create a tech tree for this type of project but i think that the coolest way to implement this would be along the story lines of well the most dangerous industries are very regulated on core worlds and pilots are not trusted with them but things like cattle ranching could be done where ever the planet resources would support the work maybe ice or gas worlds are probably not so hot for cattle ranching but volcanic worlds may be good for uranium mining or robotic parts factories and raising exotic dancers on any of the above worlds would be impossible i would imagine that this would incorporate physical limitations of world some degree of npc regulation that effects positioning some industries and a degree of space available per world  based on npc populations land mass suitability and resources available  i think that the easiest set up method would be bpos for the industry components mining equipment vs fence pickets and bpo price varies based on the complexity of the components etc then the system is geared to make the pilot 10 return per unit vs what the npc market is buying for then another 1020 risk premium that is effected by pilot skills associated with those aspects of corporate management i do not think that the npc supplies or demands should go away actually an increase to the npc fuel demands that empire can not maintain then station demands reach a critical mass pilots can choose to supply the empire mega corporations this would encourage pilot participation economically via reward while not totally upsetting the current pos networks that many have spent years building lots to think about
i like this idea needs lots of discussion but could solve the pos fuel problemsplus add some interesting new options to work with
people have a right to play this game anyway they want fw is a great addition to eve  if they want to organize let them fkff  stop criticizing
all be it i have only really been into exploration pretty heavy for last 68 months in eve one thing that i kinda feel though is that people those involved in exploration and its related activities are kinda treated as red headed stepchildren with a stutter that no one really wants to embrace cept when we put plex mods on the contract system maybenow there was all that talk awhile back in the dev blogs talking about changes to exploration added content blah blah that well im not holding my breath to see i have enough diversity in my eve path not to be too upset about it i do however feel that solo players are really getting the short end of the stick in eve and most likely will continueand yes i know blah blah blah eve is supposed to be a group circle jerk or whatever for some players proper group work just isnt a possibility my schedule varies too much to really roll with a proper corpbut i also dont play solo all the time exploration is one of the kinda true solo activities i can do at a given time as well as mining but man can not exist on roids alone and trade and manufacturing same thing exploration offers some decent content possibilities if properly thought out lack of any real options in ship choice for a solo playeralts not being counted is kinda lame not everyone is willing to throw down on multiple accounts and i soon may be another when one of my secondary accounts expiresyou have to admit that exploration as a career path really has probably the least amount of choice in ship choice and this is really rather lucrative career path if done properly just kinda suprises me not ranting im used to the things in eve i dont like but work around but in all honesty there could be some things done to make exploration betterif nothing else work towards perhaps some mod changes and make the virtue set a bit more applicable or at least accessable from other agents than soe than maybe other ships could be more suited for all around exploration usejust my 2 isk worth
thisand if you really want to spend billions on a hg slaves then train amarrgallente caps  srsly this is not an issue shield tanks are fine  almost too good actually
csm meeting 7 chatlog is viewable here1 the crane needs a powergrid increase  escalation approved 2 nighthawk is terrible  needs a powergrid increase  escalation approved 3 improved wardec support functionality in fw  escalation denied4 rigged ships into cargo  please allow this  escalation approved 5 dynamic agent qualities  escalation approved 6 fw impact on eve storyline  escalation approved 7 local chat as intel tool  escalation denied 8 unnerf the bio lengh  escalation approved 9 gallente ewar ships need a boost  escalation approved
let me get this straightdynamic agents fw storyline and the especially bio length is considered by youthe csmto be of the utmost importanceand yet the stupidity of local as an intel tool is not worthy too hot a potato for you guys not even a hint of improved scanner functionality perhaps leading to a replacement intel tool for the lazy pilots that cant be asked to learn how to use the scanner aside from giving gallente recons the love they deserveor at least escalating  whatever the hell that means allow me to present you a golf clap for ignoring real items of interest for those who actually play eve as opposed to yapping about itexactly how much longer do eve pilots have to put up with you and the majority of your fellow csm reps catering to your own individual agendas and preferencesits times like this where i seriously contemplate paying for my game via iskforgtc as opposed to my current sub via cc at least i wouldnt be subsidizing stupid free trips to iceland on my friggin dime editby all means continue to ignore threads like
how about you go read the actual chatlog and see who voted which way on those issues before accusing people of being a waste of space for the record i consider the local chat removal to be a very important issue and i was very disappointed that the csm chose to vote it down today end of the day though i have one vote from 9 and im not going to get my way on every issuei suggest you discover which csms voted against and send them evemails ingame  or call them out on the forums or whatever  and suggest they change their minds
hey bone calm down we are hardly 3 months into csm and every meeting has been pretty packed so far i had actually planned to take up the pilgrim for ccp to revise just like the council voted for ccp to take a look on the bonus for the arazulachesis but rl health made me incapable of actually getting the job done for friday which was the deadlineso the issue will be brought up but for now just waitin regards to the local changes you of course know why this issue wasnt supported for escalation because you read the chatlogs rightthe vote would have passed with a few changes to the submission document so you can be pretty sure it will be brought up againbut how do you make the assumption that because it was voted for by the council something is much more important than something else mind you we have not yet made a priority list based on these new things yet and the local chat as an intel tool issue was no escalated because of the submission template needing tweakingoh and next time please please stop all those strawmen argument it could easily be seen as a troll
the pheonix is fine  citadel torps are notfix the wepon not the ship
its a brilliant idea while ccp is devoting resources to station interiors and things that dont affect our space ships they should have been implementing this idea its awesome
after pounding eft fits for an ungodly amount of time the naglfar has two main problems1  dps needs to be more affected by damage mods there are various ways for doing this but the initial design of the naglfar seems to be it can do many things split weapon systems horrendous training times aside offer us a unique way to do this we can 3x  2x damage mod our separate weapon systems something no other race can do however when we do this our total dps should more accurately reflect the sacrifice if we completely failfit our tank in order to dpsfit  the mutual exclusivities as they stand now  then we should be rewarded with more than thirdplace dps  especially considering the revelation and moros both field much better tanks while doing superior dps 2  cpu fit is too tight its understandable to have tight fittings on a minmatar ship really weve gotten used to it however when were sacrificing whole slots and requiring faction mods in order to fitfordps that tight is too tight if were going to have to use damage mods  as i support above  then give us the natural cpu for bcuiis and a moderate shield tank  as opposed to the current abject failure  honestly the dread is so situationspecific its not as if wed gain access to overpowered fittings if we had more cpu as i recall they dont exactly make any bigger modules than capitalsized tldrsplit weapon systems are a  but also awesome were one of the few races with the ability to use a full rack of lowslot damage mods  for both projectiles and torpedoes  go with that and rebalance riskreward for a gankfitted naglfar to something sane remember we have 2x the training of other characters
ive been thinking about this for some time since i wanted to revamp my overview settings but was deterred by all of the nonrelated settings id lose by completely throwing out my dat filesfirst they need to get all of the users overview settings and window positioning data pulled out of the current dat files and store them in plain ascii files with sensible names this would allow for easy backup of the files as well as easy tweaking for power userssecondly they need to add the ability for the user to import and apply the settings from the ascii files on the fly preferably being able to switch among them with keybindingsthese changes would1  allow the user to have the freedom to make changes to their overview settings and window positioning with the ability to painlessly revert the changes if they are not satisfied2  allow the user to have multiple overview settingstab configurations yes tabs are nice but even with what i have available sometimes id like a different arrangement without opening and mucking around with overview settings3  allow the user to have multiple window arrangements for various purposes i know you can drag windows around and move them but still id like to be able to have several different arrangements saved that i can switch through instead of having to constantly drag windows about
please god yes
i absolutely hate having to reset my overview settings in signed
fixing overview settings is pretty damn annoying my pc crashed with eve running the other day and i lost all my settings

in practical terms letting a single skill escalate all the way to level 5 is a similar  though longer  approach but in that way you get around 1 or 2 weeks i believe that may be too muchbut what you say makes a lot of sense and it would make my life a lot easier  specially if the queue is set to 24hs 
from a coding standpoint building a means to add skill until the total training time is over a given timeframe 12 or 24 hours the problem comes in the form of the large player base and the database space this may take upthe lightest solution from a database standpoint is to automatically start training the next level in the completed skill  1  2   5  actually there wouldnt be any extra data stored since everything is already thereno matter what type of automatic skill switching scheme is decided upon a new method  in code or stored procedure  would actually have to be called to make the switch this code could actually be controlled by a new bit in a  or the  configuration table controlling if skills are switched when the account is expiredif a progressive  automatic  skill queue is implemented the skill switching would have to stop but not if its limited to a short timeframein all honesty i dont care what implentation is taken just that there is an implementation  even if its an api based evemon type external app but thats very dangerous to think about security wise 
never understood the crying about having no skill queue ive trained a couple of characters now and had no problem at all i could see a problem if once you started training a skill you couldnt change till it finished but theres nothing stopping you from looking at your skills and seeing that amarr cruiser iv will finish while youre at work so quickly log in and train another skill in the mean time and switch back when you get homeheck pretty much every other mmo you have to be logged in and killing stuff to earn xp in order to increase your skills eve takes away that hassle and still people cry about it
you dont see a problem because you are being selfish and cant see beyond your own experiencethere are many people that wouldnt even dare to install the game at their work or simply they dont have the right to do so i try to do my work at the office and i dont need to be pending over a game or to put it differently i dont play games at work i do my work at work i play games when i have time to do itand also i have many responsibilities in my life i have a small kid and i dont like to be forced to look over a game call me casual gamer but i pay for this game as anybody else if ccp can do something to improve my gaming experience i will welcome it
i still dont understand complaints about the skill system its already the best system available to casual players  like me i never had problem to switch skill except maybe 45 times where i forgot to switch to a long skill so i lost maybe 1 or 2 days of training and what  did it change my gaming experience  no and it was my fault i forgot to switch to the right skill si i blame myself not ccpi like the skill system we have i like to think about how to plan my skills i dont want to queue my skills
nice for youa lot of people dont think that way though
supported
this is on my todolist for raising for next weeks meeting i will let you guys know once i submit the issue to the csm for the rest to read
over a year ago a large set of new hardwirings were implemented once of these were an invention implantsadly this never worked ccp removed it from the game talking about wanting to change them to give a time bonus on invention instead of a chance bonusa post about this is hereso this thread is for supporting the idea that ccp should get busy and give us this implant which we were given but then taken away again the time bonus implant sounds awesome so why dont give us it
some implants still exist being plugged inheres the official statements so far20070802 01200028082007 15140020070927 09550020080102 141600 it would be time for an update thank you
yes may be even a rof one
of cousre while this would bw good there are still implants  like the invention implants  that are in game over a yer and still broken if you are going to put drone implants ingame make them work
tbh for me its not about the time of the card but it actually is the price right now i pay appr 234 for one month by credit and 336 for a 60d gtc this game is absolutely unaffordable unless i find a friend in the us to pay via credit as that is the only affordable way to play now as 2 30d gtcs were cheaper than 1 60d in fact one 90d was cheaper than 1 60d1 euro  1561  96you do the fn math 60d gtc should cost at most as much as 2 30d ones used to cost and then some less as its buying bulkand in gtc trade for isk the outcome should be a 60d gtc should cost 300 isk overpricedthe eve novel cost me about as much as one month of the game itself
my account will expire on the 24 probably i will pay one more month and after that i will freeze my account and i will wait i will wait for eve to become a real premium product i dont like to pay a premium price for a substandard product and with premium i mean1 no lag for large fleet battle now with over 100 players in one system the game is lagy like hell and this is not premium this is substandard product2 no bugs a premium product should be free of bugs from this point of view wow is a premium product bu not eve in 4 month while i had played wow until i get bored i did not see a single bug in eve also 4 months i have seen some horrific bugs from npc that did not take any damages to ui bugs that still are there eve has left me with a bitter taste so far3 no big bugs and the big bugs are when the client is crashing or memory leaks and i got a lot of client crashing and some times the client leaks like a broken pipeso they incresed the price with promises that some time in the near feature eve will be better bu i dont want i will not pay for a non existing product when they will make eve a true premium product then i will continue eve until the i have better things to do than paying to test a substandard product
signalsocan i have your stuff
mandatory thumbs up
ah yes the old problemsome want war for fun in the gamesome want peace for fun in the gamemaking both happy is mutually exclusiveso those who want to play cooperative and konstructive will never be happy about those that play destructive yes the paytogrief is bad i dont like it all that much myself but this is eve there is no such thing as no reason in a computer game  i like to blow things up is plenty of reason to play a game where you can blow things up i wouldnt like to get decced and have the results of collecting and missionrunning and trading and searching of years blown up by some wahahaha booom kind of guy depending on how bad it would hit me i might even quit for a while gso mercs for hire would only benefit the rich corps furtherone possible solution 08  10 sec  no war concord just says no not even your enemy you can come and talk be diplomatic but shooting each other will not be accepted in these areas for the sake of security of all bystanders
this is not the problem all ppl in this forum are arguing the wrong problem the true and only problem with the war dec is that all eve online empire wars are guerrila warfare even if a noob corp hire mercenaries and pay them very well they cannot patrol 247 meanwhile griefers can strike whenerver they want and often they have carebear altsthe war dec system have to allow to noobs or anyway to the defender to put an end to the war by force how destroying enemy headquarter and force them to stay in npc corp for 2 or 3 month this way war declaration will be done only for real needs not for funagain all other methods will bring to nothing
as the ceo of an empire 00 pvpgriefer corporation i would like to say that i fully support some of the ideas in this thread and would like to address othersfirst conditions of victoryall the ideas that have been presented would be insanely difficult to implement and as i read this i thought of several ways to loopholeexploit every single one of themexcept one sadly the only idea which made any sense was the command center proposal anything that forces or gives incentive for people to undock and fight is good for evenext topic what should the penalties be for losing a warwell to be frank it has to hurt such ideas as having your corp disbanded and not allowing members to join other corps for 2 months is a little harsh and would surely cause a drop in playerbasemy solution make a command center cost a ton of isk and take about two weeks to anchor corps get only one command center  which when in system with fleet could give some sweet bonuses p  when that command center goes down after reinforced of course the war ends and that corp cannot declare war again until they have a new command center if a group of players were to have alt corps set up to hop into just to make another wardec they would be shelling out tons of isk for keeping command centers up for all thier alt corpsof course this goes full circle as well stop players from dropping roles and corp hopping everytime they get decced some restrictions need to be imposed there or some monetary penaltiesand on the subject of mercs simply allow a merc corp  or the defending corp  to pay concord and the merc corp may enter the war legally under the flag of the defending corporation of course in doing so the defending corporation will have just created a multicorp war situation and the attacking corp could bring in some friends as wellif theres one way to bring people in eve together this is itnow the corps who live on wars have consequences and the carebears can actually fight back
maybe up the costs or something but there is nothing wrong with pay to grief this is eve also a more centralized mercenary system would be nice for the mercs but i hope you mean the mercs have to bid on it and the seller pays not that the seller can just get rid of a dec really easily whenever they want
well the seller should have a say in who gets the job not just a bidding war that can be exploited rather easilyoh and another thing whats wrong with our current merc system
if this ship does come along it should be accompanied by a ban of some sort on people using cargo containers inside industrials that add up to more cargo space in total than the ship is designed to accommodate i do it myself  i have eight containers in an iteron v greatly increasing the amount i can carry  but it always strikes me as ridiculous this is eve not doctor who a ship between a hauler and a freighter would eliminate the need to do it id have thought
actually there are some thoughts i had about this whole thing and it comes down tono faction items can be crafted in nonfactionfacilities  aka high secthis would mean source of faction  highsec source of officer  low er sec and cause some interaction between these sources of itemsno t2 bposnone ever delete all t2 items could be something created by using a highly researched t1 bpo and expertise in crafting not some luckbased system but something that just makes the character producing it the most important factor and the bpos quality a crucial factor  to the amount of waste  on a t2 production
risk is irrelevantill say it again  there is no reason to go into lowsec even in the smaller highsec market hubs there is enough volume to support a living the problem in lowsec is not the risk at all  capital logistics have pretty much obsoleted any need for a lowsec market you have your highsec hubs and your 00 hubs thats how our eveworld has evolvedhighvolume producers build in highsec their stuff gets filltered down to 00 and lowsec see people are more efficient at moving their stuff where they need it than producers are at trying to figure out where stuff is needed it is more beneficial to producers to bring their products to where there already exists volume you can go and build your ravens in lowsec and sell one every 4 days and i will continue to build mine in highsec at my market hub and sell 5 a day
there are three things that need to happen1  stocks need to be able to be traded securely from corp to player and player to player like items are currently tradedthis will allow people to sell and buy stocks at market prices that are determined by how people value the corporation and its stock2 corps need the ability to distribute dividendscorps should not have to distribute dividends it should be optional buyers of stock of corps that dont distribute dividends would be buying stock based in speculated increase in price and control of the company distributing dividends would help make a corporations stock look more interesting to investors these dividends should be automatic but not be guaranteed guaranting dividends takes the risk out of the stock and would raise stock prices artificially the corp should have the option to be able to set a dividend price per share at a beginning a period also with the option not to have a dividend payment for that period this way the corp can control its dividend payment period and make sure it has enough isk to cover the dividend per shares again this factor would help buyers determine what price they would like to pay on the market at the end of the period the money would be taken from the corp wallet and distributed among the shareholders if the corp does not have enough money in the corp wallet to cover it dividend the corp wallet should be emptied and zeroed3 players need to be able to see dividend and stock price history of the corporationthis will help players determine which stock to buy at what price based on the reliability of the company in the past the history will show when corps dont meet their dividends dividend per share price and frequency of dividends even if this is done offline or out of game this would be fine research companies stock history offline and buy it in game most people do this for their ships outfitting etc already anyways so thats not that big of a dealif you guys are worried about corruptful ceos have an insurance system where corps can have the option to have there dividends guaranteed by having them backed by a npc corps this would allow newer corporations to help gain reliability and trust from their investors one could take into account the corps standing with the npc and concord to determine how much of the dividends the npc would be willing to guarentee for a price this would prompt a new stat to keep track of also  of dividend guaranteed to the investor even if company wasnt able to pay upfor examplecorp abc has1 mil shares100 isk per share dividend declared at beginning of period 100 mil in isk paid to investors corp has good standing with npc corp and has paid npc corp x amount to insure 20 mil in dividends at end of period corp only has 85 million in walletcorp wallet ends up with 5 million first it will take from the corp wallet  85 milllion  and if there isnt enough the corp gets all the insurance from the npc  20 million  so the investors get their isk but the corp takes a hit in standing with the npc corp the magnitude of the hit should be based on the size of guarantee the blame should also be shared throughout the corporation slightly decreasing every player in the corps standing with that corporation this would discourage corps from missing their dividend numbers and encourage corp members to work together to achieve this also if the corp looses enough standing it shouldnt be able to get the same guarantee or a guarantee at all until the corp regains its standing with that corporationlike i said though this will just artificially raises the price of stock through a fake sense of securitythere will always be people trying to rip you off thats part of the risk of investing and like real life one doesnt have to have stock to be successful in eve so if you dont like the risk just dont invest
you barbarians and your ambitions of hunting space whales well let me tell you if space whales become a reality im going to form a obsidianpeace pirate alliance to protect the whales  and gank all spacewhale hunters  in the name of protecting the only intelligent life in the eve universe

i misread the first part of that as space hamsters with enormous balls
well they do ever had a male hamster who hasnt seen a female in his 2 year existence

this would be a welcome addition to eve
do want
just reinforcing many points and suggestions here but still heres my 02 poss right now as objectives is a powergaming element in itself i think when caps were rare that was fine but these days its too simple and annoying of an aspect territory needs to have an infrastructure to succeed logistics services etc to compare eve territory to rl colonization you can set up tiered sov as suggested require specific structures such as depotswarehouses in each system small civilian service facilities and listening posts or intersystem communication relays for example you have system af with3 supply depots3 insystem fueling stations1 comm relayx number of poss that require the depots relays and stations in order to run the small structures can be raided and destroyed making them juicy targets for raiders as long as they exist operation of the pos goes on this removes the chore out of pos fueling which really is pointless and just annoying the stations can require service costs which would replace the fueling isk sink if a structure is attacked the comm post would send an alert which would make it so not all systems would require constant powergaming patrols however is an enemy recon finds the comm posts and its attacked destroyed first no alert is sent as the structures are attackeddestroyed then the pos is affected it gets weaker and if the stations and depots are destroyed it would be forced to go into reinforced mode defenses would suffer to a point that smaller bs gangs could take on the pos muich easier these outlying systens would feed more defended core systems that would be much stronger and have a better infrastructure this allows gangs to make quick raids force alliances to actually patrol occasionally pos warfare and superblobbing to go away pos chores lightened and purpose to actually claiming space
while some of you may not like this i would also like to see this kind of prime fiction introduced not for roleplayers but for everybody i am a very casual roleplayer as in roleplaying for me is a simple way to stave off occasional boredom when this kind of foundation pf is introduced it needs to be introduced in a manner that is valuable for roleplayers and nonroleplayers alike it should be very concise not packed with all kind of taleweaver vaguery and other such bulltell us whats up in depth but without a ton of leave you guessing nonsense
signedthe jinmei dont even have the luxary of a player group writing stories for them to my knowledge  the chinese influence from the descriptions is fairly blatent but thats it and how about the mannar theyve been part of the pf since the begining yet theres nothing from them
yus
as i said earlier your post was semiconfusing ok i agree some of the agent are kind of mess up storyline agent are the most messed up as we have no mining storyline agent atm however let agree that miningkill mission doesnt mix very well like oil and water yes
it would be nice to know whats going on
long overdue
definately something that i would use alot the amount of times i have come up with really good ideas for mates and sent them off then realised i cant remember them and they deleted the mails is almost rediculous
supported because a  its a great idea and b  tzarrim  nuff said
bump from the depths
no supportto touch on most of your pointsposs dont need to be easier to setup use of large numbers of poss shouldnt be encouraged any more than it is by game mechanics they shouldnt be easier to setup or run yes i have spent a lot of time running them myselfjump freighters being useless thats just stupid if you find them to not be worth the cost you are doing it wrong mine has been worth every last isk i spent on it and is used on a very regular basis three times the capacity of a rorqual with the ability to move through empire with twice the hitpoints of a normal freighter with a jump drive added on top if you cant work out how to make this worth the isk well thats down purely to inexperience and lack of imagination cloakingdefending itself well the idea is  believe it or not  it isnt a combat ship you escort it perhaps with carriers  or even by scouting  and prevent it from getting into combat jump freighters if anything need their cost increased way too much bang for the buck right nowcarriers do too much for their cost as it is already they shouldnt have any more hauling or combat capabilities and dont try shouting inexperience i have three carriers and use them very often and have done for a long time cant find a use for them well thats your inexperience talking they are still perfect for moving small volumes of high value material still very useful in a large number of combat situations  dreads are only particularly useful at towersupercap shooting  and dont take pos repping as being something small it isntsuicide ganking i can agree with changing that one
nice summary of the whole threadnow maybe you should actually try reading itill clue you in on the general themei personally do not like playstylex and therefore i think it should be made harder i do not think it is fair that someone should be able to interact with me without my explicit consent i want to play eve in a bubble and anyone who tries to burst it must be punished my style of play is correct because it is in line with some moral code which i am unable to step outside of in a game where it really does not applyi wonder how the thread would go if it was asking ccp to stop insurance payouts for people who declare war because it is unfair on the victimor stopping insurance on self destructed shipor at gates in lowsecor in 00insurance should not be based on what some players think fair or unfair because in all honesty it is a stupid enough mechanic already it should apply to all players equallyif suicide ganking is an issue tackle it  although id be interested to see how many ships are killed per day with the attackers subsequently being killed by concord  tackle the heart of it dont slap a stupid kneejerk bandage on it and hope for the bestthe problem is people dont want to face up to the underlying problems because that may mean things that they think favorable to their playstyle being ajusted too and that would never dothey arent after fairness and balance they want vengenceif only theyd take that spirit and do something with it rather than crying for ccp to do it for them
first of all sorry for the pyramid quote i couldnt resist i as a character of marginal integrity must argue this point i personally consider pvp eves strongest drawing point i have only attempted a suicide gank once however i have done my fair share of lowsec killings also i can testify that it does take a ridiculous amount of time to raise secstatus think about it 4 hours of hardcore 00 ratting  often in hostile space  to account for one kill think about that for a second now compare it to your carebearesque ways imagine after every lvl 4 mission or jetcan filled you had to go and bash your head against a wall for 30 minutes i have now filed my case for consideration though i am sure many others have said the exact same thing in the innumerable  well not really  pages that come before the one my specific post is on well every decibel produced by a thousand people in a croud makes you deaf
to repeat its high risk insurance and before you ask the question again with the vagueness that makes it no yes or no answer  a soldier police officer or anyone commits a criminal act  determined by the courts with legal jurisdiction over them  and is killed then it is not paid to the beneficiaries
so all i have to do is claim i am a soldier interdicting covert enemy supply lines in a blackops mission and then the insurance will pay out because i was killed by a hostile police force whilst on active dutyseems fairat the same time we can stick anyone who self destructs a ship in to eprison for a few years because fraud is badyeahor we can accept that insurance in eve is a game mechanic buffer open to everyone equally because it is far simpler and fairer than making judgement calls on each claimbut then i guess you d be happy for that to happen so long as it was you making the calls
the ones making the calls are the developersthey are the ones that see it as a brake on the fact suicide ganks are far more profitable than the riskscost balance allows for
avon try not to blow a fuse like i did when replying to his idiocy after much soulsearching ive come to the conclusion that he really isnt trolling and that he really doesnt understand what were talking about
first post in threadposted  20080710 141300last post in threadposted  20080721 165200 that is over 11 days and only 33 supports putting this thread at 3 supports per day it will be years before this thread will meet the 25 of voters minimum threshold at this rate and ashen angel nearly half the posts in this thread are yours do you really think rehashing the same idea over and over again is a good idea and will help you gain support for your cause obviously it isnt workingalso you have such bad tunnel vision you completely ignored my last post only to reply on specifics about isk insurance instead of taking the other ideas into consideration instead of using your brain which you hopefully have to find an acceptable solution to most parties you are pushing an issue only acceptable to a small minority of people and ignoring all other ideas instead you continue page after page rehashing the same arguement to make sure those ideas get buried in the middle of the thread where no one will read them besides the ones that have been keeping up with your blurf
trading kill rights are one of the options already listed as being looked intothe module wouldnt help very much with many suicide attacks  since they are aimed at the lone ships or unsupported instead they pop the logistics ships since their tank is being ported away by expensive modules the last is a basic merc contract with terms on payment neither of the last two affect the costrisk of shooting empty haulers without even bothering to scan to see if there is cargo  an empty hauler with certain named cargo expanders is worth it depending on the ships used 
if this happens to be honest ill be taking my entire corp over to the forge so we can suicide gank the crap out of everything to join the guristas
the cost risk of shooting empty haulers is you lose the cost of your modules ship insurance only covers ships mineral value not markup not modules the empty hauler pilot if insured should get an insurance payout too thus suicide ganking empty ships is a nonfactor if suicide ships are too cheap its because ships in general are too cheap the modules i proposed would help in the case you described in both cases they are diverting dps and allowing the target to live longer all the escorting fleet has to do is make sure the target lives until concord can arive and jam and kill everything a module that sacrifices shield to repair shield can be balanced that it can repair a very high amount for a very short period of time while in empire this time would be enough to allow concord to arrive or the gankers have to bring and coordinate more people increasing the potiental cost for them  increasing the split of the rewards too  to drive their ships into oblivion in any case any fix to suicide ganking should require players activly working to prevent it not some arbitrary punishment system because someones activities are deemed too risky which frankly can apply to many more things besides suicide ganking including ships fit out for alliance or factional war  especially dictors which are technically suicide ships in any fleet fight based on how fast the enemy fleet will be shooting them so its essientally drop a bubble and die 
avon everytime this topic comes up you fly in with 100 post in each thread trying to highjack itits done its over with accept the fact that you wont be able to suicide gank for free anymoreyour extreme arguments are virtually always dismissed because you take the topic and keep spinning it and spinning it till it doesnt even resemble what it once wascancel your sub to avononline and try playing eveonline more
how about we break the arguments down into a simpler questionis recieving an insurance payment for losing your ship while ganking reducing the isk risk involved with ganking to near zerofor the purpose of this response pretend this has absolutely zero to do with riskreward of anyone else anyone is welcome to respond but i am especially interested in responses from our key contributors here ki an draygo has been getting into it  windjammer ashen mozetta avon leandro and me this should be a simple yes or no
yes
ki anhave you changed your mind on the stupidity taxread 2 posts 248  mine  and 256  your reply getting rid of the insurance pay out on ships killed by concord is a tax on the stupidity of the pilot that lost the shipjust like getting suicide ganked could be called a tax on a stupid pilot who had too much value inon a ship and was not paying attentionbeing the ganker and not getting the loot  or no loot   stupid  poor planning  taxed the cost of your ship  sec lossbeing the ganked and not getting away  stupid  you did put your self in the position to get ganked  you get taxed the lost cargo  and perhaps part of the cost of the ship all of the npc corp items have no place in this thread they are a red herring while there are issued with npc corps they have no bearing on the requirement of a stupidity tax for suicide gankersall the posts about people who like or dont like pvp combat or the market or missions have no bearing on a stupidity tax on suicide gankers
no i havent changed my mind i do believe that stupid suicide ganks should cost the ganker however i dont think removing insurance is the right way to go a rework of mechanics is more time consuming but it will most probably lead to a better game id rather wait for balance than have a kneejerk patch that fixes the wrong things
lol wuti dont suicide gank i havent for about 4 yearsi dont like it as a mechanic and i would welcome a way to limit or remove it as part of a holistic review of many conflict related mechanicshowever i honestly think that people who go on banging the zomg insurance aint fair drum do so precicely because they would rather try to punitively punish people who play in a way they dont like than to take a step back and see how eve could be enriched and balanced in a broader way they dont want that because the know that the game is unbalanced in more ways that advantage them than those they dislikeinsurance is not the solution to this and it only serves to skew balance further in favour of people who already have huge advantages whilst obscuring the the real problemsim sorry you got me so wrong
im sorry but its close to 1am here and im a bit tired could you rephrase the question not sure what youre getting at
ki its a set up question sheheit is reaching
finally understood the question the answer is a definate no
look at you forgetting to switch character oh dearthere are few ships where the insurance payout  cost of ship  mods  insurance premium or even close to itlower the cost sure mitigate it entirely nothe real question is would removing insurance on concord kills stop or significantly reduce suicide gankingi dont think it would and if it wouldnt is the call for it an attempt at balance or a way to lash out because they feel powerless
not to mention the fact that there is a lot more to consider than just isk when it comes to suicide ganking
i know man just bear with me on this i think we can all see that the disussion is getting further from relevant and more towards repeating the same crap over and over by both sidesi just want to clear up the arguments that we have and need a starting point
it entirelly depends on how you measure iskrisk as risk has many different meanings in eve as thus it is not a fair question and the only answer i can give is no we could discuss the risk but thats already been done to death in this thread and obviously we dont agree
or maybe i still dont understand the questionedit if you are asking this recieving insurance the suicide ganker loses almost 0 isk wether he succeeds or fails his gankthen the answer is still no i did some calculation given a tier 2 battleship and t1 fitting the cost for the ganker is around 13 million that is not a lot but its still higher than 0
if voiding the insurance on a ship due to it being killed by concord would not help balance suicide ganking claims the gankers but it would make the victims feel better then whats the big deal about implimenting itthen there is the gankers saying that if their insurance is void for being concorded then insurance should just be done away with all together so they are not the only was affectedno one feels any pity for the badger 2 on autopilot with billions in the hold i have read this enire post and only one person said they think they should be able to autopilot thru empire in total safety  which i personally think was a troll  so you can stop bringing up the person on autopilot in the t1 hauler bit
what about the most common suicide gank ship dominix t1 fit with t1 sentries thats tier 1 and it only takes a handful to pop a freighter in 05
do you know this or are you making an assumption here i know tri are  where  pretty big on suicide ganking seemed to me that the domi wasnt the first choice there nor has it been on any of the killmails ive seen thus far the domi was the best suicide ganker before the last nerf to suicide ganking  yes suicide ganking has already been nerfed  several times  but now that concord insta jams and kills drones they are not so hot anymore the handful you talk about would be around 1520 or so as before the nerf it took about 10 with t2 drones to kill a freighter in a 5 system i know i tried
let me clarify i have been told many times by people that domi was prefered but honestly i have seen freighters get ganked in empire and i see teir 1 used a lot because of costsmy point is on a teir 1 bs after it is insured with only t1 fittings after insurance payout its only a few million it costs you a few million to have a crack at the reward of what you are suicide ganking which is going to be a whoooooole lot more than what you lose everytime you take a shot at iti view it like a slot machine you only have to pay a quarter but stand to gain hundreds of dollars based on many factors all in your favor you have to have many many many unsucessful ops  losing your ship to concord  in order to come close to what you stand to gain in only one sucessful opas far as the alliance i am in does that really matter in this topic
someone posted an idea in the minutes for this topic about a structure that would take care of or help with pos fueling we could add a supply depot structure to this  maybe that would allow you to keep a large supply of fuel in a central location in system and drones could ferry it out to all your pos in system as needed then the drones and the supply depot could be a target for raiders to attack but if your territory is secure it dramatically lessens your need to refuel anyone more familiar with pos logistics that can tell me if that would be helpful
the idea looks to be headed in the right direction i like more objectives with more volatility for individual objectivesthe relationship that needs to change to make the sov changes really have impact is that whatever minor goals are put into place need to have diminishing returns for both the attacker and defender thats how you make it where ten pilots in ten gangs are more advantageous than a hundred guys in one fleetwhat comes to mind in 5s when i think of this kind of thing is a more dod type scenario gates operate like flags getting there in a domi and pounding on the objective for an hour with drones will get the job done a few pilots can do it faster a lot of pilots cant do it better especially when they could be hitting other objectivesnot suggesting specific mechanics just that whatever objectives are in place need to be more numerous and more volatile while still remaining tied to a low volatility buffer that prevents timezone issuesthe current system is for a few poss  which should be serving starbase roles not sov roles  to be in low numbers and have low volatility they also serve as skirmish points and timezone buffers thus all activity is centered around the poss which also serve as death stars and so only blobs with capships are really important in sovereignty contests
there was a lot of ideas kicking around in this thread i tried to sum it up in the submission template im writingfirst solutionthe pilgrim is forced to fight inside web range only recon that has to  but it doesnt do that very well move it outside of web range like all other recon ships increase the nos and neut rangeor second solutionif the pilgrim is supposed to fight inside webrange it doesnt tank well enough its forced to fit a capbooster in order to keep up due to the nosnerf this could be fixed by increase the pg in order to fit capbooster increase the nos percentage amount so that it can also tank using capwarfarethis was what i could make out of it what do you guys think is this how you want to suggest it to ccpif you have any other suggestions i would like if you could use the above format so that it can be added to the submission template deadline is friday
the pilgrim need a boost yesif it was up to me id just change its role scrap its nosneut bonus and replace it by a laser cap use bonus and give it 45 gun slots that would basically make it a zealot with drones and some ew but without much laser dps  no damagerof bonus and only 5 lows seriously limiting damage mods and tank 
this would be my choice of fixes for itmy fitting problem with the pilgrim has always been cpu not pg but fitting a cap booster may require both cpu and pgi dont like the 2nd solution i think the pilgrim should mimic the combat recon in every way that the other races mimic theirs
i tend to agree with this but the idea came up from this thread what do the rest of you guys think is the 1st solution the best one maybe i missed some other solution
yep 1 is the bestextend the range on nosneut as per the curse a touch more cpu pilgrim is then fixed
see post 58 for suggestions  and 57 for longwinded supporting details the pilgrim is rather unique amoung the recons as noted you would also do well to convo veroneif anyone knows the pilgrimhe does looking forward to your response
it is not forced to fit a cap booster by any regard  that 2nd fix should be more focussed on its cap amountrecharge so you dont need to fit a cap batteryinjector to get some kind of sustainable cap warfare going onas it stands you can get it perma running 3 neuts a disruptor a web and 2 tds with a large cap battery and 2 cap power relays or using ccc rigs but it has no propulsion this way if it had the large cap battery built in you could choose to go sustainable cap warfare and ab route or less sustainable mwd and cap warfare routeweb range wasnt an issue either perhaps the pilgrim could also do with some more armor  most fits involve a plate and rep or just a plate  so it can survive long enough to chew down a target
here is where i am coming from and you tell me if i am wrong for itcould i train to fly sacrileges sure i could i can already fly all caldarigallenteminmatar hacs and use all the t2 gunsdronesmissilesect for all those ships no problem now if i trained for sacrilege which considering i have 17million sp in missiles i could do just great but that doesnt change the fact that the cerberus needs boosted just migrating to the flavor of the month doesnt fix game balanceis the cerberus a lot harder to fit than the sacrilege agree or disagreeshould the cerberus lose some of its missile range  which imo is overkill  for some better midrange capability agree or disagreeperhaps part of the problem is the sacrilege is dare i say too good agree or disagreecerberus is a missile ship should it not be effective with both heavy and heavy assault launchers agree or disagreedo the caldari need two sniper hac agree or disagreei will always and forever hate the kinetic missile damage only bonus the very fact the sacrilege is not limited to 1 damage bonus on its missiles really bugs mei also think it is wrong to have to train another race to use the caldaris racial weapons that is ridiculous you dont have to train caldari to use pulse lasers while yes the sacrilege is ok since its a khanid ship i still think the caldari should be rather ok with all kinds of missiles you dont see the raven boxed into just cruise missiles it can pack torpedoes no problem and technically speaking the eagle can use blasters just fine even if its not the optimal use of the shipcerberus though fitting problems out the wahzooo its in the same boat the nighthawk is in
what jim just said
if you try to fit it to fill a role like a sac yeah it is a painhowever fitting it for its intended role presents no problems whatsoeveras to maybe the issue being the sac is too good  yes yes it isif it was slower it would be more balanced  but it seems ccp havent gotten their heads around the speed problem yet that isnt specifically a nanowhine btw just more an issue with fast missile boats  there is no penalty to making a missile ship fast as there are no tracking issues to worry about  which is why we lost the ability to use dual mwds back in the day with those crazy ravens
i agree though i think that heavy launcher setups could use a lil boost its kind of annoying a sacrilege has a way easier time fitting a full rack of haml than the cerberus fitting just heavy launchers maybe the sacrilege is too easy to fit it seems overly easy to me least in eftfor example i can basically fit 2 bcu ii 2 overdrive ii a damage control ii 2 large extenders  1 regolith or drop it for a webifier  a 10mn mwd a warp disruptor ii 5 haml ii a med diminishing nos tight but it fits almost 500 dps and 3300ms 30000 effective hp thats pretty super and its completely cap sustainable ya sac is uh pretty good i guess
compared with most hacs it seems very easy to fit tbh probably too easythe probably forgot they turned it in to a missile boat and left it with stats for lasers p
1 agree2 disagree completely if anything it should get more range  currently i have to use rigs to get the full 240 km range 3 agree sort of  but i think the problem is really that jav hams are too good4 too vague to comment on are you asking for a pg increase or what5 yes the eagle and cerberus despite both being snipers fulfil different roles
yes that is my assumption as well amarr boost indeed nerf the sac 1 ok we agree2 i dont think so that would kind of defeat the purpose of rigs that is if you really wanted to shoot heavys that far uhm it takes a lot of sensor boostage to achieve 240km targeting range and i think at this range your missiles are rather ineffective but hey if you insist you uhm actually do this whatever though i am inclined to not believe it3 i am rather convinced the sacrilege is too good at the very least when it comes to power grid and capacitor you dont need a single fitting mod to pimp out a sacrilege look at my previous post and at my fairly cookie cutter sac setup i dont think that setup should be achievable without a rcu ii or two yet it fits flawlessly on a sac also sustainable cap with mwd how nice without some cap relays or rechargers a cerberus caps out in about 2 minutes or less4 im not sure i think the cerberus could use more grid though not more cpu definitely more grid a power grid boost would help out a ton5 i think the difference is that one is actually a good sniper in theory eagle and one is a  poor sniper cerberus and bringing either to most fleet fights will get you yelled at for not bringing a battleship raven  cerb  rokh  eagle but whatever i dont know who you hang with but in my neck of the woods its battleships for long range so basically the caldari hac have been pushed into a role that battleships do a ton better which leads me to thinking ccp would perhaps want reevaluate thisyoure basically pigeonholing these ships into a role that is rather obsolete and no longer really exists anymore eagles might have been uber interceptor swiping ships at once point but interceptors have been basically rendered obsolete thus the eagle isnt really needed anymore for that role and the cerberus cant hit a fast ship no matter what if its fast enough a cerberus can only sit back and watch his missiles do nothing  and yes for christs sake fix precision heavys ccp  still once again i dont see how the cerberus is a good support killer not when the support is generally untouchable by heavy missilesso if you are telling me you like to rig your cerberus with sensor boosters and shoot heavy missiles that go about 8kms from 240km away to shoot ships that go 36kms i honestly dont believe you sorry
and by the way gypsio iii falcons can jam up to 240km not that one would waste time jamming a cerberus  but in theory  he could
from a small mixed gang in lowsec perspective the cerberus is probably the biggest threat to the falcon of course the falcon should be jamming the bs in the main fight but if it wants to be able to do that itll have to keep a jam on the cerberus which can be tricky if the cerberus has a sensor strength of 95
whatcaldari frontline shipsno just noshow me one t1 caldari ship that is supposed to be a frontline fighter  with the possible exception of the drake  the whole point of caldari gunboats is their flexibility of range when you warp into a battle at almost any range you immmediately start dishing out the damage youre missing the point of the cerebrus jim
raven is not a front line fighter drake is pretty good i suppose caracal is certainly no sniper even if it is a bit subpar kestrel is a front line frigate for what its worth wait for it   maybe   caldari missile ships are their front line fighters their railgun ships are the sniperswhy wouldnt caldari have front line ships sorry i didnt get the memo stating that every race gets them except caldari
how did i miss this rubbish the first time round jim you really need to stand back and learn how to use the cerberus and to identify the situations in which missile sniping is useful compare the dps delivered after 60 seconds of firing an eagle and a cerberus at a tackled target for a start otherwise were just going over the same old ground  you whining that the cerberus isnt as good as a sacrilege at being a sacrilegereally this thread should be in ships and modules tbh
thats okay i dont used a watered down cruise missile raven call me crazy but id rather use a raven it kills falcons much faster its cheaper too and is even harder to jam and gosh darnit i believe even is more survivablehonestly if you wanna talk about your uber sniper cerberus and how cool it is and how stupid i am for not shooting heavy missiles from 240km away you can eve mail me in game and we can talk all night about how much you should do yourself a favor and use a ravenraven is also a lot easier to fit get this  you can fit siege launchers on it just fine too  and do midshort range pvp on it crazy if only there were some kind of small gang pvp equivalent heavy assault cruiser like that for caldari
emphasis added you got that right gunboats are all right as long ranged support snipers  moa ferox eagle rokh  however missile boats long range sniping is just idiocy and the raven is heaps better in that regard than any other caldari ship
pss poor argument absurd assumptions no sense of how the game is playedcan we move on to something that deserves attention and throw this thread in ships and modules  where it belongs
i think the cerberus need 5 more powergrid and only that
no support the cerberus is my second most successful pvp ship  on kills scored  i have no problem fitting it for its role  and i incidentally have no problem fitting heavy assaults with javelins that go a very very long way too the problem with this thread is that its promoting a homogenization of eve online with all races and ships being dragged into a tight functional specification that risks damaging race and ship variety many people have said it in this thread and ill say it again if you want to fly a sac train a sac and fly a sac dont try and argue for game changes that make a cerb a sac im offended to be honest that you are suggesting removing the cerbs missile range bonuses since those are the things that make it the premier light stand of missile sniper in the game i love flying the cerb in this role and taking it against superior odds in situations completely untenable for close range ships this thread is terrible and i definitely wont be supporting it
jade read the thread again i never said remove the cerberus range though i think it has more range than it needsi think the cerberus should have slightly more grid since i think its overly hard to fit yes even with heavy missile setups the 6th high slot on the cerberus is not usable if you want to fit a mwdlsei think the cerberus should have the option of fitting haml not be crippled by doing so they are after all missiles which do belong on the cerberusi think the missile flight time bonus should be a double missile velocity bonus  same range but better for long range i think the kinetic missile damage bonus should be damage bonus to all heavy missiles  sac gets short range missile dmg bonus caldari get long range for all missiles that is fair how in the world is that trying to make the cerberus a sacrilegesacrilege should get a hefty nerf its too easy to fit way way too easy to fit anyone actually disagree with me on this no fitting mods are needed for a sac ever its capacitor is too powerful for a missile ship perma mwd with no cap rechargers or relays wtf
1 grid agree cerberus is unnecessarily hard to fit2 double velocity bonus would be very nice indeed3 all damage type bonus well it would be nice but ccp might want to change it to all heavy missile damage types excluding hams just like the sac has a bonus to all ham types but not hmsnow finally were getting somewhere in this previously awful thread  you have specific proposals were moving out of ships and modules into features and ideas what you need to do now is to identify the pgcpu boosts that you think are needed  get modelling fits in eft  determine the effects of switching to a double velocity bonus  how does dps delivered over time change  and most importantly justify these changes  you should enjoy this youll get to compare the cerb to the sacrilege  so get cracking

i need to bump this thread during dt while people are still annoyed by it
hell im with you and dt is during lunch for me  bst  this should be tied in with the ui overhaul and i sincerely think that the csm should present a special edition of their problems for ccp to answer that consists soley of ui issues to really hammer home to them exactly how much bother the ui really is
hello allas a freighter pilot and jump frieghter pilot i find myself moveing lots of items for different members of my corp as im sure you are all aware the freighter and jump frieghter class of ship can only take one type of can this makes it slightly difficult to sort everyones gear and make sure they get the right stuff  i have a battered notebook to help what i propose is this1 frieghters and jump freighters should be able to take different types of cans or2 frieghters and jump freighters pilots should be able to create their own subdivision in the cargo bay much like a carrier corp hanger however the pilot should be able to name each tab i feel this will just make logistics a lot better to organize and save a lot of naffing around
afaik you can already courrier contract yourself the stuff so it stay in nice packagesbut i agree it should be more pratcical a corporatehangar separation would be nice
just use courier contracts all the stuff of each person in their very own little package
yeh doing that at the moment but it is a little bit annoying haveing to get 50 courrier conrtracts written
that also only works if hauling stationstationyou cant break courier contracts at a pos
just another good reason to lend your support to this
spoiler unplayable lag losing ships at blackscreens terrible customer service etc are not the makings of a premium producti didnt really want carrier 5 fighters 5 cap ships 5 or dread 5 but apparently im going to get them 
do want
do it
i suggested something very similar in the ideas forum a few months ago good idea
useless isk sellers go from cheapest isk wwwasshatcom to cheapest isk at www dot asshat dot com
i approve this ive played wow for quite some time and what they did was that everytime there were an inappropriate message in the chatbox players could simply just rightclick the senders name then choose an option report spamas far i understood it if a message received enough spam reports from the community the player would be checked by the gms investigated and ultimatly bann the account itselfnow i dont suggest ccp to copy this method if its not wanted but thats one way how someone did something about it close to 9000 accounts were banned each month because of this system i believe
i agree with the op speed is brokenthe t2 bonus implants break it even furtherlook at snakesslavescrystals  each of these gives a whopping 33 and 54 to their relevant statplus they stack upon dozens upon dozens of modules that affect the same exact ship stat  speed armor shield now look at the implant sets that have zero modules to affect the stats that they adjust talismans  energy emission  and halo  signature radius  these recieve bonuses by ship type only yet the bonuses given by these implants is only 17 and 33 respectively why so annoyingly low when they can be modified by nothing currently in the game and the ones with several dozen modifying items recieve disproportionately high bonuses
currently empire ores are out of whack veldspar is pretty much the most valuable ore outside 00 kernite might be slightly better although that can be found in hisec as well the problem is simply that the lowsec ores have been pushed to the side the drone regions inject quite a lot of midrange  lowsec  minerals into the economy lowering the price the solution is to simply make the minerals from lowsec ores more valuablethere are a number of ways to do this build costs of shipsequipment  all or just a few like capships  could be redone to put a bit less emphasis on tritaniumpyerite and maybe a bit more on isogennocxium another way is to simply replace the reprocessable alloys on rogue drones with something elseeither a real bounty  why wouldnt concord put bounties up on rogue drones theyre a threat as much as any pirate faction  or some droppable rewardraising the price of lowsec minerals would obviously result in a fair bit more profit to be made do i want x isk hour mining in safety or 152x iskhour mining in danger rather than do i want x iskhour mining in safety or x iskhour mining in danger
supported the most abundant empire ore should not be more valuable than almost anything outside 00 would also like to see more reason to go to lowsec
i believe in the invisible hand
problem with that is this issue was created by ccp artificially by the nature of the drone region drops and other factors that tritanium is so valuable is the result of the invisible hand while this is fine for the market it is to the detriment of the game at large since it kills the lowsec areas might as well remove the belts thereactuallythis could be the invisible hand of chribba making veldspar  damn you chribba you fooled us all11 buff lowsec ore plox 
one needs to find a way to vastly increase the demand for nox and isogen that is allit looks like this was tried at one point  look at things like cargo bay bpos  but they numbers required are so inconsequential that it looks like the effort ended before it even reached the level of halfassery
they wouldnt even really need to increase the demand for everythingmaybe for a few things capships for example

anyone who has spent any time in lowsec can attest to the constant stream of haulers moving back and forwards running courier missions is out of handplayer corps like metafarmers have tried to eradicate them in certain areas but like cockroaches and flies they return to haul 237every now and again they will disappear as it seems ccp takes action but soon the haulers are back with new ridiculous names that seems as if someone fell asleep on the keyboard or a random combination of two words out of a dictionarythese isk farmers are not only a blight on the eve economy but they are also just plain annoying  as a pirate trying to scan down targets and avoid blobs between the myriad of haulers about it really gets to me my proposal is to remove lowsec courier agents or at least scrap the courier missions the agents give out in lowsec its almost risk free for them  warp to zero and insta undock points  to reap the lp and then cash in for implants which are then sold for isk and then sold to players if they want to farm isk make them do it the hard way l4 combat missions where we the players can then hurt their operationsare the lowsec residents ie pirates the only ones who see this problem am i alone in wanting to see this stopped im hoping the csm can bring this issue before ccp and lets get this sortedi would also like to know ccps stance on this what actions they take when finding a hive of haulers etc
something ive been wondering myself i know its hard to keep up with the farmers as admins but cutting off their easiest sources of income is a good start at least
agreed this is out of hand
yeah its ridiculous and farmer bs are more fun to pop than farmer haulers so id rather they were doing combat missions
couldnt agree more
agreed some places right now are crazy with this problem  more traffic than the amarr emp station going inout
remove lowsec courier agents  no what about those of us that actually use them
signed
so wont they just move to highsec agents i dont see how this would stop them
as far as i know there arent many l4 agents who give out constant courier missions in highsecthe lp gained from the lowsec agents is what draws them herefor example there are three l4 q20 archive agents in ingunn near where im based in one station so they grab three missions in one go to maximise lp gain theres something wrong right therelp is turned into implants implants to isk and then sold to idiots
before some1 whines plz read the whole post pcaldari have no uber drone boatsthis makes sense as minmatar have no uber laser boat  lol this fact is fine and dandyuntill ccp skrewed it up by bringing in carriersto train for carriers one must train fighters heaviesmeds etc and max out their drone spthis is fine for every1 as the drone sp aids in other ships that can use drones well ie arbphoondomito an extent the raven and scorp benefit aswell as they can use medslights etcthen we get to heaviessentriesnot one caldari subcapital ship can field 5  or even 4  heavy dronessentriesthis is rather lame as we must spend many sps on drones and train t2 heaviessentries etc for our carriers therfore losing out on the sp for heavies benefiting less from all that sp in dronessure we can use them in a dread or carrier but so can all the other raceswe just lose out elsewhereif someone says just crosstrain blah then stfu its not like gallente have to crosstrain to get maximum use from their skillpointswhinenow a solution plz extend the drone bay of the scorpion to 100125m and bandwidth  or maybe ferox dunno all other cal ships cld be too overpowered  scorp gets primaried anyway so its not like it will make a huge difference to ops etc else plz bring out a new class of ships for the races that focus on that races nonspeciality  for want of a better word  ie drone boat for cal missile boat for gallente etcthoughtsedit ok heres something that keeps coming upu dont need heaviessentries for a carrierand caldari shldnt use gallente weapons it ruins diversity etcexplainedminmatar can use 5 heavies they arent specced for dronesammar can use 5 heavies they arent specced for dronesgallente of coursewhy not cladariif u say because there opposite to caldarithen why is the eris lach and ares a missile boatand the reason im talking bout heavies is because it wld be stupid to put so much sp into drones such as interfacingadv interfacing etc for carriers and not train for heaviessentries but cal are gimped as we cant field them in a single subcap cal shiphope that clrs that confusion up
bump for love
so along with taking away from some of the racial diversity in eve you are proposing to make people who fly caldari subcapitals have to invest more sps to get the most out of their shipsim not sure you have thought this throughalso this should be in the ideas forum
agreed  whilst it would be nice to have drones it wouldnt help eve overall balance and so on and yes i fly a chimera been through the pain love drones and would love a drone bay on my falcon but not in the best interests sadly
i think ccp could toss a few caldari ships 15m3 drone bays but honestly theres bigger fish to fry as far as caldari pvp issuesim hoping ccp will look at caldari ships and do what they did for amarr if its half as good as the boosts they got hell maybe well even see a khanid technology exchange and get a nice fancy laser ship thats better than a zealot mmmmmmmaybe
this isnt an issue in the slightest
thought this through plenty plz refer below
cal dont have a single drone boatgallente have a t2 missile boaterishow is this such a huge diversityreducing changeedit typo
yes please   add a sentry dron bonused ship for caldari  or rework the ferox to be one  like baybandwidth  250100 10 to sentry drone hp and damage shield resist bonus as is1 long range as caldari speciality  check2 gallente still have the best drone ships  checkyou can even add the optional sentry optimal instead of the damage bonus to keep it to spec  
youre being serious arent you
while i dont see this as a major issueas mentioned caldari are broken  in the bad way for them  in many worse waysbut i could see the scorpion getting some drone love since it has more of a utility role as it standsgot my thumbs up but i dont really think itll have legs
erisinterdictors skill bonus 5 bonus to rocket and light missile thermal damage and 10 bonus to interdiction sphere launcher rate of fire per levelquite seriousand im not asking for this because i want an uber drone ship i just want to be able to utilise all the sp that will go into carrier traininglook at it this way i train many skills such as interfacing etc for fightersit wld be rahter silly of me to ignore the other types of drone with such good support skills for thembut sadly its gimped as i cant use heaviessentries on any subcap cal ship
youre under the impression that you need t2 heavies and sentries to fly a carrier you dont  the only subcapital drone skills you need to get into fighterequipped carriers are drones and drone interfacing both of those are useful to max on subcapital caldari ships  plenty of ships have a 25m3 drone bay and a ship with any drone bay at all benefits from drone interfacing being one of the biggestimpact skills in the game as such this is a wholly unnecessary change and a bad one at that
well unless you fly black ops you arent going to use all those carrier sps anywaylots of caldari ships use drones and if anything the fact that they use less of them makes the skills all the more important to maximise their effectivenessi cant believe you are using a gallente ship using light missiles as a justification for caldari ships using a full load of heavy or sentry drones either  i honestly thought you must have been joking about the eris
if you dont feel that training drone skills pays off for you cause you play caldari dont train them there are other skills im pretty sureand scorpion is awesome bufferbait
yes to a caldari drone boat
i like the idea very much but limiting them to cap ship only is limiting their use in bs fleets and smaller gangs keeping ur idea in mind perhaps creating a different sized bomb for each sized ship eg less powerful bomb for bs anti bs bomb while keeping the current dmg of bombs to cap only also is it wise that defenders would be able to destory a bomb once it is on the hull of a ship smart bombs already work well against them
bomb in their current role are definately useful but theyre just simply brokenthe launching ship should be immune to its bomband they should only cost as much as a frigate  500k tops  considering theyre lucky if they can kill a frigatethe defender missile launcher idea has a lot of merit however i agree eve is in dire need of a method to make missile countermeasures usefula  such as making them effective for the entire squadwingfleet that the missile screen pilot is inb  give defender missiles an insane rof bonus  so you could actually load them into a siege launcher and achieve 25s rof to support an entire fleet c  have defenders respond to bombs  sticky or otherwise  and drones as well as missiles
i take it that the lack of support for this issue is simply cause so many have realised that the claw sucks and never botherd to train for it in the first place
either way you shouldnt need a command ship to properly utilize longrange scrams  which the ship has a bonus for 
scram range  locking range is kinda wierdsupport the sport
then by your reasoning caldari missile boats should also get a targeting range bonus since their weapon ranges are usually past their targeting range
homes in roidsthat simpleexcept not  my idea is find a roid and custommine it to your specifications it could be carved to contain some ammo a few ships or maybe even a manufacturingmining facility depending on its sizeperhaps others could stumble upondestroy them accidentally with mining lasers making them a more volatile investment than a posgo ahead bash this idea or boost it i just like the idea of a cheaper alternative to poss the cost of which is intimidating to manyedit i realize that i am bringing an old idea up but it needs to be given a fresh show to the candidates i posted on the old thread  
i know they are planning to move belts from being static to having to explore for them perhaps one of the roids generated for these dynamic belt could have the habitable flag set on it that way you can a  control the number of them in the universe  id hope that these would be seeded even in highsec  and b  they would remain hidden once the belt had been mined outalthough to make them id suggest it would take a significant amount of time resources and skills  which would create a niche market for miners creating these homos and selling them on for profit
hells yes
if i may suggest directing your attention to the following thread sposs  that really fleshes out the idea in earnest and gives credit to the suggestion the only sad part that although player housing has been on the drawing board for a very long time very little has come of it i might also add with no small degree of humility that it showed up there shortly after my informal conversation with oveur during june of 2006 who agreed that it might be something to explore although not immediately anyway it can tie in perfectly with the hopefully upcoming pos overhaul i would fully support it of course
this is the first time ive looked at this forum so i apologize if this idea has been discussed beforei think it would be cool if there were more commands i could give to my drones specifically id like to be able to tell them to automatically focus on a certain class of ship or to attack ships currently using an ewar mod on me ect these commands could even be made available by a certain modrigskill good idea bad idea
hell no
oh and omber shows up in several missions namely downing the slavers and enemies abound kernite is available in caldari lowsec and amarr highsec and looking at my local area  caldari the citadel  i can buy the 8000 kernite for 236million and the 10k omber is under 1milthat implant comes nowhere near close to the cost of the ore
turning it down does nothing for your standings
3ish jumps in a intyshuttle spend 3mil for ore get 4 implant either sell to buy orders for 10ish mil or wait and sell for 15ish mil  unless its a cha implant then you can sell it for 45mil to buy orders or 7ish mil on the market 
akita never before have i felt as much hatred for anyone as i do for you right now suggesting this there are many specific and very graphic ideas going through my head to thank you for your contribution many of which i assume  and sincerely hope  would cause you sufficient pain and agony that you would wish your life to end however being the welltrained amarr that i am i would take extraspecial care to ensure that your life would extend even past the span it would have under optimal conditions entirely for the purpose of causing you unending and insufferable paini have enough trouble hauling it one jump thankyouverymuch and despite having lvl 5 mining skills i only have them to help my corps if only absolutely necesasry
please please please please tell me how you fit 8000m3 into an inty please
i buy it at the station where the storyline mission is at
alas my storyline agent is a waste of space in some deadend backward crappy damned system closest i can get is one jump
idea improving visual notifications and integrating sound into the fleet broadcast systemhave aura tell us when a fleet broadcast is broadcastfor example if the fleetwingsquad commander broadcasts to align to the khanid prime stargate aura will let you know something like align request broadcasted  this could happen for all broadcasts another example the commander broadcasts a target you then hear aura say something like target has been broadcasted improve the visual notifications for broadcasts in addition the blinking of the broadcast window  both when minimized and open  is hardly sufficient i think i feel this needs to be improved perhaps along with improved blinking and aura letting you know about the broadcast you also could have a black box of text appear in the usual position informing you of the broadcast too the current broadcast system feels unfinished the bottom line im trying to get across i guess is that basically the broadcast system ccps got in place is great but it feels unfinished the ideal situation is that even if you are not looking for the broadcasts you will still be aware of them when they occur when your commander broadcasts in fleet unless youre blind and deaf it should be basically impossible to miss the broadcast currently this is not the case
as long as its optional this seems fine to me
sounds goodi think that whenever a new broadcast is made the back of the broadcast window should flash white for a second just long enough to get your attention
yeah its rather easy to miss broadcasts atm auditory notifications would help  should be pretty easy to implement to  the flashing the window is a good idea as well
as its so easy surely you wont mind sharing this insight with usin a couple more seconds you have no time to warp anywhereso in the situation where you have multiple pos belts and moons on scanner  potentially even in the same 5 degree  how do you do this
hop into systemscan 360if ship on scan180906015 multiple celestials on scan check range  smart pilots have either an ov setting specifically with celestials or check via f11 map ranges from jumpin prior to moving in if multiple celestials i
thank you for that and yes i agree dimwits raven makes life easier  assuming he doesnt have multiple ships in space with his name on them im talking about tracking down people who have the basic intelligence to watch local at least once a minute and rename their ship thoughi have an overview with celestials and already do pretty much exactly what you suggest it works but it takes time and time is something there is precious little of when trying to catch someone before they warp out when you see 30 or more ships and multiple online pos on scan then filtering out the signal from the noise becomes nigh on impossibleit also doesnt answer the problem of being able to engage one hostile with multiple others in local and have some information on what is happening around you if someone is coming to help their friend i like to have at least some advance notice of their ship types and numbers to help me decide whether to stay or to bail yes by comparing lists and seeing new ships arrive you can get some info but if they are already in the pos and in scan range you are basically screwed as you cannot tell if it is occupied or not without either going and looking or waiting until they come and kill you
thems the breaks really hit the target you wish to and either yourself or wingman spams short range scan looking for inbounds this is called creating an engagement and to counter the obvious potential trapdont send in all the km s from the adjacent systemwith any luck  and a handy falcon pilot helps  and a bit of patience on the delay bitcue ride of the valks as you proceed to knock poshugging lemmings onto your killboardbut this is tacticalnothing to do with the relative ease of scanning down a given target in cluttered systemsand the dimwit example is just one nuance i usually keep local minimized and only pay attention to large number spikes  primarily because i dont care who i am attacking  
i feel special now all of the highpriority items just get a meh who cares from me yey im differentalso  i miss linux client im so way different
on the forums of the galaxy of eve many things age fittings are shunned due to nerfs discussions of old issues that have been fixed surely take up half of the forum database the way ccp has been keeping their bandwidth cunsumption to a reasonably low level is to lock old threads thereby reducing the number of posts requiring large amounts of data transfer however i in my occasional forum browsing as well as i am sure many others have become irked due to the prevelance of said locked threads and our wish to post on them the other issue i have mentioned are threads aged past the point of use threads about old nosdomi setups dampganks and why to always fit an ecm are among these outofdate discussions i would like candidates to adress this issue there are approaches to update this system that could be made perhaps a voting system or moderator decision to delete threads beyond their useful age what i am primarily searching for is a way to decrease the amount of locked threads maybe by ridding the database of them permanently i eagerly await that candidates responses
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
excellent while id still like to see a low moved to a mid  and fittings compensated to match just like id want with many caldari ships cough raven cough  this is most definitely a step in the right direction
x the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because i support ccps current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecksfurther more loot should be available to everyone and all wrecks should be able to be tractored by everyone ok since that will never happen i do want to say a couple things after spending a weekend mining omber and finally wanting to shoot myself in the head i started looking for something new and fun i read a post about ninja salvaging and thought i would give it a try after spending six hours training up the skills and pulling together the necessary equipment i headed out to the nearest high sec mission hub to give it a test runafter waiting 6 minutes from my scan i see a raven ok here we go and an acceleration gate my first try i jump in and immediately warped out n00bs are not use to seeing quiet that many red cross hairs i went back to the forums and discovered i wouldnt be agrod so i went back with my salvager and the mission runner was done with that room well all said and done i made about 15 mil on that first mission it was a bit of beginners luck the next mission area i only made 5 and it took me a couple attempts to find a gate the last one of the evening was really fun because the runner came back in an iteron to loot and salvage it was fun because my slasher could fly too the wrecks and salvage them faster than his tractor beam could pull them in ok that being said i think there are some untruths being told no it is not hard to salvage mission runners periodive been to null sec running missions is way easier than running into a gate camp most people i know run missions because it is fast easy money not because of the fantastic skill of challenge mission running representsi think both of those truths are really important for everyone to understand one of my favorite comments ive read so far is on the ownership of wrecks you own those wrecks for those who think that please go run a mission in low sec first your pretty raven will get blown to bits next all those wrecks will not only get salvaged but also looted and the one wreck you actually did own will also get salvaged and looted of course you already know that dont you thats why you run missions in empireim really surprised more people dont take advantage of all this i know pirates in 00 who would love to pew pew a player in a pve bs why dont they just scan down mission runners and start stealing their loot ravens are so much prettier on killboards than riftersfor those of you that think that all players salvage their wrecks run a 360 degree directional scan in any system at max range and see how many wrecks show up do it again an hour later my guess is a sizable portion of missions dont get salvaged now im in no way against making salvaging mission runners wrecks more difficult  challenging by all means make agro from rats open im even down with the whole staking a claim thing i dont think it should be a super easy one click option though i think your claim should last 15 minutes after that the wreck comes open to claim by anyone who right clicks the wreck and that claim should last for another 15 minutes finally wrecks would persist 1 hour after the finish of the last claim i can just imagine the lazy mission runner sitting back letting his  or her  hammerhead iis fight the good fight and then suddenly realizing all their wrecks are turning yellow  i also think the claim system should work for loot if you are to busy  lazy to keep whats yours maybe you dont want it that bad after allwell thats all for now if you see me out there while you are missioning say hi and if you ask nicely maybe ill leave your wrecks alone maybe
id like to see where you read that since its fundamentally wrongyou can be aggrod by the npc ships  dont fool yourself it happens to me all the time  i see youre flying a slasher which i need to commend you on as its the fastest minmatar frigate and the best racial ship for ninja salvaging  the good news is because youre using a frigate the larger ships  bcs and bss  in the spawn will do very little damage if you keep movingthat being said if you ever warp in on a l5 mission be prepared to run away fast i got hit with 800 dps warping in to a l5 by the environment  damn gas clouds were hiring  and were always looking for good pvpers you want action looking for targets weve had 18 wardecs in three months tchell dahhn alt spottedoh wait
i want to be able to salvage wrecks without being flagged as a criminal  being a mostly lawabiding federation resident  especialy wrecks abandoned on purpose however i dont want to tick people of by taking salvage they might want my imperfect guideline is that if no one else is hovering around the wreck area theyre fair gamei would not be against implimenting for example some sort of timer so that when a person leaves the vicinity of a wreck and stays away for x amount of time it is considered abandoned after that point salvage of the wreck is 1st come 1st served with no flagging
if you set the timer for 30 seconds and set the distance at 5000m im all for this idea
i over simplified that i didnt mean that you couldnt be agrod period just that you wont get insta agrod as soon as you jump in plenty of time to make a book mark and wait for things to settle down a bit i might have to take you up on this at some point im not quiet ready to start pvp yet but my ceo just told me i had to stop ninja salvaging or im out so im kind of riding the fence right now well see where the next couple of weeks take me  
i beg to differ well meta drones may not be the best thing but its still worth while especially because those drones are considered exotic goods faster and more durable drones its certainly something carrier pilots want i know i doi woldnt mind acrheology sites in the drone regions either some better divercity in combat plexes sure but i can live with all that the thing is it takes literaly hundereds of jumps to find anything of value im not talkin about some carebear empire space crap here this is 00 deep 00 far away from any friendly pos or outpost sites respawn slow and there are always only few in every region it takes a while to find them and sometimes u need to go in hostile space to do so i rearly do expoloration for profit i probably wouldnt bother with exploration if i happen to live in any other region outside of drone space gravity sites are worthless in 00 especially if u are part of a sov holding alliance its cheaper and u can actually make more cash if u mine in a belt plexes are fine but if u consider the time ud need to find em youll be better off ratting in a belt anomalies well even worse then plexes drone radar sites however provide u with something unique it is the only type of exploration site that im interested in the real value of an augmented drone is about 10 to 15 times the value of the regular t2 version what is real value u ask real value includes the matirials skills and manifacture time aswell as the time u had to spend finding the bpc if you include the rarity factor the price may even shoot as high as 30 times the standart t2 version it is so rediculously expensive that its virtually impossible to make any money out of itto that extend 00 exploration is rarely done for cash yes the few explorers lucky enough to have ladar sites in their space can make a fortune on drug production but thats about itto be frankly honest with you guys i would even mind a dedicated exploration ship why you ask well the answer is quite simple but there is more to it you see i live in an established sov holding alliance infact i can go 100 jumps deep in 00 space and never even see a single pilot on my way if u really think about it 00 space is big really big infact it is too big for the pilots inhabiting it there is a simple reason for that most pilots are scared of 00 and even if some find the courage to go and check it out pirates are likely to catch the courageous carebear in a gate camp in lowsec or the first 00 systemheres my answer to why i would mind a dedicated exploration ship its not a big deal for me if a single carebear covops sneaks pas the pirates but it would be a big deal for me if an exploration ship makes it through it means more competition on my exploration routes and i just dont want any ps i do exploration for fun when i want to unwind from all the fleet combat  aka lagg till u wake up in station  and pos warfare i do not explore for cash although thats a nice side effect
well as i posted in another thread exploration ships do make sence to a degree however as it stands now exploration isnt really the best way to earn a living exept for few rather exploration dedicated regions  drug production etc  its fun to do for some diverse but 1010 plexes that drop the good complex modules cant and shouldnt be soloable in my opinion as for the empire explorers you got stations everywhere put a cruiser around the systems that u explore and ure doneexploration ships in 00 however make much more sence since the outposts are scattered over great distances however the last thing i want to see around my exploration routes is carebears runing exploration ships stealing my looti know it sounds selfish but well thats eve isnt it i already need to compete against other explorers of my alliance and naibor alliances the good stuff is rare and there are enough ppl going after it alreadyexploration takes far too few skills to work compare it to mining combat or industry and ull see what i mean maybe thats why its so popular but you dont need a dedicated ship for it mining takes atleast 2 ships solo combat is a myth well solo steath bombers and recons can gank stupid pilots and that really is it ratting in the drone regions takes atleast 2 ships to work decently  even if u fly a marauder even if ccp brings out a dedicated exploration ship id probalby keep dualboxing my buzzard and ishtar pilots to do exploration
its called high sec  
aother idea is to make learning skills a separate over time skilling system in which you can train one while other skills train normally at normal speed
all that needs to happen is that people stop telling noobs train all learning skills before doing anything elseinstead tell them to first train up simple rank 1  2 skills which let them fly better ships and do fun stuff once you start learning more advanced skills then you can train up the basic learning skills and later on the more advanced learning skills
what he saidedit i fail
just an idea here new skills that need to be in eveship customization 15rank one allows the repainting of ship to matte finishrank two allows repainting of ship to gloss finishrank three metallic finishrank four pearlecent finishrank five allows the mixing of finishesship hull customization 15rank one allows use of striping on shipsrank two allows the use of basic vinyl type designsrank three allows the use of fading vinyl type designsrank four allows the use of embossments on shipsrank five allows the use of body moodifications ie cool fins to make my hyperion look like a 58 caddythese skills could all be under industry and it could be possible to purchase and invent through bpo and bpcs the colors and mods to the ships contracts could go out for people to modify ships etc this could be a whole new industry in evejust an idea to throw out there but im sure many pilots would like the ability to at least somewhat individualize there ships and distinguish them from all the other ships flying about eveanyway just throwing the idea out there to see if ccp might get behind it and maybe drop out a sweet patch with these options
hmm id really love to see that kind of a featureunfortunetly that will only add up to the lagg issues of the game
ship would look different from each other  thumbs upmore lag  thumbs downsilly coloured ships all around the place  more pinkish thoraxes etc   thumbs downbesides afaik the game mechanics support this
ops willpower to destroy farmer cans is small apparently
just discovered the meeting notes today  pretty forum btw jade just wanted to beg plead and otherwise cajol the csm to plug the citadel torp issue it was mentioned in passing in the minmatar caps issue  so it appears to be rolled up into it  but while its a nuisance for minmatar caps its crippling for caldari capsthanks
chatpron says absolutely nothing useful not even a remote discussion of alternatives to localcsm answersweep it under the rug and hope it goes away but do carry on csmbelieving you actually represent the playerbaseim not trolling just calling you all out as i see it excuses and inattentioncontinued failbut at least you might be able to post awesome npc wrecking shots ad naseum in player bios again  because thats really important
ok it just goes to tell me you didnt read the chatlog then im not saying it was a troll post im saying you are setting up strawman arguments which is really silly someone like yourself can do better than that but im totally speechless over how successfully you called out all csm members for oh wait another strawman argument you are making assumptions and you are stating things like they were fact but you have no ground for them at least you are yet to prove it  i mean how exactly has it been swept under the rug i think its silly you even suggest thatlet me point you to the chat log which you of course readif you call that sweeping it under the rug then i think you should run for csm next time and show us how to do it
to set up a straw man or set up a straw man argument is to describe a position that superficially resembles an opponents actual view but is easier to refute then attribute that position to the opponent  for example deliberately overstating the opponents position get your definitions correct pal the only straw men i see are on the csm to witbane glorious  local annoys everyone at times but im not really sure if discussion on changing local is going to get anywhere ideas are one thing but id prefer a more unstructured discussion so ill have to say nay sorryi have read the chatlogin its entirety quote above is just a representative sample reinforcing lack of care or concern on the part of the csm trueyou and jc may have voted yes to further discussionsyet neither of you back your yes reasons with any sembalance of ideas in order to make it an actual debate over prosvconswhile ccp may not like the use of local as an intel toolthey are also twofaced in this regard as the last formal comment by a dev regarding the current state of the onboard scanner is they are not prepared to look into it at this time or words to that effect  you can find that particular exact quote yourselfim not doing your work for you with regard to local as intelvscannerthe main issue you fail to acknowledge is pilots in eve are generally lazy and cant be asked to learn to use the scanner properly  and lavistai know from personal experience that you fail at that too  herehave a further silly comment from somone who obviously has no clue how to use the directional scanner properly  or when to use probes for that matter inanna zuni  it is unreasonable to expect every ship to install a scan launcher so it needs to be the ship one if the ship one then will be affected by skills which means new players at a disadvantage where everyone gets local info at same moment currentlyjust wow but perhaps with some simple tweaksgeethe scanner currently can give automatic range values to celestial objectsperhaps allowing the same functionality for noncloaked ships might encourage folks to use what is a simple 3601809015 camera rotate process a bit easier as opposed to the current stupidity of having to manually input rangesbut nolets agree not to discuss things or dare to discuss any of the valid player suggestionsoptions for improvement and ignore the other threads with wellwritten reasoning and plenty of support in favor of improving bios and other such nonesense that have no effect on actual gameplay  now dont get me wrong yes i am being harsh and blunt but i dont bull around and dont appreciate being spoonfed bloated chatlogs as representative examples of you csm folks doing your jobs properlytbh it would have been better had the csm been left as a simple bit of player oversight regarding potential ccpemployee involvement in the game rather than the current selfinterest group it has morphed intoand me run for csm cheersbut no thanks there are far better players than me who actually care about the game and how its played and should i wish to roll up to iceland and visit jinx and the new ally smelteri would do it on my own dime and not at the expense of other players money keep it simpleyou folks should be about the gameplay in the context of eve being a cold harsh uncaring environment period
congratulations you found wiki what is your point it doesnt change the nature of your above postsno because the idea being discussed around was all written out in the submission template which was sebmitted before the meeting huh im sorry are you the bone i used to fly with as far as im aware i know pretty well how to use the directional scanner and what is your point with that anyways maybe we should dedicate a whole csm meeting to your ideas i mean they seem to be more important than the rest of the communitys ideas
ill return when you  and fellow csm members  actually have something useful to say regarding game play in a cold harsh unforgiving environmentim not holding my breath put that in your hopedfor expanded bioi am also fully expecting to see this thread locked and deleted for daring to ask questions and challenge the csm to actually be useful regarding game play
why should it be locked that would be stupidanyways what you didnt see in those logs was that for half an hour before the meeting we were discussing several different topics where several csm members were advocating the harsh environmentalso i think looking into the pillaging outpost suggestion could be what you are looking forbut im all for the unforgiving environment but bone how do you suggest we should do it what should changeunless you post on the assembly hall we cant raise it if you do post there i will read it and answer so please do post
you know what ruleofthebone its a real shame you arent prepared to run for csm office yourself because id actually love to see you win a seat and get told face to face by the rest of the committee to stop acting like a whinging prat and try bring some actual adult discussion to the table grow up and treat people with a bit of respect and then youll deserve some in return since the csm process began ive seen nothing but cynicism and snippy oneliners from you on the process and game experience of those candidates who went on to win the election and frankly you can jump in the lake for my money dont lecture me about eves cold harsh unforgiving environment thats the platform i ran the election on thats the consistent position ive been arguing and advocating in every meeting online and facetoface and thats the precise issue i spent 20 hours in discussion with the ccp officials promoting and brainstorming during the iceland trip the difference between you and me rule is that at the end of this six months im going to have a voting record showing i kept my word and did exactly what i promised id do whereas youll still be sat on the sidelines throwing your toys out of the pram and saying its all a waste of time because some other players in the game care about things you dont think are importantand dont try to claim some kind of piratecorp wellspring of information on all things dark and dangerous  ive been there experienced these things played the small unit pvp game for five years and learned enough about this environment to make informed decisions and cast votes for the benefit of this style of gameplay in the formal environment of the csmif you want things done in this csm then you need to count your blessings that you got some csm reps who understand these issues and are prepared to go the extra mile to make things happen rather than stamping your foot like a spoiled brat and making wild accusations against those that actually care about the gameplay styles you claim to valueyou dont think the bio length and fw impact on the storyline are important to this game frankly screw you but fortunately im not such a shortsighted prejudiced player as you evidently are i can appreciate a game environment where longer biographiesbetter dynamic rp storyline and reformation of the omnipotent local chat problem both have a place on the csm agenda and however much i think you are a knuckledragging whinger for attacking the decisions that other players care about its not going to prejudice me against the things that you and other players care about too
ill make sure i put this into my soontobe unnerfed bioalsotldr
what a predictable answerjust a shame you prove his point completely right
there should be a very own forum for posts regarding factional warfare at the moment most posts seem to be moved to caod which in no manner seems optimal with its own forum pilots would perhaps be more inclined to post griefing whining etc which gives us that great community feeling  tm

why one caldari ship needs a bigger drone bay
omg yes i soooooo hate having to reset my overview on a weekly basis because some lag issue sync issue or bugged login fraged or outright deleted my overview settingsyes yes yes
long overdue
omg yes
raised the issue and it was supported by the csm i think our best idea was probably some kind of variety freight container that mimics the performance of a ship maintenance bay on a cap ship ie allows assembled fits inside but no cargo youd then load these transit freight containers into the freighter and bingo anyway well be adding it to the formal agenda for the discussions with ccp and fingers crossed
ccp needs to introduce a new storage container specifically designed to carry assembled shipsship transportation can 120k m3 and can carry a fully assempled ship assembled ships should maintain the same volume as they do when packaged but can only be transported using a transport can  ie with a freighter  the can has the same limitations as a carrier only ammodrones can be in the cargo of the ship being transported
maybe we should start a questions pile  simple yesnosoon answers only required from ccp
this seems like it should be pretty simple to give a 1 3 and 5 bonus to the time it takes to get prints out of the oven or some such i definitely support this thread ccp should not be allowed to forget about this issue for over a year
an update would be good
my name is displayed and i approve this message  
it would be good to see closure for this issue
id like too see this fixed
yup got the 1 version plugged in and would really like it to do something worthwhile
just another perfect example of ccps promises made  ccps promises kept and what ccps interpretation of soon means
yeah would be nice to have this little implant in my head do something besides using up a slot
i petitioned and got the implant removed it is in a can somewhere honestly a invention speed plant seem pretty useless but anything is better than nothing
bump for love

i continue to like some implementation of the command center idea along with adjustments in the wardec cost in some waypersonally i see no issue with the system accumulating the combat sp of each character in the corps  you could just sum gunnery and missiles for example  and skewing the fee accordingly fighting your equal costs x amount fighting your inferior costs x times 2 and fighting your superior costs x divided by 2 etc numbers to be decided by ccpyou could even make it more complicated and factor character age and wealth in rich industrialists should be able to hire protection after all after all only ccp needs to know all this data  you as a declarer just get an isk value and its not going to lag much since how often are wars declaredon top of that you could have as an option to halve your wardec cost at the cost of no podding  remember this is a bribe to concord so just as ship security hits are less than podding security hits they can take no podding wars less seriously and so charge less  this enables honourable pirates to work more cheaply  yes they do exist  allows you to teach a lesson inexpensively and so on you can still do the real thing if you want tocorphopping is only lame to the person who cant find targets i believe lowsec and nullsec are full of potential targets many of whom can fight back its an intended and provided way to escape a war you dont care about or wish to fight if you stopped just declaring on every corp because of personal vendettas your problem would be solvedi believe ccp made a point of saying that continued grief towards a particular individual again and again is not on
war decs need to be looked at to be suremost notably against npc corporations in which the scourge of macros hide there are zero deterrants to force these violators out into the open  such as limited skill availabilities mission agents and ship types also and much much much more importantwar flags should be persistant on a perpilot basis to bring an end to corpalliance jumping to escapeavoid a warshould an individial quit a corp after the declaration has been placed they will still be a valid war target through the duration of that declaration cycle  1 week  if they join another player corp that corp does not assume the war but can defend the target once they have been engaged by the valid aggressorlikewise with corporations fleeing alliances to dodge a war declarationthis will cement corporation solidarity once players know that quitting their corpalliance will not make them invulnerable to the war
i wish i could vote twice lol
its my understanding that chribba has some isk so i will support this thread for 50 million isk  price can be negotiated  up anyways   alternatively i will not support this thread for 150 million isk  non negotiable 
so how did the discussion goedit nevermind found the transcript of the chat herelooks like its back to the drawing board
well the bad news is that the csm initially voted it down 1841 after discussion the issue was supported by lavista jade dierdra val opposed by hardin bane inanna tusko serenity ankhowever tusko does want another attempt to get the issue onto the table with a more detailed proposal that hes working on and we should get to vote on that prior to the end of august online meeting with ccpim disappointed we couldnt get the issue in principle on the agenda last sunday but as you can see from the meeting chatlog there are quite split opinions on the issue i however remain convinced its a vital issue and we need it raised to ccp so am eagerly looking forward to tuskos take on the problem
thanks for the answerfrom the transcript i see that possibly 2 votes may reverse provided the proposed implementation becomes more attractivewhere is the current proposal  the document  published andor being discussed
have to say no to this oneno local  very very empty universe not only do the locals not know whos come into the system unless they task some poor slub to stare at the gate s  in infinitum but the hostiles dont know if theres anyone there to bother withthis leaves both parties stuck spamming their scan buttons hoping for a hit before they show up on the other guys scan spameven in empire space this would leave eve full of solo pilots because thats how they would feel wherever they went when their only visal contact with other players would be at gates or stations
carebears love their local i guess if you allready have 10 alts in hulks in a belt it would be hard to manage 11 in a scout ship how about we remove local and get a save function implementet endofflamehaving something like a multispec probe that detects new ships in system would definitly be enough to replace local as it is now then again if you have a probe doing exactly what local did why get rid of itor you enable a local chat for alliances who hold sov in system ie u got a system scanner at your pos and your sov local shows you all people in system introduce some sort of hacking module allowing enemy players to link onto the system scanner for 1030 sec hacking should be detectable though just some ideas
the problem isnt that local is so powerful its that the scanner sucks so badremoving local in its current form without making the proper fixes to the scanning system would be a huge mistake if i had five minutes to come up with a better solution heres what i would do1  highsec  nothing at all social channels in 5 systems should remain as they are the only parties to be affected by a change here would be corporations at war but in this case they shouldnt be given any additional penaltiesbenefits while in an otherwise high security area2  lowsec  only show pilots with standings in local  positive or negative neutrals boost the population counter but their portraits dont appear on the local toolbar until they speak in local are scanned or seen on grid this will place more emphasis on personal relationships as well as keeping better track of who your friends and enemies are3  nullsecno sovereignty  local population count only no portraits appear in local until they speak are scanned or appear on grid this would boost player interaction by hailing new pilots in system to give them an opportunity to reveal themselves as friendly or not a threat scanners get pings that show gate activation 4  nullsecsovereignty  in systems where your alliance has sov the intel displayed in local approaches that of highsec but only for your alliance leaving attacking forces would be at a severe disadvantage forces enemies scouts to be more diligent about collecting intel also boosts the importance of having sovereignty
i completly agree local chat should get either removed or just not show who is inside the system i have nothing not previously said to add though
i support destruction of outpost with the fact that the attacker doesnt recieve anything maybe some salvage just make it so that when alliance clicks terminate button on an outpost it should let all the processes in it finish and then he has to click that button again to finalize it sov may not change hands during that time
so if i thumbs up here it means im not supporting getting a reload all or switch all ammo button where do i go for that
i endorse this but perhaps with some modificationssomeone once suggested linking weapons into weapon groups that could be loaded and unloaded as a single unit they would also fire as a single unit linked to a single f keythis would reduce the server calls from 8 individual weapons down to 1 or 2
supported i used to have a machariel but since the dps and the reload stuff after 10 shots is well  end of it  i bought a nightmare
not supportedlike is said in all the anti nano threads dont like it train a different race tough cookiesor maybe bring all your other ship classes down a notch or two so when a roaming gang enters the system it isnt all minmatar shipsthen maybe then minmatar bss will be deserving of a boostyouve got the best ships for all forms of pvp except fleet fights take your cake and enjoy it

agreed but not only for large artyfor all artilleryrailguns do more dps from greater distances and have 13 the rof okay so they use cap but when it comes to long range combat cap is not so much an issue
one needs way more than a 5 clip increase 5 would increase your ammo count on emp l from 10 rounds to 105artillery needs to be boosted in all ways
i agree that artillery should be looked ati dont agree with the solutions that many of the players have suggested some of these demands seem to suggest that arty should hit dps as hard as missiles no hitbox style weapon should do the same damage as missiles not without the same kind of hefty drawbacks that missiles  especially big missiles  suffer in pvp
wow didnt think this many people would reply to this thread lol have you all the story i wrote about them they could work i mean there are gas clouds in the game that do damage at random intervals so why not space creatures
i like it needs to be fleshed out a bit but its good shouldnt be difficult to create in the game eitherwindjammer
a lot of people are forgetting to tick the boxawesome idea do it ccp
stupid boxread your version of the story top to bottom a creature that can create its own warp tunnel can manipulate gravity pretty daftly id assume so when it comes to space whales defending themselves there ya goheres a bit of fiction to make it go round in a fun way for those who find themspace whales were originally conceived just after the collapse as a way to preserve the information of the early civilizations in a form that wouldnt be tied to the human destiny not only do space whales travel all over the place but they also store any information they acquire into internal biologic datacoresspace whales have grown to consider humans very primitive since they can warp around without spaceships and dont use missiles which cant hit nanos going faster than 88ksif you kill a space whale you get whatever you can salvagehacklootif you watch a space whale your standings with the space whales goes up if you watch long enough they start dropping items for you like hints to be less technologically decrepit if you attack someone who has aggressed the space whale your standings go up moremaybe evenspace whale is an interactive agent who will give you new bookmarks to their location if they like youspace whale watching pirates

good luck though i defiantly support the change despite what ccp has said however i expect no changes
yes please
supported but only for non capital ships ie only blackops
i vote in favor of information while the little stories are fun and ive especially appreciated the most recent four about the current leaders of the factions i would love to see some actual background information be published

supporting a windjammer thread on both counts

yeah me too please
i raised this one to the csm but it was rejected discussion notes here
wardeccing a fw corp should have one result youve wardecced the entire malitia end of story the only advantage is that you can jump into the militias space without the npcs jumping all over youif two corps within a milita choose to wardec each other both should be removed from the milita until their wars are concluded whereupon they can rejoin without any negative standingcivil disagreements between members of a military command are not uncommon and taking it outside the milita is a logical and acceptable response
i like it
id support this if it was just a request to treat militias as alliances so to declare war on you i have to declare war on the alliance as a wholeor alternatively just set members of the matar militia to sec status 10 thats an incharacter solution that pretty much solves all current fw problemsanyway the op solution looks unecessarily complex and may have odd consequences when fw corps are inevitably allowed into alliances
i agree with much of the post 00 is simply brokenjump frieghters are even more broken they should cost less than a carrier as they have absolutely no use whatsoever beyond hauling crap a carrier can fight a rorqual can mine a jump freighter can do nothing
all points supported
this kind of leadership is why i voted for lavista this is the single most important issue in eve  besides the omnipresent lag  i am 100 in support of removing tech 1 loot from missions
dont see it as a nerf of course there should go something in place maybe mission wrecks could yield more salvage the reason this should be done would be to free the t1 and mineral market from the npc aspect right now npcs have a large influence on the market i think that is no good
thats sort of like saying that taxes are a horizontal redistribution of wealthwhats the point salvage is only good if you can sell it it cant be reprocessed for example and most salvage is crap the only really good salvage are things like armor plates melted caps and tungsten alloy bars and theyre only good because they can be turned into rigs that are in high demand further more if you did remove t1 drops and someone where to enter your mission and salvage your wreaks youre left with nothing at all and with no way of taking revenge on those who steal your wrecksand id rather not see an aggro timer added to the act of salvaging wrecks that are not yoursum no the reason the mineral market is ed up isnt because people are running missions and selling t1 loot its messed because mineral distribution was designed at a time when most minerals were bought by npcs on the market providing a bottom  rather then a cap  to market prices all markets have npc components in real markets these take the form of governments international agreements and regulations
yes for removing unnamed t1 loot but the higher metalevels should stay and be nonrefinable  or 10 trit   however i am not sure on the compensation for mission runners maybe more salvage would be good i see it as best option
a firm yes for removing the unnamed tech i loot from the drop tables but  in particular  possibly leaving the named gear drops alone
worst idea ive ever heard as a new player who decided after a few trial accounts to be an industrialist i joined an empire mission runner corp and make ammo and missiles presently for this corp the two minerals that cannot be mined in hi sec is zydrine and megacyte and the asteroids that these minerals come from are predominately found in null sec zyrdine and megacyte are also the most expensive per unit minerals not freely available in hi sec when i start making ships i will have to buy large quantities of these minerals so the only way around this for our corp to come up with these minerals is to reprocess t1 loot and for my corp mates to supply these to me this will only offset some of the mineral costs to make battleships etc if you remove t1 loot you see an explosion in the price of these minerals and to whos benefit definitely not empire players
remove meta0 items from the loot tables  ie the items built using bpos  but not the meta1 thru 4 items faction or officer itemsif loot drops are removed then all rats must drop other refinables as drones do now otherwise the market will suffer dramatically due to the complete loss of mid and high end mineralsi will have to vote no
i would look at something like this from the point of view of who it benefits and who it would hurt the established industrialist  more items to make  sell  the starter or midterm industrialist  more items to make  sell  miners  this would drive up the demand for minerals  mission runners  less haulage required of the loot drops  the starter or midterm industrialist  the big boys would still be able to make these items and undercut them  hobbyist industrialist  who use the mins recovered from reprocessing to make what they need  new player experience  i loved the process of discovering mods that did new things or improved on standard mods i already had  mission runners  less loot to sell  miners  the increase in prices would make mining bots more attractive to run one other thing that occurs to me  why should pc ships drop loot when npc ships dont a question that would need answering if this went aheadi am essentially a missionrunner by trade but even so i can see some merit in this proposal and think some of the negatives can be addressed by the ops suggestions care needs to be taken though that all sides of this farreaching issue  far bigger than just making life rosier for the industrialists  are looked at before making a decision definitely if the loot is removed it needs to become more accessible to make itacquire it in other ways i do like the idea of bpcs for the named t1 drops to populate npcs instead thoughi do have faith in the csm guys for the most part and im sure that lavv will do the proper thing here when he presents it  
good analysis but yes its not the intention to grief mission runners we need to find a good middleground so that mission runners arent cheated out of profit yet i think its a bit silly since mission running is about the only profession that is 100 to get a fixed income without risk 
i have some trouble with lavista suggestionsadd lp to compensatemore salvage to compensatetranslate immediately inreduce further the value of lpmake most salvage practically worthless and get more already worthless salvage beside the make rigs cost nothingso even if he dont want to nerf missions rewards it is the exact result of his suggestion he is a expert industrialist and market player for what i get so i find a bit strange that he is not seeing the effect of his suggestions on the lp and salvage market this kind of change cant be implemented alone it need to be part of a well thought plan where most  possibly all  of the aftereffects are considered remove rat drops what will be the effect on 00 production  will be that the right time to introduce a capital mining ship specialized in low end mining so that 00 producers can get the low ends without the need to import from high sec what will be the effect on mining and mineral prices how will change the mineral production minerals available through mining are an inflexible quantity  the volume of minerlas spawned at dt is fixed  while the rat drops are extensible the higher the number of mission runners the higher the quantity of minerals as the eve population is growing it is better a extensible source or a fixed source requiring people to move further out to gather it and so on
may i please point out that they were just suggestion a suggestion can be used in a provoking context in order to gain feedback or a better idea this is the case hereim not a mission runner so im really looking for opinions from people as for what could make up for the removal of t1 lootim fairly well aware about how supply and demand works i will admit however that i dont have much idea about the specifics and history of the lp value remember just because i suggest it it doesnt mean that will be how it will be suggested please help me out for how we can make this work out for everybody
my problem is that you are making it a suggestion in several forums always making it as it was something with a simple causeeffect chain without any secondary effect i have already pointed out this thread remove loots t1 where several peoples have discussed this same topic you dont seem to have read it beyond the page where you have posted as pointed in the post above  included a few noted added after eating and before seeing your reply  what will be the consequences on mineral prices mineral availability in high sec  mission drops are a expanding source asteroid are a source with a fixed amont  mining more bots less minerals available for new players less mineral for players logging in in the last hours before dt 00 mining rats are a good source of minerals with way less risk than mining ops for veldspater  00 minerals importations player rewards any alternate resource convertible in isk will see a huge loss in worth in a very brief time as it will become oversupplied in no time so if it is priced at the current level of value the reward loss will be large but increasing the straight isk injection will be even worse as it will overflow the market with isk with a heavy inflation following it  if the drops are removed only from mission rats it will become a huge imbalance if they are removed from beltexploration rats what will be the alternate reward the same for the mission rat or a different oneat some of these question the other thread has tried to give a reply but the first and more important thing to see is that a single issue that will affect only the t1 production and the t1 loots but a very complex question with far reaching effects
i can understand venkul mul quite wellanything you do do compensate the mission runners for lost t1 loot will have a detrimental effect in the endthe only option is to increase mission payout  wither direct reward or bounties  the problem is loot is not guaranteed but bounties are so you make the mission runner more profitable with a fixed increase while t1 loot was chance based
unsignedremoving unnamed t1 loot would seriously affect several major professions that rely heavily on reprocessing unwanted loot into minerals profiteers and marketeers who play the market and act as checkbalance to minershaulers and couriers who make a living picking up their contracts of regionwide purchasessmallscale industrialists and pvpers who manufacture their own supplies out of reprocessed junkthe new players who will build up most of their initial isk not in bounties or rewards but in selling off lootif anything the problem is that the named market is oversaturated making the reprocessed value of meta 0 loot more valuable than most of the lowmeta named goods in my humble opinion named loot should be removed from highsec entirely and dropped as bpcs only in lowsec or as modules in nullsec while the toptier named  scouts arbalests rolled tungsten etc  only drop their bpcs in nullsec in addition i think bpcs for faction loot  currently only available from lp stores or from traders  should be added to fw and plex loot tablesremoving t1 loot will not serve to help anyone but the mining guilds and bots changing the availability of the named goods and putting more influence on the manufacturing element will expand the opportunities for pilots to choose their professions and create new demand for minerals courier contracts manufacturing slots and trade goods
i would love to see this and its should be a relatively minor changeit would vastly help miners and industrial characters while revitalizing the marketsive mined quite a lot and even done some manufacturing and frankly it sucksthis would help alot

this comment concerns meif you remove the loot aspect in favour of greater salvage it seems to make the salvage aggro argument more viable for the mission runners im not against dropping different loot than t1 items but i would be against thisif you want to change whats dropped fine you have to think about who is grabbing the loot however ccp will never change the dynamic of whats dropped if you award more lp simply because someone else grabbing it up would get little benefit from it they recognize that there are more than just the mission runner to contend withnow if youre looking to augment the loot drops with something new and exciting viable to any player who comes along and nabs it thats a different storyall that being said what do you see as being a viable change to t1 loot drops what will you put in that can and who benefit from it
removing tech 1 not the named stuff from loot drops has my supportedit i think people are missing a point the bounties on rats can be increased slightly to compensate for the t1 loot being removed so instead of getting a 600k bs one will get 650k etc overall this will have beneficial effect even if at first some might experience a slight shock
so you want the insurance to go away because it will make the victim feel better um the victim has had hisher ass handed to them what kind of crap is that you do not seem to get it taking the insurance away will not fix the problem you will still see suicide ganking and you will see it just for the lulz are you that naivete to think it will curb anythingthe guy getting ganked is going to be ed no matter what and no fact of removing insurance from the ganker is going to make him feel any better if there needs to be a balance then fine give the tools to the haulers and such to give them a better chance for survival beef up the frigging targets allow the gankee to have the opportunity to better his ship and the ones that dont are the ones no one will feel sorry for they are the same ones that auto pilotthis way you are not messing with mechanics to solve an issue you are giving the players the chance to protect themselves now the gankee can feel good about the fact hesheit took steps to thwart the attack that is a win ganker nada the gankers pride costs more the the ship and the sec hit makes the attack not worth itso now you will see the real gankers and the ones that think its too hard will go away hurting them financially will not stop it
in order to clue someone in you have to have one everything in this thread is a response for the most part to the op which outlines ccps belief that the suicide gank mechanics are too biased towards the ganker and what the plans are to balance this you couldnt have missed the general theme by such a wide margin unless you intended toyour playstylex is too easily killing playstyley and therefore needs adjustment concord other police and the sec rating of a solar system should have a little more meaning than being the butt of the suicide gankers jokethe planned changes are tackling the heart of the problem these changes are neither a bandage or a knee jerk reaction they are a well considered and studied cure being carried out by a ccp task force in response to a problem that has needed one for quite some timeyoure in one of the proudest and most notable alliances in the game your character is 5 freaking years old you should be dealing in 100s of million and billion isk suicide ganks and youre seriously going to tell us youre worried about the small time i just want to blow something up i dont care what gankswindjammer
so if you were to kill a hulk in a 07 ice field youd have to spend 4 whole hours ratting to regain your sec status you poor thing ever wonder how long it takes a miner in high sec to earn isk to purchase a hulk and outfit it insurance pay out on that t2 barge is a joke compared with the cost of the ship you have to rat for 4 hours the miner has to mine weeks to purchase another barge and thats only if he has access to another hulk to do it with your 4 hours isnt spitadditionally you might try mining for four hours and see how it compares to 4 hours of ratting thatll have you bashing your head against a wall in realitywindjammer
if youre a soldier on an interdiction mission you should be choosing your targets well and with intelligence the insurance in such cases is a small fraction of your gain however if a soldier goes to another country and commits a crime its still a crime even though he may be a hero in his own country as such there are penalties and there are gainsif your actions are of value to your corp your corp will have no problem with the concept of reimbursing you for your trouble and expense as far as your sec hit goes well i guess taking one for the team is something you might learn to take pride in i seem to recall a certain freighter in or around oursulaert that got blown up by a group of your alliance mates it contained many billions of isk in ships and modules destined for your enemies at the time i didnt hear a single whine from anyone only congratulations to the suicide gankers the plans ccp has will not effect that sort of suicide gank in any waywindjammer
your post is the result of being misinformed let me help you out1  the op of this thread is not a proposal it is an announcement of plans ccp has to implement the proposal brought to them by the csm it appears ccp was already making the plans well before the csm brought them the proposal2  last time i looked the thread containing the initial proposal had 155 thumbs up3  the 25 figure you quote is in cases where nobody on the csm wants to escalate a proposal to a meeting with ccp in such cases if a proposal receives approval from a number of subscribers equal to or greater than 25 of the voters who voted in the last csm election the csm is forced to bring the proposal before ccp whether they want to or not4  a proposal may be brought to vote at a csm meeting by any member of the csm where it will be voted upon for escalation to a ccpcsm meeting a simple majority of the csm is all that is necessary to escalate twentyfive percent of the voters isnt necessary5  the planned actions are of ccps design not ashensi hope this clears up a few things for you always glad to help a troubled travelerwindjammer
yes
good pointdont forget that most piratey groups dont have access to secure 00 as such their ships are constantly at risk and you have not 4 hours of mining that is serene 99 of the time but 4 stressfilled hours and i doubt your statement that it takes weeks to gather the money for a hulk i have known people that have raked in 80 mil a day mining easily
i dont think it would either neither does ccp the call for it is an attempt to balance not an attempt to lash out by increasing the penalties for the suicide ganker it is reasoned that frivolouscasual suicide ganks will be reduced even those wont be eliminated and the serious suicide ganks wont be touchedwith increased penalties the suicide ganker will be more inclined to calculate the relative gain versus cost of his activity rather than simply blowing the crap out of everything because hes bored or doesnt like the name of that character that just went bywindjammer
youre telling us that suicide gankers wouldnt howl like a herd of banshees with their tails caught in a tornado if you gave haulers freighters and mining barges a practical way to defeat high sec suicide ganks really i think its safe to say the gankers would be much happier with ccps present plansif ive read your proposal correctly it would spell the effective elimination of high sec suicide ganking personally i dont think that would be a good thing for evewindjammer
the thing is though the cost of ganking even without insurance is always going to be a fraction of the potential reward4 years ago when the cost of a cruiser was a significant investment and insurance was pretty much a joke fittings expensive and targets relatively low value people still suicide gankedwhybecause they find it funnow isk is readily available targets are potentially very juicy and ships are comparitively cheap  removing insurance is not going to make people stop doing something they find fun even without insurance the cost of a suicide gank will be covered by killing the npcs it takes to recover the security status  loot is just a bonusif your goal is to reduce deaths to ganks this is not the way to goif your goal is to stop people whining that it isnt fair then i can understand why ccp are looking at itif you want to reduce ganking you need to make it harder not more costlyif you think i say all this because i favour ganking then i suggest you look back on my posts in other threads about this subjectif i favoured it i wouldnt have proposed things like ablative defences for ships  a huge hp buffer to shields or armour  or both  but which can only be repaired in a station at a repair facility if you get attacked you are likely to survive but will have to pay to have your defences repairedthat is a way to balance risk and reward make suicide ganking less of a worry for the individual pilot and to reward players who proactively seek to protect themselvesremoving insurance does nothing to lower the risks for potential victims  if they are attacked they are still going to die the ganker is still going to have fun and the victim is still going to be sitting in their pod cryingthe proposal does not tackle the issue not matter how much you want to think it wouldlook at pvp combat in general i fly almost exclusively t2 ships so i am in a position to know what it is like to be basically uninsured if i lose a ship then there is far less prospect of me recovering my losses from gathering loot than a suicide ganker has and yet i fly them all the timedoes it make economical sense is it profitableno of course not  but it is a hell of a lot of funi am happy to absorb the cost of loss to be able to play the game in the way i enjoy and it is exactly the same for suicide gankersthis is a proposal to punish not to balance and so i respectfully disagree with you
dont forget that most high sec miners dont have access to 00 either you do not know anyone who has raked in 80 mil in a day of high sec miningwhich is the type of mining i specified if they raked in that much they were in low sec or 00 miners down there have a little stress too you know also thats still a full day of mining versus 4 hours of ratting even if they do have access to 00talk to your friends and ask them about the particulars of that 80 million were they mining solo what sec were they in how many hours did it take themwhat is this complaing you have about 4 hours of stress anyway i thought you scum of the earth suicide gankers liked that sort of thingwindjammeryoure kidding scum is a filtered word
this guy is lying when he says high sec mining is worth 10milhr then or you are saying that 8hrs is more than a dayim confused
but haulers freighters and mining barges do have a practical way of defeating highsec suicide ganks its called playing the game  and in case of freighters scouting  and minimizing ganker profitsthe fact the greedy bastards try to make cash afk and without taking neccesary precautions  because theyre in highsec  is something different afk play should be risky someone stripmining highsec belts in a hulk should be at risk  you can argue the hulk needs to be tougher so you need a bc to suicide one well maybe  people suiciding them for the lols will always happen because well with a multibillion wallet i can afford suiciding a few t1 cruisers even without insurance payouts as do many older players  10 prevents me from getting to highsec else id be suicide ganking idiots in t1 haulers myself  the security hit  and need to go fix it after suiciding  is what prevents you from just going to jita 44 buying 30 cruisers and suiciding yourself all day long for most the time spent is the real penalty there anywayalso dont give me the boo time for hulk  suicide ganking is uncommon enough that the average hulk has probably paid itself five times over before it got ganked my lowsec  pirate  ships are under risk of destruction all the time and i generally get to pay about 23 times their value before they explode  didnt have a ship outlast premium insurance ever  so the highsec hulk still has a better return on the investment  albeit over a longer time frame but also at lower risk ships are tools which inevitably die how much they earn for you before they die is what counts treating ships in any other way is for carebears which seriously dont get eve
thats in a 610 hour day in high sec  with the hulk you just ganked when it only takes minutes for the 00 suicide ganker to recover his isk losses by ratting thats just a wee tad unbalanced
you dont seem to get it for you let me spell it out in basic wordsgankers do not want anything to change because it will hurt them and help the person being ganked by having insurance void if they are killed by concord it will hurt them financially the gankers do not want thatif it actually cost them isk then it will cost them it will curb the suicide ganks for lulz that happens all the timehey joe there is a hulk mining in a belt in a 05 lets go suicide gank himbut bill what possible loot could we get from itwho cares it costs us nothing and will be funny to destroy something that he worked hard to getbut then he will have kill rights on usand what come back and maybe have a shot at destoying our insured ships we still lose nothing again and we get the opportunity to kill him again without concord showing up to help us get our insuranceyour right bill its his own fault for learning how to save his iskyarrrrr overload your t1 guns so we can kill him faster and with less people yarrrrrr
he cant recover the sec status in minutes thoughyou really must try to look at the whole picture
ahaha thats not balance thats catering insurance right now is balanced and fair because it is blind to the circumstances your ship blew up in once you start adding circumstances to which you do not get the payout you start making it cater to a specific group of people which isnt fair or balanced unless of course you mean balanced by it fits my playstyle for example a balanced change would be to remove the plat level insurance entirely to decrease isk injection into the game what about people fitting ships for pvp almost never having the insurance expire on those ships because they almost always get blown up or people self destructing ships for plat insurance because somone is selling them so low its profitable insurance doesnt make sense realistically in this game however it is a game and it doesnt have to make any sense or be a profitable venture making the system cater would go against the sandbox nature of this game increasing options to the victim and maybe his escort would expand the sandbox nature of the game i am strongly opposed to any change that reduces the sandbox or multiplayer nature of the gameavon is essentially right about the reduction of insurance wont stop suicide ganking but it will change what ships suicide gank in probably push it more to the t1 high dps cruisers and battle cruisers like the vexorthoraxbrutix setups essentially the isk loss is the same as the isk lost in a gank battleship with insurance
i will say hes lyingwith all relevent skills at 4 hulk t2 strips t1 crystals single account i can make 5m an hour in belts where the roids survive more than 3 cyclesif you consider that hulk with its rigs and equipment costs just under 300m that is a long time mining the only time it undocks anymore is when i need some trit and there isnt anything close at a decent price i make a lot better iskies running level 3 missionsnow if you have all skills maxed multiple accounts and a hauler yes you can make that much run the numbers with 5 accounts  4 max hulks and one t2 hauler  and you can meet that but a single miner without maxed skills cant get anywhere nearnow if you want the attacker to spend the same time getting his security up as it takes me to replace that ship im all for it i think that is a touch extreme though ratting is only a bit better than mining is
screaming about people afking is total bs and you know it they will suicide gank if the guy is afk or not so stop trying to play that card
i am saying let the players play the game and give them the opportunity leave it in the players hands to set the balance its not a guarantee to stop the attack but if the player chooses to use some brain cells then their chance of survival will increase it is up to the player to fail or to succeed it called playing the gameit will not wipe out suicide ganking at all it will only increase the immersion and what the hell is wrong with practical any way
no it is not bs you saying it is shows how little knowledge you have in this subject if someone is flying atk and using wtz a suicide ganker does not have time to scan and fire on the jumpin side of the gate a fast ganker might have time to scan or fire but not both what flying atk does is make it much more difficult for a suicide ganker to perform his trade you are still vulnerable to multipeople dedicated camps but you are virtually immune from any lone suicide ganker and even a dualboxing ganker flying atk and using wtz is the number one most important thing to do when hauling it does not remove the risk for suicide ganking but it does mitigate it substancially
ccp is taking steps to balance suicide ganking get over it man
translation i dont know what the hell im talking about but i think ccp is on my side so it doesnt matter
lol your losing your isk button get over itanyways last couple pages of this thread is like the same 45 ppl so i think take my leave and let other people commentlaters
good idea youve certainly managed to show how you when called on your lack of knowledge will take your ball and go home its the lack of knowledge about how suicide ganks work displayed here excellently by marlona that is making this debate so hard to follow and so important to conclude it has become increasingly obvious that the people calling for a nerf dont really know what goes on in a suicide gank several of them have experienced suicide ganks as the victim and speak more from an emotional and vindictive standpoint than a rational one rationality seems to have taken a real dip as even ccp in the op fails to be rational claiming that devs have come to the realization that suicide ganking mechanics today are imbalanced in favor of the ganker this is irrational because the mechanics are the same as before
i agree loss of insurance alone will not be an effective dissuasion thats why there are other changes in the overall balance plan when you add loss of insurance and the other planned changes together you get an effective package that will disuade the casual suicide ganker and bring some balance back to the situationas you point out the loss of insurance is a minor issue for suicide gankers this means it wont hurt them to lose it but it will help balance the mechanics of suicide ganking when loss of insurance is added to the other components of the overall balance planthank you for clarifying your stance on suicide ganking i was having a difficult time understanding why someone such as yourself would favor such an activityas it happens i like your proposals and would prefer them as well as similar ones the problem with them is that they would virtually eliminate the ability of suicide gankers to do what they do provide haulers freighters and mining barges with a practical way to survive suicide ganks suicide gankers would howl up a firestorm of complaint the changes ccp plans are an approach from the other end of the problem yes but its an approach that wont eliminate suicide ganking like yours would it is therefore more palatable to suicide gankers and the general populace of evewindjammer
well first of all its not a proposal i know thats what assembly hall is for but ccp decided to put the results of ccpcsm meetings in here as well the op of this thread is an announcement of what ccp has planned in response to the bias of mechanics currently favoring suicide gankers this is similar to threads started to discuss planned changes made in dev blogs and threads started to discuss changes that have been made after the release of a patch or updateagain loss of insurance is just a single part of the overall plan and by itself will not stop suicide ganking in fact none of the changes will nor will the entire plan when implemented with all the changes the plan contains thats a major point in favor of the planned changes and a major point of consideration when the plans were made and in their continued refinementsuicide ganking is recognized as an important part of eve as such the desire is not to eliminate it rather the desire is to create a situation in which suicide ganking takes a bit more thought and consideration regarding gain and loss the idea is to reduce easy griefing suicides not eliminate suicide ganking from the landscapewindjammer
yes this guy is either lying or badly mistaken if you want verification of this look at what he said about mission running ten million iskhour running level 4 missions everyone whos run them can tell you thats way lowthe highest income i made in a single day of mining in high sec was with a hulk it was of course fitted with t2 strips running t2 crystals and i had upgrades in the low slots mining foreman trained to level 5 and exhumer trained to level 5 for the boosts i was mining omber then because it was paying extremely well at the time i earned a bit over 50 million that day but it took me 14 hours of continuous mining and i had a continuous and uncontested supply of omber to mine no im not kidding and i do not use scripts i did not take breaks i ran to the bathroom between cycles of the lasers and ate while mining i did it because i had an entire system loaded with omber there werent any other barges in the system  very strange day  and i wanted to see if i could get it all there were a lot of belts in that system and i didnt get all of it but i almost did let me tell youfourteen hours of that    is nuts i will never do it againso when i say there is no way a miner in high sec can rake in 80 million isk in a day i speak from experience not from speculation the only way a miner could possibly do that would be to mine for maybe the entire 23 hours of the up time i dont see that as something somebody is going to do unless theyre running a script and even then i have serious doubts as to it being possiblewindjammer
ah but your suicide ganker is actually making isk while getting his standing back maybe we should change 00 rats to return only standing and it would then be fair trade
youre new to the discussion or you would have realized the context of my post was ship modifications bonuses new types of modules of specific value to industrialist ships higher resists more armor more shield more structure more slots for those ships better fitting ability etc the context was not tacticsthe planned changes are not being implemented to protect people using bad tactics they are being created to protect those using good tactics who arent getting the level of protection they should in a high sec system theres no tactic to protect you from blind suicide ganking that nails you before you come out of black screen or before the grid loads no amount of scouting is going to stop a suicide gank of your freighter in high sec  you dont know who youre scouting for in high sec bit different from the situation you have in 00 and low sec further if youd read my earlier posts youd see i do not support people who play afk while piloting ships loaded with expensive itemsas far as i know the hulk is already tough enough that it takes at least a bc to suicide it in high sec if it could be done with a cruiser the problem would be even greater than it isthe plans are to make the suicider pay for hisher giggles and therefore cut down on the frequency im happy for you that you have a multi billion isk wallet many in the game do not have that even so the loss of insurance will not be enough to stop them and that is why loss of insurance is only a part of the whole planned package the increase in sec hit should be of particular interest to you given what youve saidif high sec suicide ganking of exhumers were as uncommon as you suggest ccp wouldnt be making the planned changes you can thank jihadswarm for highlighting the weakness in game mechanicsi get the impression youre more than a little out of touch with high sec and what goes on therewindjammer
it is not catering it is balance ccp understands that todays suicide gank mechanics are too biased in the gankers favor thats from the first sentence in the op of this thread and it can be read as meaning there is an imbalance that needs balancing catering would be to leave the current situation as is that would cater to the suicide gankers who are in it for the griefing content ohlook who im talking to of course you know all about griefingcontrary to what you say the planned changes are an effort to preserve the sandbox not to reduce it if you were really interested in the sandbox youd favor the planned changes since goonswarm has always been more interested in griefing than anything else im skeptical of your claimswindjammer
nothing is wrong with practical id prefer to be able to make the industry ships tougher what im saying is that if you offered the means to do it in a practical way youd have people using those means if people used those means suicide ganking would be virtually eliminated in high sec or become a rarity high sec suicide gankers would then have a legitimate beefthere really arent too many people that want suicide ganking to be impossible thats even stated in the first sentence of the op of this threadwindjammer
ohhhhhi see you and some of the people who agree with you are the only rational ones and we should only listen to what you have to say ccp the csm myself  of course  andoha whole bunch of other people who disagree with you are wrong and youre right because everyone else is irrational why didnt you say so before could have saved us all a lot of timewindjammer
ohhhhhi see you and some of the people who agree with you are the only rational ones and we should only listen to what you have to say ccp the csm myself  of course  andoha whole bunch of other people who disagree with you are wrong and youre right because everyone else is irrational why didnt you say so before could have saved us all a lot of timewindjammerno you should just try to be rational so far youre not as i said even ccp isnt very rational on this issue its irrational to try to fix something without first examining what the problem is we havent even had anyone stating exactly what the problem is in this or any other thread without mixing in opinions such as too much or too little give me a rational explanation of what the problem is pleasealso try to be rational enough to look at a game mechanic from all angles not just the one affecting your playstyle in this thread we have had people from different playstyles saying that the removal of insurance for suicide ganks is a bad kneejerk reaction to a much bigger problem this is an example of looking at the mechanic from several angles we have all come to the same conclusion the removal of insurance from suicide ganking is a bad fixthe reason i am posting in this thread is because i dont see the finality in ccps decision they havent changed anything until they actually do it i feel it is my duty as a player to try to make them see why it is a bad idea since the only reason they are even contemplating changing anything is the endless whining on the forums  as evidenced by the sudden realisation that there is a problem despite the fact that its the same mechanics as before  i feel it should be fairly easy to convince them otherwise
exactly i expect that under this system the pos will be used for practical purposes rather than for territory control itself so theyll only be set up for industry and base of operations purposes instead of as sovholders
nice proposal that moves broadly in the right direction i share some of the concerns over certain details but with a bit more balancing this should work
yarrr i agree the pilgrim just seems bugged as it looses the range bonus  which may have been logical in the nos age but is pointless now  without gaining another bonus to compensate
web range is exactly one of the issues did you even read the op postthe pilgrim should reflect in the same manner as its cousin the curse in the same ways that all force recon vessels reflect their respective combat recon cousins  simple as thatno thought went into the effect the nos nerf would have on this ship and it needs to be visitedif you really feel that there should be some ship that breaks the mold propose a new ship line because we pilgrim owners feel that it should reflect in like manner to the already established bar of force recon ships
20 effective capacitor for calculations of energy vampire drain amounts per level that would effectively remove the nos nerf from the pilgrim at lvl 5  unless i completely fail at grasping the nos functionality but you get my point just to add ideas 
did you even read my post webrange is not an issue to the way the pilgrim fights or it wouldnt be if you could actually run multiple neuts for a reasonable time  see earlier post  without a cap booster or lots of cap modsi am a pilgrim owner in fact i am recon 5 td skilled max cap skilled pilgrim owner and i dont know how long you have been a pilgrim owner but i have for over a year and it worked fine when before nos nerf inside webrange  with the same tank i have on it now incidentally  plate  single rep  the problem is that you cannot maintain your cap warfare and run some kind of local repair worth anything without using an injector or lots of cap mods which is why i proposed building a large cap battery into the ship which would give you enough cap to run an effective analogue to pre nosnerf pilgrimsalternatively another midslot and the gridcpu to fit a large cap battery in with an ab or a medium injector with an mwd and some more cargo space for charges would be nice
the first option is not a option at all it would completely eliminate the identity the pilgrim has and make it a useless nano ship which btw ccp has already expressed its interest in nerfingthe second option is the best of those two but it still wouldnt help unless you change the way noss work because you cant run them dry with a nos and when they have less cap than you you stop draining anyways i would rather remove the td bonus and add a 5 bonus to armour resistance altough this would make it a useless td boat it would make it much more tanky or just add some built in resistances to its armour
heres a fix that will remedy the pilgrim perfectlygive it the same bonus to fitting large nosneuts that logistics currently enjoy to fit large remote repsshieldenergy transfer  ie 8090 reduction in cpupg reqs for large nosneut increase cap and regen by 20this will give pilgrims more range  out to 25km wo resorting to faction  without modifying their current range bonuses and make them deadly in close range where theyre  apparently  designed to fight
totally agree  pigrim needs some love  of all recons its most useless now
yes i read your post and disagreed with it and as stated by op it is the only force recon ship to fight at the edge of webs its also the only force recon ship to not carry all the bonuses albeit reduced than their cousin combat recons your setup  fail over a year ago was a different age in combat and if you propose changes to fit within that construct it would be just as worthless as it is now simply give it the same bonuses at the established bar of the already existing force recon ships it has utility uniqueness and logic if carried through at that level  but it wouldnt be a better alternative to the cursea change to its bonuses to reflect that of its cousin would be enough to use but not enough to make it a better alternative to the curse your proposal restricts it to use in a manner that no other force recon has to endure and puts it at much higher risk as well
why did you ask if i had read the op then you do know that flying it at the edge of web range is not the only and often not the most effective way of flying itmy proposed changes restore it to its former combat effectiveness  and the one about extra mid yadda yadda would actually allow it to be used as it was once and give it new utility it doesnt have at the moment  with a range bonus it would become what the rapier is to the huginn nearly identical ship trade dps for cloakmy proposal keeps it in the spirit it was originally designed and see above for what you call different i propose a slight nudge to the current status quo to restore the ship to what it was you propose drastically changing it and thus the way it operates and is flownthe cloak allows you to pick targets and maybe you have to put a bit more thought in before decloaking on something rather than just oh well if it all goes pearshaped i can just rocket off at high speed
this is an assumption you have made nothing more it is incorrect not all ships are designed to fit both long and short ranged weapons hacs are even more specific here than usual theyre often designed with a single kind of fit in mind while bcs and bss are far more versatile when was the last time you saw an artillery vagabond if you think its hard fitting hams to a cerb you should try squeezing 720mms on a vagaseems absurd right thats because it is the cerberus is a mid to long ranged missile hac the eagle is a mid to long ranged turret hac both of those have a great deal of uses and if you cant figure them out jim then thats nobodys problem but your own the reason why people are telling you to train another race is because mid to long range is caldaris whole deal if youd like to object to that principle more generally start another thread about how caldari lacks close range high damage options  they dont ham drake w 3x bcu and a minimal tank its lulzerrific  this thread however is as jade said  unusually succinctly  terrible
signed the cerberus like the nighthawk is apparently balanced as a mission ship without a mwd  seriously the fitting required to upgrade to a proper dual lse or lsbinjector setup is almost exactly the fitting used by a mwd ii  this should be fixed to allow a tank similar to the other hacs considering the current pvp environment where mwds are mandatoryawesome especially if precision heavies get fixed so they arent completely useless but i get the feeling a lot of people will complain that this makes it too good and negates the flight time drawback missiles are balanced aroundyes but not because the cerberus has problems the kineticonly bonus on everything but the raven is just annoying and needs to be fixed but the cerberus isnt hurt any worse by this problem than the other caldari shipsnow while these arguments are good they really dont make any sense in the context of your complaints about the cerberus being useless with longrange missiles two of your proposed changes benefit the longrange setup just as much as any shortrange setup while the third is only useful on a longrange setup sure they would be nice to see but isnt this kind of a concession that the cerberus current role is just fine
id love to see the double missile velocity bonus too but rather than make the kinetic damage bonus apply to all missiles types id like to see it dropped in favour of a big explosion velocity bonus  and i mean like 50 per level or something  a proper bonus 
isnt the sacrilege supposed to run a dual rep resist setup though after fitting which you cannot use its last high  not even for a cloak like the cerb cerb is a 90km sphere of death for small ships but it is i agree far less useful in most cruiser gang situations than a saci like your proposed change  same range but missiles cover it faster due to double velocity bonus which actually makes it a better missile sniper  and i agree it needs a bit more grid
so we have 3 races following the exact same pattern of close and long range style boats and we have one race that has almost exclusively long range boats and you are against homogenisation tell me more about it
i would be chuffed to bits if the cerb was changed with the bonuses jim sets outmost important thing to change about the cerb for me is the ability to fits hams with an mwd and a half decent buffer tank  2 lse photon invul mwd giving the pilot the choice of losing tank for tackle as is the caldari way
signedsame goes for the eaglecaldari get really gimped with our fitting issuesnot the slot layout simply pwgcpu
sighto all these people complaining that caldari cant fight close up in cruiser fights  plus adressing claims from different threads that caldari cant nano  i present to youham nanocaldari navy caracalone option for the fitting goes like this1x od ii 2x bc ii rcu ii lse ii wd ii small cap booster ii fleeting web 10mn mwd ii 6x ham ii 3x polycarbs  or 2 polys and one aux thruster  3 hobgoblin iisdps 455 with a range of 30km speed 3553 ms with cheap hardwirings and in a gang agility like an interceptor  29 seconds to warp with mwd off  hp 17k what is the web for killing cerbs and other nano hacs of course overload orbit at 75km and full speed enjoysee you dont even have to train for a sacrilege the cerberusUFFFDs role is long range and fitting it for long range is no problem at all so wheres the problemmore grid what fordouble missile speed bonus yeah maybekinetic bonus thats a different non cerberus focused discussion how exactly is the cerb hard to fit never ran into problems how many lses do you think you absolutely need to cramp onto itthe sixth slot how about an autotargeting system or a cloak or something do you really think that slot is there for a medium neut or something on a long range ship
what cerb is a very potent hac in right handscompared to other midlerange hacs it has generally more dps and bigger hp buffer at the expence of noninsta damagewho really needs some love is munin but cerb is ok
so now a faction cruiser becomes the balancing standard the issue is other races can achieve the same utility in close range setups with plain t1 or t2 ships
lol
the distance you have to be to the black ops battleship is ridiculous with the nature of battleships being bumped around the range causes problems just sitting still the tiniest of movement mucks everything up and if one of the ships bumps the battleship it can bump another ship out of range as well the slow response point and click movement plus laggy situations and the tiny area to operate makes it difficult for ships to go in a portal these mechanics can cause ships to come in multiple jumps or moving back in range because of the short range mechanics and bumping physicscurrently the range seems to be 500m or less it should be in the vicinity of a jumpgate 2500m edit modified title to more accurately reflect what it is and distinguish between it and lightyear range traveled
sounds sensible whats the activation range on a bridging titan just out of curiousity
currently there is zero downside in trying to selfdestruct a ship in a losing fight despite the fact that it denies lootselfdestructing unfairly penalizes ships that are deigned to disable and wear down other ships  nosneut ewar heavy tank low gank  and penalizes smaller ships winning engagements versus larger ship classesadditionally the timer is not balanced across ship classes with huge buffer ships and capitals having an easy time of abusing this mechanic to deny lootthere is a lengthy thread here discussing possible balances
grumbles why can you not edit support this issue into your postobviously i support my own issue
i cant really say i see self destructing as a major problem that needs fixing tbhive only once had it happen to me during my time in eve but tbh if the pilot finds this a good way to stop others from getting their loot then so be it
selfdestruct should drop 100 of the modules and cargoselfdestruct should also consist of two phazes on a 120 second timerafter 60 seconds the pilot is jetisoned from the vesselat 120 seconds the unpiloted ship explodes dropping all of its modules  cargo intactthus when a pilot chooses to self destruct they will have 60 seconds to disarm the self destruct sequence once theyre ejected they have the normal 30 second wait to reboard and in so doing deactivate the countdownanyone boarding the ship once the pilot ejects will deactivate the selfdestruct sequence
it needs balancing as it stands now there is no reason to ever not do it if you think youre losing it also both easier to use and harder to prevent on capital ships and large buffered ships im fine with selfdestruct remaining in the game but it needs to be balanced
self destruct actually is designed to destroy everything when some one pops them normally they some mods destroyed what you said makes no sense why should that mechanic be any different form normal destruction if anything if they self destruct the pod should go too and the attackers should get a kill mail because the attackers forced the destruction of that ship
selfdestructing should serve two purposes1  to deny your attackers profit from your loss2  to inflict damages upon your attackers at the cost of your own shipto these ends i would recommend the following changes to selfdestruct1  reduce the timer to 30s with no option to cancel2  reduce the amount of loot that drops from your ship to 12 items  nonammunitioncharge  however selfdestructed wrecks offer 200 salvage3  create an aoe blast around your ship equal to 110th your remaining capacitor amount at 25252525 damage types radius to determined by ship type  eg frig1km battleship 10km cap ship 25km 4  ships under fire when the selfdestruct generate a killmail for the enemy with the ship that hits you last getting final blow your name appears on your killmail the amount of damage remaining  damage done5  ships that are selfdestructed receive no insurance payout further pilots that selfdestruct lose their pod and wake in their clone bay losing any implants and with the appropriate skillpoint penalty if the clone is not uptodate the final blow pilot in the mail gets whatever bounty might have been on your head
dont get lost in the details or the suggestions and ignore the issue at hand selfdestructing is currently imbalanced it needs to be tweaked regarldess of what exactly those tweaks end up beingas it stands there is no down side to selfdestructing for the player blowing his ship up despite the very real penalties it inflicts on their attackers and for some ships  like capitals  except in very rare circumstances its impossible to kill said ships before the 2 minute sequence finishescap warfare electronic warfare low dps ships low dps gangs as well as solo play are all penalized by this mechanic
if anything self destruct timers are too long and have little to no meaning for subcapital ships most of the time such ships are popped well before the timer runs out and the ship self destructs a frigate for instance may as well not even have the self destruct option unless its to prevent the pilot being stuck in a webbed and scrambled situation where the attacker wont finish himher offtraditionally self destruct has been used in the world of scifi and real life to deny enemy access to assets whether those assets be in the form of treasure intelligence or firepowerin the end the ship was earned by the person piloting it and that person should be able to do with hisher property as they wish as long as said property is still within their handsive no objection to the attacker getting a killmail that person did ultimately cause the events leading to the ships demise i dont think the pod should go in a self destruct because obviously the emergency eject provisions of the pod spring into actionwindjammer
did you even bother to read any of thisthink about the repercussions of decreasing the selfdestruct time lets pretend timers were changed so it was viable for ships to complete selfdestructs in all non uberganked situations1  every player would selfdestruct rather than lose it denies opposition loot and costs you nothing2  to get any sort of loot  the reward part of the risk vs reward  players would need to have extremely high dps theres a limit to how much one player can do but bringing more players makes it more likely any loot drops3  any small ship that starts to win versus a bigger ship gets no loot4  any ewarcap warfare ship that isnt in a blob gang gets no loot5  any low dps heavily tanked ship that works on the design of grinding the opponent down gets no loothow is that in anyway desirable i understand and respect the desire to have a selfdestruct option but it needs to balanced if its going to deny the opposition assets it needs to have a drawback or it will always be used by good players  like now 
you dont know me so ill simply tell you i did bother to read it prior to my initial post1  every player will not selfdestruct rather than lose your premise is flawed many if not most prefer to go down with their guns blazing still others are not willing to admit theyre losing until its far too late ohand many want to see how much they can do to the other prior to being blown up2  i see no problem with your number 2 you want the loot work for it the original owner did3  sucks to be a solo small ship my heart bleeds for them get more friends or get a bigger ship4  properly speaking ewar ships are meant to work as part of a fleet they are not intended to do everything well that fleet need not be a blob something as smalls as 2 or 3 people often suffices5  then use a ship designed to destroy your oponent before heshe can self destruct or call in buddiesyoure right its not balanced now like i said the timer needs to be shortened so that people in smaller ships have practical access to it ive not seen or heard of players always using it in fact ive seldom heard of the self destruct being used as it stands its nearly worthless for the vast majority of ships in evewindjammer
youre not so good at this you still get to see how much you can do and go down with guns blazing while selfdestructing shorter the selfdestruct time the more true this is as it stand you can cancel it any time you want so there is no reason not to use it in any sort of questionable fight in other words since it only hurts your enemies without hurting you all good players will use it people forgetting to is bad play not a balanced mechanicif i can kill you with low dps over a longer time why should i be denied loot i did work for it requiring that dps be the only option to get loot encourages blobbing youre right small ships shouldnt be viable for anything besides tackle obviously they lack the social skills to x up for blobwar and ought to be penalized lets just remove everything smaller than carriers according to what windjammers school of total fail ships are limited in what they can kill by player skill and fittings not by class size selfdestruct makes size matter more than it ought to some nub in a bs deserves to be looted by a well fit frig who outplays him not shafted because nub can right click selfdestruct and afknew to pvp what an absurd thing to suggest not all pvp occurs in your home station after youve docked your ratting raven xd up in your 50 man local defense gang and told the ewar pilots that now that theres a fleet their ships can do somethingomg windjammer hasnt heard of it being used its not in your elite tactics book well hell i must be imagining that its a problem if you havent heard of it i cant imagine its an actual problem mods remove my post in fact remove my rights to post at all i didnt check with windjammer first obviously i dont deserve to keep posting
endlesswindjammer is right as to the frequency of players actually using that option most players play style rarely incorporates the denial button where it used the most i have seen is in cap ships because they have the time to do so verses the sub caps in which they usually melt fairly quick and the ones that dont melt with in that time took the steps to ensure a decent tank so they are actually playing the game as intendedmost pvprs choose there targets based on what they have to fight with and running into some one who pushes the panic button all the time is fairly rare once you get the notification the 2 minute drill comes into play and thats when you over heat the weapons or call in some more support if they are close enough that isjammer about the pod i am kind of on the fence about that now i do see your point but self destructing your ship should give you a pause at least maybe when you hit the self destruct button you have the option to eject at some point and the attackers can risk trying to board the ship to stop the self destruct count down if the attacker cant then he is danger of loosing his pod to the area blast or something of course the attacker has to be able to pilot the ship he is trying to capture so the guy pushing the button has to weigh the possibility of loosing his ship to the attackers or going down with his shipv0v self destructing a ship is not one of my things to do its not some ehonor or anything i just like fighting to the end and victor goes the spoils but thats just my playstyle
i lold right about hereif you can slowly wear them away little by little until they finally die from boredom you dont deserve any amount of loot you are a failure as a pirate and should be taken out back and beaten with your own peg legtheres a very large and fat line between care bear mission looting and pvp pirate looting and if you cant kill them in enough time to prevent their self destruction then you dont deserve anything no loot no killmail no epeen stroking of any kind sorrycome prepared to fight and win or dont come at all
i cant remember when you and i have ever agreed upon anything i even like your suggestions for the pod if you make a proposal with those suggestions for the assembly hall ill support it and i believe others will as well it would really make the self destruct more interesting by adding in some tactical complexityim a little worried about this whole agreeing with each other thing but im sure it wont last so im not too worriedregardswindjammer
way to ignore the entire recon like especially the curse pilgrim and sentinel as well as nosneut ships of larger sizesobviously these ships werent designed to get looteve where youd better kill them quick or theyll selfdestruct and say lol learn to blob nub then youll get some loot
some of the ideas on how to fix this are fairly dumb imo like that their pod should die in the blast or that 100 of the loot drops  lol i think that a fair side effect to self destructing is that when you activate it all mods go offline and you lose control of your drones so you cant fight back
obviously they werent because they are meant to support a gangthere are straight combat ships and then there are support ships tacklers ew ecm logistics none of these were meant to win a battle singlehandedly
i dislike this idea intensely be happy knowing that you have denied your opponent a ship if you killed it or they selfdestructed they take the same loss the loot would be nice but a gangmate could easily just pop the wreck if selfdestruct was removed when they choose to selfdestruct thats your warning to pile on the damage if its really that important to youif you really need the emotional response you get from a killmail in order to play eve perhaps you need to rethink your life priorities
you have zero working knowledge of pvp do you they might take the same loss but no loot for the vicor is a big dealwtf are you on about with their gang mate coming to pop the wreck so what how is that in any way relevant in the slightest littlest bit to the issue at handdenying a frigate loot off a battleship beause it takes him 15 minutes to kill it is absurd as is trying to argue that the enire line of amarr cap warfare boats dont deserve get loot if they solo somethingadditionally where are we laying on the dmg from when they start selfdestruct the dps of combat ships dont change much throughout a fight and they certainly dont have tons of spare dps lying around that theyve left in reserve for the moment someone starts selfdestructingstop posting itll make the forums a better place
e s a d i a f dudeyou are upset as are a great many other pirates because you cant win a fight you think you can dish out enough dps to eventually take down an enemy but you do realize thats damage per second not damage per hourso dont act so shocked when youre expected to finish a fight in a limited amount of time where have you been living that you pick a fight in a dark alley somewhere and slowly jab at the other guy until he gets tired of your pathetic 12yr old girl punches and falls downyou started the battle and they went home in a pod looks like youre the winnerbut coming onto the forums and whining about the lack of loot and a killmail makes you the weinerso learn to play and play to win or go home
disagreespeed is not broken and can be counteredskill training in primary and secondary skills time investment equated in experience to use effectively and isk reflects accurately in outcome vs those who dont invest the same resources when compared vs others that invest at parity the outcome is uncertainbalanced
tbh this issue could be resolved in many cases by allowing tractor beams to work in pvp as say a 2530 web 20k  as opposed to a web 90 10k of course making marauders a little bit more of a pvp machine than they already are
agreed speed is way too binary if youre a speed tank against a turret based bs you cant get hit if you get webbed you die its not interesting enough imo theres not enough skillcircumstance aspect to it turrets should still be able to hit speed tanks  albeit very seldomly  and speed tanks shouldnt become fish in a barrel if they get webbed
then you wouldnt mind boosting my carrier to be a wtf solopwnbbq ship then right as acording to you training time investment secondary skill requirments and isk investment justify a broken mechanincheck my carrier takes tons more training time and isk investment than your nano i should be able to leave the field of battle whenever i want and choose my fights with impunity too
nothing wrong with speed as it is
i have no problem with velocity its momentum that doesnt feel right with the current system adjusting agility scripting webbifiers for range vs strength and boosting the webbed deceleration rates are the keys to fixing nanos in a fair manner
you forgot a portion of what i stated and thats experience a carrier can do a great deal of damage vs noobs and seem like a solowpwnmobile but the moment someone who knows what theyre doing enters the scene is when youll lose your shipsame as a nano only about 1000x times easier to kill than said carrier
are pirates as a whole so thoroughly incompetent that they cant kill a defenceless hauler just because they wtz whats next youre going to complain that your targets are allowed to fight back umyou realize that legitimate players can take courier missions right for that matter legitimate players can even sell isk having a pack of agents located well enough to make courier missions viable seems like its kind of the whole point of offering courier missions and saying that it should be broken up because macroers abuse it is like saying we should ban driving because people die on the roads
someone once told me how another mmog does it  runescape i think   a random npc wanders up to someone doing some repatative task like fishing and engages the player in a convothe npc wants the player to act a certain way and typically their response has to be chosen via a visual cue system choose the wrong itemprompt the npc teleports the player some obnoxious distance away  in eve think 1020 jumps away  but doesnt otherwise damage the player  much eve already has interractive agents in space they should make similar agents that wander around looking for pilots doing a repetative task and engage them in a conversation if the player responds correctly they get some small bonus  skipped to their destination or somesuch  if not they get a surprise transfer to some system annoyingly far away
popping haulers on a stationgate all day is the single most boring thing in this game more so than mining there are far more interesting things to do but thank you for your expert analysisso abuse of a game mechanic is fine by you even if its detrimental to the game as a wholeiskgtc is not the issue here but the sale of isk or rmt as ccp puts it this isk is made from abusing a game mechanic but i suppose youre fine with that toosure this might haurt the few real players who do these missions but why not just do a kill mission or is making isk for no risk the way of things to comeengage your brain for a second and try at least come up with a reasonable alternative like the gentleman after you instead of attacking an idea like a rabid dog oh wait this is eveo what was i thinking
i personaly think a bigger collarteral payment to the agent in the beginning and a trasport good that is actualy worth something on the market would do the trick atm its mostly like a wast of amno and sec status since haulers are preaty cheap only some t1 cargoexpenders  and the loot is worth next to nothing so they donUFFFDt realy risk something you shoot one 5 minutes later he is back with a new hauler otherwhise a flat limit on missions per agent and day would mayby make it a bit harder for the farmers since they canUFFFDt farm 237
djego has hit on what is the real problem here to mewhy are these elite agents paying elite capsuleers large sums of money and lp to move worthless junk around dangerous spaceit seems to me that if you want a capsuleer with a 100 standing to your faction to move something across lowsec itd better be something damn valuable to youthen l4 courier missions can be done by legitimate users hell even increase the rewards only now pirates have a reason to chase you just like every other money making activity in the game you now have to put money on the line to make money id suggest trade goods that can be sold to npcs possibly npcs from other factions only and it should be on the order of millions of isk per mission however there should be an isk collateral for each mission obviously thats a bit more than you can get on the market now legitimate couriers can do their thing pirates can do their thing even macroers can continue doing their thing but now the risk is balanced with the reward you lose your ship on a courier run and you not only miss out on the million isk completion reward you also lose your collateral oh and kane here gets to ship your cargo of holodisks to a gallentean he knows whose tastes run that way
sorry no support youve identified a real problem but your solution  eliminate the low sec courier agents  isnt a good onewe have a problem with macro miners would you advocate the removal of the asteroid belts and ice fields they feed uponid like to see ccp come up with a proactive solution perhaps something involving the player base theres a lot of resentment towards script runnersmacroers and ccp could put all that energy to work for them if they could present it in such a way that players could help ccp get rid of the macro problem it isnt just pirates that suffer from the problembest regardswindjammer
seems like you might be interested in supporting a suggestion to make shooting courier mission runners worthwhile that involves the player base and puts their energy to work eradicating the problem the way they do best
this idea is just as good as removing tech 1 loot from the missions these two changes in synergy would be the best thing that ever happened to the eve market
la vista if youre going to nerf industry by making it so it takes years for new players to compete just say so  ill quit now
what is your point this is not a nerfthe exact point is that things like modules and ammo should stay as they are build by minerals but ships and the like should be using components just like t2 are now
my god nowhy we already have7 minerals37 salvage components35 t2 building components capital ship components t2 capital ship components moon minerals simple reactions complex reactions12 advanced materials17 datacores12 decryptors200 t1 base items  meta items cosmos items bpcs rare bpcs ect ect ect thats left flagging untouched7 ice based fuel products40 commoditieswhy why why do we need another much needed level of complexity isnt eve the most complex damned crafting system in the mmog world as it is alreadyno i cant say it loudly enough
only if this is accompanied by ccp removing prebuilt named t1 modules and making rats drop bpcs for them insteadreprocessed unnamed t1 mods instead of returning minerals would offer the t1 components used to make the named variationsmanufacturing named t1 modules would require the appropriate bpc requisite t1 components  depending on their meta level the better the good the more components it requires  as well as current unnamed t1 mineral amount for that module
i think this is an interesting idea
no support the current situation is ideal for new industrialists building a shuttle or t1 frigate from minerals is a source of fun and pride for new industrialists its baby industrialists first significant step im flying a ship i built myself adding another layer of complexity to the process is not a way to encourage those new to the manufacturing processif the proposal is to have ccp simply make the t1 components how is this different from what is already done ccp makes the asteroids from which the minerals are obtained people can either mine the ore purchase it or purchase the refined minerals to build a t1 ship i may be missing something here but that seems to be to be identical to people purchasing t1 components to build a t1 ship also if the t1 components are purchased from an npc entity then youve put a nerf into the player driven aspect of the economyif the desire is for complexity right now complexity is broken down into steps of increasing complexity t2 ships provide plenty of complexity if thats still not enough for you theres always freighter construction and if even thats not enough theres capital construction and if youre really a masochist theres super capitalswindjammer
i dont think i need to tell anybody that defender missiles are completely worthless right now ive done some thinking on the topic and i think ive figured out a way to make them not suck or at a minimum suck less put simply throw out two fundamental assumptions about how they work  one that they can only defend you and two that you can only launch one missile at a time the first one is easy enough to fix  your targets missiles within your defender range will be targeted by your defenders no matter who theyre aiming at hit chances will be probabilitybased and youll have a better chance of defending somebody closer to you meaning that defending yourself is best  but youll also have the option of trying to extend missile defence across your gang the second is a bit more complex at the moment all ammousing weapons have a charge rate and its invariably 1 meaning that they consume 1 round of ammo per activation change this from a flat 1 to a measure of volume and make defenders 13 the size they are now so that theyre tied with rockets for the smallest for reference current missile sizes and the implied rate of defenders per second for a t1 launcher are rocket 0005  1 defender 025 dmps light 0015  3 defenders 02 dmps standard025 dmps assault heavy assault 0015  3 defenders 0375 dmps heavy 003  6 defenders 04 dmps cruise 005  10 defenders 0454 dmps torpedo 01  20 defenders 1111 dmps citadel 03  60 defenders 125 dmps this produces a progression roughly in line with fitting costs and the number of missiles needed to fight off a target of appropriate size torpedo launchers are a little too good but thats hard to fix and given that they have by far the highest fitting requirements of the subcapital launchers its tolerable citadel torpedoes are lower in dmps than namedt2 torpedoes but theyre in desperate need of a buff anyways so ill wave my hands and assume that buff makes this problem go away missiles would aim at targets in succession hitting the first until it dies with the surviving defenders carrying on to attack the next and so forth also with the increased number of defenders flying the missile hp totals will have to be adjusted accordingly make each missile require being hit by its own weight in defenders to die  meaning that a rocket will be stopped by one but a citadel torpedo will require 60 hits give t2 missiles double the hp of t1 missiles just to give people a slight extra reason to use them i intend that the idealconditions both immobile defending yourself  hit rate for defenders will be 7080 meaning that you can negate an average of 7080 of an opponents missile fire with an identically fit ship firing nothing but defenders this would drop to 3540 against t2 ammo of course i am under no impression that defender missiles would be actually good under this plan tank especially this sort of statistical tank that comes right out of your dps is inferior to gank in most circumstances defenders would be the thing of utility highs on the megathron and tempest or the sort of thing your local raven might switch to if you have an ally in deep structure heading to station for repairs their role is a bad one in most cases and it should remain so lest it completely eliminate missile warfare however while they may have a bad role they should not be bad at their role this seems like the best plan i can think of to attain that idealtldr defender missiles fire in bunches at any inflight missiles the target has within range
thats a bit too complex for defenders overalli agree that they should be smaller but they should be able to be loaded into all launchers and should have a base rof  independant of the launcher theyre loaded into  of 3s modified by skills down to 2 seconds their range should be quite far 75100km with a velocity of 10 kmssince we dont want to bog the server down with defender ai the defender should have a target the moment its launched and if that target  missile  is destroyed all subsequent defenders seeking it simply popi agree that missiles should have a certain amount of resistance to defenders but not 60 for a citadel 1 defender for rocketslights 2 for hamheavies 3 for cruise 4 for torps 6 for capital torps  bombssince few are likely to be running around with a full rack of bays loaded with defenders there is no expectation that their efficiency would be greater than 2030 likewise defenders can miss  and do this a lot they seldom work within 30km simply due to their flight behavior and velocity a launcher with defenders loaded can be activated remaining in a readied state except when cloaked  just like active modules such as hardeners  and responds immediately to incoming ordinance it does not count as aggression howevera new skill should be introduced under leadershipdefense operations  6  skill at the operation of defensive systems lowers the damage recieved to all members of the screened group by 2 per level when using defender missiles allows the interception of enemy missles for one squad per level within the range of the defending vesseleach level of this skill allows the defensive screening of one squad the defensive screen pilot must be assigned as wing boosterthere is no advanced version of this skill or ganglink  thats the missile bay in use  to increase the damage reduction more than 10
i dont think its all that complex really defender missiles fire in bunches at any inflight missiles the target has within range as for 60 being too many for a citadel a maxskill phoenix can fire an average of 1 citadel every 12 seconds neglecting bcus a kestrel fit with t2 launchers can fire 1 defender every 072 seconds again neglecting bcus at that rate it would take less than 4 kestrels to match the phoenixs rate of fire and probably 56 to statistically stop it cold depending on the exact formula  a raven fit with t2 torp launchers can put up a defender every 0081 seconds or 148 for every citadel the phoenix can launch thus virtually negating a dreadnought perhaps even two 60 defenders isnt a lot when put in context actually its so few im almost tempted to say a siege module should raise the hp of the missiles you fire while using one as for them missing due to flight mechanics thats an easy one change the flight mechanics its not an unreasonable expectation that the fiddly little things at least work as for your proposal of making defenders identical whatever the launcher its not a bad solution though i still prefer the one i proposed above the leadership bit seems hacky though  i want defenders to work for everyone not just the wing booster also i dislike throwing around a change as fundamental as a 10 bonus to all resistances in the game to fix a problem as small and confined as defender missiles
oh hey golley gee i can put a thumbs up on things i think should be looked atokay what about things i disagree with wheres the thumbs down option
agreed though some of this will be addressed if changes to artillery and a few other ships are pushed threw balancing as a whole has left most caldari and minmatar ships nearly incapable of performing any viable role in pvpthe ship balancing should by no means be limited to those two races though many ships seem to fall out of the realm of usefulness others are completely against the story of how the races existexample eve chronicle the war drones onthe caldari mounted a series of raids into federation territory which the gallenteans in their slow and cumbersome ships were ill equipped to meetthe caldari ships are more often than not slower than their gallente counterparts though they do often have a slight agility advantage its nothing worth mentioning the minmatar ships are supposed to be the fastest of the ships and occasionally fail here too not a big issue but when the ship is the slowest of the 4 versions and the crappiest tank with the worst guns it gets to be a problemi fail to see how a race with the fastest ships would also have the slowest tracking weapons isnt that counter intuitive to the weapons and ships themselves as oppose to the ammar having the slowest ships and fastest tracking speeds
agreedccp should look at the entire spectrum of ships and examine those that are not seeing any utilization and then try to discover whythe burst for example or the bantamand then look at how each races technologies reflect their overall scheme such as what you just pointed out fast ships with slowtracking weapons ofc said race with the fast ships also focuses on slowing down their enemies to be within the slow tracking of their guns well except for the large ones that operate outside that envelopealso look at modules that are little used and why reinforced bulkheads for example ive never in 4 years run across a single ship using them hull repairers as well 14 the repair amount of an armor repper with 4x the cycle time  which works out to 116 the efficiency of armorshield reps  and yet there is a race that focuses on hull tanking so why are they penalized with a completely useless tanking schemeyes ccp look into the overall race balancing vs their racial technologic specialties
there is currently a broken game mechanic being exploited to avoid pvp in areas where pvp is supposed to be happeningdetailed thread herethe suggestions in the thread are just that suggestions if better ideas appear im for that just something needs to be donetldrjumping into a system and logging before your cloak breaks means that hostile players have only one minute to probe and destroy you regardless of your nongcc player aggro flags this is broken in regards to players with player aggression flags and with ships with large hp buffers its further complicated by logging on an alt on the same accountplease get it addressed
agreed there is a major game fault where the player can escape the 15m aggression timer by simply jumping to another system which immediate voids the entire countdown and once they logoff they disappear 60s lateralso logging in  out resets the ships position making probing down their logoff point nearly impossible the ship should not move from its logoff point until it has come out of warp  at the location if its first logoff  whereupon it attempts to emergency warp again the 60s vanish timer should not begin until the ship comes out of login warp
xerox its my understanding that whether the issue gets addressed or not is based on the votes for it in the threadneed you to show support m8 if you agree p
 the nerfs by gods the nerfs and the uselessness of it allreduce or eliminate someall of the idiot nerfs choking the usability of t2 ammo over insanely cheap faction ammo  all the upsides none of the crappy nerfs reduce the penalties that stack and make it progressively worse to fit all of your weapons with ammo
the problem isnt with all t2 ammo people are perfectly willing to absorb some penalties when the reward is something you couldnt otherwise do for example barrage and null allow you to do something that is impossible with any other ammo type  engage at mid range totally worth ithail and void on the other hand just allow you to do what you normally do  shoot people in the face  slightly better and with gigantic penalties totally not worth it  the slight damage boost over faction variants just isnt speciali think that t2 ammo should be about doing something that normal ammo cannot what that is i dont know but a bit more damage just doesnt seem worth it high tracking short range ammo aka flak rounds or something different damage types crazy alpha low rof overloaded ammo it has to be something special enough that it gives you a new option with that weapon system but not obsolete other ammo types and not feel like some kind of trick shot nonsense not something thats easy to tweak but id support a review of t2 ammo with this aim in mind
i have felt this way for a long time
t2 short range ammo for guns is fairly useless t2 missiles seem to be fairly bad across the board
yes void is utter crap fix it
definately supportedmost long range ammo is resonable but the rest is worthlessive listed my ideas here
omgi dont know how many ppl said this in my last post in another forumits not thatlook at it this wayi train for fighters and i train for them well i must get interfacingadv interfacing etcit wld be rather silly of me to just ignore heaviessentries as i have such uber drone support skillsso of course one wil trian 4 them if their a carrier pilotand it sux that not one subcal cal ship can field even 4 heaviessentriesi dont want an uber drone boati just want a regular drone boat like every other race haseg phoon are minmatar a drone race no they can use 5 heaviesgeddon are ammar a drone race no they can use 5 heaviesgallente of course field 5 heaviescaldaricantand if u use the excuse gallente are opposite to caldari and hence shldnt use similar weaponswhy do they have missile boats theneg lach erisplz stop repeating what others are sayingdamn
why do any caldari ships have drone bays at all thenhuh huhyoure not exactly comparing like for like are you
afaik you dont need heavy drone skill for carriers if you dont use heavy drones that is however you still need to train all drone support skills etc in a way carrier training needs a lot of otherwise useless skills for caldari pilot which kind of sucks one reason im not really training for a carrierhowever caldari ships dont really need drones i hate drones seriously if theres an issue with capital ships its that you dont really have any nice capital ship types which make use of caldari skills  effective ewar capabilities or something taking count on skills etc  phoenix  pos bomber  boredom chimera  need to train drone skills
so your complaint is that after youve trained carriers youll want to use the requisite skills you trained on noncarrier ships and despite the fact that you can do so on a majority of caldari ships the fact that you cant use them enough is enough to warrant beefing up one of three ships that really dont need it might i ask whats your stance on advanced spaceship command its a rank 5 skill you need to max to train carriers just like drone interfacing only instead of it helping the majority of your caldari ships it helps exactly two of them do you want a boost to freighters so that you can better make use of your newfound support skills
this is a very interesting fix for bombs but its the wrong fix for defenders
by intention bombs were supposed to be antiblob not anticap and came prenerfed to not be overpowered if anything they need area of effect radius boost
edit stealth bombers so that each has 90 resist to their racial damage type they are now preengineered to use a specific bomb with less risk
how about non covert ops ships require fuel to stay cloaked and make it so cloaking lasts half hour max on non force recons stealth bombersblack ops  ie cloak fuel usage bonus on said ships  there fore it would still be usefull for evading people but not possible to afk cloak a ship without seriously gimping ur setup  hugin with cargo expanders 
this same idea inevitably comes up every time someone mentions balancing cloaks and i always reply the same waycloaks power themselves by disabling every other module onboard thats why there is no cap draw because they are siphoning off the power from the other modulesif it were ever implemented that a cloak has to use cap or fuel then id imagine a great many people would want to fight under cloak at that point as it stands were paying for the invisibility by way of inactivity if we have to pay for stealth with cap or fuel then we should get combat ability returned to compensate then you can obliterate ships unseen for as long as your capfuel lastsmy own take on a fix for the afkcloak issue has seen some strife in fi maybe some of you would like to look it over and consider my ideasmain points being1  change local from an immediate channel to a delayed list then a spy who doesnt say anything wont be displayed at all2  afk timer implementation if a player is nonresponsive for 20min they are marked afk in corp chat if they remain unresponsive for 1hr they are autodcd3  hunter module created to locate cloaked ships in immediate vicinity doesnt decloak them nor does it allow target lock only distance from you allowing for proper triangulation and bumping to reveal them4  bubble anchorable created to decloak vessels passing through aoe bubble can not intersect a stargate or an interdictor bubble preventing implementation as another gate camp toy
oh the dreaded afk cloakers they can terrify entire regions without even doing a thing its not the cloakers that need fixing its the local chat
afk cloaking is a definately broken system to be surethere should be a pos module that can pulse an entire system and decloak all ships but without deactivating the module the pilot must turn the module off and cycle it back on to recloak  this to prevent macros from noting that the cloak has turned off inactivity timers need to be implemented as well but should have random requirements to avoid activityspoof macros once inactive for a certain period of time in space the client shuts downa triangulation module should also be available but require a good bit of time  skills required being the same used for exploration  1m to detect that a cloaked ship is within 1000km 5m to get a direction 10m to get a range 15m to get a fix solid enough to see a ship icon and approach it it cannot be locked of course until the scanning ship gets close enough to decloak both of themonly cloaked ships can scan for cloaked ships in this waythis is solely to eliminate purely afk pilots active pilots will note active measures being used to track them down and move
how does your pos module decide if the cloaker is afk or not 
im sorry i cant support the op on this issuei have no problem with having an afk timer of some type and think it would be good for the servers but the ability to probe even with the slightest chance destroys 2 classes of ships and causes more harm imho than good with local giving you perfect intel you absolutely know someone is there hence any alterations to probing cloaked ships is a huge nerfcloaks are the only counter to probes the problems with probes related to cloaks are1  probes can give 100 accuracy in location that location is the given as a result is the position of the ship when the scan ended2  cycle times can be brought down to under 40 seconds3  cloaked ships are really slow  except for sbs  meaning the targetted ship doesnt have time to move far enough after the initial hit to avoid a mwdapproaching ship after the second probe is dropped since only covert opequipped ships can warp cloaked all others are hence easily caughtso for a cloak to still be an effective module the potential of actually probing a cloaked ship will have to be so low that the long range probes will be effectively worthless and wont get a hit anywayswho cares if you can find a noncovert cloak you say what about lowsec00 exploration where you spend hours trying to find one site that also kills the fuel idea you could never carry enough fuel to effectively find any exploration site my final thought on the whole thing is that whenever i read a someone is cloaked in our space and we cant ratmine alone i have 0 sympathy even in empire we fly with cover ships when we are mining why arent you if its the we dont have enough people on again i think whaaaaaaa
how can someone who is afk and unable to engage anything be an issuewhat the op means is people who may be afk but they could just quite as easily be sneaking up behind them as we speakexciting huhthe problem is your fear and i think eve would be less of a game if we deprived you of it
it doesnt as i said it decloaks every ship in the system  but does not deactivate their cloaking module  an afk pilot will be left vulnerable while an aware pilot will respond and cycle his cloaking modulethis should also halt shield regeneration and cap regeneration on larger ship it should actually drain the cap though only down to 40 or so because youre trying to hide something really really big capitals should not even be able to fit a cloak at all theyre just too doggone big to hide
thisnerfing the local will fix your afk cloaker conundrum go vote in the appropriate thread
yeah and then everybody in eve is stuck spamming the scan button every two seconds until they are forced to quit because theyve developed a repetativemotioninjury in their mouse handleave local out of this particular thread its about cloaking  and being afk in general 
if you had bothered to read the serious nerf local proposals including the direction identified by ccp youd have known that a completely reworked ships scanner is considered a mandatory part of the packagei maintain that nerfing the local is the perfect solution to the ops complaint as the afk cloaker would lose the ability to passively monitor the system and the reworked ships scanner would at some limited range identify a cloak signature
are you aware you are posting this in the wrong topic  this is about afk cloakers  if you want to screw cloaks in general you can as well remove them from game
the only people out to completely screw over a cloak are the folks arguing in favor of an anti cloak pos module which i am completely against in case you were wondering1  local allows anyone anywhere to see who else is in the system so you can sit cloaked in a safe spot and monitor all traffic effortlessly that rules out the necessity for probes of any kind being required for surveillancelocal also allows anyone anywhere to see who shouldnt be in the system with you when every face is marked as friendly except one then you know there is a spy in your midstthats why local is part of the afkcloak problem if someone is afk and cloaked but you couldnt see them in local because they were smart enough not to speak in the channel then the paranoia goes away2  afk needs a timer its a standard feature on every other mmo there is nothing in eve that requires your presence but not your interaction so there is no reason why people should be allowed to exist in game for 23 hours a day without actually doing something during that timesome would argue that a 50 ap route in a freighter could take far longer than an afk timer would allow but give me a break are you honestly going to leave your freighter unattended for that long for that many jumps with the evergrowing risk of suicide gankers3  cloaks are indeed the counter to probes and their current implementation more than justifies the immunity to long range detection however i do believe that a very short range hunter module would be more than adequate for an added challenge without completely stripping them of their usageif you have secured a remote safe spot far from the beaten path then there is no hope of finding out where you are and thats perfectly reasonable given the covert nature of such activitiesbut a spy trying to creep amongst the fleet should have more to worry about that the 2km bump zonewhich is why i devised my astrometric hunter module the best hunters would be other covops ships for one thing and the fact that the module only displays distance not heading direction or especially allowing for a target lock means that the hunters will have to work for their prey4 ships working in tandem can devise the location of a spy and an interceptor could move to intercept much better balance i believe than a pos toaster oven that neutralizes everything in the solar systemso local is very much a part of this argument it is the reason people are aware of a spy in the system and it is the same reason that spy can function without any real effort on their part eitherfix local implement afk timers and implement the hunter module and everyone will be better for it
the issue is the abuse of local if you didnt see their name in local you wouldnt be so unnerved by it and make it an issue
grow a spineif youre getting this annoyed about it and refusing to do anything then the valid tactic seems to be working fineits not like one lone covops is going to be doing you any damage any time soon is it
but the piwates are scaredactually its somewhat a valid argument whos to say that extra face on your local chat is just a covops or a carriertitan laying in waitingim not arguing against psyops against the pirates because it amuses me to no end that theyll develop such a psychosis theyd be willing to invest in any module or device to reveal the boogeyman and the evils under their beds but the fact remains that cloaks are being abused its one thing to use them for simple spying since that is in fact their original function its another to hide a titan and not suffer any rebuttal when you decloak and immediately dd the areabefore anyone starts up with the nerf capital cloaking or some crapits quite logical in the advancement of technology that something as simple as my hunter module would eventually be devisedits a simple sensor the detects the gravity distortion generated by a cloak you have to be very close to the source so you cant just probe them out from anywhere in the system but you can find out if someone is hiding from you close byi will always vote against anything that resembles an anticloak iwin button but i still think that the technology of war will always advance to meet the damands of the battlefield and this is one possibility that is overdue
supported i got a corp m8 that wrote a real fun bio for his character and it just got cut of at less than half of its length  
i wholly endorse removing the idiotic cropping of biosthere should be a little radio button at the bottom of the bio window that says expand bio so the player can have a short bio  what we have now  that shows how many characters you have used  and then an extended bio for whatever reason
i took this up with the csm last sunday and it got escalated for discussion in the formal meeting with ccp fingers crossed we should get a substantive response on the issue and hopefully get our bios unnerfed
post constructively saint
fully endorsedyouve spent hours tracking down a site it should put outalso concerning gravimetric sites once their ore capacity has been reduced below 25 it should no longer show up on multispectral scanstracking one down only to find 3 rocks left with single digit quantities after some hours of work is worse than finding an empty can
raised this to the csm and the issue passed 72 so well be adding it to the formal agenda for direct discussion with ccp
wouldnt it be a better use of time to figure out ways to encourage people to fight in locations other than stationsi have seen discussion that the war declaration mechanics need a change because they are too easy to be used to grief i dont see how making it easier for people to score kills when camping stations is any less of the problem with that when you get an overview of war targets or reds outside the station waiting for one person to pop out or rather more likely one baiting and the rest mostly ready to warp ini think the gangs that station camp someone in are more of a problem than their annoyance with their plan backfiring and getting killed and their target escapingive been in a few gangs that have waited at a station to kill enemies and it is a turkey shoot unless they have an intel channel
imo  if youve got a 15m flag for aggroing someone that youre not at war with you should not be able to dock for the durationsentries should do random things besides just shoot  theyre so pitiful that theyre ignored by anything larger than a frig  they should cap drain ecm or whatever but not by race whatever a sentry does should just be randomly cycledalso cynos should not be allowed within 200km of a gate or station  its far enough away to allow the cynod ship to warpto but not so close they can instajumpdock 
not in a sexual way the ships and modules forum section bothers me as the ship index stickie is litterally swamped with locked topicswould it be the end of the world to lift the 90 day inactive lock thingie just for that forum 
its completely illogical that vanquishing an enemy  and suffering the requisite standing drop to that faction  does not likewise raise your standing with your faction equally  thus the standing loss cannot be huge but the gain must equal the loss otherwise youre being too heavily penalized for joining fw the adjustments should be small to prevent meteoric risefall situations 
there is always one that has to act like a moron
i agree with thisno ship even the lowly nuub frig should have a locking range less than 2530km period
hell yesand reloading too
im in favor of something like this it obviously has a number of issues to be worked out but i think it has alot of merit trade right now is way too focused around jita and anything to decentralize trading is a good thing and i think the idea of giving players the ability to set up small trade hubs would be a great way to do that  especially in terms of spreading out mining etc 
currently three implant sets recieve rather substantial bonuses to attributes modified by existing items beyond the implants themselvesi am speaking of the snake  speed  slave  armor  crystal  shield boost  which currently recieve a 33 and 54 bonus for low and standard respectively currently for speed there are some 20 items that increase the speed or capability of attaining higher speed which can affect a ship likewise with armor amount and shield boost amountas there are so many items to further compound the bonuses given by these implants why are they so high compared totalisman and halo implant setscurrently there are no modules rigs boosters or anything other than a couple of skills and ship bonuses that affect the attributes boosted by talisman  energy emission  and halo  signature radius  implant sets yet the bonuses provided by these implants are so low as to be inconsequential when taken into account against the attributes they boost  17 and 33 respectively currently i only make use of slave implants so its not a rant concerning implants i actually do use i merely want to know why the heavilyaffected bonuses are so substantial and the negligablyaffected bonuses are so weakas for a fixreduce the bonuses granted by snake and slave to 17 and 33 as there are so many other items  skills that affect the same ship attributes bor remove the attribute bonuses entirely reduce the crystal bonuses to 20  40increase the talisman  halo implant bonuses to 3354 as they have no other adjustments whatsoever orb increase the attribute bonuses to 35 respectively to give them some use value

the ultimate solution to this problem would be a drone macro language let it see hostilities ewar and firing on you your allies and your drones and logistics on your hostiles and issue attackfollowreturnscoop commands accordingly its a bit ambitious and a lot unlikely but itd be the right answer here id ideally like to see a similar thing for ships but anything past logitech g15 level would probably make things way too easy on people who afk macro you know the bad kind  my fantasies aside however the shortterm solution you propose sounds relatively good drone options and hotkeys for them
when you join our corp you are encouraged to ninja salvage furthermore not everyone in our corp does pvp we have a few people who are really good at it a few okay people and several crappy pvpers like myself  the last group generally sits back and salvages and we make quite decent moneys doing it ps train asometrics to 4 xd it will help 
i was a little harsh on my response and i appreciate the clarificationas our member mentioned we promote ninja salvaging and looting as a profession so youll never get warned about it  although you might get warned if you dont 
unlike most sn members i invade missions and loot wrecks often just for the aggro not always but oftenand i make it most obvious ill approach only loot containing wrecks nick the goods and lazily orbit you until you shootonce fired upon i warp off to get the shootin ship gives you plenty of time to warp off to get your shootin ship or call in your corp mates as i am flagged to your entire corp there are other options to pop us without suiciding yourself
just as a matter of interest what do you use as a shootin ship dotard
wardec corp alt detectedkidding im sure the big dogll be in here shortly
im pretty new to eve and have not really done much pvp its definitely not a requirement to join the corp  although you will have to be on constant alert for war targets which makes everything more fun  personally i spend 95 of my time salvaging and looting
well we got the benifits of learning skills already as older players so the ones who will suffer is the newer players if they are simply given learning skills or those attributes are automatically added in  then the midrange players suffer so its not as simple as removing themalso while it does help to train learning skills  it has been said time and time again that basic skills should be trained first and then after you are in your thorax or caracal or whatever then you can train learning skills while you practice your races and learn the game  it all seems perfectly fine to medo i hate learning skills yes should they have been introduced no shoulld they be removed no
yes well if they remove the learning skills and just give everybody 10 to all stands and reduce training time by 20 then i want those months i spent training them up reimbursed by the handing over the number of sp i would normally accumulate in that time with my current stats  17m spmo on my strongest attrib pair i started when you were doing good to start out with 90k sp and friggunnery 4 now newbs can start with almost 1m sp and get into a t2 frig w t2 guns almost right out of char gen thats 2 months of early training before the learning skills alone or 1 month once youve gotten the basic learning skills doneso new players are already boosted into the game by 36 months over where i began and now you want to boost them another 3 months by eliminating the learning timesinkcover the old schoolers who started before all of these newb buffs and ill be fine with it
i think eve needs a smoother transition from the actual newbie tutorial and then the rest of the gamei think the agent mission system from levels 13 should actually teach about the game mechanics and not just send you flying around space isnt that an interesting concept for example you might get a skillbook as a reward and then some description about how it works maybe youd need to use a particular skill along the way something to that effectthe problem with eve is that it has a huge learning curve thats really not a bad problem  its more fun than being simplistic but it is also a deterrent to new players one that ccp should be eager to resolve if only from a bottomline standpointbut it would also make the game more fun for the rest of you if a way can be found to teach people more of the fundamentals before they are doing l4 missions without knowing what a target painter is or how to use one
thumbs up
im sorry lia gaeren but you apparently do not understand how to play a mmorpg in short you have played eve incorrectly please delete your character and start over and play the game properly this time1 create only the raceclassschools that are going to give you the leg up you need for day 12 train all learning skills in the exact order as dictated by evemon its best if you can set aside a week or two to be at your computer 2473 only train skills necessary for the particular task you are going to perform it is best if you can narrow this down exactly ahead of time including exactly which mods you will equip on your ship 4 have absolutely no fun whatsoever this is not allowedsarcasmi agree entirely lia gaeren i dont agree with the op because they are a little too 4 for my taste and i dont really agree with the idea of removing learning skills  i like the idea of adding new ones though or even a tertiary  new  attribute to skills  learning skills are a great time sink for players who like time sinks and minmaxing and being uber efficient there are lots of you and thats okay for the rest of us they are an interesting way to speed things up at some distant point in the future but im not losing any sleep over itlast night i was training eidetic memory but i decided i wanted to play with a destroyer  heresy  and so i trained up destroyers real quick i know im a total noob i did something i thought would be fun shoot me
recently as the council have worked its way trough the communitys concerns we have hit a large pile of balancing issuesseveral people including me expressed concern about this during the last meeting i discussed this issue on our internal mailing list which received no feedback for some absurd reason and suggested a course of action for itits obvious that the community cares about balancing so the csm should of course raise it but the concern is that balancing issues do not require discussion as much as a stock exchange for instance the idea being put forward is a list of issues which are marked a response only meaning that the council would like an answer to the specific ideas being put forward and possibly a yes we will do this we just cant say when answer this means we are able to deliver a good bunch of balancing issues and get an answer on them without having to spend 20 minutes that was the time spent on each issue in iceland the major issue about this as i see it is that it doesnt facilitate discussion as much as i would like it but we do have a limited amount of time so we have to consider thati think the best solution is to add a clause saying that if ccp does not agree with an issue put forward time should be allocated for this issue to come to an alternative solutionthis means we will get a list of issues which will be passed onto ccp and only if ccp is not happy with it we can discuss it further the rest of the answers should simply be posted as a part of the minutes as an official response from ccpwhat do you people think
i mean really how hard is it to make a t2 industrial hull with 8 high slots and a bonus to tractor rangespeed and salvager durationchance8 highs no weapon points with decent speed and moderate cargo  on par with blockade runners marauders went a long long way toward making cleanup a lot easier but they are still very limited as 4 of those highs are guns slowing their cleanup down to about the same speed as a dedicated salvage destroyer
name calling isnt going to progress discussion very far in fact such actions could be considered in breach of forum rules and in direct conflict with the higher expected behaviour of csm members and those with positions within the csm read the documents carefully unless of course you are thinking about changing these sections also
amazing i stopped playing eve over a year ago only to return and find this still goes on i guess it always willfor my 2 pence worth i think it is good that a consumer group has been established although im not sure of the mechanisms yet good luck to you guys but expect as always you will never please everyone

yeah i run 3x 21 widescreens and currently i have to run a separate client on each one being able to unanchor parts from the client and move them to a second monitor would be stellar though id still want to be able to run multiple clients
must have morepixels
i would like to use 3 screens ot be honest p

i really love the idea of black ops and despite all the issues surrounding them im training for one nonetheless  i like to buck the trend   there really is a need for a good look at them and all the issues raised here not just the ones listed in the original discussion summary its simply not eve when you have something that doesnt perform any role
this would be a good role for a dedicated salvage vessel 8 high slots  no hardpoints  for tractorssalvagerscloak insanely high sig res to compensate for the reduction caused by the nerf  otherwise will never be able to target a wreck  a highresistance tank and decent speed  cargo  3000 m3 base 
id love bos to be able to use cynos into jammed sistems but make cyno visible its a cynojammed sistem afteralljumping to the sun in any sistem in range is unrealistic or any variant not involving prior cyno
covert cyno should be able so that a small cov op gang can be brought instarjumping is an interesting idea that will open a range of new tactics fore this ship class specially that it will work without another player
i support this  
id love to be able to move rigged ships in some way the issue isnt so much with battleships i can understand if they are too big to fit more than 1 in a freighter but for all the small stuff that would be safe to move solo anyway i dont see a reason not to allow it

no jump cloning is already way way too overpowered you should not be able to move around 00 with this much ease especially with npc 00 base to dock out ofthe only possible way id support more jump clones is if the station you left saw the destruction of the clone in that station upon jump thus requiring more thought before jumpingas it stands right now jump clones not only allow too much ease of movement and unnatural and traditional bases out of npc 00 all around the galaxy they also allow easier protection of expensive clones got a fleet fight well just hop on out of those expensive snakes and into your cheap fleet clone it removes too much of the riskreward aspect of the game
it would be nice to have something happen with this since they arent being reimbursed as there is an upcoming fix this is a great example of how a little visibility to items in process would help your standings with the people who pay your salaries and promote your gameit is frustrating to have this issue be a year old with end in sight and no options for reimbursement for those that have these white elephants
agreedcov ops cloaks should make the few ships that can fit them pretty much impossible to find though some mechanics should be put in place to thwart them as there is zero counter beyond sheer dumb lucknormal cloaks should only reduce the ships signature radius not make it outright invisible to sensors a 9095 reduction in signature radius would make it adequite reducing a raven down to a sig of about 5 not impossible to find but not easy by far likewise when the scanning ship warps to them they dont show up on overview forcing the pilot to look out into space visually to find the cloak shimmer somewhere out there
well thank you for spitting in the proverbial face of ccpif you havent noticed ccp releases these huge complex expansions to add new features ships modules etc would you prefer if they did it in little chunks or not at alla graphical fix such as that is not entirely important either maybe they fire missiles like subs do open a port and out they come maybe people dont carestick to complaining about losing a ship and forgetting insurance existed you  and me but in a good way  are being rude and it isnt warranted or we could drop eve and play swg where everything is messed up thanks to the players whining about things too much
i suspect this is something that will be addressed in the special effects update thats coming sometime in the future but in case it isnt it totally should be done
agreeda simple fix would be to have the missiles ejected from a bay much as they are on todays contemporary fighter aircraft and then ignite a short distance from the ship a simple rotating magazine would fit the bill perfectlyas for graphics striking the target but missing thats not so bad seeing a fleet of npcs waving laser beams about like flashlights no where near my ship but scoring a hit is likewise rather lame though i suspect it does cut down on server load not having to calculate trajectories as the weapons on player ships do
this is an old issue and it sure made me sad when trinity came out and we still saw no missile hardpoints i doubt we ever will sad though missile effects could use some love though to at least make it seem more realistic instead of just missiles just poofin outta the center of the ship
then by all means plz support the thread d
wow ppl really love trollingbut i dont see how i spat in the preverbial face of ccp
i spose the guns hitting while missing isnt so bad but i do like your idea for the missile cming out then firing wld be easier for ccp that way d
i dont know if its ever going to change but can ccp continue to completely ignore 30 pages of agree posts1
le sigh another rant about npc corps and corphopping as though this hasnt been done to deathso why do you feel that this cements solidarity theyre far more like to quit after that week which will have been spent docked due to the idiot that got them into the war in the first place corp solidarity is thanks to the corp not game mechanicschanging corp is perfectly valid if you want a war with no restrictions lowsec and 00 are out there and waitinglet me reiterate this is a game people play it the way they want to they will not go and get shot by you just because you want a fight real fights are available go seek them instead of pursuing individuals
agreed the procuror has about as much use as as a burstie no use at all in fact a burst can almost equal its mining output  sarcasm  but a crappy miner in a scytheosprey can flat outmine it without half trying in fact a crappy miner in a mining cruiser can almost equal a retrieverhow about keeping the 1 strip miner but giving the procuror a minor industrial role give it the ability to compress ore only one factory slot it does not need to be in anchored mode and takes 2x the time to compress oreor allow it to immediately refine what it mines at 40 plus skills  to 95  efficiency  ore never lands in the hold the minerals do also all mining barges need 2 more highslots  utility  more pgcpu  esp the mackinaw  and the ability to actually kill something if attacked  such as a frig or maybe even a t1 cruiser 
mediumheavy mining dronesprocurerskiff  drone boatideas
yes yes it does suck having it available to be invented into the skiff does not seem like enough justification
aye the procurer is a terrible shipthe problem is a bit endemic of mining barges in general but the procurer is the worst off because it really has no role because there are many other ships that can do the same thing it does at1 lower cost2 less training timethis makes the miner in me cry big salty emo tearsperhaps it can be turned into the official lowsec mining barge increase its agility add a second highslot for a cloak something like that
the procuror is absolutely pathetic at least with every other worthless ship there is some redeeming factor this one has nonethere was a thread on it a few months back with one of the devs chiming in saying they were looking at it things being rattled around were1  lowsec ninjaminer increased agility and speed maintain most of the current stats possible bonus to cloakig devices2  bulk miner large cargo hold still one strip miner3  dedicated veld boat much like its t2 cousinnot sure where it should go but it definately needs something
yeah the procurer is pretty pointless
making it a ninjaminer would be good although it would be pretty useless in lowsec unless they make the lowsec ores more valuable than the hisec ones
possibly the single most useless ship in eve it needs anything to make it usable seriously
give it heavy bonuses to mining low ends heavy as end better at mining veld than a hulk and maybe it would see use that is a massive bonus thoughi support the procurer  drone boat miner
since no one reads more than the last 2 posts anywaysi dont care about the whole thread just what the last guy said ill respond to that
signageit does indeed suck bigtime but its such a cute little thing itd e a shame to dump it completely so it needs overhauling bigtime
i will only support this proposed local change iffthe ship scanner that is builtin into ships currently is made more userfriendlythat there is some sort of visual cue as to being scanned by such a scanner
supported butconstellation chat sounds like a great idea but then there needs to be something done about spammers especially for jita in jita constellation chat there would be way on top of 15k people and local spammers would be happy about thatplz dont get me wrong im just afraid of the empire constellations with more than 1k ppl in therei can remember once ccp had something like a global chat which you could close but autojoined after login  at least for the first time   that was awful
boost alpha of 1400mmmake them useful for something
there is nothing wrong with arty dps a 6 x 1400mm tempest with 2 gyros does comparable dps with a 7 x 425mm megathron with 2 magstabsthe capless advangtage of the arties is balanced against the rails better trackingthe single biggest problem an arty user faces is lag as has previously been pointed out once your guns are empty theyre empty and thats it the above tempest can fire 12 volleys of tremor l for 3287 damage per volley thats 39444 damage per reload the megat gets 40 volleys at 1747 damage per volley which equals 69880in a laggy fleet situation this means that a tempest can only be relied on to do 56 of the damage a megathron is capable of putting out also the tempest will be out of ammo in 124 seconds whereas a mega can continue to shoot for 224 seconds meaning a mega will be useful for a lot longer to the fleeti appreciate that this isnt the place for comparing ships effectiveness but there is something wrong with the arty mechanic when lag sets in currently ccp cant fix the lag but they could ease the pain for the minmatar bs pilots
just throwing it in here but what about making it so that when overloading the artillery pieces you get a damage boost instead of the rof or whatever is on now and only when fitted to minnie ships  or make it a bonus of the minmatar artillery ships though that could upset bonus balance of ships this way you have burst damage but repeated use of it would break the guns and you would need to repair them i am not a wiz at these mechanics but just throwing it in hereregards aedit oh and a tiny little bit more range bonus would be nice on the ships that are supposed to use artillery
im in favor ifgiant space whales leave some sort of residue or gas that can be harvested thereby making them more valuable alive than dead anyone hear of a whale crapping fermionic compounds it could be done give them their own area of 00  like the drone regions

completely necessary and more importantly assuming its under development can we have any idea of an eta
i would venture to say that the lack of external client is the only thing keeping evevoice from being the 1 choice do this ccp and you will have won us over i use evevoice regularly my corp is pretty small and the logistics of who will own the server what are the passwords and addresses etc make evevoice a great choice i have had a few troubles with getting it to connect correctly but to keep this in perspective i have had 10x more trouble connecting with ts or vent
most of the resources available in eve are limited and follows a pattern of riskreward to a certain degree the exception is missions that provides a magical endless supply of risk free isk and minerals this is in my opinion one of the major problems with eve and is behind the issue of getting people to spread out and use more of the systems in eveif you look at for instance ratting there is a clear progression of increasing rewards when you go from 10 to 10 to get the best rewards you need to go to 00 and work together in a group alliance  to protect your resources in addition your potential iskhour will drop the second more people attempt to use the same resources system  similar patterns can be seen for mining and exploration etc mining has its share of problems but i feel this is closely connected to the issue of missions missions give at least double the reward of mining in high sec so the only positive side of mining is that you can do it largely afk macro  and more easily operate multiple accounts id even argue that high sec mining is more risky than missioning and you are fighting over limited resources when miningmissions however does not suffer any drawbacks from limited resources you can sit in the same system all day long chaining missions over and over and over with no limit to the isk flow it provides pure isk bountiesrewards minerals loot  salvage standings and lp in one easy package in a completely risk free environment where you dont compete against anyone for your resources and the iskhour is competitive with what you can earn in a large portion of 00 in addition high sec missions place you in an area where you got easy access to the best markets in the gamemissions break the otherwise competitive nature of eve it breaks the concept of riskreward and it eliminates the need for any sort of teamwork to maximise your isk earning potential and due to the carefree nature of doing missions in high sec  you dont have to worry about beeing killed  you dont really get any benefit from the vastly increased risk of doing low sec missions even though the actual reward is slightly biggerpersonally id like to see a radical change in missions and completely eliminate them in their current form but thats probably very unlikely to happen however something needs to be done with especially high sec missions to put it in line with other means of making iskso here is some suggestions of what can possibly be done to make missions fit with the rest of eve eliminate missions in their current form and instead give rewards lpiskstandings  for handing in tags that you get from rats through rattingexploration increase droprate of tags make cosmic anomaliesexploration complexes in high sec or anywhere  more common in connection with a limitation on high sec missions  limit the number of missions you can get pr day for instance 1 mission pr agent in high sec 5 missions pr day in low sec and 10 in 00  nerf mission bounties from high sec missions perhaps half of what it is today  remove some  all  loot give each agent a limited total nr of missions he can give out pr day or pr hourim sure there are many other possibilities to fix missions but something needs to be done with the current mission system me puts on flame ant suit
very interesting im very much looking forward to see what people think if we can come to some agreements i might bring it up
just giving myself a thumbs up since i for some reason cant do that in my first post
those are all awful ideas missions are not as rewarding and unrisky as you make them seem youd have to spec in missioning to make them work welli make my isk from missioning and i only manage about 56 missions a day if even that id be much better off ratting in 00 but the belts are crowded so im losing about 50m a day as that much missioning may generate me 15m a dayidea 1 ratting provides much more income in 00 than missioning its only risk is getting jumped but thats how it is for missioning plus mission ships are a hell of a lot pricier than any standard ratting vessel the real hindrance there is that belts are crowded you go do fw for your tags and standings from rattingidea 2 that one i cant argue with too much not done it myselfidea 3 1 mission per agent do you honestly think every mission runner no matter how dedicated has 56 agents available in empire and all of them with ships in respective stationsidea 4 highsec missions are crap when it comes to bounties and loot not to mention mission rewards what at best 34mil rewardbonus for 30 mins of grinding you have to dedicate time to get the lp for a sellable item in th lp store and then you have to multiply the time for the acquisition of tags needed then add the time it takes to sell itidea 5 seriously the most impossible of your ideas have you any idea how many people use the same agent in dodixie limit the agents missions to 100 a day and hes depleted in an hour whatre people supposed to do then idea 3 risk lowsec join an alliance in nosec not hard the latter but it seems theyve been avoiding that option for a reasonto really do missions as carefree and benefitially as you claim you have to bling up your ship and equipment get a rattlesnake deadspace boosters crystal set takes quite a while to fund and anything that kind is just screaming for a suicide gank and if it were just for the drops suicide ganks are done just to cause grief not even a dominix is safe any more it gets shipscanned for its t2 rigs and one single ss lar and boom
do tell this to salvage ninjas mission gankers etc what was ithisec is safer not safe lol 1 mission in highsec should be in line with the other means of making isk hello newbee heres your 1 mission a day want more go play with esmenet in 00you sound a bit like a pirate alt hoping for more targetsin short no thanks
having done something like 5001000 lvl 4 missions i can safely say that its not hard to make around 20 millhr i lost one completely t1 fit raven early on when i had like 25 mill sp and it was only because i didnt pay attention to triggers and spawned 4 waves on me at once since then i havent even come close to losing a ship in a mission and in my current t2 fitted ship i could probably do fine even if i repeated my early noob mistake of spawning multiple waves so yes missioning is risk freei expect lot of flames from people that dont want to see how missions breaks from the concepts that apply to pretty much any other way of making isk in eve atm
remove loot for high sec agents and leave bounties tags and salvage
i have several corp mates not rat in 00 because they make more doing missions in high sec yes it takes bling and such but good days can get 50mhour for several of thema total limit is bad i could see a decrease in agent quality depending on how many missions he gave out the previous week i could see a limited number per character per agent or faction a day bob just doesnt have anything else for you to do today without his books looking suspicious to his superiors for all i know i could even see caping agents in high sec at l3 q0 and l4 q20 and moving up to l4 q0 to lowsec and any better having to go to 00 there are several threads already about changing rat drops both in missions and from rats in general i would like to see more done with tags as i cant melt them for minerals mining suitable trit quantities in 00 to complete with refining rat loot is a topic in several other threads thoughjust a few alternate suggestions
yes limiting pr character is probably better than a total limit but a total limit would encourage people to spread out more instead of having everyone in motsu
an idea ive had floating around for a while is that missions should become a more limited resource  but not quite how you describecurrent system ask agent for mission instanced mission is spawnednew system agent spawns a new mission at a some frequency which is part of the agents stats  up to a maximum number of missions waiting which would also be configurable  mission runners can access the list of missions the agent has available and the reward for them and then choose one to take onthe reward and timebonus on the mission is set to a low level then gradually increases with the rate of increase being based on the agents qualityas a mission runner you can see the full selection of missions available from the agent and choose one to takenow you have a limited pool of missions available at each agent and people have what is effectively a bidding war between each other to take the mission at its best reward point but before someone else takes itquality would no longer directly effect mission reward instead rewards would rise faster on higher quality agents this means that if you go and find a lower quality but less used agent you can generally find better mission rewards directly rewarding people for spreading out and trying different agentsyou now have actual pvp and competition for resources between players incentive to spread out agent quality still meaningful but not the beall and endall etc
most definately in need of a serious fix will have the added bonus of eliminating clogged areas of empire space and bring more people to low sec
missions need a fix they offer way too much reward for not much risk i support having the csm look into this issueid like to see level 3 and 4 missions only in lowsec  00 they can keep the current rewards structure  when they are moved to lowsec their rewards should increase  id also like to see in 00 agents faction and deadspace drops  not very often but sometimes and if this already happens i apologize  lastly to make them more interesting give them the escalating paths like the deadspaces now have perhaps when you get this you can get aforementioned factiondeadspaceofficer lootedit forgot to support
dont you mean it will have the added benefit of removing people from the game when it takes 2 years of running their one mission a day to buy a battle shipfewer people in lowsec too since they wont be able to grind missions in high sec to earn the iskies to get their ships back
no i meant what i said but your version works just as well for methey dont go there now so theres not gonna be fewer of them
risk vs reward in low sec should be addressed first lowsec is in many ways more risky than 0 sec and has very little extra incentive when compared with highsec if you want to introduce people into high risk situations you should first open the door for higher risk situationsalthough esmenet its cute that you admit youve run thousands of missions to become established in eve and now you want them obliterated in the form that you abused them
i still do missions actually so im nerfing myself but either way it doesnt matter what i do or did if you open your eyes to the game as a whole you can see how missions break the concepts that the rest of eve follow
hmm i dont know about everyone else here but i think missions have already been nerfed by the virtue of being boring as hell with mining you can fly over to a field lock onto a rock or two and fire up the lasers you can then more or less be afk while your ship does the rest with low sec ratting and whatnot you have to keep an eye on local or risk getting blown to kingdom come by a wandering piratewith missions you occasionally lock targets and fire missiles thats pretty much it just sit there and launch while sometimes boosting your health you cant quite take your eyes off it since youll die but there simply isnt enough going on to require anything more than passing attention sure you can try pulling them off in a lower class ship but thats too inefficient to justifyim assuming that things are marginally more interesting for those who have the misfortune to grind missions on a gunboatdrone carrier but i dont think it interferes with the messagethe point im trying to make is that crippling the mission system in the way youre describing will extract the last morsels of joy one might get from running missions leaving them nothing more than household choresi play eve to have fun not as another parttime jobeither remove missions entirely  as if thatll happen  or leave them as they arepsid like to point out that my first major concern when i read this thread was that those of us collecting lps would be well and truly screwed since theyre hard enough to get as it is i might be more supportive of your suggestions if you can provide a viable alternative method for acquiring lps to be blunt the 500k that i have right now are the only reason i havent moved down to 00 anywayedit just as an aside i agree that missions break eve to a degree from a lore standpoint it seems insane that the pirate factions could supply enough ships to fuel the destructive tendencies of thousands and thousands of pilots every day most players will have committed mass genocide after their first eighteen months
removing or radically altering missions isnt going to make people go play in low sec people its going to make people quit
in my mind what happens after this is implemented1  many players who play for the fun of it leave simply if they cannot do what they wish to do they arent going to subscribe much lower amount of subscribers2  empty lowsec  worse than right now  if you can only run one mission a day in highsec or 5 in lowsec it will take you forever to replace a bs or bc plus fit it people arent going to run off into lowsec to lose the bs they just grinded for 3 months to get running one level 3 a day 3  market crash highsec mission runners will be poor to the point of not being able to afford ships above a bc they definately will have issues replacing bss t2 or deadspace modules will not be purchased because of costs and lack of funding4  pirates will be poorer you get your iskies from blowing people up and taking their loot if your targets have no isk they dont have any loot if they cant make isk to buy their new toys they dont play the game5  alliances will be poorer yes they can provide for most of their needs but they still need iskies for things like npc provided pos fuel no carebears  no one buying your deadspace stuff  a lot less cash6  isk sellers profit seriously cloaking ratting ravens in 00 will be the primary source of isk in the game sold by external web sites since players will still need isk but will not have access to near as much many will just buy what they want but instead of straight isk you will see things like full snake set only 1595eve requires isk to flow in order to function you are directly threatening that isk meaning you directly threaten eve everything you listed will hurt the game greatly you really think that you would be able to gank factionfitted mission ships or fat haulers if there were not missions bolstering the economy
some of us are trying to make sure that you still have targets to shoot at
ratting is boring as hell and is perfectly safe if you know what you are doing what is teh risk of a wcs cloaking sensorbooster ratting raven that logs off the second someone enters localno risk at all thats why 00 is full of cloaking wcs ratting ravens high sec missions are risky from gankers anyone can gank any mission runner mid mission with a few torp ravens 45 max if mission runner is at a gate on the other hand 00 ratters have almost no risk at allif anything risk needs to be added to 00 ratting and rewards increased for missions in lowsec i am a fan of lvl45 and rewards of low sec just do not cover the shiploss when you find 4 ms hotdropping you for s and gigglesmissions need more scripting and more friendly npcs to remove the rambo effect some fw missions already have multirace npcs fighting each other and you get a real feel of a fleet battle when you join in half way through
getting a bit annoying that every time a topic is up for discussion that hurts carebears some of them show up and make the argument that if you do this everyone will quit and the game will die as if they are really speaking for everyone in empire i dont think everyone will quit i think a few will emoquit make a tearfilled post on gd about how ccp ruined the game and how me and my elevenhundred alts are quitting other than that i think most people would adapt and find other ways to make isk such as venturing out into more ahem unsafe regions of spacetldr everyone will quit is a bad argument
i think it was motoworld where they said everyone will quit when they planned a change overnight pretty much everone quit something like it happened with swg when they released the nge expansion the problem in both cases is that they were not looking at the root causethe real number 1 problem that everyone hates is 00 ratting being too easy its next to impossible to kill cloaking ratters this should be the focus first  to make 00 ratting more dangerousalso low sec missions need reward boost 00 missions need reward boost just now few people do them because its not worth it if a enemy is going to hot drop you with 5 motherships when you jump though a gate
i didnt say everyone i would bet if you checked ccps expenses for server upgrades etc it wouldnt take a lot to put them in the red red is bad of course if they lost enough then they wouldnt need to do server upgrades but then if they lost enough so it wasnt making a decent profit they could just close eve down and concentrate on the ww mmo being built and reuse the existing hardwarebesides explain to me where i went wrong in my assumptions as to what would happen where do you see the market population base status of invention etc if this was how eve worked how would it effect your targets how would it effect you
this one is easy these is way too much supply in the market as demonstratedby ummm looking at the market for more than one second so if there are less mission runners then that means there will be less minerals which means prices will go up whih means more miners and then prices will go back down again it is very simple if you really think the market will be extraordinarily high because mission running is over then you just dont know anything about economics or eve at alli mean you would be suprised if you knew how many pvp players had industrial alts and could easily swoop down and start up productionmininginvention if it suddenly became worthwhile lower subscription numbers do not harm eve or ccp at all they can sell servers or advertise or add in new content eve chugged along quite nicely with less than 10k average ppl online so i am not worried that eve will omg die because a few mission runners decide to quiti agree with the op there needs to be competition of some sort for high sec missions either that or massive nerfs to iskhr or hard limits to the max  of missions you can run in high sec it is ridiculous that mission should give you equal or more iskhr than 00 with none of the risks cloaking ninja raven 00 ratters is also a problem but a different topic
its just annoying that whenever carebears feel something would hurt their profits they immediately take the subject hostage by threatening to quit its sort of the trade mark for carebears so im not surprised by it but its still annoying also i dont think as many would quit as you seem to think nor do i feel that the game would be worse off if anyone did quit for this reasoni think it would balance things out a bit more high sec would still be pretty crowded but for completely different reasons thats where people would go to do commerce with the goods they drag in from unsafe areas of space it would not be the source of those goods at all it would effect me in the way that my high sec mission running alt would need to find something else to do that would probably mean more exploration and such however i think a combination of a complete nerf of high sec high end missions and a boost to low sec it would be awesome
now i would like to tell you something it is hard to imagine but still truenot everyone is minmaxing eve being a caldari achura and doing l3s in passive tanked drake and l4s in raven and cnrnow some people who actually have to shoot at targets for example have much harder time with missions than folks in cnrs and dont earn nowhere near as muchif you hate missioning that much you should argue for a large boost to pvp capabilities of caldari ships and a huge nerf to their pve strength
im sorry but what is your argument here if someone sucks at eve hes going to have a hard time doing missions well mate let me tell you something that falls into the yp department its not a balance issue
im unclear on how this would work in practicewhat we dont want is for an fw corp to declare war on an neutral corp or alliance and in doing so pass the war on to the whole of the faction
i support the introduction of a midline hauler call it a scow but give it a substantial tankmake it limited to cargo access at pos stations and industrial mining ships that are anchored make it capable of launching  recovering pos modules as wellgive it some function though  make it a subcapital logistic ship with range  fitting bonuses to logistic modules but no quantity bonus as current logistic cruisers enjoy this will enable it to support its fleet during an ambush give it say 4 utility high slots and bs scan res  and bs pggrid  since it cant load in space putting tractorssalvagers on it would be a complete waste  though folks will try  give it perhaps 1 or 2 mid slots and 1 or 2 low  expanders wont increase its cargo substantially beyond 120k m3 
you should have just called me an idiot would have been far less words and definitely dont want more lp available to level 4 mission runners still with the remove meta 0 leave meta 14 and dont compensate with anything
1there still should be loot but it should be meaningful and a far lower volume like if i pop a serp outpost either give me something decent or nothing not a few hundred hybrid rounds and web ithe whole mission drop system needs a complete overhaul in
i must agree with planktont1 meta 0 might as well be a raw mineral drop and as such its stepping all over the mining profession as for the named stuff though some things ought to be rare valuable and random imoas to meta manufacturing if it could be introduced in such a way as to not crash the existing named item market im into it but just as i dont want missioning stepping all over mining i dont want an outright reversal of that situation either t1 and minerals should be the province of industry miners named gear should be the province of missioners ratters i think i hate seeing useless partsedit unlike plankton im ok with replacing the t1 loot drops with something else my idea was trade goods but whatever works im of the opinion generally that missioning could use a small nerf but thats not what this seems to be about
apart from anything else providing t1 basic stuff should be something that players do not npcs the huge flood of t1 stuff from npc drops means that the profession of t1 module manufacturing is stillborn aspiring manufacturers are faced with subsidised competition and cannot possibly compete since t1 stuff is sold for below mineral cost
noones talking about getting rid of your arbalest loot just the t1 basic stuff
become miners ok im kidding but seriously a couple of million sp thats about 15 if what it takes to be a good miner and 10 of what it takes to become a truly specialised one not a line of argument i would advise you to pursuein any case you can adapt quite easily i would think whats it to you whether youre buying mission loot to reprocess and resell to manufacturers or miners minerals to resell to manufacturers and manufacturers modules and mission named items to resell to playersthe fluctuations in the mineral market that would occur if this change is enacted should provide plenty of opportunity for the alert trader
whilst i personally agree that hisec l4s are too lucrative  i use them myself so i should know  this thread isnt the place for that argumentif you like were discussing how mission rewards should be received not how much the reward should be in totalincreasing lp at the expense of minerals has been suggested because simply handing out more isk would be highly inflationary lps are at least an isksink
get rid of t1 loot from rats
youre assuming that the market for lp items is completely demand limited that people will spend exactly the same on lp items regardless of price i would suggest that if lp items were cheaper people would use more of them for instance if the price of faction ammo falls enough that it becomes economic to do missions with it
thats a popular exaggeration i build and sell t1 modules and even ships and my profit margin averages 30 of sales thats at fairly low volumes  35m month  and its my understanding that at high volume the margins are lower but thats kind of how that goes just ask sam waltonreread the op the phrase that means t1 meta will have to come from elsewhere suggests to me that they are in fact talking about arbalest loot  and modal and fs9 regolith blah blah etc  which they seem to plan to move to the manufacturing sectori dont think im in favor of that i like the current system there
well as i later noted i can see the benefit from having named loot still drop please remember that this is a discussion topic the op is not gospel truth the post was made to gather feedback on this topic
well rats do have to drop something as it is now its wrong rats dropping better things then industriallist can build  t1 stuff  my idealet the rats drop upgrade modules which players can use to upgrade their t1 modules into named
youre not thinking enough about the drawbacks of your ideaif you replace t1 loot by more lp first it will only benefit the missionrunners not the ratters  and guess which kind of activity loot more  second it will further devalue lps which dont need that if you replace it by bigger bounties the macroratters in 00 who never loot and delog when anyone enter the system will absolutely love this and it might do bad things to the economyif you make meta modules more common by direct looting or indirectly by producing them youll basically kill the demand for t1 since there will be lots of supply of meta mods at cheap priceif you remove them completely without replacing them by anything its a signifiant nerf to the income of missionsrunners and a huge nerf to the income of ratters think 20 or so i doubt youd want anything that make 00 less attractive compared to highsectheres also the fact that most named items  all the guns for one thing and guns are the main source of minerals from loot  only reprocess for half the worth of t1 modseventually removing t1 from the loot tables might be a good thing on the long run but the way to do it will have to be considered very very carefully
yes but only t1  ie no named edit i dont see what the problem is regarding mission runners just change the loot tables to increase the number of named drops to compensate  roughly  for the value of named items or increase the chance of some of the more expensive items still less hauling overall and it means most of it will be sold
jesus what are you people thinking hell no
when i joined this game mining was a very lucerative buisness but as of late with the mineral market crashing because you dont even need to mine to get minerals now everything is getting out of hand a friend has actually saved enough mineral from loot from all the mission he does to actually build a carrier fully support a revamp to the mining industry
i couldnt agree more
so if the price of faction ammo falls enough they will become a hot selling item little problem the production price of the faction ammunition has 2 components1  5000 units of standard ammunition price determined by the market pretty invariable unless the mineral prices change2  x lp dont recall how many but a fixed price dictated by ccpso to make the production price fall enough you should reduce the value of the lp end result the lp have a lower value i really fail to see the logic in your post i am not interested in selling faction ammo as hot potato if the gain is 10 isklp substituting several millions in loot in every level 4 mission with several millions in lp at the current lp value  or at ccp supposed lp exchange rate  will simply make them overabundant and lower the value of lp
3 i disagree there researcher who likes to make moneyanyhowremove all loot even named unless its level 5 and 00 dont boost the mission runners they do not need boosting in salvage or lp sorts thats it really
these are bpcs for meta items
im not keen on this idea as it would simply lead to a devaluing of lps  or salvage  i would increase the bounties but that just increases the isk per hour and makes salvaging pointless similar problems with just make them drop more salvage it will just devalue the existing levelmy suggestion as a short term solution and certianly one that would aid the mining profession whilst not hindering the mission runners as much is to change the reprocessing plants  rp the idea is simply that what minerals a rp can produce are linked to either its security rating or just to null lowsec highsec divisions it can be explained away as hazardous radiation if necessary but more importantly it would mean that mission runners are unable to provide critical resources for items in highsec thus restoring some of the balancea balanced solution must not be just drop more of z or gain more of y as supply and demand will just make y  z more worthless which sadly is the current problem for minerals  and tech 1 items to a degree if tech 1 has to be eliminated from the loot then bpcs of meta items become a must its fairly easy to implement as all the loot tables simply change from 250 mm railgun i to 250 mm railgun i bpc x runs
mm thing is less loot for mission runners for them to take means they can go though missions faster with out wasting time collecting loot i mean the rewards in mission is huge far i can see lp stores and rewards and mission rewards and most of all salvage they dont need loot also pc ships should drop loot because that be a reward for the another pc for killing him and take any nice mods he has dropped like a titain  other wise it be like wow and makes pv pointless other than just kd also to be honest i honestly think with the mining bots i think there should be a cap on what shipequipment you can use if your in a npc corp meaning like a trail account cant use hauler so if there in a pc corp and there showing signs as a bunch of bots the macro hunter can declare war on them and wast them joining a corp not hard and not reason not to join if people want a war dec free corp then they need to have limits in how the function in eve until i see a real big reason why not i strongly stand by this
sorry meta items as in named i not sure what ya mean
thumbs upblazing fire ceo interstellar operations incorporated corp web site services service killboard hosting service forum hosting service web site hosting service alliance creation
named items are meta 14 which is almost certainly what he means
i agree
1
i assume he means this from his op perhaps a combination of the two a bpc to build those optional productsso in fact you would first build an meta x improvement item that in its turn would be added to an production run of for instance a standard missile launcher bpo to produce for instance an arbalest missile launcher but alternatively you could make a named armor repper of special ammo with it because it would result in the meta x version of that item it would leave it up to the manufacturer what to improve and thus a way to respond to prices dropping or rising for particular itemsbut getting rid of unnamed as drops all for it
i wholeheartedly support this as a miner increase salvage to make rigs cheaper  they are jury rigs not uber pimp mods eliminate t1 loot
supported whole heartedlyit is right now the only thing that will fix the oddly skewed market
agreed the loot when refined ruins the entire purpose of mining while giving an insane boost to the already insane isk of bounties mission rewards salvage and bonuses combined not to mention the lpmaybe the mission rats could drop something else something for a new profession or we something that would be useful for mission runners  temporary armor patches or we  but not worth alot on the market
everything sold ingame should be subject to the effects of the free market to the furthest degree possible i know that the eve market isnt truly a free market but its close and anything that increases that aspect of the game world is only a good thing
i glazed over some of the posts here as it has become a whyz u nurfin me meshonz just get over it missions should have been nerfed long ago  i run missions too evidence that missions need nerfing is that a 25 year old player still finds missions to be profitable enough to do yes please remove all t1 loot from missions and ratting now setup t1 named bpcs to drop as you suggested lavista this allows you to keep your precious isk from named loot how because it will be the only way to obtain these bpc and will therefore be more valuable make the named bpc have about the same build requirements as t1 and poof you dont need uberskills in industry to make them and you could also just sell the bpc for isk too if you cannot be bothered to make them yourself
bingo ccp should be constantly trying to refine any aspect of the game that removes the market from npcs and puts it more into the hands of players taking npc influence out of the market as much as possible would lead to a much more realistic free market situation in eve
yes but have you ever asked the question is this a good thing a free market should be exactly that free it should have no outside influences with the exception of protection against force and fraud
i do not have issues with removal of t1 if you make the meta better than t2 in some way more than just fittings atm maybe a 10 bonus in damage mod for meta 4 or something but its gotta be worth constructing for more than just the new players and training time cannot be an argument as theres too large a base of players with t2 already
free markets crash hard without regulations and safeties you run the risk of creating a market atmosphere that incredibly unfavorable to the player
as a player who does not have billions heck i dont even have millions   200 million is the most i have ever had   i support a change in how modules like this are found on one hand when i was an unexperienced user i sold and reprocessed these drops that allowed me to purchase what i needed so i think those players still need these items to make additional money and or get items they need to make moneyi think at the point where missions provide million isk per kill as a bounty that these enemies need to stop giving out the lower quality loot they need to drop something that will allow somebody with an investment to produce something worth value this item would also have a value lets basically called it an upgrade item this item would be influenced by the market perhaps this item could also have a way to be produced lets limit the number of these items to a small amount i am thinking around 20 different itemsi have made a few million isk playing the market i typical find an item i can produce or purchase for less and make a profit the problem with this change is i would be unable to do this any more i would have to invest money into blueprints and have to attempt to price my goods near or below everyone else granted everyone else would be in a similar boat everyone wants to make a profit and i have an advantage i will take anything i can get to increase my wealththe items i purchase are items i have found drop often in mission drops i take advantage of people who do not study the market system and just quickly sell items i would just have to adapt and as long as my skills to reprocess an item i sold for cheap to gain a profit from the minerals is not effected then i am happyi guess the point of this post besides showing my support towards this idea is to say that as long as a change does not effect the usefulness of a given skill as long as a character can train a new skill andor an old skill and adapt to the change it will work outwill the system be different sure will people complain sure it will happen no matter whati think npc cooperations should only provide the information to produce items they should only provide the welfare items to new players for a price so they can actually advanced in the game items still need to be dropped if they are special but anything else dropped should only be the knowledge to produce that said itempeople who cannot earn the items to their skill level andor or afford to purchase these good items will still not have them the amount of people will just increase and this will provide confidence to additional players and they will start to experiment with new elements of the game i am afraid to try new elements of the game because i dont have faction items and at this time do not have the ability to get even get them
i support this ideakey being most if not all ore should come from the mining professionimhotake careminsebsis
actually no they dont its manipulated markets that crash hard name me one example of a truly free market that has crashed hard  no the usa doesnt have and has never had a truly free market ive studied free markets for a decade and i assure you that a free market is far better for all involved  except the power hungry  sure theyre susceptible to ups and downs and even crashes but all of these will be far less disturbing than those that happen in manipulated markets
im not going to get too close to rl politics here and im not going to ask the same question as j kunjeh because he asks the wrong question of course  theres never been a truly free market so of course theres never been a crash of one  but i do still feel the need to criticize what youre saying even if we take the anticapitalist line on realworld politics and say that free markets impoverish the masses most of those criticisms dont apply to a game world you cant starve to death in eve you cant become unemployed  you might lose your current job say if you lose your only hulk  but you have an infinite supply of noob ships and corresponding access to an infinite supply of ships for basic mining and ratting better ships have very low entry requirements and its routine for a new player with no assets at all to be in a cruiser inside a week of play this assumes safe space of course either protected by concord or a friendly alliance but so long as we dont remove highsec and npc corps that should still be the case furthermore since the elimination of the t2 bpo lottery monopolies and cartels need not worry us the only things that there are not an effectively unlimited supply of are premium goods  namedfactiondeadspaceofficer goods invention decoders rare skills most players dont need stuff like that there is an infinite supply of missions an infinite supply of t1 bpos and basic skills and an effectively infinite supply of asteroids several hundred times larger than the demand certainly qualifies  nothing can be held by one or a few players even titans are showing up on the market these days and in some quantity at that so precisely what failures will arise from a free market in eve wealth concentration overblown in real life but an absolute delusion in a world where creating wealth is a trivial affair i care about how rich i am not whether tyrrax thorrk can find another officerfit ultrarare ship to go pvping in and i know ill never go broke unless im a complete fool the economy is too decentralized to experience a demandshock recession and too casual to care about the situations that would otherwise create one in any case when i cant starve or go broke why do i need to hoard my wealth  and supplyshock recessions are impossible in a world with an infinite resource base and low barriers to entry neither inflation nor deflation is an issue and even if they were fluctuating prices are hardly seen as shocking its theoretically possible for ccp to wreck up the place but thats a failure of the government not the market so precisely what market failure are you concerned about here
great idea gets my support  but not extra lps in exchange for reasons stated by otherswhy not replace the tech 1 loot tables with the meta product or additional salvage you mention that would then be needed to produce meta level modules would still give something dropping of value even if it isnt of immediate value it would also maintaina a link of sorts between meta modules and rattingmissioningfin
great post herschel youre right theres never been a truly free market in the modern age but the markets most close to a free market are always the most resilientyour post also got me thinking about what elements ccp could add that would increase add the necessity to hoard money didnt they say with ambulation we would be able to feed our avatars hmminteresting possibilities
how long did it take them to make many of the changes in the systemhow many changes to the balance were made after the developers looked into things quite often after people saw a tool and abused it because it was possibleright now they took a look at suicide attacks and are tweaking the rules on themthe way you point out its always been that way is almost sounds like you want them to roll back to the 10 code but things change the game evolves new issues crop up and new adjustments are madelong standing systems and items are changed as well after all i doubt you want them to put the belts back in jita and the like pull the extra turrets off ships and push everything back to what it was like when the servers were first put online after all that was how things were for a time
so you and avon and a few minor griefers qualify as people from different playstyles and while i agree that insurance is not the cause but a symptom of the problem the fix is still a pretty good one unless you are one of those guys only getting their kicks from the suffering of other players heck even some pirates and suicider sympathizers have voiced their support for itseriously since you do not accept any viewpoint but your own as rational you fail at rationality yourself removing insurance for concordokkens is a good compromise between the free for all for suiciders we currently have and that you so vehemently defend and the pvp flag bs that the hardcore carebears want i dont see what could be more rational
i have proven without a doubt that their gankers  opinions are irrational and biased at this point have i notthey gankers  wont even say that taking away the insurance payment would increase the cost because they gankers  are so dug in on being right no matter the cost that reasonable thought has long since been left in the dustif they gankers  wont work with us carebears who apparently are not carebears because we go to low sec once every 3 months  to find a reasonable fix to all involved partys then nerf the freaking christ out of it ccp and let them gankers  cry about it in hindsightedited to add the reference windjammer is talking about i like the new version better too jammer
uhheveryones opinions or did you have a particular group or individual in mind also this they you speak ofcould you specify which group youre targeting i myself have a good idea of whom youre discussing but it would be nice for other readers if you could clear this upregardswindjammer
show me free for all suiciding show it dont just say its there while not being able to produce a player who has been ganked repeatitively over the past month most complaints are from someone being ganked once or twice often they are afk or not attentive to the enviroment they are in if suicide ganking was so rampent i would see it when i fly through empire my noobship would be the target of battleships because i might have something valueable in my cargo rightthen you have people complaining they got ganked before they could load grid that has nothing to do with the suicide ganking mechanic and everything to do with lag and the games netcode and processing orders tough luck how about you complain about the lag instead in these situations suicide ganking has already gotten hit with the nerf bat more than three times  introduction of wtz general hit point buff to all ships several buffs to concord including jamming drones in addition to ships then you have people who cant identify a potential suicide ganker in system because they are hiding in an npc corperation how is changing insurance going to fix that it wont the only think the insurance change would do is make the first situational preference in a sandbox game i hate patchjobs that dont address the cause but try to find some sort of punishment that doesnt even go halfway to fixing the problem instead the solution will end up creating more problems but hey we have to be entirely focused on this one solution and blind to any other possible solution that works at the source of the problem and expands the sandbox nature of the game
personally i think that voiding concord insurance for anyone who has destroyed a target in hisec is a sensible moderation of the issue in hand it wont remove suicide ganking completely but it will tone it down to acceptable levels  ie generally only against targets that deserve it such as ships that have been scanned and found to be carrying an overly valuable cargo making the proposition profitable  rather than the speculative ganking we are seeing at present  ganking targets just because they look like they might be carrying something of value however i think anything beyond that including the more severe sec hits that are already on the table are misguided and will result in negative effects on the gamefor example it would be easy to be extremely heavyhanded  and some csm members are all for this  and punish any ganker so severely that his faction standings and sechit are impacted with months worth of repair workall this will do is prompt more ingenuity from those who wish to persist in their attacks for example it is perfectly feasible to train up a gank caracal on a trial account in sufficient numbers  and which group in the game do you know who excels at such organisation  they would be able to take down almost any target they wished in highsecwhat then monitor ip addresses proxies would circumvent that remove trial accounts from the game yes ccp would love to do away with one of their main marketing tools im surepeople play this game to pvp primarily of the nonconsensual variety to engage closely with fellow players and blow their stuff up there seems to be a trend for this becoming harder and harder to achieve issues such as the lofty scam and now suicide ganking are being firmly addressed but the overall picture that has made these activities so desirable  such as the immunity offered by npc corps and dysfunctional wardeccing and bounty systems  are ignored suppress this element too hard and a great deal of the mystique of this profoundly unique and engaging game will be lost and this is something that can only be detrimental for all players
all the people who disagree with you are irrational that would seem to be a lot of people who arent being rational the thread containing the original proposal had 155 thumbs up approvals the csm voted unanimously to escalate the issue to the ccpcsm meeting and ccp had already formed a task force to address the issue really all those people arent being rational this would seem to be a good example of circular logic ie youre right because you say youre rightthe only person i saw use the term kneejerk reaction was avon and he sees the problem but has a different solution to it i like his solution but disagree with him because i feel his solution would virtually eliminate high sec suicide ganking and put a serious kink in low sec suicide ganking that sound like im fanatically biased to my style of game playthe removal of insurance from suicide gankers is not a bad fix its an imcomplete fix thats why its only part of a package of fixes rather than trying to stand on its own as a complete fix as a part of the package of planned changes its an important elementthe mechanics of the game may be the same as before but their usage has changed i hate to keep hammering on goonswarmno really i dohonestbut they offer a prime example of the problem with their jihadswarm blind suicide ganking is another example in the endif you havent understood the problem by now youve been wasting everyones time with your posts you havent grasped the discussion at allwhen you say we have all come to the same conclusion i have to wonder who is this all you speak of considering what you did in manipulating quotes from the economic report im suspicious when you say youre the only rational one and everyone else is irrationalbecause you say so i start wondering whether or not you need professional assistancewindjammer
i think avons solution is good too funny how that works out innit
hahaha yes the ol well officer if she really understood the male mind i would not have had to  her
this thread is now about how great i am and i nominate myself to lead ccps suicide ganking task force
itt carebears comparing themselves to  victims
your logic not mine in fact you could create analogies to almost any crime using your logic he was driving a nice car so i stole it his live has everything i want so i murdered himjust because you can doesnt mean that the punishments are not handed out you stole that guys car well if you hunt down a few guys for us who by the way did the same crime then we shall let you steal more something is wrong with eves punishment system ccp and most of the playerbase would like this fixed only the criminals would vote for lesser laws on crimes ofc
your proposal pidgeonholds it into this style of play whereas the op proposal gives you flexibility but it wouldnt better than the curse youd also continue to pidgeonhold it as the sole force recon that can do nothing once pinned down by an interceptor because its outside of weapon range  no other force recon suffers from the same problems as pitiful as the arazu and lechesne are even they could still force an interceptor to orbit within web range if the interceptor pushed to continue to warp disrupt themoptions based upon fit not your scenario of heres a ship and this is the sole way to fit it just dont uncloak and youll do just fine
lame argument insanely lame if this thread is terrible its only because of comments like this the vagabond is obviously not designed for artillery yes its an insanely fast close range ship however correct me if i am wrong here you do have another hac the muninn which just so happens to be designed for artilleryi never said give the cerberus tank bonuses or a drone bay or more capacitor or more speed  if i asked for any of these things only then i would indeed be asking to make the cerberus a sacrilege  considering heavy assault launchers go almost 50km on a cerberus its basically a mid range ship with haml fit im just thinking haml should be a bit easier to fit i never said a cerberus should be a sacrilege i just think it should be a tad easier to fit thats alli can fly other races ships i can fly every hac except amarr i just think it is lame that the sacrilege is so easy to fit and such a good ship with caldari weapons yet the cerberus in comparison comes off as being rather weak  it does have fitting issues now if the cerberus is truly a long range hac fine lets give it double missile velocity  thats 12kmsec heavy missiles  and lets get that kinetic bonus changed to all missile damage and lets toss it some more grid cause i really feel its hard to fit the cerberus right now compared to most other hacsperhaps i should have chosen a different subject line to this thread people seem to be just running with the whole lol jim wants to make cerberus pwn in ur face like a sacrilege lol and thats not the caseagain my proposal is simply1 easier fittings for cerberus  mwd2x lse should be easier like other hacs 2 double missile velocity is more effective than 1 velocity bonus 1 flight time bonus  better at long range ok 3 damage bonus applied to all missiles not just kinetic or at least just heavies  sac gets this why not cerb those are my 3 ideas to improve the cerberus and make it a bit more viable if you disagree with them that is fine are they seriously terrible ideas or really step on the sacrileges amazingly huge manly toes i do support a sacrilege nerf though its got too much grid for a missile boat too much cap too but i wont rag on the sac too much in this thread lucia dont bring faction ships into this they have nothing to do with balance yes i know navy caracals are not overly expensive but i think they are toy ships and should not really be factored into balance discussion i mean you really wanna argue nightmare vs other bships or stuff like that expensive toys for the most part could argue gist shield boosters are overpowered too but again expensive toys  pvp
again jim you need to identify specific numbers and estimate the balance effects of those changes or this thread is worthless and has no place in this forum how much pg do you think that the cerb need model some fits and quantify the effects of switching to a double velocity bonus or switching the kinetic damage bonus to alldamagetype this thread will go nowhere until you do this
agreed   these are fairly reasonable requests
how much grid probably 7590mw though this will still render the 6th high slot all but unusable the additional grid would make it easier to fit dual extender  mwd for heavy missile launchers but a rcu would be needed for haml fairdouble velocity is simple it comes up to 12kms vs 8kms which is the current top speed a nonrigged cerberus im not really sure how to put that into numbers but i think we can simply say missiles will hit stuff from far away faster thus making the cerberus more viable at long range correct it will take a cerberus firing a heavy missile from 100km about 12 seconds to hit at the current speed of heavy missiles with a double velocity bonus it would take about 8 seconds there you gonow as for the missile damage bonuses the cerberus tops out at 350 dps for a heavy launcher 2 bcu ii  caldari navy scourge setup with any other cn navy missile you are doing 280 dps the boost would mean 350 dps with any heavy missile sac hits about 480 dps with 2 bcu ii and its light drones with any heavy assault missile and considering the superior speed capacitor and tank of the sac this seems fair to meso there you have itsac  485 dps 5 haml ii  2 bcu ii  3 hobgoblin ii  20km rangecerberus  350 dps 5 hvy launcher ii  2 bcu ii with kinetic 280 dps non kinetic  189km range sac outside of range is completely superior to the cerberus so if they both could pick any missile damage type would that be fair to you it would be fair to me considering the sacrileges many strengthscerberus has a huge range advantage yes but this isnt a head on 1v1 comparison im not going to sit here and argue who would win 1v1 obviously a sacrilege would since it could avoid most of the cerberus damage never have to turn its mwd off keep 1618km away from the cerberus and watch it die a horrible death precision heavy missiles being broken would make it all the easier of course but could a cerberus stay back and sling missiles at greater ranges and with far greater effectiveness by being able to choose its damage type like the sacrilege can yes could it benefit from being able to fit a dual extender setup yesthat being said sacrilege is fairly fast and has a lot of buffer hp and has insanely good cap and never has mwd issues  permarun it all ya want folks  so in all fairness i think the cerberus could use some love again sacrilege is a very very good ship enjoy
imho 5 heavy assault launchers  mwd  2 lse ii  2 or 3 damage modsdc ii is overpowered because a setup like that has no weaknessso it need just the grid to fit said setup with only 1 lse and require one power diag to fit with one rcu you shouldnt be able to fit 2 lse ii
nope it doesnt first off the races dont need to be balanced in the way you envision balance they are different as are their ships which is a good thingsecondly eg the navy osprey was made into the fastest caldari cruiser on purpose to fit a role caldari ships normally dont so while i dont get the point of balancing races in a way that they all have very similar ships ccp does use faction cruisers to provide versatility why dont you take their offer and move alongif you want to operate outside normal caldari tactics there you goplus please do explain whats so much worse about factions cruisers compared to plain t2 shipsnavy caracals cost 90m isk navy ospreys 50m a cerberus 80m so where is the big differencejimi am not that sure about the kinetic thing if you do that it doesnt only affect the cerberus but eg also the currently slightly overpowered drake and a lot of other ships especially taking the drake into account i would be happy to change the caldari bonus from kinetic to guided missiles light heavy cruise  where its kinetic only atmi just dont want a drake with 100k ehp 200 passive recharge and even a mwd having hams and thus 600dps of any damage type it chooses that would require some severe bashing with the nerfbatso my question to you is would you accept the kinetic bonus to be changed to guided missiles damage insteadbeing able to freely choose damage type and utilizing hams more efficiently is just too much sorry
premature postage
hilarious because you just described the sacrilege add enough capacitor to perma run a mwd and to that too okim talking heavy missile launchers  mwd  2 lse ii not haml haml should be harder to fit on a cerberus and require fitting mods considering how painfully slow and overall defensively weak the cerberus is this would imo be fairokay the kinetic damage bonus thing for just guided missiles sure why not its better than just kinetic in my opinion although damage to all heavy and all heavy assault would give the cerberus at least some advantage over the sacrilege which imo is still the better ship overall when you take into account its speed its tank and especially its capacitor really i dont know how much i can stress this the sacrilege is amazingly good i dont think the cerberus could ever outshine the sacrilege under 20km no matter what you did to its bonusesanyways this of course is not a cerberus only issue the kinetic damage bonus has bothered me for years i just dont like it i dont think compared to turrets which do two damage types or more its very fair missiles just dont do the dps of turrets torp ravens aside which do need painters and stuff so i never felt that the 1 damage type thing was ever justifiedi know the old argument is that lasers only do emthermal or hybrids only do kineticthermal but still its two damage types and generally more dps and on a lot of gunboats you get a drone bay not all but most which lets you add an additional damage type  most caldari ships dont get drone bays also again turret dps is better and missiles do have a lot of limitations overall especially in the nano warfare currently in place which makes missiles rather ehhhh unless you manage to actually web someone but anyways thats just my opinioni honestly dont know much about drakes ive only flown them a few times cant say i am crazy about the ship im sure its good i hear from most people its omfgwtfbbq good or its a total noob boat that gets popped easy im sure its somewhere in between that i know its better than a nighthawk which is hilarious and sad ive honestly avoided battlecruisers my entire eve career only one i can fly that i like is the sleipnir which is a pwnmobile
thats sentance makes no senseits an oxymoron
its been a while since a used a sacrilege but i dont remember it being able to compete with a cerberus as far as the shield buffer in concerned the sac has 4 mids and cerb has 5 that means that after the mwd ans scrambler the sac has 2 slots to shield tank the cerberus has 3if the sacrilege passivearmor tank it needs 1 1600 plate  1 rep to compete with the passive shield buffer except that the added mass make you align more slowly so thats a doubleedged blade and the fitting requirment is much steeperso the sacrilege cant compete defensewise with the cerberus unless it goes allout tankingthen youre comparing the dps of a longrange setup  apple  with the one of a closerange setup  orange  to try to make your pointa ham cerb with 2 damage mods do something like 440 dps if i remember correctly compared to the 487 dps of the ham sacrilege and bearing in mind that the cerb has more range it is more than honorable
huh lets back up heresacrilege can fit 2x lse ii  mwd  scrambler  dmg control you have a ton more of a buffer than the cerberus to say the sacrilege cant compete defensewise to the cerberus is very lulz it completely blows the cerberus away lets also keep in mind the sacrilege can mwd without cap issues you cant fit 2x lse ii on a cerberus without an rcu ii which further slows the cerberus down unfortunately which is already slowfor the sake of argument can a cerberus do 440 dps with kinetics vs a 485 dps sacrilege with any heavy assault missile sure is that dps close yes if you stick to kinetics sure is it as fast as the sac no can it maintain mwd forever like the sac no can it fit a nosferatu no does a haml cerberus have near the tank of a sacrilege hells no 16k hp vs uh i dunno 30k maybe more depending on your setup sacrilege is more durable by far sacrilege in theory can be actively tanked cerberus is epic fail with a shield booster and mwdbottom line is yes the cerberus has more range but if you are going to fit short range weapons shouldnt you actually get in disruptor range in that case you are shooting at the same range as a sacrilege but with half the hp and slower not the best situation for a cerberus to be in best to stay far far away unfortunatelylets forget about ham setups on a cerberus i dont wanna really compare it to the sacrilege anymore its pointless sacrilege is just plain better close up i guess its supposed to be fine im concentrating more on the cerberus needing to be better at its role midlong range heavy missile tossing not asking for the cerberus to be a sacrilege though i find the best haml ship in the game to be an amarr ship rather confusing but ill put that argument aside for now
i agree that the sacrilege is amazingly good at what it does applying constant dps to targets closer than 20km but as its a one trick pony and the ship built for that trick it should outperform imitators the question is just by how much but thats a different topic and you are right that its directly related to caldari shipswhat i am more worried about is actually that the caracal navy issue outperforms a cerberus at close to mid ranges  the setup above was no joke and fitting heavy missiles a navy caracal isnt bad either  and it doesnt even require you to train the hac skill so lower skill requirement better performanceone could say that the cerb is much better long range and thus its fair but i think youll be hard pressed to find other faction cruisers that outperform their respective hacstill i personally do think the navy caracal is overpowered since they added the 6th launcher instead of the cerb being gimped so its not the cerbs problem but maybe the truth lies in betweenguided missile bonus instead of kinetic changing the flight time to a missile speed bonus id have nothing against bringing that to ccpregarding drakes  you can make them incredibly powerful and i personally think they are unbalanced but as at least 90 of the drakes people encounter are horribly fit  due to them being a favorite new players ship  people dont take that much notice of itthe best ham ship being amarr from a rp perspective i have no problems with that i always saw caldari to be guided missile specialists while eg torps are more of a minmatar thing  brutal and unelegant  and the new hams also supposedly rather unguided a khanid thing
yes but the damage a navy osprey can put out is fairly limited  about caracal level in general t2 is better than faction t1  at least available from lp stores in empire  with some battleship exceptions and more available but faction was never a point in balancing ships faction items and ships stand out or otherwise the speed implants would be already nerfed to helloh and jim is arguing that a noncaldari missile hac is better than the caldari missile hac imagine a minmatar drone hac would outperform the ishtar  that would be fun
gallente ships are better with blasters than caldari onesso why shouldnt khanid ships be better with hamsthe caldari speciality are classically guided missiles and railsone valid question is though are javelin hams balancedusing eg a drake as reference fitting 3 bcus and heavy missiles you do 414 missile dps at 84km with hams you either do 384 at also 84km which is not that much less and you have the option to switch ammo to deal 540 dps close range doing comparable dps at the same range as heavy missiles if you use javelins while having an additional short range option is a bit weird in my opinion and makes hams a tad unbalancedwith heavy missiles you currently dont have any flexibilitythe heart of the problem here are t2 heavy missiles though where both types are pretty much uselessif the advantage of using heavies would not only be ability to use fofsbut also ability to deal damage to fast ships with precision heavies outdamage navy ammunition with the fury ones at close rangesthe situation would be very different also regarding the cerberusUFFFDs versatility
i agree to the missile problems but that changes the cerb situation only a little bit because it has fitting problems when trying to get any sensible buffer tank  mwdnot that the sac has 2x the ehp and spare fitting for mwdhamls while the cerd maxes out with hmlsmwd and one lse
lets stay with the facts shall wewhile eg a dual lse dc ii sac has 30k ehp and a lse  invul cerb fit has 21k thats not your true combat survivability cause the sac is much weaker in thermal  30 vs 86 resistance  which is a very common damagetypeand the 21k hp fit leaves one midslot free for a small cap booster to fix the cap problem  in addition to the one disruptersbwhatever slot additionally you dont need that much of a buffer tank because you will be far out anywaythe problem if there is any is midrangechanging fury heavies could fix that problem or nerfing ham javelins a bitfixing precision heavies would give the cerb a completely new role being able to apply damage to nano ships without the need to get close enough to web  this would fix the watered down raven claim fixing t2 heavies  both kinds  thus would imho fix all cerb problems  except for the kinetic thing which is a general caldari issue  a double missile speed bonus in additon wont hurt of courseall other problems like the tank is still weaker are imho imagined ones not all ships have to be equal and the cerb does a thing no sac can never do and it does it outstandingly well providing standoff dps which makes up for and let me just repeat myself the larger your range the smaller of a buffer you should actually need in combatthe whole this or that ship has more cap larger tank  thing gets tiring even jim seems to agree to it not being the core of the issuethe core of the issue is that javelin hams cut into the cerbs turf and that t2 heavy missile types are useless thus limiting the cerbs abilities
i just went through the thread again and im admittedly too talkative shouldnt start posting on eveo during boring workmeetings i guessstill theres been a lot of in my opinion fruitful discussion and here ismy short and personal conclusionspossible issuesfix precision heavy missiles to add a new role to the cerbchange the cerb missile flight time into another speed bonus to be able to apply dps faster from afarnerf javelin hams they should maybe give double the range of normal hams not the full hm range they do the momentmaybe make hams harder to fit by increasing the powergrid requirements this weakens the tanks on sacrileges ham drakes and such as a tradeoff for the high dpsthink about changing the kinetic bonus on caldari ships to a guided missile damage bonusyep if you want to change ease of fittings for hams i am of the opinion that fitting hams should actually be harder if anything not easier and generally have more drawbacks currently they provide a big dps advantage close up while still allowing to switch to long range at will and are not even hard to fit on many shipsgetting feedback whether you people agree on any of the above would be nice
mm i read the first page and what i seen by the op seems wants a easy win ship learn to use the best what you been provided every one else seems to know and fly better than you on this ship dont like the cerb then change ships simple
actually jim is arguing that the heavy missile spec cerb is worse than the ham spec hac when using hams and thats really just working as intendedthe only really valid concern here is that javelin hams might be overpowered
well i agree for all except the pwg fits that means most caldari ships cept maybe the drake wont be able to use themit doesnt make sense for the missile race not to be able to use a certain type of missiles lol
agreedcould change this by increasing heavy missile velocity further at the expense of flight time  so same range as before  which would mean that though you get nearly as much dps at nearly as much range  for a significant velocity penalty i might add  it takes longer for it to travel the distance and start hitting the targetpersonally i dont think this is a problem as you are trading a lot of speed to get the range meaning that a ship can avoid damage while applying it effectively  with heavies  by staying at higher speed while the javelin ham using ship cannot deal much  due to the heavy missile users speed  and takes moresac gridcpu is based on mwdinjector5 hamdual mar tank with maxed fitting skills that just squeezes on  if you want to balance grid requirements with tank helps if you use the right tank mods  ham drakes ehp style fit is balanced with other fits in its class and trades having buffer regen for less dps when compared to platecanehp harb and more dps for less ability to repair and resist cap warfare when compared to 1600mm plate fmp harbtherefore i think this conclusion poor and based on false premisedoes this not make hams less viable on a caldari ship than now at least as it stands one damage type gets a boost
the sac has a 3ksec permanantly running mwd and has full tackle so anything fast enough to pin it down with a web  huggin rapier not included  is going to die i would say that having more effective hitpoints more speed  permanantly  and full tackle more than makes up for the fact that it has  thermal resistsas for the sac being limited to hams well thats just total s there are videos in these forums showing nano sacs using heavies excellently with very nice range a sac does the same dps with heavies as a cerb except with kinetic just like the cerb with hams except that the sac tanks better is much much faster and has full tackle and all the cerb gets is a bit of range the cerb is a fun ship to fly but it has no role which the sac cant fill better whether it is in a fleet a small gang and most certainly on its ownthere is no such role as sniping with heavy missiles beyond 100k its ridiculous
while you are principally right in my opinion active tanking is pretty much broken at the moment different issue but comparing a dual rep tank where you need at least 3 low and 1 medium slots doesnt compare that good to a pure 3 low slot buffer tank with a plateand in a sac just using 3 lows and the 2 rigs as tank due to the armor resist bonus you get 60k ehp and 500 dps which is not bad for a hac too much no ideabut anyway using a passive tank and comparing it with eg the zealot where when you do 500 dps with navy multifreqs the maximum passive tank you can fit is around 45k ehp as you cant squeeze a 1600mm plate onwith the sacrilege its no problem at all and you have some spare pg plus you do nice reliable dps of a damage type of your choosingmy experiences with passive armortanking other hacs are non existant but doing it on the sacrilege does seem to be very easy maybe the zealot is just underpowered no experience there sorryi imagine what could have happened  need to look it up  is that the pg of the sac is still the one intended for lasers and thus fitting hams leaves a lot of pg over

most sacs are 2x lse ii  dmg control tanked gives you good buffer of hp doesnt hurt your speed and leaves you ton of grid to spare im not fond of the fact the sacrilege has no cap issues with a mwd like other hacs rather lame
most i have seen are either fit similarly to lyrias  3 odmarbcu  or mwdpointweblse  armour rep optional this is somewhat beside the point of my post the sac has fitting room commensurate with it being an armour tanked ship that plate fitting was just in response to something lucai said about plate tanking amarr hacsthis is somewhat beside the point of the thread which is that the cerb needs a bit of love and i have stated my support for that opinion and also for your proposed changes to give it that love
this is a ed slap flight between a pair of idiots that cant fit ships not supriseinglythe cerb is a long range engagement ship although it has a ham bonus for some reason it really shouldntthe sac is a close range  face ship that can make any solo nanoger run the hell away if you look at them funny
guys a stilleto is completely out dpsed and outclassed by a ship that is both not designed to fill the same role but they both use projectiles damnit this means the stilleto is broken and obviously must be fixed
in iceland torfi franz  or whatever his name was  gave a short presentation on ccps progress with ambulation and i think mentioned that they were thinking of things that people would be able to do while in stations what i propose is an idea for this and it involves basically stealing a feature from lord of the rings online wholesale lotro allows player avatars to buy musical instruments and use number keys to play tunes and things for most people you can pump out a song about as intricate as you could using the ocarina in tlozoot but there are ways to upload song midis into it so you can get it to play pretty much any song automaticallyin lotro you can use a 3rd party javascript program to turn a midi file into a abc file and then you put that in the my gameslotromusic folder in game you whip out your guitar clarinet bagpipes whatever then you type music and then play song then the game will start playing whatever you converted from a midiso if ccp is looking for something cool to put into ambulation do this lotro isnt the kind of game i like  and for the record i uninstalled it before the trial was over  but when i heard about the music playing bit it was enough to get me to try it out think about how many people would be willing to give eve a try if they were enticed by the promise of being able to play hava nagila on electric guitar or scatman on a sousaphone in evethink about it
thisis a far better idea than i would have expected youd get a bit of a different demographic and youd get a lot of people doing odd things with it i want to see this happen just for the people busking in jita 44 and to see what griefers would do with it the intersection of those two cases sounds fun as well now the real question is whos in for making guitar hero a minigame
holy  that is gay hell no
give us this feature i shall busk in the hallways of jita 44 and be the richest man in eve

uhuhlook at this shameful  thinkin  talkin  without walkin  he ain gonna get away with that  if he keeps on startin 
yall z keep in around an get stuck in the ground
im entirely into this idea
never have i seen an idea that has bellowed from the rooftops louderi am a care bear and i want to play bagpipes in space
as long as there are bag pipes and dragonforce im down
bah bagpipes i want to create an orchestra from the bones and organs of a spacewhale and play the 1812 overture with themmaybe blowing up a few serpentis while im at itladadradadadada da da boomladadradadadada da da boom
i was incredibly confused as to why this thread had 9 supporting votes but upon reading ithell yeah
this idea rules
this idea is the worst idea in the history of ideas
sure why not
if by gay you mean totally fracking awesome bro
ill play the skin flute
nothe eve elite do not bring their own instruments from their ships and play in public like a bunch of hippies i have nothing against hippies 
hahahaha
im only going along with this if some kind of synchronized hipthrusting can also be incorporated
those of us who are far happier not to be associated with the backstabbing cynical and ruthless folks who generally consider themselves to be the eve elite might do thoughsince i have an honours degree in performing arts i feel obliged to give this my support although for the record i still think ambulation should be about 200 on the list of things devs should spenmd their time fixingimplementing
supported  it shouldnt be that unwieldy perhaps this could be presented as an addendum to the black ops topic already passed and presented during the iceland trip
ohhhh yes support this wholeheartedlythe nightmare became a t1 marauder wo the tractor bonus the rest of the faction ships meh why bother imo nice collectors items with little use in the current game schemeand where are the faction destroyersbattlecruisersempire faction ships need some serious love theyre entirely pointless subbs but are far far far too expensive for what you get theyre supposed to be rewards for dedication then make having them rewarding give people a reason to go out there and get them blown up
yay to more shiny and actually useful toys  
not supported since removing learnings is not an option for me yes there is an issue with learning skills but thats not the solutiontraining the adv learnings to level 5 for example takes ages and that only pays off if you want to play eve for several years yes i am playing eve for a very long time now and when i entered the game everyone was laughing at me because i trained all my learning skills to level 5  by that time there were no adv learning skills well training the learning skills up to level 4 is really not a big matter of time for a new player and after that its a matter of taste if you want to stay in eve for a long time of only for a few months if you want to train them up to level 5 or not you need check if you like the game and want to continue with playing it or not i think the learnings are good as they are and i wont cry if ccp goes one step further and creats another batch of learning skills which are rank 5 its just another question of time if you want to train those up to level 5 then since you will need to play eve for ages then to make a profit out of that
the primary beneficiaries of removing  ie free  learning skills would be older players who want altswhenever this topic pops up its the older players arguing for removal  cf op  and the newer players in the thread that are saying its fine
i completely agree that learning skills could go awaysome of you say they are an option and that some players may not choose to take themand youd be the same players who point and laugh when someone starts playing and says gee i didnt train those yet should igiven the popularity of evemon and the near necessity of its usage any training plan that takes more than a few days will usually cause at least one learning skill to be suggestedand any eve players guide you could find online will suggest the same thing learning 45 basics 4 advanced 4so those optional skills are pretty much manditory unless you want to spend months trying to get into a cruiser as it stands i hear it takes about 22 years to get all level vs if someone didnt take the learning treeright now people make a new character and then wonder what to do for the first month or so while they get their learning up to parso id agree implants could boost learning as they already do but eliminate the learning tree entirely either make the skills train at the fastest rate they could now or leave them slow and let everyone suffer for itawesome im gonna crosstrain to another frigate only have to wait 2 months before i can fly it
opposeevery time this topic comes up i just laugh to myself eve is different from almost every game in the depths to which you can customize your character with the amount of skills available more choice is good less choice is bad has anyone put a gun to your head to make you train any skillsome call learning skills a time sink it is indeed the opposite allowing you to get far greater reward in return this am i created an alt as close as i could remember to mirror my main   pretty close also there was a difference in only 2 starting skill levels  both toons tuned to favor an industrialresearch line of progression i then loaded 2 evemon plans for this toon to train to fly   fly only   a mimatar titan  ragnorok with no learning skills total training is 44 skills   12 unique  total training time 581 d 9h 31m 28 sec cost 5964570000 iskwtih suggested learning skills 80 skills 22 unique 263 d 6h 1m 12s cost 5989720000the plan calls for lvl5 in learning spatial awareness and iron will lvl 4 in instant recall empathy focusand clarity lvl 3 in eidetic memory and logic and lvl2 in presence if i start today 23 july i will finish august 21it does not take a rocket scientist to see the advantage here 318 days off training time is in no way a time sink it means you have to stop and think am i so stubborn that i hate learning skills so much that i will forego almost a year of training so i can avoid that waste of my timeif you dont want to train learning just dont do it claiming it to be a time sink is false giving everybody atributes in exchange only dumbs down the game remember more choice is goodright now someone that created a character at the same time as i did and concentrated on combat related skills instead of the learning as i have would easily kick my butt in a couple months we will be even and in 6 months i gurantee the butt kicking will be reversed
ooohnow that could be interesting you wouldnt directly train learning skills but they would advance depending on a number of factors  what skills you do have trained and to what levels your total sp etc  that way they naturally over time advance as your character trains more and more skills its a more realistic way of doing it and it would mean you get to focus on training other skills while eventually earning the benefits of the learning skills
that was a fantastic tale and i want to thank you for sharing it with us howeveri heard a quote in a thread a while back and its stuck with me sincepeople dont want variety they want the bestso saying learning skills are just another option while at the same time demonstrating that without them a ship would take you a year longer to get into is laughablerookies just barely joining the game are being told by rookie chat their own npc corp chat and any pc corp they might join that they may as well use their 23 weeks trial time to get the learning skills out of the way then when they start paying they are ready to play the gamethere is no way other than psychotic delusions that anyone could believe the learning tree is anything other than mandatorynow if every skill trained at a set rate with only implants to boost that would be differentif skills trained faster as you accrued sp to reflect your own practice at studying that would also be differentbut saying someone could skip those skills entirely theyll just take forever to get anywhere useful
im not one to present my cases thoroughly and accompanied by extensive mathematical calculations but i feel this one doesnt need such the idea is simple although not really a neccessity itd be nice if all remote repairshield transfercapable ships had a role bonus for remote hull repair systems that pretty much includes logistics and carriers onlysure whod use this in battle its use comes up when a ship is so badly damaged its repair costs are high or for the breaktime in battleseither range or amount bonus if not both it wouldnt give any significant advantages to anyone  aside saving a bit of isk 
anything to make pos  outpost repairs less of a bore
id be happy if the hull repair modules native and remote  would just stop sucking so hard but this change works too
yesfix the bugs let us go a year without a major content patch and spend that time fixing bugs balancing bugged things and making intended things work as intended
it makes sense that i should have access to the entire cargo hold of a ship in my personal hangarwhen the ship is moved to the corp hangar it should revert to only what the ship has fitted  expanders  rigs  and if the current cargo exceeds that i should not be able to remove it from my hangar without reducing the cargo likewise i should not be able to trade it to a corpie for the same reason  because the game cannot factor that corp members skills until the ship is in their hangar likewise if i pack a ship full undock and then eject the cargo remains in the ship  the excess was once ejected in a can  when someone with lesser skills boards the ship what happens theni will issue support for this feature but only while said ship is in my possession
i was gonna say i read an approach to this topic which mentioned that stats have to be taken into account when it comes to any fittings thats why the warning when you eject states some items could fall off if your skills were the only thing holding the ship togetherso thats probably why the cargo seems to shrink because its not actively calculating your skillsi could understand any ship in the hanger taking your skills into account but i would still leave free floating ships the way they are if you pack every inch of an indy and then eject then you should find a lot of excess cargo floating right next to your pod
someone please please kick ccp in the gonads about the damn client windows jumping all over the place resize themselves or close randomly regardless if theyre pinned or not
windjammer through this post you have time and again proven your ignorance and misjudgement its really been something to readendless is 100 correct in his summation that as it stands self destructing is imbalanced and in need of reworking there is no downside to initiating self destruct in any circumstance despite the obvious negative effects it has on your opponents by denying loot as the game mechanics stand now all strong players should initiate self destruct every time they are attacked as a matter of fact they should start it even when they attack someone else if the fight starts to go foul just let the timer go and deny loot if youre winning turn it off in this way by the time the fight goes bad you might be down to a 30 second timer or less as the mechanics stand and if pilots took advantage any fight lasting over 2 minutes would result in no loot for the victors i wont insult everyones intelligence by listing all the possible fights that take longer than 2 minutes to conclude but this mechanic punishessolo pirate work small gangs in small ships that engage larger ships with big tanks any single ship or gang that is low on dpsnewer characters who are due to skillpoints confined to smaller ships typically cruisers and below who engage larger shipsin effect this mechanic is also promoting blobbing and discouraging creativity in setups as heavy dps loadouts will be required to extract loot from smart players who initiate self destruct as for those of us in this post who have not seen this be a problem and thus believe it does not need to be changed this logic is seriously flawed on a fundamental level as endless simalarly put it players not using a broken mechanic because theyre bad is not an example of a blanced mechanic it is an example of bad play this logic is akin to living in a town where murder is legal but figuring that this is ok since you have never personally seen many murders lastly all claims that not bringing heavy dps is somehow less honorable or poorer play are moronic and again discourage creativity pilots shouldnt be punished for equiping modules other than guns if it still gets the job done just a little slower
remove insurance on selfdistructmake pod pop toothats all
given the very nautical nature of eve the idea of self destruct is more akin to scuttling a shipthis is done when one is overpowered in order to deprive the victor of their spoilsso the game is working as intended
heres something of a first im not going to respond to what he wrote i believe hes so obviously wrong i dont really have to point out the flaws in his thinking anyone can see themwindjammer
ima gonna come in here and make a really stupid argument that is as stupid in this issue as in another nottobenamed issuedeny insurance for self destructsmuhahahhahahahahhahaha
you know this made me wonder if this was the reason the csm failed the first time
not supported there was a vote for the csm next time vote different but nope this is not the way
i support this idea she should be removed from the whole csm
democracy doesnt seem to be a well known concept in this thread 1  people voted jade into the csm position if you dont agree vote differently there is nothing else you can do and there shouldnt be anything people voted jade and thats it for this term2  you do realize that democracy doesnt work like someone gets voted and then represents your interestwhat actually happens ispeople state their agenda to get voted and if they get voted in the ideal case they support this agendaat no point they have to turn around and support anything else or even things people that didnt vote them wantthey may try to do that to get voted again next time but regarding one term its simpleperson a has a personal agenda person a gets voted to support that agenda person a works to make that personal agenda come truecsms are not supposed to personally each single one cater to the whole of all eve players they are sort of supposed to cater to the people who voted them but in reality they are supposed to represented themselves as people supposedly voted them based on their personal interests and stated personal agendaits a miracle how so many people are seemingly so naive regarding democracy
just found this thanksinannapeople should probably read it before looking stupid in here
when i started reading this thread i was neutral i have however come to the conclusion that the position of chairperson as currently administered is impeding the work that could be accomplished my stepfather was the town moderator in a small new england town for many years for those unfamiliar with the forum a traditional town meeting is a pure democracy the various committees and boards make proposals for local laws budgets and the like also citizens can propose articles for a vote at the town meeting at the appointed time all registered voters are welcome to attend the meeting and vote on every articlethe moderators job is to keep the meeting flowing maintain order and allow for full discussion pro and con on all items the key to acheiving this is roberts rules of order this assures one topic at a time is on the floor and discussion is restricted to the item in question and all arguments that have reasonable bearing on the item are allowednow my step dad was good our meetings stayed pretty much on topic and i never recall anyone having an opinion to express being denied an opportunity to speak hitting a mute button seems a failure in leadershipmy personal experience involved establishing small civic organizations having been elected chair my first suggestion was to establish some rules rule 1 we would follow roberts rules of order rule  2 the chair could suspend roberts rule 3 the chair could invoke roberts at any timethis gave us a firm foundation in established rules and also the flexability to be less formal if we so choose rule 1 for rules and budget meetings rule 2 for most othersit worked very well part of it may be my upbringing when it comes to free speach i firmly believe in the saying  i disagree with everything you are saying but will defend to the death your right to say itthis is the attitude needed if a chair is to be effective the chair should only vote to break a tie   or create one   they need to be as neutral in all matters before the committe as humanly possibleand they need to hear all valid arguments pro and coni do not want as chair someone with the power to prevent my representitive from voting   i did not vote for any of the people mentioned in this discussion but the one i did vote for is on the council  if the actions of the chair invalidate the vote of my rep then i am disenfranchised actions like this will doom this adventure to failurethe responses posted by jade in this thread lead me to honestly question if he has the maturity required to lead this endeavor a better way need to be implace to prevent a total collapse of this experiment

all polycarb rigs in the galaxy should be taken off the market stuffed into an iteron mk5 and warped straight into the center of a sun and incineratedspeed tanking is dumb insanely dumb i am tired of hearing people say its not dumb because it is on the contrary dumb if any ship is going to speed tank it should be frigates as they die insanely fast otherwiseif i hear one more person say his dual lse ii vagabond with 9k shields and 75604050 shield resists will instantly implode if it goes 35kms instead of 8kms im going to screamyes this is ruining the freakin game ccp ruining it big timerawr
supported it would seem that its an oversite in design to allow them to so easily be destroyed easily corrected too
citadel torps badly need boosts and a lot of them drop their rof 30 seconds instead of 48 would put damage fits of the phoenix and naglfar about equal with the moros for dps which is appropriate given that they have flight time as a concern  increase their hp dramatically and triple their speed while reducing their flight time by 23 itd dramatically improve my defender missile suggestion too but thats incidental making the other two dreadnoughts playable is a worthwhile change in its own right
 
agreedput all faction items into the market database so escrows are not neccessary and a price valuation can be established  primarily for ships insurance should be a percentage of total market valuation throughout eve discarding prices that are wildly out of variance to the norm ccp has all market data available to them the computational code should not be too difficult after all evecentral does itthis insurance becomes dynamic at the time you buy itship loss due to self destruct  concord have no payout not even the default 30 a flag should be inserted showing the relation between two ships however in instances where noncorps accidentally shoot one another while ganged in a mission but it must be resolved solely via petition  to recieve insurance only not to reimburse the ship for whoops factor

why give the harpy double optimal bonus granted its in line with the eagle cormorant and rokh but as an antifriginty vessel tracking would be much more viable
i agree 100 with the op fixing afs by giving them the same mass as their t1 hulls is such an obvious and simple thing to do that you have to wonder why the devs have not done this years agoi think the reason has something to do with the devs not wanting a viable entry level t2 pvp ship to be able to be flown effectively by relatively new players  eg only 6 months of fee paying note they are happy with new palyers using an effective t2 pve ship though effective afs should be fun to pvp in even for players with years of fee paying skill points not all experienced players have the isk to burn on losing lots of 100 million hacs on daily roams however most players could afford to field and loose multiple afs and would have more fun loosening lots of afs during the same roams into enemy territory than looseing a single high priced hacps yes i know some people retort saying that giving afs the same mass of t1 frigs will make interceptors not worth flying but this argument is obviously false to anyone who has ever flown an interceptor because we already go against such ships as a t1 nano rifter which achieves speeds of about 35kps while fitting t2 guns the ops change to af mass would only allow af to match the speed that their sister t1 frigs already have  eg afs 30 to 35 kps get hit by regular missiles flying over 375 kps vrs interceptors 60 to 120 kps which can out speed even a max skill boosted cerbs missiles flying at over 8 kps 
not going into details i support the general idea
this is badly needed assault frigates could have a lot of potential
i agree we just need to flesh out what the role of the assault frigate really is nowadaysfor the most part as it stands theres nothing an af can do that a cruiser cant do better and cheaper
afs need 4th bonus
i like the fix of making af using afterburners immune to webs more than this solution
why not make all abs give resistance to webs and keep their minor speed boosts and give afs a bonus to said ab web resistances too broken
this is a pretty good idea one of the better for afs could make them alot more fun if they were more tankable andor had more dps
a few things i think would nice to have ingameit seems only logical to add gallente navy drones to the gal navy lp store since the gallente are the drone racegallente ships that specialize in certain drones the ew ships should have a bonus to ew drones mining ships should have bonuses to mining drones no more blanket bonuses for drone use we have enough of these all purpose ships ships with bonuses to specific tasksstop giving everyone drone use by making them standard fair on all ships you make them hard to balance and expand for the gallente as an effective drone or drone module for a nondrone ship is overpowered on a ship like the ishtar or domi if you cant do that then be fair and give the domi a couple missle hardpoints what i could do with a couple of thosethe gallente invented drones and it should show from having ships built to use specific drones more effectively to offering special drones in their lp stores the gallente should start to be a little like the story that the devs have written about them and less like the caldari
i agree with this but i think it would fall under the topic of a general rebalance that is already discussed in another threadlook here
the reason is it requires more skills and more bpos thus it serves as a barrier for anyone wanting to break into the field whether a new player or someone whos done something else for a while and decides to try it out
i dont get it how you guys come up with such things it is just as if you had an idea but never think about all the factors ever missing the big red sign in the middle of the road much  thumbs down
which big red sign would that be your opinions are far more useful to us if you explain what they are
i support but only if you remove t1 items as loot
supported and would do so again and again
yes please this will add much needed complexity and realism to t1for those whining about having to actually do work to build t1 ships and mods just buy the components off the market directly this will allow newer players to build components and sell them to older players who dont wish to botherfor those complaining that their slots will be clogged i recommend that many more slots be added to lowsec stations this will give industrialists  of which i am one  a reason to go to lowsec
its an intriguing idea but my fear would be the effect on prices and ship production profitlets say for sake of example a producer buying minerals and building a ship looks to make 10 profit on mineral costs to sell the shipnow lets add in an initial producer producing components from minerals that are then used to build a ship either  one producer does the whole process himself and sells for 10 above mineral cost or  a producer produces components seeking a return above mineral cost and a producer produces a ship from components seeking a return above component costin the first case one guy still does it all and all the new idea has added is another step in a producers processes that isnt particularly excitingin the second case  if the ship price and the mineral costs remain the same the two producers will each receive a reduced profit  if shared equally it reduces production profit down to 5 on materal costs  or  ship prices rise by 10  broadly  to mean production remains as profitable as everi am not convinced the balance of the market is such that prices would simply rise by 10 i suspect that in practice there would be a small rise since there will always be a number of producers willing to do the whole lot themselves and provide downward pressurethe result would be that  starting producers and producers not running the whole process would suffer reduced profits from componentship manufacture  producers with sufficient infrastructure in place to run the whole process themselves will see more profits coming their wayid vote no on that basis since i think there is already little enough profit in tech 1 production for smaller and newer producers i do like the idea of adding complexity to the production path  i am a producer myself  but i dont think this is the way to do itfin
should have been there from the beginning
how do you add complexity to production if you keep the onestep path of minerals plus blueprint equals spaceship
i supporti support the removal of named items from loot and the replacement with components to keep minerals from rattingmissions oki support as a step in implementing meta bpos for all nonfaction gear to be player made as well
short answer  not this way as i stated and for the reasons that i stated  i think you may have misunderstood my statement  my own fault as i wasnt clear enough  in my opinion the career path of a producer needs more complexity  i referred to this as the production path   this does not need to equate to adding steps to the existing production processin fact i think that adding a new first step to the existing production process is going to cause more harm than goodmy argument is that as far as i see it  the proposal is likely to make production less profitable for new players and not exactly encourage them into production as a result  new producers can aways build modules  do they really need a new barrier to entry to producing ships and the option to build components at what i think will be lower profit  on the other hand  the proposal means that existing experienced producers will be buying components to build ships rather than buying minerals to build ships  now thats not exactly enhancing their game play eitheras an example of what i think is a much better suggestion  another thread has suggested introducing an advanced form of tech 1 production to get higher meta level modules with use of skills and possible other components this adds something to the production path and is far more worthy of support i am sure that there are other suggestions that have been made or could be arrived at that add a new feature to explore and make production as a career more complex adding an extra step that potentially harms the smaller producer isnt the way to do itfin
dumb idea i dont support this at allnot only will it drive new players away from production  because new players will not have access to researched bpos so will be forced to buy it all they cant research them as there is no research in empire for a new industrialist unless they own a pos  but it will add another layer of time into ship production that is simply not neededleave things as they are theyre plenty complicated enough as is

tl dr defenders suck and any suggestion is probably good
a possible fix  not to redo your idea  is to introduce a specialized launcher for defenders themselves you activate it and it stays on until it runs out of ammo the way it works is if it detects a missile being launched at a friendly target it launches a defender to intercept simple
defenders are useless atm something needs to be donebtw also take a look at npcs using defenders plz maybe some changes will make less ppl using  navy  ravens for missions with a missile boats missions are too easy anyways everybody uses a raven another issue golem 100 bonus to missiles but plz also to missile hp since it would suck against any ship using defenders
defenders have needed fixing for a long time now and this seems like a balanced solution kudos
actually each race should get a countermeasure system specific to that race as a dedicated utility moduleamarr  guidance overload pulse battery  burns out missile guidance they fly off uselessly until out of fuel caldari  defender missile bay  what we have now gallente  flak battery  long range aoe  potential to eliminate many missiles at once minmatar  phalanx interception battery  high rof autocannon that chews incoming missiles to pieces each one adds a different flavor to the defensive method and range to engagement but overall each being equally effective
current situation turret support mods   5 damage mods  low tracking computers  low tracking enhancers  mid target painters  mid web  mid turret counter mods   4 tracking disruptors  mid ecm  mid remote damps  mid speed mods  mid low missile support mods   3 damage mods  low target painters  mid web  mid missile counter mods   4 possibly 5 ecm  mid remote damps  mid speed mods  mids low smart bombs  high defenders  high as it stands now missiles have more counters against them and fewer ways to improve their performance when compared to turrets turning defenders into a missileonly countermeasure without offering a low or midslot mod that improves missile velocity explosion velocity flight time etc is entirely unbalanceddefenders belong in the game once missile ships are given more mods to improve their performance
indeed few would have full racks of defenders unless of course they were attempting to protect a capital ship from a dreadnought firing citadel torps in which case a raven  or couple of drakes  could completely negate a phoenixs ability to do damage does that seem right to you
while point defence systems are an excellent idea  as any realworld armed service will tell you  its unfair that only missiles should receive countermeasures rather than launch missiles in bulk  since we dont like doing that in the real world  maybe just give a percentage chance of success for deflectioninterceptionjust as an example i havent given this a great deal of thoughtrockets 90 chancestandard missiles 50 chanceheavy missiles 35 chancecruise missiles 25 chancetorpedoes 10 chanceand so onas explained above this concept should then extend further to other modules types which would intercept or perhaps deflect  ie reduce damage from  shots from projectile hybrid and laser turrets wed have one module for each class needless to say the firing rate of any such modules would probably have to be zero since its possible to fire the entire 8 gun rack simultaneouslyscratch that wed have two modules one which protects its parent ship and one which defends everything within its protection range it would be ideal if protection chances decreased the further you went from the protector but aside from being  i presume  a pain to programme youd only encourage everyone to huddle around the defender like a metallic slime mouldthese modules could work in the way hitachi morimoto described you simply turn them on and they defend you until they empty themselvesthe big question is whether or not they would be vulnerable to ecm im inclined to say yes on this point with perhaps modules that are invulnerable to ecm available on the side but requiring large amounts of cpu as they need to use their own sensors instead of leeching off the shipshmm i just thought of a new possibility for a logistics class cruiser  which increases interception chance range and gives a cpu need bonus such a thing might make fleet engagements more interesting  or at least longerlivededit what slots would such modules take up turrets or launchers if were doing missile interception with defenders fired from launcher modules thisll leave those ships without launcher slots high and dry just a thought though
well tbh that was what i asked myself when i first entered these forums id like to see an answer to this question
please make sure you search before posting a new thread this was one of the first issues raised
even if raised before still needs thumbs up for thumbs down
or you could go to the original topic and register your support there instead seriously if you guys want this issue implemented then one topic with 100 supports against it is going to be more likely to be noticed than 10 different topics with only 10 or so support on eachedit link provided to original thread
or maybe ccp should pay a few people to moderate their own damned forumshow many hundreds of topics are reposted every week if not every day because there is no organizationand even when an attempt at organization is made such as commonly proposed ideas is stickied at the top no one reads those or theyre out of date and dont reflect the rant of the week
heh teach me to post while im tired and hungry that last post came over as just a little bit too sarcasticin a way i can understand the original poster in this i struggled to locate that thread with the forums own search function it took a visit to evesearchcom to track it down though that in itself is an issue that needs to be resolved
i also see this as the tail wagging the dog if your guns have a hard time tracking why would you invent a divice that requires you to get up point blank where your long range guns lose are pointless and invalidate half of your weapon systems and the other half not be absolutely fantastic i could understand that if webbers worked at long range but they dont for a reason so that argument is dated at besti could see an argument for the minmatar using target painters except again it nerfs the minmatar just like ecm nerfs the caldari if signature radius was a much larger determining factor in hitting a target then i could understandexcept signature radius is insane and completely out of what as well it seems to be based on lottery when creating ships as opposed to anything elseexample compare the signature radius and physical size in game of a rohk and megathronrokh 500m megathron 400mguess which one is bigger when parked side by side the mega
id prefer 1 balance and fix expension to 5 new  pseudo  content expensions
my understanding of the original ideology of the races and the stories about them support this ideology yet the actual modules and statistics in the game fail miserably at upholding that ideologygallante used very large slow ships with drones to fight the caldari successfully yet now their ships are faster designed for close up combat and for the most part have smaller signature radius than caldari ships direct departure from perceived intent and written cannon of the gallente the gallente do armor tank which is fine but isnt the added mass of armor counter intuitive to speed and agility doesnt size directly relate to signature radius wouldnt the larger heavier gallente ships be slower and have larger signature radius than smaller faster caldari ships they should but in reality they are not the cannon also makes reference to gallente ships being good for orbital bombardment seeing as though the atmosphere and gravity well of earth requires you to reach a height of around 100km above the surface so why would a blaster boat be a good orbital bombardment platform when its best ammo wouldnt reach the surface much less allow it to cover a wide area of the surface drones protect them up close and rails protect them at range their bonuss and ship designs should reflect that but for the most part the bonuss are completely oppositecaldari used smaller faster ships to fight the gallente successfully yet now their ships are slower apparently larger due to signature radius and seem to be specifically geared towards staying at long or very long range from the enemy which would go completely against having a smaller faster fleet  again a direct departure from cannon the caldari shield tank which few will refute is for the most part inferior to armor tanking yet shields have no mass why would they be slower and have a larger signature radius why would a military society depart from the configuration that allowed it to hold its own against a much bigger opponent i also never understood where this idea came from that the caldari are missile s as far as i have seen the cannon never mentions the caldari missiles being the reason why the gallente developed drones it does however mention that the caldari responded to drones by creating frigates not missiles they didnt create huge lumbering barges that spewed missiles like crazy they used smaller faster harder hitting vessels as a combat multiplier and to offset drones missiles work well against drones but only because they dont use mwds unlike virtually everyone else that is pvping today haha i killed your drones before you owned me sucker yeah that is attrition warfare something that the smallest population in the galaxy would not be suited too there is nothing wrong with a race being missile s except missiles are so incredibly useless compared to guns that you nerf an entire society in the process they sure can run missions though continued
amarr have huge ships that focus on getting in and soaking up more damage than the other guy their ships are not always the slowest which seems a little odd but what really gets skewed is that the best tanked ships seem to have the best overall weapon system yes they consume cap and this can be an achilles heel at times but they also require no ammo do a huge amount of damage and by far have the best overall tracking of turret based weapons now all of this wouldnt be so bad except that other than a slot for an after burner or micro warp drive all the mids on an armor tank are open for use as either cap rechargers or some type of ew which further expands the usefulness of an armor tank while shield tanks suffer the exact opposite fate of being highly restricted and still being worse than an armor tank this is compounded by the fact that cccs bear no penalty while all shield modules do though signature radius is almost pointless which brings me to the minmatarthe minmatar are the biggest mutts in eve they dont know if they are shield tanking armor tanking hull tanking speed tanking or missile whoring they certainly are not sniping because arty couldnt fall out of orbit and hit the celestial body pulling it much less function respectably as a weapon system autocannons are decent and very much depend on the ship they are on rather than being a premier weapon system the problems with minmatar guns are compounded by a very small clip size think about what happens when there is lag  and the rate of fire that is uncharacteristic in the face of modern weapon systems the 1650 mark 7 406mm  could be hand loaded every 30 seconds by hand and thousands of years into the future we have only cut that time in half thats the 16 inch guns off of the battleship missouri which was made over 60 years ago for crying out loud as another poster pointed out they supposedly developed webbers so that they can hit stuff but how does that help when a web range is so short how likely is it that rather than just put a faster tracking system into the design priority you would instead develop an energy based weapon system of little relative functionality that defies the laws of physics in slowing down its target but not actually effecting how much thrust the engines are producing but somehow effecting the mass of the object without developing the opposite of this system that effectively makes your ships have zero mass and therefore zip around at any speed you like why would it not be more likely that a race that has really slow ships that have tons of armor and specializes in energy weapons would be the ones to develop a weapon system that slows the target down seeing as though they would never catch the target if it tried to run away without webbers ok reality aside webbers are a poor excuse for poorly executed design so they added target painters as another form of minmatar support that doesnt work either signature radius is a joke i could throw 3 shield rigs on my rohk with 5 large shield extenders and a mwd and still see very little additional damage due to my signature radius being the size of a small planet i suspect its because if sig radius worked like it should arty would never hit anything much less something that movedamarr should be the slowest toughest have the slowest tracking guns and rely on webbers to slow down targetsthe gallante should be slow tough primarily use railguns with range bonuss drones and tracking disruptorsthe caldari should be fast weak primarily use short range weapons with damage bonuss and ecm or sensor dampeners preferred the minmatar should be fastest weakest have the hardest hitting short range guns with the best tracking because they are simple they should rely on ecm to suppress their targets because if they are targeted they are webbed and screwedimho

third thread about this in as many weeks we should merge them to get an accurate count of the votes thumbsup of course
logging to avoid getting blown up is lame doesnt matter whether its lowsec 00 or war targets as long as the system doesnt compromise the ability of a nonflagged target that is not in imminent danger to exit the game i am in favor of eliminating this issue
you diminish the strength of any arguments you make by framing this topic in a racist manner
having run into this myself  1 wt abaddon 1 neutral domi smacktalking and repping and loosing drones when i attempted to jam his double eccm fitting then having 2 guardians show up and join in repping the abaddon  i am entirely for puttinging some real smackdown on neutrals getting involved in warsim for thisneutral reps my wt he immediately becomes a wt for the duration of the war not his corp  theyre free to support him if my corp attacks him with the same result  just the neutralor get concord involved just like they do now if you rep an npc and give the guy a sec hit not as bad as suicide ganking but a definate downward adjustmentcurrently it is used in empire wars like drones are all the bloody time
repping someone that has a 60 second no jumpdock timer running should result in a 60 second no jumpdock timer this should be classed as an exploit untill its fixed properly
i already brought this up in iceland and the devs agreed that it was pretty stupid so itll probably get fixed sooner or later heres a thumbs up for you anyway
yep its a hopelessly broken loot tablesuch as dark blood ships salvaging for t1 salvage parts
whilst i completely disagree with the op from the stats they look awesome something needs looking into herethe components can be collected slowly with a great deal of effort but the augmented bpcs are just stupidly rare looking through contracts bpcs and built drones i found a total of 5 augmented hammerheads at 300mil no others were available
they need to be made much more common and overall the drones should be notably better than their t2 counterparts these things should be the navyfaction equivalent of drones not the equivalent of officer loot that isnt any better than t2
yes the components are a bit easier then most think to getthe bpcs on the other hand are like finding hens teeth after 50 sites i have found one  1  augmented hobgoblin bpc to date i have dozens upon dozens of integrated but only that one augbut stop and think about itif they ever introduce the upgraded drone modules or the drone implants they are working on then these drones need to be rare because they would quickly become overpoweredpersonally i am just glad to know there are augmented hammerheads to find as i was worried that the hobgoblins were the only ones availablealso gal navy drones are logical and it is kinda stupid they dont exist in the lp store of the drone using racebut i dont think the augmented need removedso didnt support
as i started in another threadt2 ammo is worse than stupidly cheap faction ammo  big money maker these days faction cruise i dont care if the t2 ammo is great or sucks for itself id just like to have the idiot drawbacks discarded entirely so that t2 actually has some use value
agreedshort range t2 ammunition is just useless and badly designed compared to navy ammo

hells yea
the longrange t2 ammos seem fine  null and spike both give you greatly added ability to engage at ranges longer than their respective weapons can usually muster with tracking as their only penalty thats perfectly acceptable javelin is interesting  railguns going into blaster mode albeit with worsethanrailgun tracking  but the speed penalty is absolutely horrifying a full rack of javelin will cut your hyperions speed by 57 void is nice to look at and good for people on a real budget being about 14 the price of cn am  but its only combateffective against a welltackled target which one cannot safely assume tracking penalties on longrange ammos are one thing tracking penalties on shortrange ammos are another thing entirely and the cap recharge penalty on hail while less bad than it could be in most pvp situations is still a huge kick to the teeth narmios ideas seem reasonable make javelin a tracking ammo with lead damage at antimatter range im not sure about void  the dps your face aspect appeals to me greatly  but it needs something other than an infinitesimal dps boost at the cost of significant penalties you can do damageshifting you can do a lowsig ammo or you can just make it a noticeable dps boost though that last would probably be unbalanced  but the current state of it is just not right also for hail and quake specifically change the cap recharge penalty to making the guns just use cap its not like the game mechanics to allow it dont exist
the bonuses should equal the nerfsin the above examle where void reduced speed by 57 then its damage should be increased likewise  or damage  rof lower cap use whatever  should equal out to be a 57 advantagejavelinprecision missiles should not have their range halved to keep their increased flight timevelocity from letting them go further than their t1 counterparts thats just stupid and then stacking on a velocity penalty to bootone thing that has always irked me about eve is that penalties are always 10x more extreme than benefitsthe limitations on t2 ammo is illogical as well as t2 modules dont have penalties  slightly higher fitting reqs  skills at most  and t2 ships dont have penalties why should t2 ammoone of a long line of idiotic ccp decisions
thisagree
t2 long range ammo are finet2 short range ammo are crap
who cares if the ammo is good or sucks just removereduce the doggone stacked nerfs when loading a full rack of the stuff
remove polycarbs add a stacking penalty for speeds mods increase mass and decrease agility of all heavy assault ships
a balance to nanos would be a cap on speed by ship that gets more difficult to attain the closer one gets to itsay 6kms for inties 3 for cruisers 15 for bs this will enable them to travel fast and even escape but give everyone a decent chance of catching fast shipsreduce the bonuses on snakesbut dont reduce it so far that everyone ends up doing just the opposite and sitting there in super slow tanks that just sit there and slug it out
just add an extra attribute called structural integrity or inertia stabilizers  yeah same name as modules  this attribute would decrease your agility and some mwd speed if your ship has too low mass and too high speed thus preventing the ship from tearing itself apart at high speedsinstalling extra inertia stabilizers would restore some agility and speed but nowhere near whats it like todaythis will effectively serve as polycarb nerf while not really nerfing them so ships can still use them provided they dont reach their integrity limit this will also give ccp a chance to really adjust ship speeds as they intend and dynamically adjust it further if necessaryspeed issue needs a little more complex solution then just nerfing few modules and ships it needs a permanent and satisfactory solution cookie cutter approaches  like nano buff  creates more problems
caldari have no bonuss for dronesusing ur logic i wld be saying that the mega has missile launchers and is therefore a missile boat i never said thati said that gallente have some missile boats why cant caldari have a nonbonused semidecent subcap ship that can field at least four heaviessentriesi mean damn its not like im trying to make caldari the omgraceofdoom im just asking for a small change wtf why are ppl so frigid
you make it sound like im asking for the scorp to get 1079866 dmg bonus to drones missiles ecm or somethingim not im simply suggesting it be able to field at least 4 heaviessentries why do u think thats so evil scorp is least use caldari bs atm this may help it a bitadv spaceship command is equally useless for all races yet from carrier training all the other races benefit more from the drone support skills that make it a good option to use heaviessentries effectively on their subcap ships while caldari miss out
thisi wld not give two hoots about drones if i didnt have to train carriers  sure i dont have to but the alternative is a rarelyused dread lol and capital ships are v important in eve so its good to be able to use them   caldari shld get an alternative for capitals like with their bs tho this cld be pretty extreme and the other races wld need another cap as well so im not sure about that one iding the niche for them cld also be hard

hi circycas a new player myself having only just reached 1mil sp today i can in some ways relate to your arguments but i believe the essential problem here is a question of mentality specifically the mindset of a new player when approaching the eve mmo concept and build as a whole i will digress a little and get to that a little further if you dont mind indulging mestraight off the bat this game is not easy its not hard but its not easy tutorial is definitely helpful and it covers the essentials the rest comes from experience the rookie channel and a little further from the corp mates you make as well as non corp buddies you meet and befriend along the way it is clear from the get go the emphasis is on you no silly npc ships with glowing green question marks above their head no stupid quests to get x amount of y item to create z anime scenario for 100 xp gainself reliance is the name of the game adapt struggle push learn and enjoy eve solves the endless problem of lack of endgame content by being without a endgame scenario people have been playing for years and ive yet to see even a percentage claim that they have reached the end and have nothing left to doi referred to mentality earlier no mmo should cater to every single potential player and personality type in my opinion eve caters to a specific type and does so exceedingly well this game requires an inquiry and persistant mentality a personality who appreciated and dare i say demands that not everything is handed to you on a gold plate but rather wants to earn through time and effort the appropiate rewardsthere are no shortcuts in this game consider even the isk economy it doesnt matter that a new player on day 1 could purchase a billion isk from some farming website what are they gonna do with it except have access to only what they learnt to have access to i appreciate this game is not for everyone and yes it can scare away those looking for a simple challenge but not all of us are here for an easy and short ride to power and some half baked status easily acquired eve is not a mmorpgits a simulation an enviroment modelled in fiction but paralled in build with a reality close to rli dont want an easy ride i want a challenge i want to earn my status and reputation in this simulation by effort perseverance and intent this game reserves that simple quality which has so escaped so much of the online contentthe satisfaction of accomplishmenti hope you stay ciryc and anyone else who has been challenged by this game i thank you for at least having the patience to read through this if you did and will go off and struggle some more in game loving every second of it i hope you will join me there mate
industrial salvager  meh would be slow as heck unless it also comes equipped with lows and mediums enough to partconvert it into a nanoindustrial personally im happy cleaning as i go with my mega  or kronos should i ever be bothered to buy one  and using a salvagefitted destroyer to mop up anything too far away for my bs to crawl within tractor range
csmlet your voice be heardselectivelyhow dare anyone question the status quo
of course its selective do you want monstertrucks in eve but that doesnt mean we i assume this is true for other csm members why else would they be on the csm  actually do not read threads and do we care at least i do i even go as far as talking to people i know about certain issues the vocal minority is mostly presented on these forums csm also needs to talk to the silent majorityi would suggest you to actually go and read the assembly hall its all about questioning the status quo i have suggested several ideas which will fundamentally change the way eve works jade has also challenged the status quo by suggesting destructible outpostsso you are once again making up silly things

yes you are right
what kind of question is that uhh yes

implement asap signed
love it
sorry if i formatted the title on this incorrectly i was so eager to post it after i spent an hour making itissue lp store offers need cost balancingmaybe balance if a tag like that exists
iv is to low
im not sure i care too much about reducing the jump lcone time i mean year 24 hours is a bit unfair but there should be some penalty for crossing time and space   i would however like to see more clones i don have enough as it is to fill with different implant sets for different roles
yes to skillbut rank 8 yes 8 charisma ftw
aye
supported my alt needs one
an invention time bonus would be next to useless i certainly would not have paid for the implant for my alt if that was the bonusits been over a year now can we please have this implant working as originally intended thats what i paid for
yes yes and yesbtw i support this
even though they shot it down i say we keep signing it anyways yarr
balance balance balancethe station campers know where to go those undocking are blind sitting ducksallow those undocking a choice of direction
thats where youre wrong its the highest priority docking games are zapping people of their will to pvp
resistanceboosting implants for drones would be cool  add a skill for that too like 2level 
more like a miner issue
medium and heavy mining drones are long overdue imo i think retooling the procurer with 1 laser turret to get drones bonuses would make it worth something the t2 version could even lose its strip miner and get a bigger bay and 50level drone mining bonus  remember kids a 250 bonus to 5 heavy mining mining drones would still have to compete with a hulk using 3 strip miners as well and the medium drones 
it could use a boost but it does serve a purposemany have a couple days to go from it to a retriever so they use it versus spending those 4 days training up to use a cruiser and then spending another 4 days getting up to a retrievera good example is those going mini engineer and working into barges they feel the training is better spent on the barge related skills vs adding in the frigate and cruiser skills  they still go for a bit into industrials but focus on the mining barge really 
aye this ship needs a good look
id like to see it get a role bonus to say mining veld amount then it would serve a reason maybe even make it mine more veld than a cov with barge 5 and for the love of got gie it some cap and maybe even 15m3 drone bay to help kill the high sec belt rats
again why would anyone design an entire type of ship to mine a single flavor of oremercoxit i can almost understand with the explosion or whatever but again its not hard at all for a hulk to sit outside that blast radius and mine like mad and saying this ship can do it faster makes no sense when the hulk as 3 strips and the procurerskiff has 1so whether its mercoxit or veldspar why would ore make a ship just to mine that when they could design larger forms of mining drones and make a ship that specializes in thosethen that sad little lonely ship will actually see some use
the trick is the skiffs bonus to mercoxit mining yield much like the macks to icea tricked out hulk is 82 units and hour vs the skiffs 1640 hr  quoting from the miners guide 
which is all fine and well but whats the point how is mercoxit the single most valuable mineral in all the universe that ore would design a ship to collect such massive amounts i could understand if mercoxit were the fuel that powered every capacitor but its not im pretty sure its just another ore to make another mineral to make something else mostly a handful of t2 modules and some faction ammounless im missing something here then i think its a waste of a ship and the training to operate it when its only good for a very specific purpose
current price is 12k per and you get 2 unit per unit of ore so it is one of the rarest minerals
merc is needed for every t2 item its that mineralt1 item  random stuff  mercoxit  t2
and veld is the most common and needed ore why not make a ship that starting miners can mine in and it would have a purpose in any mining fleetin its current state a mining cruiser is better and a ret can mine more ice in what 2 days of training so veld or even veld and scord  non region spec ore  can be mined faster but with no tank and has to jet mine then it would have a purpose for all miners to have one
not everyone trains for cruiser though so it is a big boost from a frigatebut yeah it needs tweaking tank wise at least  all the barges and most of the exhumers do 
awesome idea i think it will greatly stimulate new edens economy and trade more stuff can be moved around without endless little hauls with no margins to give away to the hauler or move stuff with one large haul with risk and lack of frequencyidea to the ingame specs some slots to configure it  not too many to keep the defined role apparent   perhaps enough to fit a warpcore stab must be able to hold a base of one freighter cargo container  120k m3s  keep the price around 100150 mio so the investment will be in line with the ability to use it in lowsec also if you make it too expensive people wont take it in lowsec wich could use some more good logisticsrb
we already have ships for this about the only thing that will stop them is a ewar boosted heavy dicter
and to stimulate more lowsec travel it would be good that it has less effect to webbing it with more skills on the one that pilots the superindustrial
please please please dont allow these things to loadunload in space except at a pos youll see macro mobs with them everywhere towing in entire beltsi would like to see them have a few utility slots  bonuses to fitting logistic modules  range only on energy xfer no quantity boost  to support their own escort fleet with built in warp core strength modified by pilot skill  2 points per level  and commedable tanks
yes look at freighters give them some midlow slots so the stupid things can fit stuff to affect their cargo or speed or whateverjust increase the size of repackaged capitals by a factor of 10 and they still wont fit in a super uber expanded freighter of suicidally large tasty cargo
agreedhauling ore during ming can be done fine with industrials and the roqual was already added to make mining ops better this new ship should be directed at moving stuffz around through gates at longer distances not the short distances that can be covered by industrials
removing the sandbox element from eve you seem intent on turning this into wow in spacegtfo
fixing an issue does not always mean removing it it means fixing it
suicide ganking doesnt need to be fixed the fact that people think theyre safe flying 50b worth of stuff in an unescorted autopiloted freighter is a smart idea thats the real issue that needs to be addressed and it is in the form of suicide ganking
man the longboat
needs to be honestly where is the organic stuff in evesure they are going for more real than fantasy but dont you guys remember that cool episode of star trek i could supend my disblief for that
do want
ccp will never implement this theyre not high fantasy muptardsthen again they did give us the oompa loompas

spending development resources on things that already exist outside of game and do it better does not get my vote

qftim a carebear mission runner  i only play for an hour or two a day tops which is mostly spent running level 3 missions for lp  i find they can be turned around for lp faster than 4s  if i was missioning for isk though 4s would be the way to go  if missions are nerfed or i am forced to move into low sec to get them eve will have lost a subscriber  and id leave my stuff to my corp so no you cant have it and im sorry ki an for proving your point but  i like the game mechanics but dont like pvp and am bored to tears by mining and industry so missions are about all there is left to keep me in the game and if that goes im not so wealthy i would continue to support ccp  
if you are only doing missions 1 hr a day  especially if you do lvl 3s  you are unlikely to feel much impact of this limitation other than perhaps getting better value for your lp
fao esmenetwhat drugs were you taking when you proposed this its completely ridiculousi would like to know what lunacy drove you to consider mission runners get life easylook at the factsa mission runner can earn 20m an hour on a good day a ratter can earn 60m per hour on a bad day on top of this the ratter can come across faction loot and officer spawns with potential to increase profitability from millions to billions for little to no effort the mission runner gets no such boost sure a misison runner can use the lp store but it pales in comparisongranted there may be some difficulty transporting valuable items from low sec to high sec to cash in on the value of loot but its the mission runner who probably ends up buying that loot anyway to get an minimal improvement to their ship in the vein hope it would boost their performance to increase their iskhour it does work you get about an extra 1m iskhour for every billion spent its downright pathetic while the ratter can fly around in dirt cheap ships and not give a crapthen youve got the added problems of actually having and using faction gear as bling as it may be you get the s who would rather suicide gank you  with no financial loss to themselves if they fail due to platinum insurance paying more than a raven costs these days  and take your gear in less than a minute and sell it to another mission runner or in the worst case right back to you as a ratter chances are youre going to be ratting within friendly space anyway with yo which is going to alleviate a lot of the risksi mean sure maybe a ratter may have to look over their shoulder in case they get attacked and keep one eye on the system scanner but at the end of the day most ratting ships are practically worthless the ratters get so much more isk so much more quickly and theyre much more able to afford a replacement a blinged up mission runner working for peanuts can end up bankruptthen again if anything having to look over your shoulder adds to the fun do you have any idea how much mission running 16 hours a day for 13rd of the money a ratter gets sucks its so repetitive and boring id be greatlful of an enemy to keep me entertainedthen there is lag ratters may get to experience this when they participate in fleet but floating around what is most likely an empty system populated by yourself and the rat in your pocket youve never experienced the horror of what a decent quality agent can bring if the ratter experiences overcrowding you can just  off next door but the mission runner has very little options but to go to a mission hub to earn top dollar but because every other bugger ends up their too it ends up worse than jita with a fraction of the players making the missions difficult if nighon impossible to runmisison hubs also attract scum griefing can be fun but when mission running is 100 of your income and some muppet with a 2 week old alt probes you down and steals all your loot you can end up with  all for your troublesyou can argue well dont fly what you cant afford to lose but when a mission runner cant afford half as much as a ratter because the payouts are so crappy what are we supposed to do join the fellow man and rat in 00 wouldnt that defeat the whole purpose of the missions also its not as simple as it sounds to get out there and join you  the bigger bodies will not want you due to lack of skillpoints on in game experience and you wont want to join the smaller bodies because theyre usually noobs who will add you to their ranks to become a name on their list and not someone with qualities you can bringto top it all off rats are an equally infinite resource did this not occur to you in your nerf everything so its finite rant if anything should ne nerfed its the ratter if anything should be buffed its the mission payouts rewards and the laggy hubs
legit where do you get 60 mil an hour what are you smoking first of all to get that up to the point where you are getting trip 18mil rats you need to find a trues sec system and then you have to work them off by killing off the crappy spawns just to get to that level then you chain them it takes about 15 minutes for each one to re spawn once you chain them it might take up to an hour before the crappy spawn is replaced by a better one and then its not guaranteed you will get a better one so it may take you 4 hours just to get it to that point thats if you are not dodging every neut that pops in the system and every gank squad will look on the frigging map and hunt ratters in the best systems and as far as missions i used to hit 30 mil an hour right out of balginia so get you facts straight no spawning no chaining and i did not have to worry about someone ganking me in my mission because after three or 4 hours my raven was paid off i had a short and relatively safe route to a market hub
1  so eve should abandon its own design because people want to do what they wish to do for every person who leaves because they dont get a ton of riskfree isk youll get 3 who joinstay because of the improved gameplay2  he said per agent each corp has a lot of agents translating into a lot of potential missions per day 3  so how do miners afford stuff just because theyre not getting a huge amount of isk for riskless work doesnt suddenly mean theyre going to be dirt poor4  read above thats bull besides they wouldnt get isk from them anyway since they sit in hisec5  alliances have no issues making isk just because missionrunners make a little bit less isk doesnt mean that everyone is going to stop buying deadspace modules6  if someone was willing to buy isk anyway do you think theyre actually going to chain missions day after day you know there was a time when missions werent as profitable as they are now the economy then did just fine i dont agree with all the suggestions exactly as in the op but something kind of like that needs to be done id say remove agent quality or add in dynamic quality based on number of missions taken to spread out missionrunners more remove bounties and severely nerf loot but increase the isklp rewards solves a lot of problems1  eliminates laggy mission hubs2  mission runners arent the primary source of minerals miners have their role back3  mission running is now a bit more unique and interesting since lp offers are more important
mission running  rewards have been nerfed and rebalanced and nerfed and rebalanced ad nauseum since exodus releaseit works as is though the lp goods are far far far too pricey for what they provide compared to even lowend faction stuffbalance the lp rewards to be in line with other faction goods but otherwise leave missions well enough alone
to be completely frank if this change were to go through i would quit i dont mean this as an emoragequit type of thing but just as the simple truth i really dont have that much time to play anymore what with work and a class that i am taking but with what little time i do have to play i like to run missions i have been training into mining in the hope of being able to play more often since you barely have to pay attention but that is a ways off because of my limited playtime most corps would boot me if i applied due to inactivity and i would most certainly be unwelcome in 00 corps who rely on active players to maintain their space and keep operations running smoothly many of the people who frequent the missions channel in game have similar situations real life preventing them from taking up more active roles in game but they are happy enough if they can run missions running missions in low sec is sort of a farce i know how easy it is to track missionrunners down and how easy it is to blow up a mission runner who is set up for pve  i have an alt who is adept at probing people down which i have let expire recently due to lack of freetime to play ive always enjoyed the pve parts of massively multiplayer online games and i would be disappointed if missions were nerfed into being wastes of time but to be perfectly frank i probably shouldnt be paying 15 bucks a month to be able to mission on weekends anyhow it would probably give me a good reason to quitone request if you do succeed in this endeavor remove belt rats as well its only fair as you can farm rats all day in a dead end 00 system usually without seeing another soul out there in space at all and whats more there are the chance for hauler spawns faction spawns and officer spawns in my limited time in 00 i would do this all day instead of missioning and it was just about as profitable often more so if i got lucky and most of the time i would be completely by myself alone in the system might as well remove all those pesky iskfaucets ehU518DU89C1
what part of this thread said haha lets make missions useless
well perhaps not to that extreme but when i see a message that says limit the number of missions you can get pr day for instance 1 mission pr agent in high sec 5 missions pr day in low sec and 10 in 00 nerf mission bounties from high sec missions perhaps half of what it is today  remove some  all  loot give each agent a limited total nr of missions he can give out pr day or pr hourhmmm lets say my favorite agent gives me duo of death since there is  potentially  no loot and bounties are halved ill get what like 2 million isk yay there goes my mission with the agent where i have all my stuff if i want to mission again ill have to fly who knows how many jumps all my different setupsammo in my hold to another crappier agent that is if i can even get a mission because if they give out limited amounts of missions per day i might not get to play at all unless i log on after downtime yes that would be extremely convenient for me considering my playtime is already limited lately the system where i mission has about 75 people in it had only about 30 when i first got there hope there would be enough missions for that many peoplegranted this is looking at it in a rather negative light but at the moment i cant see this as a boon to more casual players such as myself but like i said i am pretty apathetic about the game lately so it would just give me a good reason to kick the habit just do me a favor and get rid of those isk faucet 00 belt rats and special spawns like i asked while you nerf missions if you are truly serious about fixing risk v reward and isk faucets ruining the game
this has to be the best mission running renovation idea ive read so far itd reward clever players and automagically balance agents based on the risk and location itd also neatly incorporate the pvpsupplydemand aspect to the system making mission running more in line with the rest of eve what kind of an agent would pay premium anyway when theres 200 pilots available as for the arguments about ratting being more profitable than missionrunning lots of people seem to  purposefully  use kinda skewed numbers say 20mh for a mission runner indicates t2 fit at best andor a lazylowskill pilot maybe suboptimal ship etc as an example i know for a fact that i do 2040mh not including lp in a t2 typhoon which is generally regarded as a suboptimal ship on the other hand 60mh for ratting indicates youre doing it alone in a system with enough belts and close to best true sec those conditions arent quite as easy to meet in a lot of 00 in fact theres complete regions where this is totally impossible due to true sec in any case ratting is a limited resource where you compete with other players firstly by securing the space so you can rat at all and secondly only a limited amount of players can rat in that space without affecting each others income changing missions in a way described above would make them follow the same design and probably only increase the profits of a clever player
the difference between missions and belt rats is that belt rats are a limited resource so their profitability is sort of selfregulating and the pvp aspect is always present even in hisecanother thing to consider is that a change to mission mechanics doesnt necessarily have to translate into a nerf a dynamic system like described in one of the posts on the first page could actually reward smart players while distributing the load more evenly across the whole of eve and somewhat addressing the riskreward issues concerning lowsec
i agree with the concept of agent quality being dynamic with agents only having a limited number of missions available in busier systems agents should end up telling people sorry i have no work available for you right nowi agree with the idea of removing unnamed t1 drops from npcs please let npcs only drop stuff worth picking up if they drop anything most of the unnamed t1 stuff just ends up being reprocessed anyway  this hurts me as a miner  missionrunners generating so many minerals  and hurts me as a missionrunner  having so much junk to carry back to base while lootingsalvaging 
my specific suggestions are not so important the main idea is to introduce some sort of competition to mission running similar to all other professions this is done by making missions a limited supply in some form and in addition scale the profitability with the systems security rating
if you guys really are hellbent on introducing competition for missions perhaps consider removing agents entirelycut out the middleman is an old clichUFFFD and theres no reason not to apply it here as well rather than forcing folks to huddle around specific stations maybe give each corporation one big mission board which constantly spawns new missions the board  like everything else  should have range restricted to region players can only take one mission at a time  with perhaps a trainable skill allowing you to increase that number  to reduce exploitation of this skill there should be severe  standings  penalties for failing a mission proportional to the number you have open currently standings would still have to limit the quality of a mission available to a playermission board might be something like thismission name  level  system located  reward  lp rewardideally there would be a constant supply of  randomly spawning  missions of each level so people would always have something to do the advantage of this system  as i see it  is that isk grinders will have the option of flitting between different corporations searching for the best missions while lp grinders would be forced to stick with their chosen corp hmm that gives lp grinders a raw deal but that should push up the lp rewards prices  which people want yessince there are no agents there are no huddlings of players in certain systems missions would appear at random points on the map meaning everyone would be more evenly distributed it also makes looting more  in the sense of less  interesting since you have to trundle back home to fetch your looting ship then fly all the way back again some players might not bother if the time taken is too long this reduces salvage and thus  potentially  makes miners the primary resource providers again another advantage of removing agents is that ill no longer have to deal with people who sound like their rectal implants are malfunctioning i would like to point out that removing these missioning hubs might hurt some traders particularly those who are able to sell items at a premium in those hubs because missioners are too damn bone idle to pick things up far away for a few million less if im being forced to move around this wont bother me too much i just thought id point it outhave i missed the point of this thread entirely
i have to say that this is an attrocious idea big thumbs down as the idea simply suggests reducing one player groups income  which they have trained for  you also in the process damage a lot of social skills that players have trainedrisk vs reward is currently unbalanced but the solution is increase the rewards in null and lowsec not decrease the rewards in highsec as this heavily punishes the casual gamers  such as myself  and rewards more hard core playersi would like to point out that casual does not mean 1hr per night but also includes one 4 hour session per week i often log on for four hours at the weekend earn my isk mission running and then have enough to do fun stuff during the rest of the week if i log on or have enough that next weekend i dont have to
op sounds like someone who rats in 00 and thinks he is superior to high sec mission runnermost high sec mission runner use isk to fund their pvp without this isk most casulal pvpers will leave the true carebears are in 00 ratting in cloaking ravenscloak ratting in 00 should be nerfed as its almost impossible to die thats the real curse in eve today not high sec missions low sec missions are about as useful as pilgrimsalso low sec missions need to be boosted since people wont bother with low sec missions since its easy to get your amarr bs ganked by 6 minmatar mothership hotdrop on a gate players would love low sec more if it wasent such a waste of timerepeating point again  the carebear is the 00 ratter ratting needs to be nerfed not missions
stop taking drugs so you will not have visionsyour whole idea is people should play as i like wrong people should play as they like in eve you are fully entitled to try to block other players to play as they like but through in game systems not asking to change the game to favour your play stile and remove other people play stile
i wish this was true the problem is that depending on the issue at hand i have heard either version of this argument  fex when it comes to nerfing a pvp activity carebears claim that all people in empire are carebears and that they outnumber the pvpers in the game and when it comes to nerfing a pve activity suddenly these same people are actually pvpers just trying to sc isk together to go pvp not this again very few will leave and to those that do good riddanceyes they are also a problem and deserve their own threadboost low sec missions nerf high sec missions nerf 00 ratting too for all i care but keep that to another threadyes a boost of low sec is in orderboth can be carebears and both needs a nerf
sort of like the carebear call to nerf suicide ganks then
australian players would love you and all those that play in the last hours before dt  half of the us too  sorry west coast player the europeanest coast players have already depleted my mission for today but you can go to agent xy it is only 20 jumps and he is a 4 18that beside the uneven distributions of agents between the empires  caldari alone have more level 4 kill missions agents than gallente and minmatar together 
you have noticed some real decrease in suicide ganking in the last years i have seen an increase and yes barring the stupid part where suicide ganking cost almost 0 isk thank to insurance there is no need to nerf it and the insurance part is more a problem of the insurance itself and current ship prices than of the suicide ganking
what has this got to do with anything i simply asked if you by saying that you shouldnt call for nerfs in a playstyle just because its different than yours applied as well to carebears calling for nerfs of suicide gankingso i take it you are against that nerf then
lets be honest here a ratter in a bad system can get 20 millionshour in isk  so immediately available  using a bc has a decent chance of a faction spawn each day for another probable 50100 millions in faction gear  so practically doubling his income  a ratter in a very good system can get up to 50 millionshour and several faction spawns every day a mission runner get 20 million iskhour from rewards and choice lootsalvage using the best agents in the best systems using a pimped up bs worth over half billion and run a decent risk to be ganked if he go owerblown with the ship  2 billions  accept only specific missions and keep them open to farm them he can get maybe 30 millionshours
what you are forgetting here which is sort of the point of this entire topic is that ratting in 00 is a limited resource sure the potential income of a 00 ratter is much higher than a high sec mission runner but were talking realities here 00 systems especially those with good true sec are often overrun by other ratters trying to make a living a 00 ratter always has to look out for hostiles and even if he has a cloak he still cant rat while those hostiles are presentthe high sec mission runner never has to worry about if other people are doing missions or if hostiles are in the system provided hes not at war sure ninja looters might come in and spoil some of his income but all he has to do is finish the mission and turn it in hell still get payed from bounties and rewards then he can fetch another mission and go at it again theres no end to itthis is what is imbalanced about this whole thing
that competion is already there in the form of selling your product wether theyre lp items minarels or lootthe profitability is already scaled even tought the scaling should be a bit more accentuatedas for your idea of somehow limiting the number of missions per day it could easily be bypassed by using alts to accept missions or cycling different agentsand just what do you think your little brainstorming will do to factions ships and officier mods marauders and 5 implants there is a demand for those things because there is a place where they have a decent life expectancy so long that the pilot using them isnt stupidyou think a large part of the highsec population will go in lowsec if they cant do missions in highsec stop deluding yourself most of those players just dont want the risk of pvp and nerfing them wont change their mindmissionrunning in highsec isnt completely safe and you might to repeat it 10 times in your op that doesnt make it true you can still lose your ship to lagdesync you can get wardecced you can lose it against wreck salvagers or the like you can get suicideganked ratting in 00 isnt really more dangerous as long as you keep an eye at the local and intel channelsps i find it funny that someone who isnt showing any corpalliance tag should speak about bringing more players in 00 and playing with a group
generally well thought out ideai like that kill missions require boss tagsdna to be returned to the agent it also irritates me that agents cant be remotely contactedso alternativelya  player contacts npc corp central hub via a general interface available through the corp infob  player than gets a random corp agent offering a jobc  player can acceptdecline remotelye  acceptdecline consequences still applythis would spread players out across missioning systems and refusing a lowsec mission means you cant ask for another for a while as currently
visions like this scare me there is a problem with risk vs reward in 00 so lets nerf missions in high sec in an attempt to resolve one issue there is a vast potential in causing many moreccp as a money making corporation needs to generate income as much as the hardcore rats try to make out theirs is not the only playstyle ccp needs to address not every subscriber plays the game 6 hours a day 7 days a week some people have other things beside eve in their life and as a result are more the casual playermissions work well for the casual player nerfing missions that a casual player or any player not inclined to be a pvp rat use to enjoy the game does nothing to improve the plight of the 00 rats instead of proposing a nerf that would impact a very large part of the casual market perhaps an increase in the reward in 00 would be betternerfing missions has the potential of reducing the subscriber base while not offering 00 rats any benefit increasing 00 rewards would keep the casual player paying each month and possibly increase or at least maintain subscriptions from 00 ratsthe wining move is to change 00 not nerf high sec missions
well lookit dat its the subscriptions argument again wont someone think of the casual gamerno the casual gamer can go play wow
my facts come through running missions 1216 hours a day for weeks at a time since red moon rising  
i totally disagree with the opimo the only thing that needs looking into is some form of load balancing to enable mission runners to spread out more either by having a dynamic quality or by removing quality entirely
what about highsec poss kindof takes a crap load of time to grind your faction standings to 5 when you get a storyline every 16 missions but only if they are with the same agentanyone consider how long it takes to get jump clones under this proposal yep definately going to entice people to go into lowsec 00 and pvp there well lookit dat its the im elite and you are a turd argument againone word which you should be familiar with and the devs say constantly sandboxoh maybe my current siggie will help too
maybe i didnt explain well enough but thats not the issue at allits not a high sec vs low sec00 post its a missions versus any other means of making iskminerals anywhere in space regardless of sec status
if people run their missions in low sec id imagine it would take about the same time as today the difference being of course that the people would actually have to work for their standings as opposed to grind for them working in this case means organising a defensive effort to keep a system safeomg teamworkin my sandbox the people with friends will push out the people without friends and stomp on their sand castle the people without friends usually puts in effort to make friends come back and stomp on my sand castlesome people however cries about it takes their toys and goes home guess which cathegory of people succeed in eve and which doesnt
sure give even more isk to the big alliance members which holding 00 space and can kill joucy rats even with lower risk than highsec missions bigger bounty faction drops if ratting aligned amd within own space is 0 risk i never lost a ship in 1 year in 00 ratting just if i wasout to pvp
right
my guess would be because ratting is an equally infinite resource of isk is a load of s as have already been explained in this thread please take the time to read it
dont see how the quotes are in oposition to each other if its too hard reading between the lines why dont we just add two words to the original sentenceits a high sec missions versus any other means of making iskminerals anywhere in space regardless of sec status
exactly its not a nerf missions as she claims its again one of those nerf highsec topics you know the ones you always show up in to show supportmoar meat in lowsec cos us wants moar to gank and killno thanks
nice opening the rest of the mail though is either unhonest or uninformed ratter in a bad system doesnt get even close to 20millionshour because bad 00 systems got crap spawns andor are overpopulated so you dont even get to keep the crap spawns for yourself as for faction spawns people tend to chain good spawns to maximize isk and in my experience if you chain a spawn  ie dont completely wipe it out to get a new spawn  you dont get faction spawns i havent extensively tested this though so i might be wrong wont be alone though if someone proves this is false on the other hand if above is true you either get top iskhour or you get the chance to get faction spawns 99 of faction spawns also drop crap its not that dg invu hg implant or large tower bpc every time this is where you go totally wrong either you dont have a clue you totally suck or youre trying to bend the facts to suit your agenda i personally do 20m40mhour  not including lp  in a t2 fit typhoon a ship that is generally regarded as a suboptimal missioning ship the agent i use isnt best possible either and i only use one character too considering my average is somewhere around your 30mh figure not even counting lp profits id assume someone using proper ship  golem cnr etc  with deepspace mods and who has perfected their routine can easily do double especially if they use an alt to lootsalvage
i can then understand how you might overestimate the ratter on a bad day by such a margin if youve only done missioningwhat i cant understand is how with that much experience you claim that a highsec mission runner on a good day only gets 20mhour either youre blatantly lying or doing something horribly wrong when a relative noob like me can consistently pull 50 more without even trying to optimize the process
if you use deadspace mods you have just painted a big bulls eye on your hull youre much more at risk than in 00 and you overestimate a lot the gain in efficiency with full faction gear maybe youll earn 15 to 20 moredont bring up the alt argument because said alt could be used mining  30 millionshour in a good 00 system  and salvaging isnt exactly the same profession than missionrunningi fly a marauder with top skills and i do the average 1517 millionshour in bounties 5 millionshour in rewards about as much in lootsalvage and maybe 12k lphour lets say 8 millions from the lp is that too much i could do as much ratting in 00 for 20 of the investment
 ki an perhaps you should suggest the following business model to ccp casual players f emhopefully ccp wont agree
its not really a secret that this thread is about nerfing high sec missions the title is pretty clear on that dont know why you treat it as some sort of hidden agenda you managed to dig upand you dont know  about me so please stfu about that focus on trying to come up with real arguments instead you know arguments that you use in debates 
the business model stick to your vision and people will play is more along the line of what i am suggestingif you wanna go ahead and propose your idea im not gonna stand in your way
i think you homogenize 00 too much to be very accurate difference in income in some secure alliance deep 00 and fex syndicate is huge id be surprised if you can consistently come even close to your mission running income in syndicate be it mining or ratting as for your marauder income its lower than i expected but then again i have absolutely no idea wether youre good or bad at what you do ie do you represent some of the top iskmakers or just someone average or even poor  for the skillisk investment  my crude estimate was based mostly on the income i do and the obvious shortcomings my ship and setup has compared to a professional mission runners tools and the fact that i am by no means a professional mission runner myself so theres possibly room for refinement in my tactics also also to clarify my position on the matter a bit im not that big fan of the suggestions in op i do realize however the fact that missions work differently from mining and ratting due to being available infinitelythe best idea in this thread so far was later on the first page the one where agents would have a list of missions available new ones added at set intervals  depending on sec agent quality whatever  and the missions would increase in rewards until they were completed by someone this would make missions work the same way as rat  roid spawns ie they would become limited in the sense that new ones would appear only so often itd also somewhat autoadjust the rewards based on how riskydesireable players would find doing missions for agent in whatever location essentially spreading mission runners around and making agents in inconvenient locations give better rewards and add a pvp component in to the mix by a bidding contest  should i take this mission now or try to wait for better rewards and risk someone else taking it in short less lag and more opportunities for a smart player to earn isk doesnt necessarily have to even alter the average mission income one way or another  though lazystupid people would find theyre doing less isk  itd still be a lot better system than the current one
i get 20 millions hour in slightly negative systems even with some other blue in the system if the system is overcrowded i can always do 1 2 or at worst 3 jumps and find a empty system again i get 20 million hours chaining only the very top spawns in my experience respawning from 0 is faster than regrowth of a chained spawn and i get more chance at good spawns while the low quality spawns die very fast and i get faction spawns with a acceptable frequency low sec and no i doubt your suboptimal t2 thypoon as all minmatar ships it can choose it damage if you want suboptimal try a mega against angels it is possible that getting a lot of angels missions you get more than 20 millionshours without pimping much your ship thanks to the tritanium bars in salvage but i would be curious to see the breakdown of your isk generation how you count the time  it must include the time used to lootsalvage if you do that  and if you use multiple character  most people claiming to do 40 millionhours forgot that they are using a alt wingman going to 20 millions hour per character whoa wild assumption here you can ask leandro salazar he is the guy doing that and i dont think he get even close to 60 millions hour
hisecthe fact that using a mega against angels is even more suboptimal is irrelevant you cant base balance decisions on the short bus kids  or perfectly sensible people whose goal just isnt maximizing isk gain  who insist on using wrong tools for the job what i meant with suboptimal t2 typhoon is that if i were to specialize in running missions there is better tools available a flaw that i instantly recognize is the somewhat low dps with sentries and cruises somewhere near 450500 dps  autocannons dont count since theyre useless half the time  second is the somewhat weak tank which while a nonissue when managing aggro properly becomes an issue on certain missions due to drones forming half the dps and aggroing whole pockets third one is that if you use sentries you cant travel gates while killing stuff and if you use heavies their actual dps often sucks due to travel times for comparison a pimped torp cnr can probably reach 900 dps has more range than my sentries doesnt have to worry about drone aggro and can shoot things while moving for these reasons i assumed itd be considerably more effective than my phoon dunno how golem does with torps but the ability to lootsalvage on the fly would definitely mean extra income at least on those missions which i judge not worth lootingsalvaging in dessy afterwards i havent tested the marauders myself so im not sure wether youd get better iskhour by salvaing what you can during the mission and skipping the dessy part on other missions also someone who aims for max iskhour will ensure that he gets the as much missions against his preferred faction as possible for me with a skimpy armor tank ship its sansha but someone flying the aforementioned torp raven would probaly prefer angel more due to trit bars and easier tanking again its stupid to argue that mission running income is bad if its bad for you just because you insist on running missions against sucky factions as for breakdown a good mission for me would be fex the sansha blockade itll take about 40mins to complete and brings in 23m in bounties  rewards iirc along with 6k or whatever lp salvaging and looting in a dessy afterwards takes 20mins and typically nets another 1520m unless i get especially lucky or unlucky thats how i arrived at the upper figure of 40mhour i seem to remember people reporting figures upwards of 50m in a max income forum thread some months back but that of course doesnt prove anything however for reasons mentioned above i expect some people are indeed doing that
now if some one is out ratting angels in a mega is plain stupid that is their own fault you would get into a domi with the correct drones with damage type the person willing to make isk ratting who is focused on nothing else would choose there tools properly some one hopping in a belt with the wrong set up is not a true ratter he is a passive ratter just grinding up some isk for a new mod or just bored legitif you posted more realistic numbers i think you would have less flack and a better debate as it stands your post was almost flame bait actually it borders on troll mode
im not really sure why you quoted the part you did but your statement is blatantly false im not sure if you are lying or just dont know but high sec missions has just about the same iskh ratio as most of 00 ratting with almost no risk whatsoever the only risks you run is falling asleep in front of your keyboard and the rats popping you shooting back at lootthieves and getting ganked in your overly pimped out iskmobile summarized the only risk you run is being stupidyes i said it the only and i do mean only way of losing a ship in a high sec mission is pilot stupidity barring a war declaration  although if youre out running missions during war times you can probably be regarded as stupid as well 00 ratting might not be well implemented in its current form but the topic for discussion here is high sec missions and their complete imbalanced nature
legit got a question why are you not ratting in null space if missioning in empire is so dangerous and the rewards suck so much this is a question for anyone else that like to answer this
i do not support the opi dont run missions no but i dont think such a change would be good for the game  see my mainline arguement in the suicide ganking thread  instead look at increasing rewards in lowsec00 to worthwhile levels instead of decreasing rewards in empire ratting in 00 is usually a good 2025m an hour for comparison once you get setup and assuming no one is bothering you  haha fat chance  and you are alone someone in the thread said you could earn 60 an hour so that gave me an idea if 60 an hour is a fair level of income for heavy 00 ratting to you why not put in place a 30x rat bounty multiplier on rats in any 00 system and a 20x rat and mission bounty multiplier on an rat in 01 to 04 sec systems while highsec rewards are untouched in addition introduce more quality level 4s and lvl 5s in lowsec areas dont be focused on prohibiting current professions and players focus on improving and expanding the game one thing i would love to see is a sort of mission system for player built 00 outposts with an appropriate range of agents
so in essence it is harder to rat in those systems or maybe more dangerous perhapsso if someone is trying to make the cash has the difficulty of getting there goods to empire to sell to make up the other half of the isk per hour ratio you were throwing out there hmm i have never had an issue move my rat loot from balginia to sell nor have i ever been ganked in a lvl 4 mission i must be missing out on all this death and destruction of all these missioners player controlled regions and space is not guaranteed i have seen some null sec alliances in empire after losing there ratting heaven i am sure glad my agent doesnt do that that would be a real pain in the ass if the system is safe it is because the person ratting took the initiative to be a part of that group and willing to pay the commensurate taxes to rat taxes can run on average  some lower some higher  around 20 so your 30mil per hour click is now 24 mil
i dont really care youre crying already so why not continue doing something you knowmaybe some visual aid will help  the following is a snippet from my post which you quoted with almost no risk do you see where im getting at hereis this another version of the ageold i know you are but what am i argument
next time i should remember to put a irony marker near the megathron comment key point you havent addressed are  in your 30 millions iskhour are you counting the time to salvage a lot of people giving his mission time forgot to add that  you are playing alone or with an alt again generally people going above 20 millions hors are playing with an alt following them but then the 0 million income should be split in two
well said absolutely agreeim not sure about hard limits on missions but replacing them with some sort of exploration would be great then have a mission like the current ones as a storyline once you hit a certain level of lp or another triggeranything to bring missions more inline with the riskreward of the rest of the game would be great and maybe even make missioning intersting
i dont know what to say do you really believe what you are posting i mean its something only the mentally ed would say high sec is the wild west do it 12 hours a day 7 days a week for several weeks then talk i mean seriously1 if your only purpose in this game is to run missions which is basically what you have been telling us it should not matter one whit what they pay 2 a high sec hard core mission runner is not picking the peanuts out of  they are wealthier than those of us who try to eek out a living doing other things such as mining or piracy 3 nobody has to run missions for 12 hours a day 7 days a week for several weeks to know something about mission running in fact someone who runs missions for 12 hours a day 7 days a week for several weeks is probably the last person you should ask about game balance and probably someone who should seek help for his obsessive compulsive ways4 your posts are so idiotic you can only be trolling so heres a premature  you for trolling me
3 years experience dude i have noobs that have a better grasp of the game than you do for someone that has been in the game for three years you would hope heshe would understand how things work by now and with your statement of running missions 12 hours a day 7 days a week just makes you look to be a farmer dude and it also means if you are spending that much time with your head in the hole like that you have no concept what else is going on in eve short of forum whoring so you really have no idea at all about null sec or anything else when i saw the 60 mil per hour statement you made i knew right away you were guessing and or trollingnow you have confirmed it thank youas far as the missions i do not want to see it get bashed to death to where it is useless but in the same light afking through a mission is not the right thing either i am not too crazy about the ideas presented by the op but i do understand they are ideas and from here we can tweak them to make it palatable for all  on a side note if you read the banter from suicide ganking thread and come here to read this thread its amazing how perceptions are entrenched in eve 
dudekikisettle downthe thing thats most prevalent about this thread is that it seems to be just another people should be playing the game the way i play it or thing it should be played kind of thing this is pretty much in the same category with all the threads with the whiners begging for suicide ganking to be nerfeduselessso wat if johnny everyman stays in high sec all the time and grinds missionhow does that affect you and why should we care and if its as overlyrewarding as you claim it to bewhy arent 00 and lowsec systems empty all timenow i like lowsec and i love 00 and i think everyone should experience them for themselves at some point in their eve life but its not up to anyone not me not kian and his hilarious broken english  not the op  to force another player to do experience it or to force another player to play how they think the game was meant to be played high sec missions arent overrewarding theyre not underrewardingtheyre just another game mechanic thats there to fill a niche for someones play style in this case the casual gamerand it does its job well
interestinga proposal that only targets high sec mission runners without considering low to no sec rattersone of the proposals listed in the op would be to force mission runners to move about in high sec with all their gear aboard their mission shipnow that ccp has stated that suicide ganking is to be looked at as the reward to risk is imbalanced is this an attempt to increase a suicide gankers payday by not just getting whats on a mission runners ship but also their other fits all in one big target that has to travel to make their living in eve under the proposals stated by the opi do not see how the proposals address the issue of the isk faucet that mission running is supposed to beconsider dedicated mission runners can make a lot of isk to do this they train for a great period of time tanking  two weapons systems at least they run the risk of ninja salvagers and suicide gankers while practicing their professionsyounger players have actually few ways to make isk early in fact they have virtually only two options mining or mission running while they learn the basics of this very complicated game and yes there are always exceptions these proposals would choke off the entry of new players into this game as i see it it would also turn away the casual players who make their isk from mission running returning players who have taken a break from eve may also find it hard to come backi can find nothing to support this proposal that would be good for the game
what he said so no im sorry you hate empire and missioners so much that you would be happy to see ccp lose a lot of money from n00bscasualsand dedicated missioners canceled accounts
hey my english is pretty ok for a guy living in a friggin iceboxanyway this thread isnt about us trying to make anyone play the game how we want them to play its about balancing the rediculously overrewarding 99 safe high sec missions yeah thats right
lolthis inglish think was funny joke comradexdbut seriouslyeven if it is overrewarding which i still stand by the fact that its not  why should it be made a priority to be fixedthe thing ive yet to see in this thread is an explanation or list of reasons of how this adversely effects the eve community as a whole
i suggest as a solution to the continuity problem that the csm elect one of their members to automatically return next time as a means of passing information and solutions of course you will probably want to make a rule that this person cannot hold any of the higher csm positions to keep it truly democraticseems like a good idea to menatas
if you are serious about this then you also cannot ignore mining with guns  rats  in the drone regionsremove crap t1 sure keep named or add named bpc no to extra lp
oh granted  im a smallgovernment freemarket activist irl and i certainly agree with the point you were trying to make i disagree with socialist lines of argument anywhere but in eve theyre not merely wrong but also silly as for hoarding wealth there are incentives to do so personally i feel uncomfortable with less than 100 million in my wallet  i want to be able to replace clones implants and mission ships without having to hock assets to do so i routinely save up more money for future purchases and stockpile pvp ships for future use the point i was trying to make is that a demandshock recession  one whereby a crisis of consumer confidence rather than any underlying factor slows the economy  causes pain because people become fearful and stop spending for fear of future need the best example of this in recent memory was the us economys slowdown after the 911 attacks  americans stopped spending as much and the economy suffered as a result despite the fact that virtually none of the real economy was affected at all this is virtually impossible to create in eve since people do not worry about losing their jobs or being unable to provide for their families and people are playing it for fun which includes large purchases of things that strike their fancy rather than worrying about budgeting and such ccp could probably cause one if they wanted to but theyd be fools to try as such savings of cash are not strictly necessary which is what i was saying above and frankly this is a good thing  realworld family finance is both boring and unfun and its not something i want to inflict upon eve especially not with no credit market to speak of there are reasons to hold cash nonetheless but it doesnt have the same level of necessity in tough times as hoarding irl why do you want to encourage hoarding anyways
yes
if you want to introduce bpcs as loot rather than refinable goods then ccp is going to have to do a few things they have no choice as the game would suffer far too greatlya  eliminate advanced mining features from nonwar declarable npc corps  not the militas b  massively increase the ores available everywhere and lower the refines from drones yet againc  get hugely aggressive toward macro users or implement simple macros available to miners  oretocan onship refining ect  and still get extremely aggressive toward macro users to the point of invasively snooping pc active processes to detect macrose  increase factory slots available everywhere by a factor of 10 and drop the manufacturing times on everything since you now have to build twicef  allow introduction of these bpcs directly into the invention process
missions should be for isk lp and faction standings loot should be rare but provide interesting items  high metalevel t1 bpcs etc  missions also serve as a source for salvage matsmining should be about obtaining raw materialssomeone piloting a caldari navy raven should not be turning in more minerals per hour than someone piloting a hulk especially considering that in missionrunning the minerals come to you while the hulk pilot has to navigate their slow cumbersome mining barge to the asteroids  with the implication that theyve been through various systems in a scout frigate looking for the best mining opportunitiesanother way of balancing mission risk to reward is to make missions a finite resource just like asteroid belts encourage the mission runners to spread out to find agents who actually have missions to be run agents could even refer mission runners on to other agents who have lots of missions within four or five jumps this would inevitably push mission runners into losec where the hungry hungry pirates are waiting begging for more cannon fodderhow many birds can we kill with one stoneedit i run missions and i mine id really love it if my several months of training to fly mining barges would put me in line for a similar income potential as training to fly a t2 drakewhat id really like to be able to do is make enough isk per month to just keep my characters ticking over so i can escape wow to play this modern version of elite once in a while  
im not so sure that stopping the steady flow of t1 loot and the refined minerals they bring is really going to be much of a benefit to someone wanting to manufacture and sell t1 modules agreed that no t1 drops would make a more profitable market to sell into but he also looses his easy access to the high end minerals that the mission runners supply instead of being able to pick up minerals from anywhere people are doing missions at a good price he is going to have to go to a trade hub and is back to being price gouged by 00 alliancesmanufacturing needs something to make it interesting and profitable but i dont think t1 garbage is the answer  does anyone actually use t1 except people in their first couple of weeks in the game when they dont know meta 234 are  i like the ideas around bpcs for making higher meta levels along the line as t2 is madei know there is a lot of qq related to the profit from mining but unless ccp have a major change of mind and allow hisec miners to find high end ore then there is a need for t1 drops just to provide access to a reasonable amount of minerals
i dont mean to say i want to encourage hoarding im just saying that i am interested in any mechanic that would make the market in eve closer to what a rl free market might look like
take it outby taking it out maybe building tech 1 things would finaly be profitable
first let me state that i have a vast operation based on t1 loot from missions that makes profits that are just sickthat said i support this idea but only if the change is well though out the biggest problem with the pve portions of this game is that they are so predictable if i run a mission against serpentis i know which loot i am going to get which salvage will drop even which ships i am going to be fighting if i choose a system in which to rat andor mine i know what ore i will find what rats i will get and again loot and salvage this is dull dull dull exploration helps with this but the barriers to entry in terms of skills and cost are high and the time factor is a huge problem yes you might find something cool but it can take hours of the worst kind of tedium not quite as bad as mining ice but closeif you are going to change drops make it part of a larger effort to improve the excitement of the pve game expand the loot tables on the high end to make it possible to find nearly anything up to valuable bpcs and even bpos implants t2 items rigs skills things that increase faction when turned in you name it sure the chances might be microscopic but so what everytime you open that loot window there should be an opportunity for a surprise if you do that i think people would support raising the bar on the low end as welli have other ideas too about randomizing the encounter tables etc but they are off topic for this threadar
how do you make money off of oversized modules you can hual
hummm a few questions in betweenthis is supposed to hit deadspace rats only iow belt rats  00 farming  still yield  roughly  the same amount of mineralsbtw i could do with more hauler spawnsor have hauler spawns drop lots of t1 loot so the station owners can get some refining tax and if the market is overflowing with  low  named stuff why would i want to buildbuy worseperforming t1  other than t2 productionbut yes shooting lots of stuff and then being an industrialist is not just an alternativewithsomecompromises to being a purely industry based player with mining and everything anymore  it has taken over loot exceeds selfsufficiency in form of ammo big timeit does not replace mining  it beats miningthis may be slightly acceptable in drone regions but anywhere else it simply removes the basis for half of this sandbox called evenow most  me included  may giggle about our asteroid oriented fellows sometimes they can even get on your nerves when they demand total safety in their 00 belts  over and over again   but their hulks are supposed to make all those gadgets possible not those stupid cloakwarpstab ravensit may be convenient and established but that is not equal to fine as it is low mins should come from empire high mins from 00  not empiremissionswhile im at it 00 hauler spawns should soften the volume of trit import yes but not make tritpyer  considerably  cheaper than empiresome regional considerations couldnt hurt  like extra nocx for angel space etc 
this is a good example of what i mean by your failure to grasp the discussion try reading what i wrote a couple more times you may eventually understand if not you could try to find someone who can explain it to youwindjammer
no i think i grasped it fully avon identifies the true problem if that was fixed i would have no problem removing suicide ganking altogether edit if you are trying to get me to reply to the other parts of your post where you accuse me of tampering with numbers and where you fail to realise what i meant in my rationalitypost ive given up trying to explain them to you
i am for stopping insurance payouts for ships destroyed by concordmaybe it could be limited on negative security status player to give a chance to newbies
with the ease to repair standing many gankers can have a positive standing so basing the punishment on the standing of the ganker would not work well end reply to quoteit dawned on me as i read the latest added posts on this thread that it all comes down to what you find funratting is fun and profitable for some folks so needing to rat for a few hours or days to repair your bad security rating should not be punishment but wait not all folks like to ratwhen we were young  for some of you this is only yesterday  and we did something wrong our parents normally did something to punish us and it often included the requirement to do something distasteful i do remember getting in more trouble when i tried to rationalize my misdeeds into something positivei broke the window in the garage to let the wasps out so i could get to my bikeat this point the punishment for suicide ganking  minor isk loss for the ship slight sec hit  does not fit the crime removal of the insurance payout would increase the punishment slightly it would not eliminate the criminal activity it would just add a slight increase to the punishmentwere the security level changes to a player based on the systems posted security level  standing with concord only  then the other part of the punishment ratting would then be needed to be done in low sec andor high sec and take a lot longer but pirating in low sec would not lower your standing near as fast in fact suicide ganking in 5 space would not lower your standing with concord as much
what a long and pointless threadful of egos clashingthat said i agree with the premise that the riskreward balance for suicide ganking is out of balancei do not want to see suicide ganking eliminatedi do want the penalty for the criminal act increasedsliding insurance premiums 1 concord kill  a 10 insurance surcharge that comes off at renewal if no more concord kills 2 kills 20 3 kills 30 and no premium available keep scaling until no insurance is available in rl an insurance co bases price on risk of payout suicide gankers should be a high risk policyfaction hits a criminal operating in a soverign state would not be allowed the open unfettered access in their space also attacking someone with high standing with an npc corp now has no consequenses there should be security hit faction hit npc corp hitmuch longer timer for theft in 15 min i wont forget you stole from me the ganker docks or jumps and the victim has no recourse how about a 5 day timer for stealing   revenge is a dish best served cold   let me go get my bs and hunt you down only fair i think   i forget gankers only want helpless victims not someone that can fight back   just because im in a hauler does not mean thats all i can fly perhaps i can return the out of the blue attack on youbounty hunter profession there have been good suggestions to implement thistradeable kill rightsfix the problems that allow ganking in the undocking area a ganker doing this is using an exploitnone of this would prevent the selfserving claims of justification for suicide ganking   wardec players in npc corp for example   but it would make the criminal think random ganking of empty haulers on the chance of a big payoff would have consequenses even the common purse snatcher does not run down a street grabbing at every shoulder bag in sight they pick their victim survey the situation and have an idea of risk vs reward as now implemented there is too much reward for very little riskan afk hauler moving a couple bil of goods through 06 space deserves to be ganked hell i might consider it myself it is the ease of random gankspamming that is out of balancei heard it before and i subscribe to it also  dont fly what you cant afford to lose and if you cant do the time dont do the crimeas it now stands there is no effective risk for the potential reward the risk factor needs to be brought into balance i would lose a ship with no insurance reimbursement take a faction hit and look over my shoulder for a couple days to steal a couple billion i would not take the risk for an empty hauler hey that would mean the gankers would have to think and maybe even scan their targets first this would make suicide ganking something other than greiving
how about both ideas something like what avon suggests and the lack of insurance payout for concord killsi think itd probably be best if there was some device a player could buy that would alert the player when a cargo scanner was used on his ship this is optional thoughhave the other half being a debris shield generator that runs on scrap metal  the background would be that its basically a hack created by freighter pilots  yeah i know that sounds stupid but let me finishits a kind of shield that a freighter can carry where it ejects a large amount of scrap metal from the ship which forms a cocoon that provides like 95 tank against all shield types because weapons are hitting the scrap metal instead of the ship requires like 100 or 200 or 300 or whatever units of scrap metal per second of activation this would be scaled for average cargohold size a t1 hauler might require just hundreds per second a big jump freighter might require thousands of units per second the rule would be that for 30 seconds of protection youd have to give up about 70 of the basic cargo space to scrap metal  premodsskills  edit maybe more  perhaps 100 of unmodded cargo space for 30 seconds  we dont want to make suicide ganking impossible just make the gankers work for it more so why scrap metal because its bulky and its cheap and worthless to haul otherwise the protection doesnt cost money directly  instead it costs the hauler money by forcing him or her to give up cargo space to fit protection how much protection is up to the hauler how fast do you think concord will react the shield has to be turned on and off manually your scrap metal supply limits how long you can leave it on so if youre afk or just not paying attention you can still be ganked  the cargo scanner alert would help with this  if youre paying attention you might notice youre being cased  otherwise watch when you see like six ravens waiting around a gate and turn on your scrap metal ejector the shield isnt so hot in lowsec or nullsec as you can just be webbed and scrambled and the pirates wait for your scrap metal to run out then gank you  thus it doesnt totally replace lucksavvy in those areas as for station ganking  just make ships leaving a station exit the station on a random vector  speed its a little unrealistic but so is a station tolerating capulseers sitting right outside of a station smartbombing noob frigates and ganking exiting ships only to get blown up by concord then showing up again in a few minutes with a new ship to do it some more the predictable exit location makes camping easy most suicide gankers who are motivated by economics do it for the rewardeffort  as theres really little risk at the moment  sitting in front of jita 44s exit port is easy having to watch a 360 sphere around jita 44 would require a lot more work
i agree totallyits hard to find fw info because its split up over every forum also as someone noted in a different thread caod doesnt allow players from militias to post because militias arent player corporations
other than the rp section evendefinately supported
if you want to fix caod keeping fw out of it isnt the answer think of why its bad now fw has ig and cas they are more than welcome there

agreed i would love to have a fw section
in any game system you will find peaks and sweetspots and at this point in time the sacrilege is one of the sweetest of them all yes it enjoys extremely fine privileges  huge pg excellent dps and perfect boni for a nanoship like cap recharge and armour resistances  but many of these are a consequence of its varied history ingame rather than outright designright now it is certainly in the top echelon of ships  much like the falcon and much unlike the pilgrim for example  indeed it is possibly even overpowered and as such may well suffer a small nerf in future  a thought which saddens me a little as right now training for it is my toons mediumterm goal the cerb in comparison is a very useful workhorse and probably midrange as hacs go certainly better than a muninn eagle or deimos for sure and a useful dps provider for many a nanogang as a caldari pilot with a cerb in the hanger of course id like to see it buffed but equally it makes no sense to use the peaks in a game system as points of reference for balance as all you do is introduce powercreep into the game it would be far more sensible to argue for a nerf to the sactwo things may well be in the pipeline which will indirectly buff the cerb anyway bringing precision heavies into line with the other precision missiles will make the cerb a holy terror for anything travelling under 5kms while at the same time ccp have avowed their intention to curb the very top level pimped speeds meaning that nanoships will find it much harder to evade the cerbs firepowerat this point a cerb pilot has two choices pack amls and precision lights and twovolley inties from 60km away or else fit hmls and apply 300 consistent dps to any nanopilot within 85 km  possibly even further 
troll
fixed top tip it helps if you read what we were both saying as mostly we are in agreement
i am for the removal of the kinetic bonus to a generic damage bonus on caldari ship the missile is suppose to be about choice of damage it seem normal that caldari ship have the choice to choose the damage type
where kin bonus is crap its a bit logical because so caldari ships are in pair with other race ships which have limited damage types caldari could get 5 to 2 damage types omho  but the problem is not thatthe problem is caladari atm on mst cruiser sized ships have no low range high damage weapons as every other race because the fitting issue of the hams if u want to use hams that should need more fitting req but atm the difference is so big too big req on hams or too low pg on ships  that even if u can fit them u have the same dps because fitting mods and just slight better damage on this hamsso atm caldari on most cruiser bc sized ships are without the option of using real short range high damage weapons

hells yeah as long as we can have fluffy bunny ears and a tail in ambulation toothen i could invite you all to my furry  sexeh  party where you can all blow in my flute while my tail beats the rythm
edit hit enter and poastedbut yeah as the topic says if i can be concorded for remote repping a rat theres no reason remote repping a someone who has been flagged by combat shouldnt cause a flag the ability to remote rep while sitting on a station and dock without having to wait out a timer is a joke
stupid posting mah support
supportin dis no aggression timers from remote repping people who are aggressed is stupid furthermore fix the god damn aggression timers 45 seconds is no where near enough time to kill a bs much less a cap ship unless you blob the hell out of themthanks cruise control off now
showing my support for this case and point i have a fleet in a hostile system they undock 10 logistics ships to rep their fleetprimary the logistics omg look at dat they all dockedbroken system much
wholly supportedrepping a ship that is actively aggressing should earn aggression flag in return  as well as the aggression timer  so the repper is stuck for at least 60srepping a ship thats just sitting there getting shot at should not  since that nonaggressing ship can dock at any time so then should the reppers 
perfectly put

opposei cant believe people are so upset about this when i first saw the learning skills i was about a few months into the game and thought they increase your stats cool sure training the basics to 5 and coughing up the cash for the advanceds was a pain but i happily accepted that thats just how things were got on with it and did it it took a while but i felt a great deal of achievement when i finished the lotit sounds like the players are broken rather than the skills a good countermeasure would be to prevent learning skills from being trained on trial accounts this would send a message that you should have fun during the trial and only train the learning skills if you plan on sticking aroundthe thing is the skills are the perceived problem the real problem is the playerbase which while wellmeaning can be rather obsessive when they latch on to some mechanic that works well  something im guilty of too  if you want to help out  and i dont doubt that the point of this thread is to make new players lives easier  then hammer home the message to the help channel regulars that learning skills are not something you should be thinking about until you can afford to buy all of the learning skillbooks in one go and still have enough to replace your ship if it dieswith regards to corps that set minimum barriers to entry such as sp and learning skills do you really want to work for such a bunch of idiotssince ccp have apparently declared that removing learning skills is impossible this discussion really would be better put to use by finding ways to improve the skills so that they no longer serve an exclusively metagaming purpose as an idea how about each skill give a minor bonus to some operation empathy could reduce transaction tax by 1 per level analytical mind might decrease mining cycle timesif these learning skills had bonuses such as those how many people might look upon them more favourably just some food for thought
my little alt creation test was to prove a couple of things one to show a toon created for one purpose this case industry was not permently gimped in combat the learning skills helped moderate the lack of initial skills second and most important to prove learning skills are not a time sinkanyone that sees almost 1 year of extra training for less than a months investment as a time sink needs to define time sink for meit may be the same on the boards but those i run into in the game that are extremely opposed to learning skills seem to be the ones that want the uberleetness now the concept of larger benefit in the future as opposed to immediate reward seems incomprehensable to them these are also the ones that as a group are less understanding of a play style other than pvp gankingi am opposed to removing the learning skills completely and replacing them with attribute points i am however in favor of a senseable restructuring of them the more the merrier i would like to see a plan that allows for more diversitylets take a couple of items as an example gunnery skill gives a 2 bonus to rate of fire per level skills are perception and willpower lets add a learning skill called deadeye deadeye gives a 2 bonus to the learning time for a set of combat related skills including gunnery in addition deadeye grants a 10 bonus per level to the 2 that gunnery adds to rate of fire thats a skill most of the objectors would find handyfor researchers we could add learning skills like advanced electronic engineering that add bonusus to all the scientific fields with electronics 5 as a prerequsite bonus such as reduced research and invention timeminers have veldspar processing gaining a bonus in the amount retreived at the processing plant how about veldspar mining that grants a 5 bonus to cycle time when mining veldsparhaulers and curriers could get packing methods a skill that allows a 3 increase in cargo capacityall these could ofcourse be introduced as regular skills but if we add a level or 2 of attributes to the skill training and a large amount of these specialized learning skills there would be an almost endless amount of diversity available i would like to see them as targeted learning skills that is they reduce the time needed to train the target skill but also add to the value of the skill being trainedusing targeted learning skills would take the sting out of learning for those that dont like it because they would see benefit as soon as they finished the level they would learn the target skill a little bit faster and a little bit better and put a little bit more pew in the pewpew

actually hull repair modules need a complete overhaul to be useful itemscurrently they are 116th as efficient as shield or armor repairyet gallente are supposedly the hull tankers of eve yet they cannot repair their hullscycle types for all hull repair  equipped or remote  should be reduced to be on par with armorshield repair to allow players another option for setting up their ships
i completely agreeccp please fix our  broken  precision heavy missiles
fix all t2 ammo not just missiles
please make this useless ammo work  
this is way i like this idea your not asking for incease it by 2000 velocity but are in fact just looking for something more balanced without baing game breaking
signed signed a thousand times signed
i support the op
one of the biggest complaints about missile use in pvp is that in engagements above a certain size where distances or numbers are significant long range missiles simply dont have enough time to reach a target before it warps off or is destroyed i suggest something that will significantly minimize this without giving missiles any negative balance effectsdouble missile velocity half missile flight timethis change would literally take five minutes of a developers time if anyone can think of a compelling reason as to why this would be a poor decision feel free to post it otherwise i would like your support on this issue
ha ha i get it nowman hes goodedit first post in a tarminic thread aside supportedalso buff precision heavies plx
trust meif i was trolling youd know it
specific constructive and polite well done
while obviously not quite so distraught i can kinda agreeive found my overview and current target windows suddenly overlapping for no particular reasonand i would like to leave a gap at the bottom of my local chat window and where all the minimized bars appear at the very bottom but the first time i reload the client they are back to overlapping as wellit is pecular that something so simple cant be readily fixed it doesnt say much for any sort of timely correction to the many other problems both big and small
lolits just frustrating to open up a show info or a can or whatnot and have my entire client suddenly go nuts because one window resized causing all of the windows around it to resize jump across the screen or vanishevery time a major content patch is released this happens every single timeccp get a handle on it for once and all plzthnksoh and posting here because i cant support my opening post fix that too ccp

in fairness ccp have claimed to have fixed this bug 2 patches agoedit for support
haha you guys are still going on about it  isnt the term ending soon anyway i dont like how we have a creepy grown man who roleplays as a amarr  slaver  ugly guy with a hood named azzma makes eve players look dumbdo you quit now edit i kind of feel sorry for bumping it up again but this thread is like a car accident its horrible and you still keep watching
some of the caldari missile ships are designed as snipers getting missile velocity and missile flight time bonusthe problem with this concept is this missile ships atm cant fill the role because more reasons1 missiles are slow and if u shoot from bigger distance take even longer time to give damage2 this ships are very slow highest mass lowest basespeed which make them unable to hold range where they should be3 because pg issue the most of them cant really use mwd which make the range holding issue even worstso the solution could be that all ships which have missile flight time bonus should get a missile velocity bonus the ships which already have this simple should get the doublethat would cause that the damage is not so extremly deleayed and so a bit better inpact in the fight would not be too overpowered because the explosion velocity would be the same and so even if the fast missiles hit the fast moving target they would not do damage because explo velocitydevs should realise that missiles are no sniper weapons and if they want ships using them as sniper weapons they should get much more speed
deny youre stupid if you dont realize why this is a bad idea
missile boats arent snipersevery race has their strengths and weekenesses for a reason missile boats exchange their delayed damage for their ability to change dmg types on the fly once you realize this is as balanced as it gets then youll understand why we think your idea is retarded
change damage type on ships which have mostly bonus to i damage type is a very limited advantagesimply dont see why u fear so much from 50 missile velocity on some dedicated ships where would this ships be overpowered
just give all ranged missiles a 2000x velocity boost or more and give them a secondary kinetic damage for plowing into the target at a fraction of coh wait the devs are nanophags so itll never happen
sighmissles are not meant to be sniping weapons caldari already have ships that are used for sniping theyre called rail ships use them and deal with tracking like the rest of us snipers
agree thats why is crazy to have ships which have 200300km missile range without the speed and have wasted 2 bonuses on something which is uselessim happy to trade the missile flight time to 5 rof and dont be able to shoot on 200km because is useless missiles are no sniping weapons thats why bad to give them even bigger range with bonus
yeah great idea lets make defenders even more of a jokegod forbid missiles might have drawbacks when compared to guns turrets have to reduce their damage to reach farther ranges the delay with missiles is a compensation for doing maximum damage whatever the rangeby this sentence you just showed not only your ignorance about ship mass but also your inaptitude to speak about balancingand what do you think the other races do they do sacrifices in their fittings just like you should caldari ships arent worse off fitting mwd those who suffer the most are the amarr and gallente because the cap penalty is extrapainfull with ships needing cap not only for defense but also for offense
if caldari ships have no fitting issue with mwd try to fit one on the nh caracalsee u never flough caldari shipsand about the cap issue ishtarnanobuffertank deimosbuffertank zealotnanobuffertank sacrinanoplenty of cap vagananobuffertanki fly this ships and they have no prob with mwd
try using a raven with torpedoes in pvp  which is a freaking awesome ship  without that range bonus that it gets then come back and tell me how sucky it is
raven have a velocity bonus not a flightimethats what i speak about btw if u would change the speed to another 5 rof it would be extreme overpowered and most of the pvpers in ravens would be happy to spam torps just to 20km for extra 33 dps i think i personly would like  ok i tell u a bit more precise change the missle flightime bonus on the cerberus
disagreeare you jim raynors alt damned force or maybe his clone that doesnt bother to type as wellregardless raynor is ranting about how much the cerebus is terrible compared to the amarrian pwnboat  which i think he has a point in  but seems to cover a lot of griping similar to yoursi agree that missiles need a closer look perhaps even a complete overhaul of concept as they seem to overlap so much railguns and similar longrange weapons so much theres always confusion about this sniping thing plus in the current nano environment even in my limited 00 experience i routinely see every races cruisers and even battlecruisers  except for caldari  outrun missiles or their explosionsi dont quite think your solutions are goodif you opened a thread saying you think that missiles are gimped and that making a races major trademark strength being a weapon thats so laughably bad in pvp in eve nanopyrean age with some concrete suggestions id support it but not as it is now sorry
support but not the existingvelocitygetsdbledpartif missiles arent sniper wepaons then wtf is the cerb specced forflight itme bonus is kinda pointless
these caldari noobs are really annoying me now i wish theyd get a clue
errrrflight time bonus  hamscome back when you try it
hams on a cerb you like going boom dont youthe problem right now with caldari is the fact that they cant touch fast ships for dps and cant flee fast ships unless your going to spend every single slot you have setting a tank  thereby doing severly reducing dps basically making you useless  your dead even then your probably deadim still trying to figure out why missles which are used to take out the fast moving and agile combat aircraft are so inneffective against the fast moving and agile ships in eve
what who said this
i dont like the proposed fix but missile velocity needs to be looked at
sniper and missile in the same sentence wtf
agreed most excellent and concise summary of the issue
it cant be that hard to do can it  and s as the people maybe i should post this thread in there too the csm forum seems to have become they replacement for spamming ideas which is not why it was created im not saying an idea should never end up here but it should not be the first port of clal as there is an aptly named ideas forum specifically for thatmaybe instead of just spamming every idea people cna think of here if they seemed popular in the ideas forum they could be escalated here instead of spammed herethats just my two cents
while it is a good pointpeople have noticed that a thread in features and ideas can go on for months if not years without a single response from a devthen that thread is lost to the 90day timer and more threads are restarted with the same ideas over and over week after week people will argue the exact same points and none of them receive acknowledgement or attentionwhat it amounts to is fi is where irate players go to rant about stuff then when everyone has come to a consensus that the problem doesnt exist or that the problem is genuine the thread goes away as more take its placenothing is ever done in fi but things seem to at least receive acknowledgement here in assembly hallso until ccp wants to hire some decent moderators along with a staff of programmers that can actually create a functional game then people will voice themselves wherever they seem to get attention
working off the rumours in the pipeline concerning moving all ore belts to exploration i had an idea for a potential industrial skill  with ship prospecting  rank 4 prerequisitesspaceship command iiiastrometrics ivindustry iisignal aquisition iastrometric triangulation iiiskill bonus 10 scan strength bonus with gravimetric probes per levelore prospector class frigaterole bonus 200 bonus to gravimetric sensor strength of scan probes 100 to radar ladar and magnometric sensor strength of scan probesprospector bonus 10 scan time for gravimetric probes per levelvessel slots and stats should allow a reasonable degree of survivability  enough to be able to survey a site against low level rats heavier stuff will need you to get out of there asap  enough cpu and grid to fit scan probe launchers probably only 1 high slot its designed to find belts for the miners not do mining itselfits heavily specialised in its role however in return for that specialisation if you want to be finding hidden belts then this is the ship you want to be usingi know it would need a lot more work especially in hammering out the fitting stats however what do you guys think of this rough version
i support this make miners go to lowsec for bigger profits
support hereiirc the fluff reason concord doesnt bounty drones is because they only bounty people rats have people in them and killing them earns the bounty not the ship
old problem maybe its time to introduce lowsec00 veldspar roids which give 23x more trit after refining
signed and stop spawning icefields in hisec or make them small and finite like roid belts are now
make specific ore drop only one type of mineral and put each ore type only in certain regionsecurity statutthis way the price of each mineral will balance with the danger involve with the market force
anything that reduces the effectiveness of macro mining in high sec npc corps
yes it would be nice to see the midrange ores worth something again i remember when i was a new player that actually going into lowsec and mining in my osprey was worth the risk this encouraged me to actually venture out and i spent more time in lowsec then i did in high sec in those days many new players no longer have that incentive to venture out and risk their mining cruiser or get a small gang together and try a lowsec group minesince the drone regions are really the source of the problem and seem to make mining as the secondary choice of getting midrange minerals i think ccp should remove the refinables that drones drop this should be replaced by metadrone items perhaps bpcs and parts to make them since having a dead drone drop a new drone makes no sense i thought ccp was doing this but i have yet to see any evidence i think this makes more sense then trying to increase the use  demand  for these midrange materials but perhaps a combination of the twowhatever the case ccp needs to do something about the situation they constantly say that they want more people in lowsec yet do nothing to encourage players who are industry oriented from ever leaving highsec
the way to do it is to make low sec always more valuable than high seca few ideas numbers are not playtested and balanced duh1  all ore is everywhere veldspar  it comes in 6 different varities veldspar at the normal level exists from 10 down to 5 from 5  0 it exists at a dense veldspar with 50 more refine from 00 to 5 it is crystalline veldspar and exists at 200 normal veldspar refine from 5 to 10 it is omg awesomeness veldspar at 510x the normal veldspar amount exploration belts have ore of the next lower levelarkonor  same deal but reversed wherever arkonor starts in a region is its base if it starts at 3 the 3 to 8 is normal ark 8 to 10 is 50 better 2 to 3 is 5075 normal 7  2 is 3050 10  7 is 10 arkonormy personal favorite it would make sense that the empires mined out the better ores already leaving deep space to have untapped resources2 low sec modulethe idea is that a module is scripted like the cyno generator to only work in low sec this module mines better than current mining lasers so it has a yeild increase for going to lowsec another module scripted like interdiction shperes boosts 00 mining amounts 3 ship ideaa ship is either not allowed to enter highsec through some means and mines better than a hulk  not preferred  or the ship cannot enter highsec and mines high sec ores better than a hulk another cannot enter empire at all and mines high sec much better and low sec somewhat better than a hulk this means hulk is for mining the 00 ores and high sec ores and these other ships for mining outside the current range2 and 3 simply increase yield which isnt my preferred fix but might be easier the first idea the minin amount and logistics of hauling the ore stay the same comppressed super veld would be good for mineral logisticsdrones need to start dropping tons of low ends from their refinables to be balanced to what most of the rest of the game requires drones are way out of whack because they drop minerals so disproportionately also mission loot and 00 rat loot needs to be looked at these changes would all make mining for low ends more viable than ratting for lowends in 00 again i fly a really nice hulk and rat trit from loot in 00 faster than my hulk mining veldspar dont nerf bat the loot just make 00 veld somehow better than 10 veld like the rats and everything else scales
actually it makes complete sense to have exceptions to insurance payouts built into the policy it happens in rl with every insurance company there are things that for instance your auto insurance will not coverlike intentionally driving it off a cliff or acts of war or mother natures wrath etc
now theres a good idea anything in the game that can be turned over to the players is a good thing as long as its well thought out and implemented correctly
i fully support this productservice
not supported horrible idea decrease insurance
self destruct was implemented to stop griefing of the sort where a player holds down another player indefinatly with a warp disrupter and web with no intent on killing so removing insurance on self destruct in that case no longer makes sense the problem is insurance is too cheap compared to what it insures fix that and self destructing problems are automatically fixed
capital ships are big so what is the deal with pew pewing at some random point on them a ship the size of my homestate shouldnt be that hard or easy to take down at the same time in the following few paragraphs  ill keep it shortish  im going to propose an idea that is not an orginal idea of my own but in fact a mechanic used it other rts and ship based games sub system targeting following the same idea as the current system for outposts captial ships should have systems you can target for instance the engines or the shield generators one of the importants parts of my plan is that it might either open the door or smaller ship sub targeting or just block the door forever as an idea that would only work on capital ships like in that starwars rts now one of the biggest issues with sub system targeting as brought up in the past is when can you shoot these parts once the shields are down then what about armor tankers but ive though of a simple solution have difference services have different levels of protectionengines targetable once shield go below 60note this is not the jump drive to stop a captial ship from jumping you must hold it down with a heavy dictorshield generator targable once armor goes below 80armor nanobots repair central armor below 10fighterdrone deployment bay once armor is below 60 below 20 armor for carriers and 10 struture for motherships  also take take stupid drone dreadnautweapons array once armor is below 40  all weapons are considered one system for lag reasons 
i could add more but i didnt want to because of the lag monster however you might be sayign to your self what the hell would be the point of taking out a ships system when its going to die really soon anyway that is because im not just calling for sub system targeting but it fact a complete rethink of capital warfare capital ships are big big big add 400 struture hp to all capital class ships this way capital ships are hard to kill but not so hard to take down struture has always been seen as once the armor and shields are gone there is just ship to tear through and it bothers me that capital ships dont seem to have much ship they are the size of a state however im not done yet because now you might be asking then why not let it explode anyways if it cant do anythingslavaging to the extreme to boost the rewards for taking down these state sized mach machinces players should be allowed to slavage capital ships and get more stuff depending on how damage the ship is once its into strutureextrasall of these systems other than the egines should be hard if not impossible for other capital weapons to hit thus only crusiers and smaller would be able to effectly take out these systems while biger ships battleships and up would take down the shields and armor making newer players and smaller ships much more usefull and needed in combat with capital shipssub systems will go offline at struture damage just like pos mechcanic this well be repairable in combat by remote reps giving ships like the minmatar carrier more use in fleet warfare also they will have a lot of hp on the subsystems however not ressitance becuase its not fair when a healer can heal 99times what you can dealthe future i was thinking about going as far as letting mplayers board capital ships once all subsystems arte taken out and have fps battles inside them yarr or just being able to take them over phowever i dont know if people should be able to steal them becuase that would make capital ship market change a lot maybe if you have to buy new subsystems or something i dont want to kill the industy side of eve with my ideaanyways tell me what you thinksorry about spelling and stufffinal notei believe the key in sub system targeting for any ship is a basic fact of these are much small targets than the ship itself and you should not be able to shoot the gun off a rifter with another rifter that is just silly phowever takingout a statehouse sized shield generator on the side of a state sized capital ship should be much easier
i would support this if the  of shieldarmorhull thats needed to take down to target subystems where higher  i think im not sure  cuz im not a capital pilot  but being able to take out a carrieres ability to launch fightersdrones  i presume thats what u mean by fighterdrone deployment bay once shields are below 10  when shield fall below 10 seems a bit extremeif its a chimera sure shield are about to fail on a shield ship spells doom still ovrpowerd though since you probably still can make a diffenerce in a fight with a dying chimera  still u wouldnt be able to go down fighting but on a archonniddhogurthanatos you havent egen gotten into the tanked hp yetalso i think engines  i guess u mean subwarp and warp  shouldnt be targetable until 0 shields from rp pow cuz the shields protect the ships physical parts until they failnot sure what you mean by self destrut systems should destroying this part of the ship disable its selfdestruct or override internal controls forcing the ship to initiate selfestruct disabling someones selfedtruct would take away the ability to kill yourself rather then end up on your enemys killboard witch is no funand initiating someones selfdestruct shouldnt be doable until like 20 hull that would also make a new tactic avaliable as you could shoot a cap into some hull and then make it self destruct then quicker move on to the next target
yeah omg what was i thinking p i moved it to in to 6080 armor for carriers and motherships in fact maybe motherships should have this instead be 20 struture hp giving motherships a role oh omg it wont diebut overall yeah i think each ship class should have its own rulesfinally what if the self selfestruct system was also changed for all capital ships what if instead of taking yourself out it just made the ship unrepairable and basicly turned it into a wreck that still has 400000 stuture hp left overthis way maybe selfestruct would actully become how all captial ships died which in my mind makes more sence because of how massive the ships arebut yeah stopping someone from selfestructing is lame i agree with that
ooh heres one for youto target subsystems you need a signal scanning resolution of over say 400500so only frigates and sensorboosted cruisersbattleships can make these precision shots the damage would be inflicted on shieldsarmor as usual but it would add heat to any modules of the system type that were fittedtarget weapons heat damage added to random  of weapons armor reppershardeners ditto for shields propulsion absmwds im looking at you maybe even include a generic ewar category to nail webbers disruptors and ecmdampsthis could also add a lot more tactical action to combat since if youre being held down by a tackler whos tank you cant break you might be able to target their ewar systems and disable their point or target their propulsion and get out of range
reminds me of warhammer 40000problem is if we can destroy hardpoints we need a way to repair them this might require a specialized ship to either repair or remove and replace hardware if all else fails they can tug them back to friendly space to rep the damaged parts you use basic capital building parts add a bit of expense to a damaged shiphopefully this will bring the price of carriers etc up a bit stop the cap floodtugfreighterlocks onto friendly jump bridges using a specialized jump portal generator that can tug a single carrier dread or freighter to a repair station or a pos for ship to ship repairs for ms and titans they pair up 2 for ms 4 for titans
 since the ideas  features section never gets read  something to sow confusion among your enemies neutral scanners  gank squadsfalse manifest container  small standard freight sizesm 1000 m3 volume 500 m3  1m isk standard 5000 m3 volume 2500 m3  10m isk freight 120k m3 volume 80k m3  50m isk what does it dowhen scanned it returns a false cargo readingwhen you assemble one you bind it to either your personal hangar or a selected corp hangar that you have read access to whenever your ship gets scanned the scanning ship gets a random selection of whatevers in that hangar  or theyre sold in permanently linked pairs and a scan returns whatevers in the paired can in the hangar obviously it seriously limits your cargo capacity and can only be moved by industrialfreighter but the upside is complete confusion of anyone attempting to scan your cargo for goodies one serious downside if youve got drugs in that hangar and a faction customs agent scans you it sees that contraband you get fined but it doesnt get confiscated  because its not in your cargo  meaning you might get scanned again at the next gate and the nextmodulesdownscanner  when your ship is scanned returns various 04 meta level t1 gear  high slot passive moduleupscanner  when your ship is scanned returns 913 meta level equipment  high slot passive module
i like this idea could be used to protect assets or provide baitonly problem is what about freighters
neat idea not sure its really worth while though
i like it not sure about the details but the principles a good one
i doubt itll be useful  i wonder how many pirate cargo scan anyway after they see the same pilot come through and back the same gate is it worth the slot if youre going to be ganked or suicided it wont matter whats in your hold the loot drop will just be a bonus surelymaybe im not giving the empire pirates credit though
ccp take a look at thesetheir premise is very sound but their utility is lousy their damage is atrociously low for the weapon classa  give them some utility beyond just damage if youre afraid of mission runners just loading  forgetting remove the damage quotent from fofs and have them do other things such as speed arresting sensor disrupting energy draining ect ect something that will give the attacker a thorough battle hiccup but takes more thought than just fire and forget rinse  repeatb  increase their damage and adjust their target prioritization  so they dont just wastefully chase drones or ships too fast to catch  c  make them stupidly fast with very broad explosion radii to be used as nano counters
at max skills a fof missile does 9375 of t1 missile damage thats a pretty small penalty for the benefit of being able to shoot while jammed admittedly id love a buff to their ai but in a onetarget situation theyre quite good at their job
maybe a little polish to them but nothing crazy they are pretty decent as is for a back up weapon of course when you have multiple ships around you end up just spray and praying maybe the ai could be a priority selection thing like your drones you can adjust the ai a bit  although currently they are annoyingly belligerent  maybe with these you can select ewar or dps another words you can have the go after who ever is using ewar  disrupt web damps ecm etc  on you or whomever is causing the heaviest damage
when you are jammed by other player so in a pvp situation you most likely have faction missilesammunition that is alot better than t1 same t1 that is better  in damage  than fof which doesnt have a faction version
all missiles should recieve a rudimentary ai including fofif a missile detects that the target is pulling away they should automatically switch to a target that is within its range and not going so fastheck just make all missles fof and eliminate that missile entirely ofc this would require a serious adjustment of missile ai and defender function
do you actually know how fof missiles work
only thing i can agree to is somehow making fof missiles only target agressive ships and not drones currently they go after the nearest agressor as to the range deactivate reactivate
actually they also suffer from a range bug that also cuts them off at 80k so if you get a sensor booster and are thinking of hitting ecmsnipers at 150k or 180 or whatever your skills dictate for range  i can tell you now that theyre useless for that they wont target anything further than 80k even if that something is actively aggressing youso damagewise yeah theyre good at their job but theyre a bugged delivery systemedit im talking specifically cruise fof here cant fly anything that can hit 80k with heavies
you could hit 190 in a cerb with hydras 320 or so dps in a raven you can hit out past 205 but this by looking at the stats in game i am not aware of any gug what bug are speaking of
however you are not supposed to be completely immune to jamming when using missiles are you some penalty must be expected
fofs do have a faction variant
i say fix their targeting instead anyone thats ever tried using fof outside pve knows how ed it is oh they have to shoot at me first etc etc
make them focus fire and shoot at target with ewari on you and in range first
if that bug exists then it should of course be fixed i didnt know about it but i assume bugs should be fixed is a default position the issue at hand here is how fof missiles should be designed  the details of coding i leave to others
a simple af boost would be to give afs their missing 4th bonusalso your hawk suggest is damn near criminal that you even considered suggesting the removal of the rof bonus is nothing short of sick if the hawk only had a 5 kinetic  should be all damage types period  bonus and no rof itd be so horribly inferior to the kestrel that it would be best to delete the ship from the database
signed in generalhawk needs extra love too
i vote for invincible af i love my ishkur
support that the afs need some love
i not sure what the solution to that but i always hated the fact that every bs can bring 5 t2 warrior and easily dispatch frigate  except uber nano one that stay out of web range  when it suppose to be hard for them to kill small shipbig ship escort should be done by other player not automated drone at least not on every shipmaybe one solution would be to remove drone from any ship except ships specialized in themthis way it will encourage other strategy then bs blob
if the gallente are going to have pure drone ships then those ships should have few turret hardpoints a good domi fitted properly can do 700 dps using guns and drones far as i see it drone mechanics are good now no need to change them
many players have a problem  all useful skills already at lvl5 many of less useful skills at lvl4 and no idea what to do next skilling other races weaponsships is an option but maybe its about time to give some new shiny books into market to enhance horizonts in eve character evolutionfor example around two months from start to get 5 into cpu  at lvl5 skill advanced signature analysys 2 to targetting speedrank x5  basic skill is x1 prerequisites signature analysys 5  x1  sensor linking 5  x3  targeting 5  x1  multitasking 4  x3  advanced electronics 1 to cpurank x8  basic skill is x1 prerequisites electronics 5  x1  electronics upgrades 5  x2  electronics warfare 5  x2  electronic engineering 5  x5 advanced energy system operation 1 to capacitor recharge raterank x6  basic skill is x1 prerequisites energy system operation 5  x1  engineering 5  x1  energy management 5  x3  energy grid upgrades 5  x2  energy emission systems 5  x2 advanced energy management 1 to capacitor capacityrank x9  basic skill is x3 prerequisites energy management 5  x3  energy grid upgrades 5  x2  electromagnetic physics 5  x5 advanced controlled bursts 2 in capacitor needs for weapon turretsrank x8  basic skill is x2 prerequisites controlled bursts 5  x2  advanced weapons upgrade 5  x6  energy management 5  x3 advanced science 1 to blueprint copy speedrank x7  basic skill is x1 prerequisites science 5  x1  scientific networking 5  x3  advanced labolatory operation 4  x8  research project management 4  x8 advanced hull upgrades 1 to armor hitpointsrank x8  basic skill is x2 prerequisites hull upgrades 5  x2  repair systems 5  x2  mechanical engineering 5  x5 advanced accounting 2 into transaction tax reductionrank x6  basic skill is x3 prerequisites accounting 5  x3  broker relations 5  x2  trade 5  x1  day trading 5  x1 
uhm i was considerably annoyed that advanced weapon upgrades only gave a mere 2 reduction but a skill thats stupidly long to train and only offers a 1 adjustment per leveli would never botherhigher tier skills should have a greater bonus than their lower tier precursors not worse
1 in this game makes sometimes a huge differencethats why that requirements should be high point is that if someone want to get fast addidional 1 into something  he can buy an implant for example but if someone doesnt want to waste implant slot he will start skilling towards advanced skills
i would and i know a lot of players that would as well
ithis shouldnt happen for a lot of good reasons but i shall list only a fewthere are many directions for the man who has everything to go to whether it be as you said to train other races or to train those lvl 4 skills to lvl 5 or to  it all entirely and try something different like science and industrythe other problem will be there are already way more than enough skills for the new player to train as it is adding further bonuses to veteran players will only increase the division between sp the sp rich and poor old and new
or try other game right eve isnt a typical mmo where you can achieve almost everything in around 23 months people playing here from years and if someone is playing so long paying for each month of game he deserve to get at least reasonable ways to specialize in what he want eve shouldnt have limits in evolution everybody can play in this game for next 5 years and get all what he wanteverybody can get for example 5 into something even noobs  just buy proper implant  idea is to show alternative  more practic  ways to achieve it
im not wholly opposed to the principle but these skills arent the way to do it
this game balances newbies vs vets by giving vets more options in form of many more possible ships to fly rather than continuing to increase their power in one ship so introducing more skills to increase the time a newbie needs to cath up when using one specific ships needs to be introduced carefully if at all
specifically i think the offers for the faction modules are too expensive faction ships ammo implants and skills seem to be about right but its cheaper for me to buy deadspace drops off the contract system than to go through the lp store here are some specific examples the drops being purchased via contracts and the faction parts being purchased from the lp storesmall armor repairercoreli ctype meta level 11 4 mil iskamarr navy meta level 9 30375 lp and 1215 mil iskrepublic fleet meta level 7 23625 lp and 945 mil isk1mn afterburnergistii btype meta level 12 3 mil iskrepublic fleet meta level 8 12000 lp and 48 mil iskmagnetic platingcenti ctype meta level 11 3 mil isktrue sansha meta level 9 2 mil iskamarr navy meta level 9 6750 lp and 27 mil iskrepublic fleet meta level 8 6000 lp and 24 mil iskenergized thermic membranetrue sansha meta level 9 3 mil iskamarr navy meta level 9 9000 lp and 36 mil iskas you can see its often possible to buy a better module for less than the isk cost of the lp store not even counting the pain to earn the lps and tags id like to spend my lps on something other than reselling ammo please make this possible
wow you just saved me money like geicoedit lp stores suck alotwith repetitive missions crappy story lines poopy drops its all suckythumbs up
id also like to point out many implants being cheaper on the market  
bingo
agreedand everyone is crying that missions are too profitable in another threadwhat other than faction ammo  poorly balanced implants in lp stores is even worth the effort of cashing in your lpnothing
i havent bought anything directly from the lp store other than ammo in ages i looked at the cost to me looked at contractsmarket and saw id be subsidizing others purchases from my loyaltyinstead i bought from some guy who seemed to treat his lp like they were freelp are supposed to be worth using dammit sure i can sell faction ammo forever given my stock of lp but variety would be niceand then theres the ridiculous tag requirements for gear  that essentially require you to irredeemably destroy your standings with other factions to acquire  but thats another postsigned
for me the only interesting thing in lp stores so far is faction ammoeverything else just isnt worth the hassle  especially not the hassle of trying to find and buy the correct tags in the time it takes me to do that i could probably find the average officer spawn twice
if it was possible to introduce a supply vs demand mechanic to the lp store that would make it very interestingthe more its bought over x time the higher it deviates from the base price vice versa
nicely presented i like it  as much as i hate misisons the lp store cld use some love in this area
well there are the cnrs seriously for non caldari lp stores are  
it wouldnt be hard to change prices either it might take time to research prices out to balance but itd be much easier than most suggestions to implement
i was wondering why theres no market forces at work here well one ingredient is  tag prices  but its share is very limitedif an item is not demanded it should have its requirements decline steadily  and ofc analogue with higher demand this will then lead to 00 mission running being equally rewarding aka fair regardless of your standing halos being so cheap would reach the same lpisk as crystals eventually sister recon launchers would not have to suffer from their bigger counterpart thukker large shield extender ore strip miner would be sold for what theyre worthbut nobody runs missions for ore  well this chickenegg discussion is none at all so what as soon as the strip miner is worth all those courier missions people will go for them if somebody makes a fortune with thukker shield extenders you can be sure hell have lots of competition within a month that will drive isk prices down and lp costs upit might be worthwhile to just refine stuff that cant be right  i dont mind contrary to npc shuttlesciv abs you still have to do something for it if the item is utter crap and only costs 1 lp so be it the lp store is nothing more than an extension of the loot tables anyway you refine your crap loot why not refine some crap lp rewardsccp may still tell us how fast each item declinesrises by allowing a preset amount of items per day  relative to weekly avg lp trades blahblah   very much like loot tablesdrop rates but im not even sure thatll be necessary it merely influences the response time of the market unless youre allowing 10000 domi webs per hour and the lp costs crash to 1 lp ofcit is these pools of ingredients as i like to call them that limit the variety and freedom of fitting as well as mission running i am a  nonnpc  nullsec dweller and i may not run missions but i am supposed to buy this stuff  and i would id like an ay2  5 agility  imp but ccp says it has to cost exactly the same as the cy2  5 base speed  id fit some simple republic fleet large shield booster for pvp  scimitar  powergrid  nuff said  but its lp costs are blown out of proportion by repfleet ammo warp disruptor and probably the stabberlp store should be a sandbox aswell

having seen the sheer number of insta undock haulers in areas like gusandall i have to concur with the op something needs to be done about this
there are many problems with macros and bots and i beleive ccp should be more proactive in stopping these and isk farming for rlm i do not think removing things from the game that a legimate player can use for their benefit is the answer placing the example 3 agents in the same station into different stations is a valid option removing them is notevery character with the name lgfkjusd should be permently flagged and watched like a hawk monitored for eula violations these abuses can be corrected by ccp using tools that are available and should be inplace it really is their lack of action that allows things like this to continuea solution that does not impact legitimate players is always preferable
ill agree my original idea is at the extreme side of things but like you say something needs to be done either ccp needs to take a hard line against the problem or give the players the tools to deal with it
from your opyour original claim was that they could not be eradicated even by people trying to do so i find that to be nonsensical afk haulers are trivial to pop and courier missions require standings collateral and ships start killing and podding them and you start inflicting actual damage on their operations i never claimed gatecamping was a fun activity  its probably the third most boring activity in eve behind station camping and mining  but if you partake in it then you can break open their haulers to see what goodies are inside with very little difficulty hey if theyre macroing to play 237 beat the  out of them with a banhammer im all for that but doing courier missions is hardly an exploit  on the contrary its essentially a joke the money standings and lp gains are terrible compared to combat missions and flying through lowsec to do them instead of being safely enclosed in highsec is courting unnecessary risk but hey if macroplayers choose to use them then they should be dealt with just like any other macroplayer and if you want a reasonable solution heres one for you punish the guilty dont punish the innocent
lol ofix macro
id really like to see this inone really big issue that this strikes me as causing is a problem with t1 ship insurance its currently the case that we cant insure t2 ships because of the t2 component market you cant pay out an accurate insurance on mineral value when the minerals arent the base cost the components are and those components are playerdriventhus either t1 components are provided straight by npcs in which case what was the point or we have to change insurancerubbish im a new industrialist and it didnt put me off at all a typical wait time on an me slot is about 20 days in that time ive mined built pvped done a fair amount of real life work its not a big deal
remove insurance and remove t1 loot saved for named itemslet the market be a true market
i dont totally like this idea but industry need to be made better so i will support a throughout restructuration of industry and mining if that is done i will even support the removal of t1 loot from missions so tentative support for a complete overhaul of industry and mininggood idea with the exception of the bpc dropped from rats they could drop damaged versions that you need to repair but how often you run around with bpc in your cargoa occasional bpc that a special rat was carrying is ok even if i would prefer them to drop from structures in exploration sites but it becoming a everyday event is absurd
i actually see this as a way to make getting into production easier beginners will now only have to buy a small handful of bpos that are much cheaper then a ship bpo even buying a simple cruiser bpo is out of the question for beginners were as buying a few cheap component bpos then selling them to the bigger builders you seem to forget that these components could be bought and sold on the market one person doesnt  shouldnt  need to do it all on their ownif a beginer wishes to build his own ship then he could buy a bpc and then buy the components off the market or use his own bpo library much like it already happens
as a citizen of providence i fully endorse this idea
remove the aggression timer for engaging a friendly  corpalliance if you web your slow buddy in the freighter or cap ship so he can warp away should not earn the webbing buddy aggro if hes in the same corpalliance if youre popping shots off at a corp mate to test your damage and his tank  or flat out killing him  should not earn an aggro timer
i understand this is a form of petition if the council did opinion polls on a proposal to test the measure of support across the spectrum of players the system as designed would be goodhowever as implemented some very bad ideas could meet the requirement for discussion many items that have little or no support if the eve community at large to help the council get a better idea of the level of support there should be poll or a 3 option choice yes   i support   abstainpresent i have seen the question and have no strong opinions either way and no i do not support the ideathis would allow the council to set priorities in disscussions about a pettition a 300 positive 2 abstain and 10 opposed should get higher priority than a question with 300 for 200 abstain and 299 opposed

in the real world if your concened that a large armada of ships is going to invade your shores they tend to get mined to ensure this doesnt happen why cant we do this in evethe bomb can be droped in space with industrial ships and require anchoring the bomb can be configured with a gause limit so a cetain amout of mass in local space will trigger it to explodethe cheapest bombs could be just as much a liability to the side using them the very advanced mines could also cloack making them a serious threatthis also opens up a new ship class the mine sweeper if ccp wanted to go down that route or if mines started to be used to muchwouldnt it be great to leed an enemy fleet in to a trap with enough determination 1 man could destroy an entire enemy fleet by secretly mining it and luring them to the spot another usefull tool to break up the fleet blobs could be deployable beacons that emit false signatures on scan ie it could be detected as an industrial ship while in reality there is only a flashing light in space these could be used to make traps and to confuse persuing enemysalso miners could use them to discourage visitors by deploying them around there shipplease let me know what you think its just the kernal of an idea but im sure it could be developed im intrested to se you guys explore the ramifications of these wapons in eve

this is a game for adults you are telling ccp who their own game is for yikes ok dude i personally think ccp should decide who their own game that their created is for but hey i guess that is just a crazy idea i have
ccp should decide what their own game is for in a forum for communicating with customersdo u even know what assembly hall is lol idiot
its very easy to insult most aspects of a person without resorting to profanity honestly aside from the awful crossposting the only issue here is why your gag wasnt longeredit also not swearing in public channels helps private ones might be different but public space is kept clean
i dont understand this resorting to profanity what is profanity other than a way to insult aspects of a person
profanity is but one way to insult people it is also disallowed by most people in conversation as well as by ccp in the forums  profanity filter at work  im fairly sure that they dont care for swearing in private channels either but just cant be bothered to look for anything there
i should be able to gagmute people just to avoid their smacktalk in my local wait isnt that already called blacklisting
profanity is the fallback position of those that lack communication skills good intelligent conversation has no need for profanity in open forums there should be a minimum of restraint show by the participants those that cross the line are mostly disruptive annoying or attention seeking they do not add to the discussion and as not everyone agrees that profanity is harmless it should not be allowed in the most public areaswhat you want to do and say in private channels and forums is entirely up to you and there should be no restriction except those agreed to by the participantsi beleive in free speach but as you do not have the right to yell fire in a crowded theater reasonable limitations in public areas are sometimes necessaryf y b may be accecptible amoung a group of teenage boys but saying the same in a public forum and directing it to someone who may be a sexual assault victim is not just because the annonimity allows us to be cras and rude does not mean we have to be or be forced to accecpt such behavior
let me guess a gm gagged you for for harassing someone
hell nowe already cant hit speed fits missles are already lolz in fleet 00 combat compared to beamsguns at anything past middle ranges and you want to nerf missile users furthersure as long as you add antilaser antihybrid antiarty etc etcso stop already
you neglectedrigs  implants to improve all weaponsmissiles always hit  when their target is slow enough to be hit  and always discharge max damagealsoecm  countered by fof  surprisingly effective at close to mid range or long with cruise  actually all ew is countered by fof but they definately need some buffingsmart bombs  are not they can just as easily wipe out the equipping ships own dronesmissilessupportbuddies they also get the ship killed all too easily and cannot be used in empire space  unless you can lure the target to a planetmoonbelt that doesnt have a damn can anchored at it 
the discussion is not regarding rigs or implants not to mention rigs and implants are relatively even across the board for both turrets and missiles as such there is no reason to discuss themthis is completely totally and patently false if you truly believe your above statement then you are totally out of touch not to mention missiles also have flight timeyes fofs counter ecm but not effectively fofs are rarely a threat and are more of a utility item however ill grant your point as validalso completely false the comparison is missiles and turrets smart bombs are a very effective counter to missiles and pose no problems in empire unless being armed by a total imbecile smart bombs do not counter turrets they do counter missiles  and drones regardless my list still stands as perfectly valid with the possible mediocre exception of fof missiles as a rather impotent response to ecm
yeah 150km fleet blobs prefer turrets because of flight time im well aware of that however it totally misses the point missiles and turrets are fundamentally different weapon systems and should be treated as such turrets are better sometimes and missiles are better sometimes personally i think missiles get the short end of that stick most of the time and need some boosts to compensate for it especially at the level of capital ships the torpedo changes were a good start but not enough however we have in defenders a fairly wellsupported weapon that is completely and totally useless in player hands its interesting flavourful and distinctive but unfortunately none of that matters when the best use of defender missiles is as reprocessables fix defenders to be badbutusable instead of runningjoke and if that makes missiles worse then improve them accordingly lets not forget the get closer to him method of countering turrets being outtracked is a countermeasure too and a pretty good one simple enumeration of buffs and nerfs and comparing the length of the lists is a horrible heuristic for determining the relative merits of weapon classes
current defenders are indeed a running joke as are fofs if only slightly less sobuff both systems to be credible countermeasure  threat and youll actually see them doing something other than being refinedas for smartbombs ive used them in empire 10 space and wiped out small frig fleets but it does take a good bit of careful wisdom as to their deployment but  yes they can destroy the launching vessels own missiles and drones and if an attacker does not launch all of their missiles simultaneously a smartbomb is ineffective against them
definite thumbs up from me
well we can all agree to disagree
all valid examinations of canon material and actual racial schemes based around the ship designs the races use rather than the modules they get bonuses forunfortunately if the curse and huginn were suddenly inverted bonuswise the eve playerbase would have an absolute shtfiti agree with your assessments but dont see how they could be implemented
a dedicated exploration ship should be available but i think it shoudnt come with no combat bonuss and should require lots of science and combat skills to use  plus the spaceship command skills too  the high skill reqs would make it unavailable to newer players and allow specilization in that area  as appose to an interest  also if it has exploration bonuss with no combat bonuss it wouldnt be too useful in pvp which hopefully would make hunting it and being hunted quite exitingjust my two isks
i am not a new player player myself ive been on here for a few years i was just rather concerned about alot of the complaints that my friends who wouldve played the game brought up and i like how you explained it all and such and i agree just what i still would like to see implemented are better ways of getting new players involved quickly rather than it taking forever yes it is very different from many other games which is its boon and its bane i think though that if just abit more immediate action would keep more people interested early on
just sit in npc chat for a litle bit and you will see all the crap that fills these new players heads and the crap is coming from these guysgals that has never left the npc system let a lone ventured anywhere outside of their comfort zone having noob zones would compound this i think getting them involved earlier and quicker has little to do with overall sp and ooh shiny toys tbh it has more to do with being social and able to work with in the system there are plenty of noobs that flourish much faster if they take the initiative the ones that struggle are usually the ones not willing to put the effort in

i would love to see the implant fixed ive had one plugged in since i could afford to  read saved 250m  buy one on contract given that there were 4 flavours listed to be released i figured  like the others i spoke to  that theyd each affect one of the 4 variables in invention improve chances improve me improve pe or improve runs if the eventual solution is just to reduce invention time i want my money back i would never have bought the implant if it just sped up time to attempt inventions a large number of my inventions  and proportion of invention time have to wait for me to get home from work before being delivered and making it drop a little earlier wouldnt be any use since i dont bother with the hardwirings that decrease copy manufacture or research time why would i bother with one for inventionactually just getting my money back now so i can reinvest it in a useful hardwiring would be great dan
tbh a me implant would be much more logical if theyre unwilling to add success like they first promised id rather wait the extra time and have a bpc thats going to cost less to producebut some sort of answer is required so supported
i support this
support
fully support it perhaps have an indicator in station gui where it says port percentage used  so if you see that north exit is at 56 capacity while south exit is at 87 capacity then you choose north exit
yes i agree with the concept ships should be more spread out when they come out of the stationand ships should not be stuck trying to align when they exit a station a freighter has to spend minutes slowing down and aligning to get away from a station typically 35 minutes unless theres a handy object ahead to warp to

for the first point  good it brings people togethersecond s no idea where youre getting that fromthird  goodhowever there is a fourth point  these large alliances will have to spend more resources  people  on maintaining the security of their systems which means they have less resources available for expansion the borders will shrink and there will be more open space for younger smaller alliances at the very least theyd need a pilot in each system preferably one on each gate just keeping an eye on things or if a pos system scanner module comes out  which i support does the same thing as the ship scanner but has massive range and resolution  then it again forces them to withdraw from the borders and start maintaining their infrastructre or consolodating it from their capital out all good things in my view
itt idiotsim sorry but just because some people cant catch ratters or get a fight from people unreadywilling to fight them isnt cause to remove one of the oldest game features cus i cant kill that guymain posts were tldr but i gather you were trying for a fleet battle and no one wanted to engage you try and think of something that wont alter the game for your temporary adhd problemsoption 1 remove the ability to talk in local  how many times have you just mashed the local bar to just show chars it also cuts down on server load far more than spamming the scanner remember goons spamming fofofofofofo in local yeah well thenoption 2  as i read somewhere else in the post  make the scanner scan at intervals and make it about 40auconsidering most systems are that size or largeroption 1 would be my suggestion as it is less stressful on the server but  now unless youre completely oblivious to alliance intel channels and their uses  this should make an iota os sense  when the enemy is moving a fleet through your space how can you tell how many or what alliance if they rename their ships to sca  or star   its gonna mess up your ability to distinguish whos who and end up saying are you the mega no the mael noso you say post recons all over yeah cus we all have 40 reconcov ops pilots all gagging to sit on a gate solo for hoursyou cannot expect people on fleet moves mining ops or guarding them in the next system to sit there spamming scanner  or just watching it tick overlocal will suffice it isnt a massive problem its just inconvenient sometimes when you want a fight
at a time when folks still scream that there are not enough people in 00 and that the load on the empire servers is to high this would be disastrousyou would get fewer people going to 00more people would hang in empirethis is a game ship sensors commonly in science fiction can detect ships system wide to even systems away i see local as an expansion of that same sci fi mechaniceven if you did get it removed the info most likely would still be sent to your computer in order for the server to handle locations someone would just write a third party program that still gave them local and their corpalliance thus giving an unfair advantage to themin the skies above the world today we track every plane so long as their locater beacon is working rather than the complete removal of local introduce a new rig that when installed removes you from local it should be a fairly large calibration probably around 150 to 200 it accomplishes in some sense the same thing but without removing everyone and thus giving some semblance of safety so that droves dont stay in empire
if the jump gates are maned shouldnt local be reduced to so and so entered systems 20 mins ago and has not been reported leaving the systemor a general warningattention all pilots a wanted pilot by the name of so and so has entered system at this time and that is all that is usedi agree local chat has alot of problemsbut removing it from the game completly is just wronglike it or notnot everyone is playing this game for combative pvp and adding yet more things to do while playing a game is a drawback to people wanting to just play for a couple of hours a day
why is this failed idea keep being brought up time and time again removing local will increase the need for alts to sit their all day and scan gates constantly because to have secure space you will need to know who is in your space i am sorry but removing local will break the game hurt established 00 alliances and will give unlimited power to invading forcesjade let this dreamworld die
signedand the prox alerts are a great balance do it ccp
just read this paragraph when i saw you posted a wall of unrelevant rp text your idea is fail havent you got your own forum for carebear stellar managment issues
first off im pretty sure everyone has to train for a cruiser at some point they can skip a destroyer or a hac or something like that but to get from frigates to bs you have to have cruisersas for veld there are already ships that allow rookie miners to get at veld theyre called mining frigatestheres no way you can expect a rookie to grind their way into a barge or exhumer just so they can get at 09 ores unless you are talking about a hulk which is geared towards all ores except mercoxitt2 strips with t2 crystals thats how you get at veld fasteras for mercoxit if it is necessary for building any kind of t2 items i still think its a waste of an entire shipmaybe its the care bear in me but i try to rationalize most of the ideas that get suggested around here why would people living day to day in a world like this come up with an idea likeso i really dont see designing a ship just to collect veld i really dont see why they would have designed a ship just to collect mercoxit either just put deep core lasers onto a hulk and youd imagine that 3x lasers could work better than the 1x on a skiff perhaps they could have taken all the gizmos and gadgets inside the skiff and made a simple mining laser upgrade to do the same thing then the hulk could go to work and the procurerskiff could find a real use in life
nope everything over frigates is optional not everyone picks up combat ship skillssome pick up industrial and mining ships and that is itand by extension of that reasoning there should be no focused ships at all you should just need a module and pick the chassis you want
yeah the whole argument about what people train to use what is completely pointlessi am an industrialist i do not fight i do not support fights i do not scout i build and i sell that is alli have bs 5 but that was before barges so i could mine now i have exhumers 5 all the relevant reprocessing skills manufacturing skills i essentially have industry maxed outhow much gunnery do i have trained500 points yes five hundred so dont expect that we industrialists crosstrain to pew pew some do some dont just like you pew pew bloodletters crosstrain to minebuildthat said yes the procuror is broken in a hopeless way a few ideas presented have some merit but i especially find the t1 empire rorqual idea to be a pretty decent one  1 factory slot to compress ores at 2x the time plus the 1 mining laser  no gang bonuses or whatnot just the compression slot it would make this crappy miner a decent fleetmining support ship that can do its own little bit of mining
i agree that the procurer needs some work it can easily be outmined by a retriever scythe osprey etc  pretty much any dedicated mining ship other than the mining frigates 
the only time a procurer is useful is in the time it takes to train for the retriever  hardly an endorsement for buying this thing it definitely needs a look may i suggest1 increase the generous drone bay to 15m3 at least then you can go into systems below 08 2 increase the cargohold to 2000m3 at the moment you cant even hold two cycles worth of oreitll still suck but not quite as badly actual quote from its description
a little more damage a lot less costi wouldnt pay more than a million for a bomb
supported space whales are neat
would like to know when they gonna to fix if they gonna fix
yeah its always annoying when the drones get stuck on each other id love to see that fixed
it can be a total pain to be taking on quite a few ships only you have one drone wonder off and start aggressing a bs and getting popped for it
ive seen both bugs too but mainly the first one it doesnt happen often but when it does it can be very annoying and often costly my domi also thanks you for bringing this up
wow i in no way support this thread or even most of the arguments in it for or againstmissioning is not completely safe and it is not incredibly dangerous either it is a nice way for casual players to participate in the eve universe i know that some players in this thread fully support every casual player being banned from the game or leaving but i for one like ccp to have the benefit of their full subscription money and them only using the server load caused by them playing 12 hours a day using the reasoning that casual players leaving would improve lag and performance for everyone the hardcore players should all be banned 12 hours a day for 1 person multiple accounts ban one of these people and its like cutting the server load by 2030 carebears it doesnt sound as nice when put the other way does it missions serve a valuable role in eve and should continue slight tweaks will always need to be made but a nerf of these proportions is a bad idea
actually it was an useful comment since it perfectly illustrated why some people grossly underestimate mission income irony or not maybe you need to read the posts not just skim them through as i said above in my blockade example 40min for mission then 20min for salvage hour together typically when i clock my missions the time is from accepting to mission up to unloading my hauler this was also addressed above single character only
you know nothing about miningratting in 00 to know how it compares while you have to do the occasional storyline haul crap for 2 hours ratters in 00 have to safe up and cloak when hostiles enter system netting them no income at all potientally for hours the lvl 4 mission rewards in highsec are easily comparable to the ratting rewards in 00 imho that means that either lvl 4 missions are too rewarding or 00 ratting rewards too little i lean for the latter and dont want to see lvl 4s nerfed but i want to see our rewards in 00 and lowsec increased appropriately
so your main argument for missions paying crap is that you insist on doing the the worst possible onesi think you said it best yourself at the start of your postif you insist on doing your missions in the most obvious and populated spots youre taking a risk there are corners of space here and there though where your risk of being ganked is practically nonexistant youre just being lazy or stupid considering what youve written in this thread im seriously beginning to doubt the validity of your  self proclaimed  mission running credentials either youre actually clueless or youre blatantly lying and bending facts to suit your agenda
if u do the 00 ratting right than lvl4 is just comparable if u fit a 10bil worth ship to do lvl4 missions just in this case u can make same isk as with 00 ratting i dont spend so much ona missioning ship because i like more to gank them   but i tried missions and long enough 00 too and in 00 i made much easier a lot more isk with the same investment
for me its because i always get ganked in low sec its only since i trained up a buzzard and got a cov ops cloak that ive been able to run through low sec on courier missions when i have to  and ive been pod killed once while flying that as well  i think before i got the cloaking ship my average was something like 1 ship lost every 3 jumps its like i have a big target painted on the side of every ship i buyfact is i suck at pvp and i hate doing it as well so im not really willing to practice to get better i play games to relax not get wound up on adrenalin i accept that eve is not the best game to do this in but high sec offers comparative safety  yes there are dangers but i only tun a t2 equipped ship and use slightly suboptimal agents and so far have not been bothered by suiciders  oh and i run missions in a mega angels ones included  simply  i die in low sec so i live in high secall im doing is having a little fun in the eve universe not bothering anyone else i dont expect the pvp guys to understand why i like it  in the same way i dont understand why they like to play the way they do i am happy being an empire carebear i have no desire whatsoever to become one of the eve elite or even progress further in the game than where i am now  im happy with where i am
bad idea i thinknerfing current missionsremoving them would take more programming that could be better utilized in other areas it would also alienate part of the player baserather than nerfing hi sec they need to boost low sec and 00 some
hahahaha good troll now stop trolling this is a somewhat serious discussion
personal attacks are not permitted on the forums saint
where did you get the isk for a dreadnaught skillbook where the hell are you going to get the isk for a dreadnought you cant get it running lvl 4 missions because they pay crap all right right or maybe you should take a look at what you have written here and see that this here shoots down every argument you have made in this threadlvl 4 missions in high sec pays too much proof above so you have ratted in 00 for 12 hours a day 7 days a week then really may i ask do you work at allbut you dont have to do them like you said in your post my arguments win you dont know what youre talking about you have proven time and again that you have no idea how things work now stop posting
except that lvl 4 missions pay better than most other professions and even more if you take into account that they are virtually risk free or are you standing by your statement that high sec is like the wild wild westsorry to hear about your accident but dont you think you could be doing more productive things than playing a computer game for 12 hours a dayno its not ironic what i have stated in this thread has all been true what you have stated has on multiple occasions turned out to be completely false
youre joking someone got ganked in highsec its just like the battle of little big horn wickywildwild west k i like how you tried to make me feel guilty about your accident by comparing me to the one who hit you though how about citing examples where i have been mistaken i can do the same with your posts might have to do several posts due to character number limitations
i know its still funny that you go all omg its a warzone teh sky is falling over a friggin suicide gankyes they happen to people who run around in pimped ass ships the value of these mods make the ships a prime target for organized suicide gankersno actually the fact that mission runners get suicide ganked is because of the pimped mods they are able to afford from either their boatload of isk or the lp store otherwise they wouldnt get ganked its not for s and giggles you know its because its profitable for the gankers that they gankyes i could too i could also ss a  load of people getting killed in low and nulsec no its not a question of me not being able to see it its a question of you living in a bubble completely oblivious to what happens outside of your cozy little corner of high sec people die everywhere every day people die a lot more in nul and 00 the people who die in high sec are either war targets or stupid i have yet to see someone get killed in high sec  again barring war targets  who wasnt a complete idiot and did a costly mistake high sec is 99 safe missions in 99 safe space pay too much these missions need to be brought in line with other professions such as mining piracy  yes its a profession ask ccp  00 ratting industry trading and exploration
well your posts are at least consistent wildly untrue and exaggerated
my mission raven is all t2 with t1 rigs its worth a total of maybe 40m after insurance i do angel extravaganza  including bonus room  in about 15 hours with this fit i have never even had an attempted suicide gank because a few t2 mods arent worth it to a suicide ganker who stands to lose sec status for killing me no one needs faction stuff to do lvl 4 missions if someone is worried about suicide ganks then that person definately shouldnt use faction stuff they are not that much better and if you can fly your ship well they are not needednot really a mission noob what you posted here is an example of overpimping your ship you dont need that gist booster if you purchase it it is either because you want to pimp or because you want to be able to run your mission while afk neither is a good reason also suicide ganking is heading to nerfville unfortunately so soon you wont even have that to worry about high sec is also supposed to be dangerous just not as dangerous it is pretty well balanced now there is no suicide ganking epidemic and lvl 4 missions pay too damn much i say this even though my isk comes from lvl 4 mission runningcontinued
no my arguments are all valid taken from personal experience and backed up by the devs and other players your arguments are all falacies dreamt up by you ignored by most and argued against by the rest you might as well concede because the only thing you have managed to do in your tirades here is to paint yourself out as the biggest nub in eve and a huge target on your back to boot
another example of you failing to read i clearly said high sec has  pay because of its little risk thats equal to if not the same as not as dangerous youre proving my point that youre an idiot what personal experience youre running missions for gallentes federal intelligence office of course your experience will not reflect this as out your way no one gives a  about you 80 of mission runners run caldari their standings will be so high from preganking it will be difficult if not nigh on impossible to turn back and run another faction atleast not without considerable time and effort and loss of earnings your experience does not include being in the wild wild west so you cannot witness the epidemic thus you are in no posiiton to comment as for your comments backed up by the devs they are clearly in my favour if they are looking into suicide ganking the thing you claim is an imagination loli can live with my arguments being ignored by most because most people are idiots  happens
high sec should have  pay because of the small amount of risk there the problem which is being discussed in this thread is that it doesnt have  pay and no matter how many times you say it does doesnt make it so high sec level 4 missions are too profitable that is evidenced by the fact that even people with 00 access opt to run lvl 4 missions instead because they are safer and pays just as much your reply to my post shows that you didnt really understand my response you argued that high sec pays little because its supposed to be safe i argued that high sec isnt supposed to be safe in this post i also argue that high sec missions dont pay little so youre wrong on both accounts congratulationsplease explain what you mean by this are you telling me the gallente federation cares less of its inhabitants than the caldari state does if so what makes you say that and why the hell are you roleplayingwho the hell are you arguing with i never made any claim that mission runners should switch faction earlier in the thread someone made a point that if they did switch factions it would solve a lot of their problems but our little exchange here has had nothing to do with it are you hearing voices because i promise you im not saying more stuff to you than what is in my postsso where is the wildwildwest motsu oh ive been there plenty of times this character isnt running missions anymore ive got an alt doing that for me ill tell you what you spend a weekend in doril and ill spend a weekend in motsu we can both run missions or rat lets see who dies the most amount of times i said my arguments are backed up by the devs doofus like i am repeating what devs have stated before i am also able to read the player guide and the knowledgebase so i dont make stupid mistakes on the forums you know like you do continuously ever thought that it might be you who are the idiot i mean if everyone else is saying one thing and you are the only one saying something elseah  it youre probably jesus or something at least in your mothers eyes
you have completely misunderstood everything i said i officially give up now  off
good because you arguements and facts are crap
hello there i believe it is in fact you that doesnt understand his response i think what leglt is saying as youre nowhere near the parts of highsec space where the suicide ganking is rampant youve not experienced the horror and are thus unable to accurately discredit his comments because most people run caldari misisons theyre grouped together which makes the majority of gankable targets in a large group and it would not be worth the effort for a suicide ganker to go to gallente space with less people there and less opportunitiesi believe what leglt meant here is that assuming you understood what he was saying that to avoid being in the areas of highsec space where there is a highrisk of loss people would be unable to spread out across highsec to other agents for other factions to avoid the gankings because they run caldari for so long it would ruin their reputations with other factions in safer areas of highsec making it difficult to migratei think this argument shows you havent been to motsu or if you had atleast not within the past 3 months motsu is a lagfest simply because its got the highest quality l4 agent for the most popular corporation there if you have been there you would do the death may not occur in motsu but in the surrounding gates and systems due to the excessive lag if the suicide gankers dont kill you there the lag might looking through your posts i cant see any evidence of devs backing up many of your claims if any what i can see though are the devs accept suicide ganking is becoming a real problem which needs to be addressed or maybe im missing somethingi dont know you but if you ever had any credibility at all it was just lost with a yourmother insult sorrycontinued
i personally dont support the ops argument at all for several reaonsfirst of all it appears to be an assumption from the general community that mission runners are rolling in the isk maybe this is the case but i dont believe it is because missions in general pay out any more money than any other medium i believe its because with people like leglt having no lives they farm them and farm them then farm them some more they dont have the isk sink of losing ships to consentual pvp nor any limits on their time to stop them farming again and again if other people equally had no life they could farm an equal amount using missions or alternative methods as some of us like to have sex with our women and actually leave the house sometimes it limits our time to farm isk and during our limited free time we would rather be blowing something upi think really the heart of the issue is people are jealous in some way of no lifers because they can make money when we have a rl to get on with thats all it boils down to ratters can earn good money with some risk mission runners can earn money with some risks too though the risk does increase for caldari if you put in the hours it can be yours too i dont think people should be penalised for choosing to spend their time earning isk if you just cripple missions which is not necessary then those people may leave the game yes but they may also move to other means to farm isk and yet again a cry for nerf will be heard elsewhereit is for these reasons i cannot support the op in any shape or form and i would think that anyone with a decent head on their shoulders would agree
hello back are you legits mother i have been to motsu the reason its laggy is entirelly the fault of the stupid mission runners there i personally dont run missions there because im not stupidnot really difficult its just that people are cheap bastards and as legit eloquently put it  but this time including himself  idiots people dont realise that a lower quality agent in a system with less lag can very well get you more iskh than a high quality agent in a system with lots of lag caldari navy has agents scattered all over you just have to be willing to cope with a q10 agent instead of a q20 no what it shows is that legit has never been outside high sec despite his claims to the contrary motsu despite its problems is not comparable to the west wildwild or otherwiseyoure missing quite a bit what im missing is why you are throwing yourself into a conversation that is over legit has crawled back under his stone  in high sec  and i doubt hes coming back thats not a yourmother insult a yourmother insult would go like thisyour mother is so fat geologists are looking for the ktasteroid crater on her backnow thats a yourmother insultcontinued
no they really pay out a lot i am a pirate by trade but i use a mission running alt to be able to afford it piracy doesnt really pay anymore in this game i used to mine a lot i dont do that anymore because in my missions beside the bounties rewards standings and loyalty points i also get enough loot to melt down to raw minerals i get more minerals this way per hour than i do miningthis is all true but it is all legits problem not anyone elses in this thread we are discussing the realities of high sec missions while some people might actually be jealous this misses the point completely the point is that i and many others calling for this nerf are running this kind of missions we do this because it is the easiest fastest and safest way to get loads of isk most of us have come to realise that this method of aquiring isk is in dire need of a nerf because it threatens many other professions in eve whats the point of being a miner anymore you get more minerals running missions miners know this they have been calling for loot nerfs to missions for yearsanyone with a decent head on their shoulders would educate themselves more about what is actually being discussed here there is a real problem it has nothing to do with us being jealous it has nothing to do with mission runners having no life it has to do with an imbalanced mechanic within the gamebtw are you actually legits alt by any chance at all
bump
hmm a change like that proposed could have a massive impact on the markets i am not saying it shouldnt be looked at what i am saying is that it should be looked at under a microscope thoroughly discussed and analysed theres an economist on staff now how about he examines the proposals and gives some predictions of its impact to the markets
i must confess i dont really see the reasoning behind this proposal i do run missions from time to time but most of what i do is trade in the tech 1 market while not all tech 1 modules are money makers ive managed to a niche just fine and make a decent  though not extravigant  living while i agree that the rewards in missions might be too high i dont think altering the loot tables is the way to go as a new player getting lots loot in missions was a major draw for me  even though a lot of the loot turned out to be useless  and id hate to see the loot tables take too much of a hitif youre looking to lower the payout of missions i would look toward what part of the mission running tends to pay out the most which would be bounties
the mineral market will skyrocket  and everything will become a lot more expensive if this happens
i dont see why this is necessarily bad
inflation in t1 ship price far beyond insurance prices would hit hard the most isksensitive groups in the game newbs casual gamers non elite pvpers basically the groups whose ability to enjoy the game is most predicated on viable lowcost alternatives to expensive and spintensive t2 gear would be hit hardestedit raising insurance to compensate would be catastrophic  rarer minerals and more isk entering the system would create hyperinflation
i would estimate that mission runners are currently providing over 50 of the minerals entering the gamenow i can see that that t1 loot isnt very interesting unless you are new in which case it can serve as an introduction to a new module but i would be very concerned if this mineral source was removed i like the idea from the manufacturing side but i cant manufacture without minerals
huh granted my dimensions have evolved a lot over the years and im probably spoiled but quite a few bestnamedt2 mods cost more than a t1 cruiser  iow cruisers arent that expensive even if they cost double a freshman wont die of starvationbut according to your reasoning wed be on the right track to reduce highsec ganks 3
havent been a new pilot for a while but i do remember the average payout on level 1s was tiny compared to the payouts on level 3s and 4s seem to remember something like 40k for a mission reward if you affect a new pilots ability to get a shiny new ship that is better than the free ship how many will continue beyond trialaffecting entry level ship prices via mineral price escalation could have a huge affect on the new playerbase but would leave older pilots in t2 ships relatively unaffectedthinking about this i cannot support the proposal
this game is a game in which the market is driven hugely on player involvement by removing tech 1 loot from the npc wrecks you are giving the newer players a chance to make money by producing their tech 1 items and selling them at a higher price than what they can right now you clearly do not understand the economy in this game otherwise youd get why this is a great idea
out of interest what are you basing that 50 on
87 of statistics provided off the cuff are made upcwutididthar
curious idea lets think what a newbie need to be competitive in producing modules1  a bpo  ie isk to buy it 2  a researched bpo  time at least 30 days between research and vaiting time he has no pos 3  production efficiency at least 44  at least some skill in refinery efficiency or he will loose a lot of isk refining the minerals5  at least 4 standing with come corporation  see 4 above why 6  some trade skills to pay lower taxes and get some sell ordershow many months of play has your newbie
well said and written
in high sec all theyd have to do is bump you till your supply of scrap ran out this also has the potential for creating a substantial amount of lag depending upon how its implementedthe idea of some kind of scan shield is interesting though as well as the idea of having some kind of notification that youre being scanned the sound a scanner makes can be hard to catch in a crowded situation or if youre some distance from the scanning shipwindjammer
i see a lot of people have stated that the cerberus should get its bonus changed from flight time to missile velocity and for the most part i wouldnt disagree however if that bonus were to be changed to missile velocity what would be the effect of all those missile calculations on the servers would it not add additional stress which would manifest itslef as lagccp got round this problem with the 15 drone vexorishtardominix by removing that bonus and changing it to a damagehp bonus and only allowing 5 maximum i dont see how increasing the velocity of missiles will not result in lag on the serversthey do have a problem with hams and heavies overlapping though which does to some extent render the role not usefulness of the cerberus almost pointless but they are from different races and so they should not be rendered useless by each otherive got two different setups for my two cerbs and one uses 3 x bcs ii  2 x hydraulic bay thrusters with the net result of my missiles having a velocity of 109 kms the other uses 2 x bcs ii  1 x bay loader  1 x missile calefaction  effectively the same as having 3 x bcs ii  and the net speed of the missiles here is 8kms or so but damage is higher than first setupid say that most inties will be able to outrun these at 100km but any closer and im sure theyll hit any other ship will definitely take damage before it decides what to do and so theres no real point comparing a sac with a cerb in any fleet both ships can be popped its just a matter of when and how quicklyboth are very capable and diffent ships and yes there are some issues with the missiles which can be addressed but the sac is not better than the cerbjust my opinionjustice
support cerb should be able to fit hams  mwd  tank swap out the flight time bonus with an additional damage bonus
this sounds great i mean as long as were getting decorations and costumes why not go all out
great idea
i love thisespecially now i can see that more and more of the high level execs have something to do other than just being stationlocked what could be better than a negotiation taking place to the accompaniament of music or banquets to celebrate the success of a war campaign
exactly my thoughts in all points you mentioned jmkarr
im a scimitar pilot and as much as i like being able to jump out with this paper thin ship i admit its a little broken only a little because you have been driven awaytaken out of combat in itself logistics arent a threat sure they can return but being off the field for 1 minute leaves lots of room to kill stuffi believe the problem lies more within the fully recharged shieldscap when talking about stations passive tanks really dont recharge that much between gate session timers  and if they undocked with 10 theres really no need for them to dock up again zigzaging the remote reps to the others
this has been an aditional problem with faction warfare targets neutrals will sit around repping members of the opposing faction all day and it isnt possible to do anything about it
agreed
this is now an exploit petition the neutralimo neutrals doing anything to assist a war target should be considered an exploit or earn them an aggression timer toward the enemy for at least three hours  15 mins for npcs or before their ship will leave space after aggression if they log 15 minutes is far too short a timespan imo
i brought this up during the meeting in iceland and they agreed it was gay no worries hoss everythings taken care of
much love bane
i support the idea
you will not solve the missionerblob by removing agent qualities  in fact you will make it worse what makes the hubs so popular isnt just highquality agents but lots of high quality agents together which lets you dismiss missions with low returns without slowing yourself down this is even more important than the high qualityquality even provides an alternative to blobbing instead of working a hub you can work a single high quality agent near the lowsec border in return for less lag by removing quality you remove this option and basically force people to bunch in the multiagent hubs even more  which are better than single good agents but balanced by lag  by increasing incentive to do so because it just makes multiagent hubs that much better relative to everything else
this is a case of wishfull thinking imho if you remove agent quality players will still filter their agent place by system security statut and number of level 4 agents and they will find one or two systems that are perceived to be better than the othersit wont make them spread out it will just move the blob elsewhereit also has one big drawback currently you have two kind of highsec missionrunners the biggest part that dont think too clearly shall we say that stay in motsudodixiesaila whine about the lag but dont try to do anything about it the smartest and smallest part that has put its finger out of its butt analized the situation and went elsewhere in places where it wasnt lagged out by the first kindif you remove agent quality not only will it do nothing to solve the blobbing part but it also will force the smart kind to move away again
approving thislag in mission systems is horrible
eve community called for a nanonerf and theyve got one on the drawing board you cant claim the man isnt listening
ludicrous speedoh no weve gone to plaid
please visit your user settings to reenable images
actually hes perfectly correct the community at large asked for an examination of it due to the immense number of whines id say ccp have done a pretty good job overall and we still have time to make sure specific areas arent thoroughly broken  like blaster ships 
im not siding with either side herebut just because the man listened to a complaint that means hes knowledgeable thats some crazy logic you have there
im all my heart for nefing nanohacs and making ships tank ad fight  atm only good hacs are ones that can be nanoed in the eyes of majority but ccp implemented every idea ever given about nerfing nanoes times 2 way to go to break all known game mechanics not a good way to balance a mmo ccp not a good way
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
didnt you know ccps primary directive when dealing with imbalances there are only two choices ignore it or nerf it to the stone age doing it in moderation just is not cooland personally i am all for sending the nano back to the stone age anyway as long as it doesnt hit frig sized ships too hard
goons do it better
speed shouls still be an optionthe solution if any is to give some more ways to combat it not take away speed as an option
the dev post is a list of ideas that ccps team have come up with not the work of this single employee this thread is moot and should be removed reallyalso this isnt the place to discuss the changes proposed so please dont
csms falling to namecalling in classic goon style should be seriously looked at for removal
aside from the stuff being part of a greater design issue that dev is showing huge ignorance by basing his opinions in the thread on an insane setup  full snake set and t2 rigs a 4b setup  the complaint is legit imo if a developer shows complete ignorance about how things work in practice on tq
make a thread about it
nobheads like you taking things to heart should be removed from the human race
i see no reason why people who bring things to me should be banned its a witch hunt i tell you  its hot and im bored 
yes a nano nerfif u look on any nano nerf thread none was asking this just make some ships slower just that not big deal  plz link here where the community show a massive support to this type of changes but if u read better dont nerf the poly or overdrives just change al speed in game5060 webber
until i see patch notes meh so what and like jade said they obviously listened and if that is indeed true then nozhs proposals of the changes are not set in stone and he will be listening to see how certain proposed changes will effect the greater player base i have seen a few dev blog proposals never ever make it to tq or they hit sisi and then before release and with out warning it changed i would think before everyone celebrate and or cancel your accounts i would watch to see where it goes first
there is a difference between balancing and making something totally useless
to the op do you actually think that one employee is given the power to make such changes without getting agreement from others
oh hell yeskicking myself for not thinking of this first
this may be oversimplifying things but isnt flight time part of the trade off for not having to worry about tracking
if this goes in my proposal about making shield tankers damage mods go in the midslots must also be taken into consideration
this is actually a change that should go in regardless of its implications for making missiles a valid option for pvp this would also improve missiles for pve unlike turret weaponry which strikes a ship instantly missiles have to travel to their target and dont always reach their maximum range and are quite slow to begin with if you doubled the velocity but halved the flight time it would still give you the exact same base range but would make that rank 4 missile projection skill all the more important for pvp and pve to train to level 5supported
nonsensemissiles get one dmg modturrets get a damgae moda med slot trackingrange modand a low slot trakcingrange modstfubut ops idea sounds like winsigned
signedthis also should reduce the amount of overkilling caused by launching a second volley of missiles at a ship that dies when the first volley finally hits
doing this would be a severe nerf to antimissile systems which already are subpar when compared to antiturret systemsit might still be a good idea on the long run youd see more ships like the typhoon in fleets but there need to be a viable counter to them
never seen the original dev post so i can not vouchsafe for the truthfulness of the statement but i have seen several people referring to a dev statement saying that missiles have already the max speed manageable by the system apparently the the calculation for missile acceleration trajectory and agility  they have a agility stat as they dont turn in 0 space  are pretty heavy making them faster will require more operations as they will need to check positionspeedtrajectory more often it is like for the drones the absence of drone upgrade implants and the often broken effect of drone modules is linked to the load they impose on the system adding something to them will increase the load after that and adding that a simple exchange double speed for half flight time is a large boost for missiles and that it would require some other tradeoff to keep it balanced i am favorable to this suggestion
signed
as i understand it missiles do not reach their theoretical maximum range  flight time x missile speed  due to the fact that after being launched they accelerate to reach their maximum velocity it would be nice to know what the acceleration figures are for the various missiles as then the number crunchers could produce a spreadsheet that would tell people what their true firing distances arehowever on topicgoing twice as fast for half as long may also help with the nano issuesupport
their primary research division  core complexion  is in amarr space i dont know about their secondary research division however but it only has 13 the research agents of coreccp look into this and advice the core complex board to move themselves back to minmatar space
anyone who does research knows the current character development is extremely poor the entire industry manufacturing and research portions are in desperate need of an overhaul a good system is fun challenging involved and rewarding eves system generaly fails in these areas we need someone on the council to get this donethats why we have ank
thats hilarious i do think a few changes need to be made regarding structures and so on not just agents caldari megacorps operating in gallente space  considering the megacorps are the caldari government its much more pressing than gallente corps operating in caldari space as gallente offices are just businesses not businessgovernmentmilitaries can i stick a rider on your billdespite how well the gallente and the minmatar get along i dont think theres a single way to get between the federation and the republic that doesnt involve running a gaunlet of lowsec systems perhaps a more experienced player can prove me wrong but ive yet to find a way to get between the two allies space that doesnt involve going through a few systems of gankspace
in all honesty there are corporations of all factions operating in their enemy spacegallente operating in amarr space  another research corp too creodron  and caldari spacecaldari science corps  kallakiota  operating in minmatar spaceamarr corps operating in minmatar spacewith the emyprian age bringing war across the cluster it makes zero sense whatosever why corps especially core scientific corporations would operate out of enemy territory
youre living up to the standard of intelligence youve so proudly displayed elsewhere particularly in the nottobenamed issuewindjammer
i disagree with the opself destruct serves its proper function nothing broken or overpowered about it dont fix what aint broke
if i have a mechanic wire my ship for self destruct i want him to wire all parts of it then ill inspect his wiring and make damn certain that the charges are so placed to blow up everything and deny my attackers any dropped loot the attackers will get to salvage what is left
i think self destructing is right to not leave loot  thats the whole point of self destructing its a last ditch attempt to at least make sure your agressor doesnt get a piece of you to address the problem of not being able to destroy the ship before it self destructs you could eithera  leave things as they are just bring more firepower next time orb  once self destruct is initiated all modules should shut down in order to channel power to the self destruct mechanism or something like that
if you cant kill a ship in the allotted two minutes then you should think about bringing more dps to the fight end of story this doesnt need to be changed
employment history should only be visible to people with appropriate roles theres no reason everyone needs to see my entire corp history
i dont see a good reason to hide it frankly
so what do have to hide that you do not want people to know
i direct your attention to this thread as probably the single best demolition of your position in short a corp history provides a prospective corp a lot of valuable information about your play style as well as providing enemies with intel on you and telling people your characters date of birth it hardly makes sense that your characters history should be hidden when it could be publicly compiled by anyone who takes an interest in you
how about no corp history tells someone a lot about a person

with the upcoming speed nerfs and nere of webs can large ships be given turrets that are good against ships of a smaller classspecifically i would like the dual heavy beam the dual 250mm railgun and the 1200mm artillery cannon and their cruiser gun size counterparts to receive tracking and sig radius buffs these weapons lack range and damage and in general are regarded as pretty terrible turrets give them a role

missile boats can be used very effectively in small scale pvp however they require more brains to use then a typical turret sniper to snipe in a missile boat you need to have another ship or ships hold the target in place so he cant warp off for this reason missile snipers do not scale well in large scale pvp for a large scale pvp engagement the fact that turrets instantly hit becomes much more of an advantagemissiles have two main advantages over turrets you do full damage at any range and you can choose your damage type not sure if you have heard of burn eden
and now look on the killboard u posted and tell me how much they used the cerb
u all telling that missiles are no sniper weapons which i fully agree and than u dont see a problem if a ship get 2 bonuses to increase the range of the long range missiles to 150kmsure by hams are this bonuses usefull pity the cerb have no the grid to use an effective ham setup which would significant increase the dps if he loose the rangeall u who tell the cerb is ok with missiles because u can have a tackler which is close and dont let warp the enemy out is bull why to have a 100dps ship to point and a 300 dps ship to do damage from range if u can put the 2 pilots into a closerange missile ship like the sacri and have double the point and double the damage
this made me lol  with capital letters  thank you
so try fitting an absolution with mwd 1600 plate and heavy pulse omen etc well see if you get better resultsyou seem to think that caldari ships are somehow entitled to always have a dual lsebased tank and that the rest of their fit shouldnt suffer from it that isnt the case if you fit oversized mods the rest of the fit should be gimped to some extentso youre a fotm user explain a lot on your views of proper balance
heres an issue i keep clicking assembly hall and keep getting features and ideas discussion ccp fix your forums please
never tried a ham cerb i see
check your dev blogs and smoke a fattynow that snakes and other speed screamers are being brought to heel  but not slaughtered thank the almighty balance bat called nerf allrighty ccp now boost the halo set to be effective beyond dusty collectors items  singular use of possessive collector cause who else bothers not me too po about bloody time shoulda come down the pipe with the privateers nerf
and the issue youre raising with this is
to advise folks to read the dev blog and stop yammering about it
then its a reasonable issue though not one that needs to go to the csm
yes wonderful lets hurt the only viable way to really avoid a titan blast and encourage even more blob warfare and beat on the only pvp that required any actually skill unless targeting the right thing and shooting your guns requires skill
your tears not enought salt go back to the corner and cry out some more adapt or die your stuff can i havehmm what else has been said to me by nanotards when i say speed mods need looked ateither way it its now the nanotards that need to go gry in a corner then after their cry they can adapt or die and on the way out the door hand me your stuff
thanks caldari you b so much you got the devs to nerfsay bye bye to tech1 cruisers also
i think this gentleman hasnt noticed that webs are getting shafted too something tells me that most experienced pvp outfits will adapt for the purposes of empire and faction wars but of course it does certainly make avoiding the blob in 00 that much harder and will again reduce viable raiding opportunity in sovereign alliance territory im disappointed this development agenda will come to fruition before fixes to 00 sovereignty systems and overwhelming defense advantage
welp time to start theory crafting this proves that cross training is your friend
frankly this is so much change all at once that i have no idea what to make of it i like the bit about making speed be better segregated by ship class but as to the interaction of scram mwd nano polycarb od web and implant changes i dont even know where to begin especially given that im not even sure what they intend nanos to do  you can bet good money ill be on sisi on monday to try it all out though
ah and there was i under the impression that titans and huge battleship fleets arent that common in highsec or even lowsecseriously 00 isnt the only game in town nanoships can be used everywhere i agree with jades point that addressing 00 blobbing titans and so on needs looking at as well if you remove the counters to that specific specialised form of warfare that said im unconvinced that it has been removed you will still be able to go fast just not insanely fastid also argue that flying most ships can take skill particularly tackling regardless of whether its a nanoship or not
ahh and if you do take a looksee at that nice little graph on the blog youll see that the peak speed of almost all ship classes is not being reduced all that muchim not too keen on the web changes however because a battleship coasts right through them esp something as beefy as a mwd typh or mach its a wait and see and evolveand ill certainly be evolving because i tend to favor speed myself but cant afford snakes so i can go flashing from gate to gate without hitting the warp button
i am not to sure why this is so much of a surprise to any one each and every race of ships and every profession gets hit with something every patch if you have been in the game long enough it just become routine and learn to cross train to adapt to one nerf on one and take advantage of a boost somewhere else
this is a good change90 webs will become 5060 web scram becomes mwd shut off switch speed that breaks game physics calculations gets fixed etc etcnow attackers can actually get a fight if the defenders decide to try a cloaking nanogang crap adapt or die is the old phrase
to my mind eve should be a myriad of styles when everyone and their dogs are fitting speed tanks on ships that arent supposed to be speedy it indicates to me something is brokenedit forgot the thumb
you are pretty hilarious poor pvper and have no clue how game mechanics work nothing wrong with speed just eve attacking a disproportionate amount of losers
incorrectspeed is broken but it can be countered with extremely specific shis running extremely specific setupsie everyone needs a hyena or better yet a huginnrapier in their fleet or many of them they simply have very little other choice at all period whatsoever the only way to catch a speedfit is to slow it down and only webs can  partially  slow down fast ships  unless they manage to coast out of range everyone should have a sentinel or better yet a curse  not a pilgrim   in their fleet to sap the speed ships of their energy but that still wont enable you to catch them without the aforementioned minnie ships a bs with neuts eh very limited utility unless the speeder wants to also scramthus you have 1 class of ships that can potentially make a speed fit  and there are many many speed fits not just 1 class of them  slow enough to strike and when the speed fit feels the tickle of a web its goneoh unless the fleet has a lacharaz but thats not as much a necessity as the hyenahugso as you can see speed does have its limited countermeasures but it is broken under the current mechanic

this is by far the moast profound statement on the internetz today if it is fast you must catch it by god we have pure genius here so cap warfare has limited utility the curse is just a joke as well can you do stuff in an internet spaceship without cap drakes anyone no really i didnt know that
first point is valid second is not the web sphere of doom needs to be looked at however nano really isnt that big a deal and people should quit whining
so speaks someone who thinks going less than 6kms is being parkedi did not say speed was wrong or ruining the game or noncounterable only that it is inordinately balanced currently toward other types of combat its either catch the mosquitos or watch out for the hot drop with out a whole lot in the middlei didnt gainsay the curse i pointed out it is the second most valuable ship in a fleet after the webbers cap warfare is extremely valid only that heavy neuts  heavy can ya read  due to capping out at what 25km unless you pay out the ringpiece for factionlet me restate speed is broken but it can be countered it merely needs  yet another  close look to bring it back into balancefor a start switching the  bonuses on snakes for the  bonuses on say halos or talismans
luckily nano changes
speed is being fixed check your dev blogsccp is reducing snake implant bonuses to be identical to the  particularly useless  halo  talisman levels
you got what u wantedstop whining
thank you ccp
as the original poster of what is the oldest and largest speed topic brought to the csm i must call the csm to shout at ccp until they abandon this ing stupid mwd nerf their dev blog is entitled speed rebalanced but in actuality should be called look how ing stupid we still arecsm i demand you do everything in your power to put a stop to this
as someone might actually notice this here instead of general whining forumrebalancing ship base speeds good idea ccpincreasing stacking penalties for ods and polycarbons the needed thing goodnerfing snakes 56 was too much but the nerf might be to hardcapping all mwds to 500 okishmwd reactivation time also the thing excellentnot actually boosting abs bad callweb changes mwd scramb interaction horrible horrible horrible  
was always going to happen if you nerf speed you need to nerf webs otherwise webs become an absolutely overpowering factor in fighting i do predict an increase in frustration as more targets manage to crawl back to the gates to escape combat thoughi do agree also that afterburners do need improving
i suspect its too late to stop it outright ivor there has been too much of a head of steam build up by the nanowhining brigade so we are going to see an end to nano speeds and increase in more static tank and gank based warfare for a while what saddens me most is that this is going to happen before 00 is fixed so its going to reduce the opportunity for raiding and small unit pvp in anything but cloaked ships still i suspect it drives more people away from 00 and into the arms of faction warfare and eventually that will make it increasingly evident that 00 sovereignty does need fixing and eventually the right thing gets doneship balancing is a bit like parenting though sometimes you have to let the little darlings find out what jalapeno peppers do taste like rather than just telling them see you in my uber tanked rr battleship on the flipside  in empire 
but what happens with blasterboats abmwd mandatory still every ship with base speed higher than yours will run away or give you enough transversal to turn blaster dps into nothingimho web needed rangestrength scripts not total nerf
bring friends  with loads of webs  nano nerf was always going to be a solo playstyle nerf
could ccp please look into giving the tower a common access materials baysay perhaps 1m storage that assembly arrays labs ect can draw fromor set the corp hangars up so that those arrays can draw from it so were not handing materials all over the place to get things done
have to nix this idea sorryive been in this game for 4 years and have not once seen any idea put forward on the ideas forum brought forward other than bug fixes and balances ccp might respond to 1 thread in a month or six and its usually a poopoo looked into and not viable or whateverthe ideas forum is pointless except as a void into which ideas  the really really good and the really really lame  disappear falling back into the inner system on regular cometary orbits to burn brightly for a day or two before disappearing toward the outer system for a month
personally im a sucker for detail and feel things should go in the right place i can see what youre saying but i think the assembly hail has fallen in to disrepair because of little to no moderation and lack of action of the csms part it may not be entirely their fualt given how much ccp have altered and gimped their roles but the way forwards to my eyes is thisideas go into the ideas forum as its where they belong granted not everyone will see them and they may not get a dev response but now the csms exist they dont have to there is nothing stopping the csms regularly visiting the ideas forum to sift the wheat from the chaff so they could then reccomend to escalate threads themselves for putting forwards to the councilas it stands now the assembly hall states it is to raise topics to the attention of the csm personally some people may consdier raising an idea is to initially create it my view is there is an ideas forum for the conception and the assembly hall exists for the escalation if the csm was doing a good job they would be aware of the topics on other boards and they could raise them here instead of assembly hall becoming the new ideas forumalas youre probably right though even if things should go where they belong they probably wont end up there
funny when these sections of the forums were implemented things that had the issue tag in the title had links to previous discussions that had alot of replies and support now its just crap really getting sick of looking here used to be interesting not anymoreeveryone is aware of this but i have to give the obliged thumbs up
yeah nothing stopping them but nothing at all prompting them forcing ideas back to that useless forum will result in the same thing thats been done for the last four years nothing
they made gravimetric belts stupidly hard to find for a reasonif they moved all of the ore belts to exploration i can see them making gravi a little easier to find but there would be sigs in every single system so you never know which of the 13 gravi hits has decent ore and there will be 200 peeps in the system scanningleave the existing static belts as they are and do something about the macros not the exploration content itselfi would however like to see exploration bcs that can find and then work through midrange exploration content without having to slog along an alt or three  finder clearer cleaner a tier2 t2 bc with zero gang bonuses but able to fit a cov ops cloak  or standard with velocity bonuses  probe launcher and scan time bonuses no damage bonuses but all of them relying on drones only for their primary damage then give them tractor range  salvage success bonusescurrently the only ones that comes close to this are gallente boats or arbitratorspilgrim due to their reliance on drones give them the exploration bonuses and they would be the utmost perfect exploration vessels
following on from the ship idea would be changes to how ore asteroids currently work1 all asteroids will not show their type when initially discovered instead itll show up as being an unsurveyed asteroid2 you can mine these asteroids however all youll get is a hold full of bits of rock  this wont affect the ore content of the asteroid  if you want the valuable ores you need to survey it first3 survey scanners to change from an area of effect to working only on the asteroid currently targetted4 once surveyed the asteroid changes from unsurveyed to its correct type mining then occurs as normal5 once the ore is depleted the asteroid doesnt just vanish instead it becomes a barren asteroid completing a cycle on a barren asteroid will again give you bits of rock which youll need to jettison or perhaps a use could be found for these  a bpo for construction blocks for example 
this kind of thing should be battered out in features and ideas first
you have a good point requested that this post be moved
ok now imagine yourself being a 3 day old newbee in a mining frigate how is he going to do all of the items decribed above
whats sad is that people are trying to rewind time as far as mining is concernedonce upon a time settlers came to each new system they established a stargate they put up some stations and then they started looking for resourcesthey sent out probes and tracked down there the local asteroid belts were they went there found that they did in fact have a decent supply of ore and they posted a beacon take a look the next time you warp to a belt theres a little teeny dot in space where you first landthats what people are trying to get rid of which is a waste they are upset that its so easy to mine forgetting that if only explorers could find asteroid belts then the industrial market would crash immediately how many 2 day old rookies are trying to sc their way to their first cruiser by way of mining veld and you want to force anyone intent on mining to first specialize in explorationsomeone already found those belts and marked them for public usage making everyone have to find them all over again or especially find them again and again day after day is just taking a step backwards
thered be nothing stopping pockets of low level asteroids showing up on the onboard scanner perhaps as a gravimetric distortion perhaps even on the overview in place of the current belts youd need the probe ship to find the better unbeaconed sitesa survey scanner requires electronics ilock asteroid activate scanner mine asteroid profit
perhaps though it does make a certain amount of sense after all those belts were located a long time ago with all the mining  not just players im sure the empires themselves have taken a fairly large chunk out of the belts hence why you cant find high end ores anywhere in high sec outside the exploration pockets  it makes sense that theyre extremely depleted heck as a way of introducing this why not max out the current belt asteroids and allow the players to run them down themselvesas a way of keeping things interesting you could give the surveyer the option of whether to register his survey results  changing the overview from unsurveyed asteroid to the correct type including remaining quantity at time of survey   or ignore them leaving the asteroid showing as being unsurveyed once registered anyone can mine the asteroid  useful for corp ops  freely that way youre never sure if the asteroid youre scanning is a fresh asteroid with potential to be something special or something another prospector has scanned but didnt think was worth his time to registerof course you do need to keep a supply of asteroids available for new pilots so every downtime 10 of the current barren asteroids in a belt will vanish to be replaced with new unsurveyed asteroidsanother idea could be for storyline prospecting missions say a systems belts are depleted over the course of a day as a storyline for those doing the mining missions you could get a mission to track down a known gravimetric site in that system and anchor a beacon on behalf of the mining corporation  which you could turn down with no loss of faction standings in return for a nonmining storyline  once the beacon was anchored it would appear on everyone in that systems overview as an asteroid cluster allowing people to warp directly to the fresh cluster the beacon would deactivate once the pocket had been mined out  less than 10 roids left these dont respawn 
theres a lot of talk about how to fix the problems caused by mission running hubs and a lot of suggestions on how to fix it but i have a suggestion of my ownremove all agentsreplace with locationless personal agentspersonal agents are very simple basically you phone ie eve mail them or open a talk window from within a station  your personal agent and request a mission from them of whatever level you want and they give you the mission outline which gives you all the information you needthe difference from a normal agent is you can spawn missions from any where lets say youre out in some backwater high sec system you ring up your agent shehe gives you gone bersek level 4 spawned in the system youre in you gain access to these personal agents ether from them contacting you or if you seek out their phyiscal locations and talk to them perhaps requiring you to run a 10 part mission to gain their trusti dont really expect this to completely solve the problem of mission running hubs but it should allow us mission runners more flexibility in where we choose to run our missions rather then being forced into grouping together at the stations where the best agents are
that is one idea letting you run missions from whatever home you want to set up so long as there is a stationanother would be to remove the level of the agent and go only by standing to that agentso when you get an agent whatever his type he starts at l1 q20 as you run missions his quality and level go up capping at l4q20 in 05 l56 for lowsec and 67 for 00the only problem is the number of agents for a particular division in any given station  4 intelligence agents in 1 station ect  they would have to lower that of at most 1 per division  1 int 1 manuf 1 personell ect oh yeah and cap agents available to npc corps at 30
this could quite possibly still create missioner hubshow mission runners would check the map select a 5 system that has no low sec within 23 jumps setup base there then ring their agents for a mission as the supply of these 5 systems with no low sec in 23 jumps is extremely limited it just means all the maximised mission runners would be in a couple of systems
i did say it wouldnt completely solve the problem but it would possibly allow the current ones to break up and it will also prevent new mission runners from being drawn into the same systems over and over again seeking good agents
basic idea is good and gets my supporti am sure it would require a lot of tweaking beyond the broad outline maybe things like limiting a personal agent to a constellationimplementing this would allow a restructuring of missions in general and storylines in particular i think ccp realizes that a good portion of the player base   did not say majority   have chosen a career path other than combat pilot there is nothing more frustrating than doing lvl 3 manufacturing and mining missions only to get a level 3 combat mission for the storyline in order for a player that wants to mine to do level 3 missions they need the industry skills and the combat skills for level 3 missionsas a researcher i feel i am being forced to cross train research and combat if i want to gain faction combat only pilots do not have the same requirement when the japaneese bombed pearl harbor admiral yammamoto did not fear they had awakened the american military power he feared the american industrial power point is there are other things that make someone valuable to their country   faction   other than pewpew but pewpew is by far the only way to gain faction in evea major rework of the missioning system would allow a restructuring of the division system that would sort mission types into basic types with no need to decline missions because you work for a manufacturing agent and he gives you a combat mission properly constructed a manufacturing agent would not have combat missions in the mixthe current setup seems to be biased to combat pilots forcing those that want a different career to chose to not gain faction or to cross train for something they chose not to dothe combat only pilots would lose nothing by such a change ccp might retain a few more noncombat subscriptions if implemented larger subscriber base is a good thing
rather than resetting current ships it probably would be better to balance by introducing newer shipsmodules along the lines you suggest
may i interest the readers here in this topic about t1 loot currently running parallel
win win and more win
very simply it takes 1 second best officer smart bomb to make a titan 100 immune hell to make any ship immune to citadel missiles
i dont see the smartbomb issue as an issuefirst it require a pretty heavy investment 3 faction smartbombs to be 100 effective as a missile defense that means 3 slots on ships that have 5 high slots  for carriers  and a carrier with only 2 high slots for remoteneutother is severely limited in usefullness add to that a hefty cap drain when theyre active something like 56 to 80 capsecond for 3 smarties that mean your tank wont be as good as it would be without themsecond for once theres a defense effective against missiles because defenders just dont cut it its hte only effective defense for a nonseepd ship and you want to nerf itthird the can tank an infinite amount of phoenixes is pretty lol as you could say the same with a carrier tanking an infinite amount of revelations if it fits 2 overdrives and keep a high transversal that will never be a problem because youll never see a dread fleet with only phoenixesi wont comment on dps as i havent used them but because of considerations like high alpha strike complete damage type selection and no cap used they should be the least damaging of the xl weapons last i think there should be capital cruise missiles to give phoenixes a longrange option and citadel torps should be reduced in range dps of both should then be tuned to be competitive but not overpowered
i agree regarding insurance currently paying too much and t2 insurance however i think that t2 insurance should still be a bit below market value to make those ships really matter to lose  but not be absurdly expensive to lose as they are now  however i disagree with regards to suicide ganking it should still pay insurance but with the adjusted insurance prices it will be more practical and not occur as oftenalso faction ships should not insure for their full value that would be a tad ridiculous
while i agree with the issues in this thread they really should be 2 or 3 separate threads to allow more granular voting
definetly in support of all points made by the op
no sorry but i just dont like it
they have contemplated this system for years and came to the conclusion that it was just too complicated codewise to have in essence a flying outpost  in relation to destructable systems 
while this seems all too much detail and micromanagment to add to laggy capital fights i do like the idea of making capitals capitals but all that would be necessary is a buff combined with making them more expensive  maybe that 500 structure idea combined with raising build costs and removing the option to insure carriersdreads dunno not a capital pilot yet 
by now theres probably something like 12000 carriers and 3000 dreads out there they just cant be special anymore
if youre going to do this whole subsystem targeting you should make it part of the whole systemfor example when you fire on a ship you first hit the shields this is the first section of the ship you can target once youve broke through the shield you can then target other sections of the ship such as for example the engines the engines are armored and you have to break through the armor to disable occurs randomly once its under 75 structure  or destroy themdifferent sections have different ways they represent their hp shield emitters only have protection from the shields they emit and some structure where as the bridge has shield  seprate from the ships shields  armor and structurenow we generally talk about shield tanking or armor tanking in the sense of how much hp each section of the hp bar has where the best resists are located and where the slots are most abundant on a capital ship we have an added element how many targetible sections exist on a revelation for example youd find 6 shield emitters and 30  or whatever  armor sections where as on a chimera youd find 36 shield emitters  and thus 36 separate ship shield sections  and a mere 10 armor sections in other words when you target a capital you have to fight through various layersship shield sectionarmor sectionstructure orsubsystems shields if any subsystems armor if any subsystem stucturedepending on where the sub structure is located you may have to first break through the ships armor section first as wellwith subsystem targeting id like to see the current model of fitting ships done away with as well rather then having a max of 24 hard points you could have a max of 24 hard points per section although youd have to restrict what modules can or cannot be placed in these slots ie you cant fit an extra webber to an engine section mid slot
from what ive gathered so far most of the players that have suggested changing the missioning system fail to realize the ramifications of their proposed changescurrently all suggested changes would bring only one thing to eve the cancellation of thousands of subscriptions its not an overexaggeration but a cold hard fact all the propositions so far pretty much force players into lowsec mission agents or into ratting to continue making isk once players start to do this a few things will occur bloating over lowsec once people move to different mission hubs bloating over the lowest truesec of 00 to get the best ratting done and a lot of ganking not pvp ganking a lot of people in empire dont pvp for good reason this will bring no pvp only ganking and once people get ganked their subscription ends with frustrationpeople really have to take into account what people will feel once they feel the hammer of wrath from other playersnow onto my idea its actually rather simple i dont want to suggest dynamic agent quality like others have nor static agents instead i suggest agent quality depends on personal standinghow this would work is rather simple you find an agent in a really empty section of space theyre not used often maybe because before they were 18 agents now you have a really low personal standing with them so they give you really bad rewards but if you work hard that standing rises and with it so does the rewards and missions you have access towhat would this solve well it would solve mission hubs if quality was based on personal standings it would allow people to leave if they wanted to and work hard to get better agents and all those people could spread out and thus mission hubs would gradually lessen until the lag isnt as terrible as it is nowbut agents as they are now have a few flaws their placement isnt that great and there are not nearly enough for the factions to support their player base it would be nice to have more agents for those corporations that give out the best rewards namely ships hence the popularity of the caldari navythoughts
agreedthe standings of the agent and only that agent should be modified by the pilots standing with that agent  not the agents corp  so if someones dedicated to their agent the quality of that agent should go upthis should not be modified by skills only the pilots hard workall agents should start at 20qas a matter of fact the agents should have dynamic levels as well as quality so essentially every agent in eve has the potential to be a level 4 if the pilot sticks with them they start at l1 q20 each and every one as the pilot works with them and their q goes up they offer steadily increasing mission levels up to lvl4 q20  in secure space  and lvl56 in lowsec and lvl67 in 00this will spread the mission base out a lot more homogenizing it across the eve map rather than in overworked little clusters
not good it means you take the agent nearest the trade hub of your choice and we get the massive network effects that created jita and motsu
if you do away with quality entirely the exact same thing will happen if you make quality based on agent standing the only thing creating lag is people who are too scared to move on to another system as for everyone else well if you dont like the lag you can move to a new system grind up personal standing and have an agent thats just as good as the agents within a hub just with far less lagof course this means agents really need to be more spread out while still being in locations where empire players feel safe and there needs to be more agents in high sec as well for densely populated areas
definately so otherwise people will just go to a system with the most agents in one station and grind all of them up to lvl4 and farm the absolute shyt out of them some limit needs to be put on how many lvl420 agents a person can have in a single stationsystemconstellation
eh i dont think agents should be able to grind up from level 1 to level 4 along with quality only quality should be dynamically altered by your personal standing then having a lot of agents in a single station would result in that however as it is there are some corporations that do have 4 level 4 agents in a single station in a single system all in the same branch this should never happen and those agents should all be movedthus i dont think there should be a limit as to how many agents are in a system but they should be more spread out regardless
the problem is that having lots of viable agents in one system rather than having one good agent is what creates the massive mission hubs with intolerable lagwithout spreading the existing agents people will do exactly what was described above get however they can the most possible favoringthem level 4s they can and farm the good missions  if you mission you should understand the significance of always being able to casually drop massive attack duo of death recon 23 anything in a system you dont want to travel to etc edit so while i agree with you on spreading a limit on how many agents in a system is exactly what is needed among other things  also maybe itll satisfy the calls to nerf missions that are getting so common because spreading agents is exactly that 
with ccp stating that they will be looking into the risk vs reward of suicide ganking i would be cautious in introducing something like this the idea is not to remove suicide ganking entirely but to make the suicide gankers actually work for their paydays its a nice idea but i dont think something like this should be introduced until we see what ccp does about suicide ganking
id say this sounds like a database nightmareeverytime someone scans your ship regardless of where they are the game has to check back with your hanger over in jita before it can give them readingssad but true
that would be perfect if you stuck your can in jita by the time the database call worked through the lag and gave them a reading  during which time the scanner is frozen in space  the freigher will be 2 jumps away on autopilotive looked at it for years  4 to be exact  and i have yet to see one idea put forward there make it to patch other than bug fixes imbalances have been rectified but never with any idea  good or bad  put forth in that forum it should simply be deleted
oh dear gods i completely missed that bitbad idea terrible idea horrendous idea just go with the usual one presented in fi  im a regular   whereby it returns randomness much easier to handle
jump out in a raven with a couple of sensor boosters on with range scripts have a friend agress you whether by ecm or guns or whatever at say 85km or greater range try to fire your fofsyou will see the bug of which i speakthere are no targets in range of your arbalest cruise launcher
fixed they no longer exist they were taken out a while back perhaps because their damage was  t1 regular cruise
here how about thismake all missiles fof by default regardless of what type the arewhen theres a locked target selected all the missiles go after it as normal focused fire if the target is lost  youre jammed it blows up  all subsequent missiles become fof  yes your launchers dont cycle off  until theres no foe left to shoot at priority is ships before dronesif you shoot at a locked target thats out of range or that goes out of range you are still launching missiles at it regardless  just like now  until you unlock the target or select another and reassign your launchers
pateria you do realize that fof means friend or foe right meaning that if you fire that and you have someone repping you you are pounding your buddy and if i understand you correctly it looks for the next target once lock has been lost if thats the case i do not want to be any where around you when you fire those things off in a fleet battleyou are asking for an signature seek type missile but it has to know who is friend or foe however and i am not sure how you would do that
the fleet i was in the other day ran off the attackers when our fof missiles killed their drones dont underestimate them  
 are too too shorta ship logging under gatecloak vanishes 60 seconds later regardless if it is aggressed or not ships should remain in space for 5 minutes though they should emergency warp as normal within 30 seconds unless held down by a pcsourced warp scrambler npc warp scramblers should not hold down ships that logcrashwhatevercurrently its impossible to scan down a ship that logs and barring a blob anything with a little resistance vanishes before being destroyed if the pilot can log before the first aggressionlikewise jumping resets the aggression timer to zero so that once they jump they can immediately log and their ship escapes unless blobbed on the other side
im in agreement that the mass needs reducing to t1 variant levelsas for bonuses id agree more with the people that asked for extra trackingor equivalent bonuses to fight nanoships  explosion velocity for missiles tracking for guns  without increasing the overall damage output of these ships youd make them one of the few ships that could fight nanos without being fitted for speed themselves this would not be a bad thing at all
i like that gallente are more drone spec thats cool but asking that all the other races completely lose their drone ability thats lameconsider that industrial competition not to mention full out war usually leads to similar ideas one side will design a product and when the popularity catches on then the others will make something similar in the hopes of swaying the market with their slight differencesso its not inconceivable that the other races would have seen gallente drones at some point and thought gee why dont we have those and then went home and made them theres nothing genetically bonding about drones that only a gallente would be able to make tiny engines tiny guns and remote controlsso i agree that gallente could have more drone stuff going for them but thats not to say theyd be the only ones with themas for gallente doing too much damage realize that the amarr are the ones with extra storage space gallente ships have higher bandwidth to field slightly larger drones than normal but still in limited supply so if you are able take out the drones then you know all they have left are whats fitted or mount some smartbombs and take out his whole wing in one swoopdrones arent the end of a battle theyre just another source of dps
you are wrong newbe can buy a hardwire implant which give same bonus as additional skill  which isnt really needed to fit all ships with reasonable fittings  idea is to give additional way for everyone than implant  cause older players already pay alot more for clone than newbe if someone doesnt want to wait a month or so he allways can buy a proper hardwire implantbesides everyone have same rights and can start play game today or could start play 5 years ago and spent alot of real money till now if someone doesnt want to wait he allways can buy an older character
stats shouldnt be in the game at all and no this is not a trollremoved learning skills and implant stats and starting stats and hell the stat windowmake every skill train as if you had 30 of each stat and learning 5 right out of the gatei am not kiddingthis would eliminate the learning skill grindthis would make more people pvp because a lot of people buy implants for nothing but the boost to learning skills and then that makes their pod more expensive and less likely to risk pvpthis would eliminate the pidgeonholing of sorts say you have excellent stats for training manufacturing and science but now you want to try out flying combat ships and guns and all things pew pew your stats may be totally gimp for training those things this would eliminate that pidgeonholingstats in eve  pure lose lose situation nothing good comes from it lots of bad does though
no they are optional and variation between different characters stats is a good thing also it would be one hell of a job for ccp to compensate all the players for the sp
i would love to see a dedicated exploration ship introduced a ship with the exploration bonus  equal to or better than current  and that has a bonus to probe carrying capabilities i want to be able to carry enough probes to scan down at least 2 systems for any type of site found  ie full set of each type of probes  the only ships with the bonus now are so small for storage that you have to have another ship to carry extra probes and carry the loot away i dont think that a dedicated exploration ship should also get combat bonuses because then it isnt a dedicated exploration shipjust my thoughts

qft most mmporpgs have a quick progression to 25 of max level and after that theres a bit of grinding and slowing of progression of course 25 of max level isnt anywhere close to 25 of the power of a character maxed out so i really think eve is still better in this respect you can train quite a few things and earn quite a lot of money  for a newb  before anything but the quick lower level learning skills will help you and you dont have to do any grinding other than for rep or isk the skills and your power in the game improve even if you have an insane workweekfinals or whateverwhen i was a newb last november i was given two pieces of advice that were pure gold 1 you only need to train learnings to 3 then train the stuff you need  all lower learnings empathy to 3 takes 2 days 7 hrs on a minmatar brutor slave child all pts into percwill which is a worst case example everyone else will train them faster  go back later and finish them when you start training things higher and 2 salvage by doing so i had a balance of candy and vegetables and all the cash a newbie could wanti have a corpie who started 2 days earlier than i did and has like a million sp more than i do since he started by maxing learnings out  54  800k of that is in learning tho and he has a wellrounded stat distribution im finally taking the lower learnings to 5 however and once i finish that ill be continuing to train the percwill stuff almost exlusively so itll take me less than two months to pull ahead deciding where you want your character to go and specializing is something i actually gleaned from the forums  thanks allps if a newbie doesnt have any clue and just trains for the next big ship theyre going to lose it get frustrated and leave just as fast as the bored newbie we had new recruits who did just that and despite our best advice  which they were too impatient to follow  they lost too many ships they couldnt afford to and left  i just think ccp has come to the conclusion that yes if they could go back and make the perfect eve and scale it perfectly for newbies and vets alike they would but they cant and theyve accepted that as it is the game is not for everyone

i am posting to inquire as to why we care what jade constantine and not the rest of the csm thinks
this goes back to before the vote when the op couldnt find my post on the main page see the second post in this thread
yeah i know im going to be posting about roids but what you expectlook at it from the perspective of a returning player like myself 2 years ago i didnt have any real issues finding a roid to mine in any system now their like rocking horse turds or the size of a rocking horse turdit seems ccp have dealt all miners a an ace card at the same time as kicking them in the teeth when i played last server population was breaking records at 21000 they were just releasing the ore ships and everything looked good for miners now the server reaches 34000 almost everyday and the hulks which  the covetor are in game yet the roids themselves have not had any loving or thats how it seems too many of the belts in high sec are gone or as good as gone ive gone round after down time and scanned some of the belts that were not there before dt and the roids which have spawned are giving me the same numbers back as i saw when i was in my uber osprey so whats the deal increase server population by like 50 and the power of mining ships by a good 400 but keep the roids spawning at the same rate i do honestly think the roid respawn values need a review i would say maybe an increase of 200 on popped roids would be a fair and reasonable response to the current climate in game and for roids that havent been popped but are still standing maybe 250lets be honest more and more people are joining the game or so it seems so the infrastructure is going to break there is more and more demand but the less and less raw materials as every day goes by
95 of null sec roids are not mined at all go there
even low sec had a decent number of roids when i last looked sure that would mean having to actually defend yourself but they are there and all the pirates are gathering in fw areas
i think in the interests of streamlining the whole csm operation its probably a good ideaanything rejected by ccp in its current form would be reopened for discussion yesitems accepted by ccp would be closed to prevent something that will be looked at overshadowing new issueshowever i have two concerns1 the reply from ccp that something is being worked on and two years down the road theres no sign of change while the issue would have been closed to future discussion as its being looked at2 csm was setup to filter the concerns of the playerbase and to come up with big ideas what happens if an issue important to a large proportion of the playerbase isnt picked up by a csm member and how can we come up with big ideas without knowing what is and what is not in the ballpark for change
while i like this idea and would support it i would like to propose an idea of coming up with a balancing list as a single proposal and allotting the whole list  as a single proposal  for one 20 minute time slot that would allow items that might need to be discussed at least a few minutes to talk about briefly while ensuring the whole list doesnt take up too much timelooking back this doesnt seem very different from your idea i suppose its just a different way to look at it
are we working on things they want to see as noah mentioned about niggling is that what we are doing in the dev teams eyes still are they expecting to see a grander scheme as they had mentioned i for one am guilty of the niggling as much as i want to present a larger picture or something i cant get by the small crap that has been driving us nuts for years i think if we can see what ccpdev team would like to see from us in a tldr fashion i think we can narrow the niggling a bit and maybe get some quicker responses
right now anything that is rejected by ccp is discussed why and alternative solutions would be but in place that was how we did it in iceland but the new format will probably not make that all that much viable so i think we will have to wait and see as i cant give you a 100 correct answer since the statistical value of our previous experience is extremely insignificant items that are accepted by ccp usually takes very little time to discuss again that is how it went in iceland but that is no promise it will be true in the next 2 meetings too  1 i understand what you are saying but i think we will have to accept that ccp is a company large one too 300 employees  that is extremely agile in its process so we cant change that there will always be features which will take years to get into the gamebut i think its extremely important to facilitate further discussion and i like to think that we are doing a decent job of that it could be better but i think that will change in csm 2 once we have the csm format in place2 well this is always a large concern for me the community should not be filtered only monstertrucks and the like should though  but right now we do followinga we pick up top 23 of all issues being discussed based on the amount of support this means we will always be talking about the hot topicsb we are forced to pick up on issues which have support worth 25 of the total voterbase i think this is quite steep but if the community really wants something to happen its possiblebut its also something that i struggle with sir its hard to find out what is in the ballpark for change so what i do if there is anything that might even be relevant for csm i post it in the csm forum
you have to view it from ccps point of view fixing niggling things is basically farming the base   existing players   its not profitable where as grand ideas can attract new subs its all about buzz these days
i obviously wasnt in iceland with you but if your description of the process is accurate there needs to be streamlining for the issues that just dont need 20 minutes of discussion this sounds like a good method of doing so
although the community is concerned about balancing issues i just dont see how the csm can effectively translate those concerns to ccp when you have half the players calling for a nanonerf  for example  and the other half saying its fine what is the csm going to do ship balance isnt the kind of thing that can be legislated it really takes devs to make it workits one thing to say we want less incentives for blobbing or even speed is better than everything else and thats a problem but very soon you cross the line into ship x is useless and finally topics like the crane needs more powergrid are taking up as much time as big picture issues like factional warfare and bounty huntingobviously theres cases to be made for all sorts of balance issues and this isnt to say that they arent great arguments  but frankly its a waste of the csms time to get into nitpicking when ccp has already said they want to hear big ideas for them to figure out how to implement and balance issues are just a distraction from that important taskin the end there just needs to be another outlet for these kinds of things it shouldnt be done through the csm
i for one have been very happy with what has resulted from the csm meetings so far i expected this was going to be a rocky process especially with ccp giving so little in the way of guidelines reading through all the meeting minutes has shown a huge improvement in organization which i believe will only lead to better thingsim just posting to say that it would be nice if the meeting complete post were edited into the op so that when going back to read old minutes it would be quick and easy to review the chatlog without having to shop through the whole thread looking for italso i am unclear as to the format of the op there is a section for the popular issue taken from the assembly hall but i dont actually see anything being filled into that space does someone from the community need to submit a template for it or should there be a csm whos job is to select and write up the popular issue or is that section even necessary

yeah i have to come down firmly on the side of against on this oneas many people have said this is not a nanonerf this is just a nerf everything in sight that has to do with speedif ccp thinks the speed in some ship types  andor specific moduleimplant combinations  are a problem they need to address those specific areas not every single thing in the game that has to do with speedthis is just an utter fail way of going about it

again someone bends it all to suit their own purposes this is not a simple yes or no topic most respectable pvpers know that nanos need balancing that consisting off brining polycarbs inline with their module counterparts and stopping cruisers getting over 5kms sans vaga this does however exclude screwing over normal nano cruisers in the 34kms rangeso no like most i dont oppose balance i do however dislike random ed changes and mass nerf batting

against go to hell ccp
im against this nerf
ccp are crazy  against
they are fixing speed by removing it and taking away blaster ships at the same time
against this is not the way this is going to kill off pvp using ships smaller than bsbc not all of us like flying bricks words fail
againstdevs should play the game a littlethe speeds are quite balanced right nowjust take a look at killboards they are full of popped nanoshipshow come they die that often if they are invincible

i think its tragic how ccp is talking about fixing the effect without even mentioning the causeit was obvious that nano needed nerfing as speeds over 78k breaks the physics engine but i will remind you all the dev blog was just an idea for which they wanted feedback so its not even sure that it will happen
we will signed if the ccp make a smart idea for fixingbut this idea will make the game to ruinthe devs will make unuseable the all matar and half of gallente ships and overpowering the caldari shipswe dont wanna this looking another ideas like a script for mwd aka lesser throttle  lesser cap penalty or somethingstacking speed modules oklesser mwd throttle ok  300350 maybe would be enough web nerf a stupid things when a web can kill the nanosscrambler mwd off effect stupid thing too with 8km range
against the nerf this is crazy this will make the game drakeravenonline
this is not a balancing it is a complete removal of speed as a tactic at all in this game maybe poly rigs need to be brought in line with their t2 counterparts but instead of actually nerfing the specific problem the suggested fix blatantly nerfs every possible aspect of speed which is rediculousthe fact that ccp seem to think that t2 rigs and hg snake sets are the normal thing for speed pilots to have just goes to show they are far removed from their own game if speed is removed from this game to the extreme that they are suggesting pvp becomes nothing more than sit stilllaunch misslewin drakes and ravens will be kings they already are extremely difficult to kill  if fitted correctly for the engagment  in nano shipsas someone said in the enourmous thread ccp need to actually look into and show statistics and data on the supposed nano ship problem instead of just counting on the tales of crying players who get their horribly fit raven ganked by hacs while ratting in the open with hostiles in system
let pvpers decide the fate of pvp in eve
i like a lot of the individual changes being proposed the redistribution of ship speeds by class the polycarbon nerf and the elimination of mass reduction are all likely to be good things and i can see the web nerf and the meta0 mwd nerf being good things as well though im less sure of those but so many more of the individual changes are utterly wrong people spend billions on snakes and destroying their value this thoroughly seems a mistake boosters arent as expensive but them having utility seems a good thing and sig radius just isnt as important as speed if theyre underused you dont nerf them similarly if youre willing to give up 300 dps of heavy drones an 83 web is not unreasonable and so nerfing the virtually unusable web drones is a mistake and the scram change while interesting on paper just seems foolish  mwds arent a problem inside 9 km because of webs  theyre a problem at 1520 furthermore their whole approach seems flawed speaking for myself i dont want a speed nerf nerfbats are unsubtle uninteresting and just serve to  off people who have invested a lot of time and money into doing things in a way that is no longer possible what i want is a countermeasure worth a damn right now i can think of exactly one module a generic nonnano ship can fit to counter a nano ship and thats a heavy neut not counting funky faction webs and stuff theres no t2 ammo that provides a tracking bonus an ideal role for tremorgleamjavelin imo  theres no web with enough extra range for less than 200 million theres really nothing thats the problem  the only decent counter that lets you actually kill a nano hac is an interceptor add an antinano t2 ammo and maybe change webs such that a higher meta adds range instead of speed reduction  t2 webs doing 50 at 20 km would be almost enough by itself and change the paladin and kronos to 10 web effect to keep the 2in1 effect  but dont just say everything speedbased has got to go and assume thats a fix let alone the right fix cutting all speeds in half doesnt nerf nanos worth a damn it just buffs bubblesand to stave off whining the only ship ive ever speedfit is an aresalso thanks to the op for posting these threads in such a clean fashion
give us the means to fight the blob again
another thoughtless solution from ccp that will ultimately do more harm than good and imbalance the gameplay more than it currently isi am for well thought out solutions the suggested changes are anything but
im sure all of the other people in this thread and other will give reason as to why this is a terrible idea i choose not to because its so infuriating that i want to fly to iceland and beat the devs senseless
we all had it coming so come on folks lets just suck it up and use your own wordsadapt
the devs clearly dont play their own game4billion is vaga is clearly a standard fit  and the fit was  aswell 
against in its implementation outlined in the original devblog but probably not for the reason you would expectthis sums up most of the points quite nicely though
if this nerf would happen it would ruin the game for everyone i know in eve this is idiotism speeds just as they are now are in good dont  this up for everyone this will cause total chaos
i am against the nano nerf the way it stands now

have to agree with this 00 combat is already dying to the endless blob and curse of absolute defense advantage this nerf to speed should never ever be implemented on the live server before there are significant anti blobdistributed sovereignty attack measures enacted for 00 space current situation with nanoships and speed is not driving significant numbers of people to actually quit the game of eveonline removing any opportunity for non blob warfare in 00 without addressing any of the issues with blobs and mindless lagfest hotdrop warfare in 00 will actually drive pvpers out of eve and its not in the interest of the game in any way shape or formantinano whine brigade will end being the straw that broke the camels back in 00speaking personally i dont actually mind many of the changes on the table in and of themselves  but they are simply a terrible idea in the context of actual warfare on the live server in nullsec right now i cant support any gameplay change that will further increase blob power and defensive bonus in 00 and so if we ever get a change to make a decision on this on the csm ill be voting against it and expressing my opinion on the matter in the strongest possible terms to the developers
why are the pvpers always adapting we use ecm you whine for a nerf and it gets nerfed we use damps you whine for a nerf and ccp nerfs it we use nos you whine for a nerf and omg guess what it gets nerfed we are always adapting always coming up with new ways to make your sorry excuse for an eve life miserable so the nano nerf really wont change anything telling a pvper to adapt is like telling a shark to swim hes doing it anyway
against
for some of the changessuch as reducing the agility in mwd use and scramblers being able to shut them downthats a proper use of counters which i can appreciate
its totaly crap
im not too bothered about speed being nerfed  although i dispise the fact that ccp are nerfing skirmish mods when its a tool that is used by a very small number of people and those people who do use it have likely spent the best part of a year skilling to help their gang mates   but i dont like the way in which this is being achieved with a shotgun nerf to pretty much all things related to speedtheres no way to predict the outcome of making this many changes  no not even on sisi  at once when the problem could likely be mitigated with one or more well placed changes instead of a blanket of poor decisions

i fully support that only viable setups for hacs and css even for those of them that are not made to be speedtanked being a speed setup should be nerfed and that ships larger than frigates  and frigs t2 cousins  should never reach speeds at which they can avoid 9999 of all incoming damage and completely break the commit to pvp idea of eve by being able to disengage at willhowever ccps proposed fix will break to many things all at once they should at most addfixtweak stacking penalties for polycarbons nerf snakes a bit not halve them and should rework ship base speedsmassesagilitiesso ccps proposal in full not supported
well im not quite against speed nerf but im for sure against making 2in1 scrambler module  make a new one if you rly have to block mwd  and web nerf  nerfing nano counter module sux   it wont affect nano it will affect all kinds of warfare prolly making disbalance

nano needs to be dealt with but buff the counters dont remove the cause no matter what you might think speed is fun and fun is importanta lot of what is proposed is completely over the top consider perhaps a hictor script which has a slight web effect or something of that nature the mwd nerf is ott and dont get me started on the web nerf

goodbye nano ships i wont miss you one bit
i do not support this topicas all of you nanoers were so fond of saying stfu and adapt n00bs
nano ships are good as they are now and as everything in eve they can be countered with the right thinking  and i dont mean more speed 
against nano nerf
way too much fix polys evaluate after a month or two and see if more nerfing is required youre changing too much too quickly
just nerf all nano equipment same way as warp core stabs with a lock range and or penalty per module fitted ie overdrive polycarb etc means u can still rig for speed for running away but pretty crap for pvp it worked for the core stabs dont see people flying with 4 stabs on now im more concerned with halving the webber penalty that sucks makes huggins a pile of crap

i am against the majority of the proposed changesas a ship builder many of these changes will effectively kill off the demand for many of the ships and mods that i produce  ie blasterboats and many minmatar ships as a pvper these changes stand to consolidate the viable playstyles and make the sandbox that we all play in much smalleryes nanos need a change or an adjustmentbut the proposed drivel that was proposed is going to cause many more problems than it solves
against

disagree the scram change actually makes that mod useful again nobody uses them because why bother when you can put a point out to 25km with a disruptorand the web change is more like an ab boost befor a web would kill a ship with an ab now a tackler can slow down a ship with a mwd by i think 92  turning off his mwd and webbing  but the same tackler can only slow down an ab equiped ship by 5060 which for a small frig orbiting 400ms is still plenty fast to avoid turrets in a close orbit

yep basically there are several very important areas of the pvp game that need fixing before speed and im definitely against this nanonerf coming before such issues as antiblob measures in 00 sovereignty warfare even deaggression timers remoterep flagging alliances in faction warfare and even things like loot ownership in pvp we had a chance at the csm to prioritize these issues and speednerfing didnt even make the first cut

except that most people dont post at all unless they are unhappysomone said it in a different thread and its probably pretty close to true90 of people who are happy dont post90 of people that are unhappy postits why when there was no nerf on the horizon the forums were filled with people complaining about nanos and only a few people responded to them in defence of nanoing all the time generally regurgitating the same tired counters to nanos which all entailed either flying a bs so you could fit a hvy neut or flying a nano yourself those were not counters its pidgeonholingim for the changes because it rebalances the ships those that were meant to be fast still will be inties and frigs cruiser sized ships wont be as fast as they used to be they will be catchable by the things meant to catch them like small drones the small ships and some missleswarp scramblers are getting a buff a good thing cause who used them anywaysthe web nerf is actually a ab buff in disguise a tacler with a scrambler and a web will slow down a ship with a mwd more than befor by like 2 but will only slow down an ab fitted ship by 5060ships will still be able to be fast somone did the math in the dev thread on the blog and the dev was mistaken it wont take snakes to get a vaga up to 4k a t2 fit vaga will still pass that without implants

well against this nerf idea is a joke and a discrace to a good game
ccp need to fix all the overpowered advantages  cyno jammers system scanners jump bridges  that theyve given to the big 00 territory holders before they mess with the only tactic that currently makes it viable for a smaller corporation to take on the complacent big boys if these changes go through the only solution to the jump bridged blob will be a bigger blob
just no to these changes far too many changes for a single nerf and in the process weakening the minmatar hacs and recons too much
too harshballance cant be achieved this way
so much worse in game needs to be fixed first

againstthis nerf completely eliminates any role that speed based pvp had it would be completely unfeasible for any ship bigger than a frigate to engage in speed based pvp including those that are designed for it  stabbervagarapierhuginnmacherial it practically eliminates any role that matar ships may have had and leaves that race without a purpose and without any competitive ships outside the the frigate class

i support the nano nerf even though i sympathize with those players who spend billion in their ships it shouldnt make them invulnerable no matter what and nano is just that for those who say that they have the right to be invulnerable because they spent billions on their ships well eve is not about who has the fatter wallet right i believe this nano nerf is going to bring diversity to gameplay in eve while still allowing speed as a viable tactic but not the ultimate tactic i also read lots of the posts on the comments of the devblog and tbh the majority of those who are against this nerf seem to be players who have adapted nano warfare as their only method of pvp and forgot that eve is all about diversity of tactics so for those people i say i am sorry but i am not convinced by your point of viewalso for the argument that nano appeared to counter blob warfare guess what right now the way things are we are heading toward nano blob warfare which i believe would kill eve and i do believe that nano is one of the main reasons solo pvp has died out tooit may be painful this nano nerf but the way i see its better now while the majority of eve doesnt nano because that was definitly where we were heading to and if that happened it would have been too lateby the way i just bought a nano ship a few days ago and i have trained a lot of skill just to be able to fly it oh well i will just have to find another use for it now and i am sure those skills will help in some way or another i will just have to adapt
withdrawing my support although speed does need to be controlled the changes on sisi are too many and complex a fix should concentrate on the causes of ludicrous speed  mwd speed boosts implants gang bonuses and polycarbons adding the sweeping massspeed changes and scrambler changes in at this stage just confuses the issue
although a speed freak myself i must agree with the adjustments being made herethe real shame is that more people will have to think about strategy and tactics now shudder
yey bout time
nerf it
supporting a nanonerf provided that they balance speed tanking as a realistic proposition for smaller vessels against armourshield tanking for larger vessels obviously smaller ships like frigates cant really soak up the kind of punishment that the larger ships can so they should still be able to use speed to the degree that theyre reasonably protected  though not invulnerable  against heavier shipsthe way to deal with these ships should be to take them on with ships of the same class frigate dogfightsinterceptors should gain limited protection against the proposed changes to warp scramblers theyre meant to be the kings of speed after all

i support the nano nerf but not in its entirety i support all its motions except onei do no support the 75km scrams deactivating mwds as this is just too unnecessarily catastrophic to blasterboats and does nothing to solve the actual speed problem as the prime offenders will not come closer than 15km anyway

i support this effort nerf interdictors as well bring them inline with thier bigger brother the hic and make it all focused leave the bubbles to the anchorable structures imo removes the need for speeding away from the blob as the only viable option
its for the bestben
changes are being put on sisi on monday iirc its still to early to judge the nerfs before they are tested anyways i doubt that they would be implemented as they are now i think ccp has just come up with some radical ideas and will let the forum whiners shape the actual nerfs
even if you are for a nano nerf unless its this specific nerf you want you should post in the other thread this affects more than just nanoespersonally i am against this nerf ccp would do better by adjusting snakes and polycarbs than nerfing speed as a whole
this will be difrent p

i like this idea and its the main reason i voted jade also along with this some more interesting ew could be added like scanner spoofingi also like the idea of pos mods that functions like a radar and detects signatures in a certain radius or in the entire solar system which could be configured to report any hostile or neutral signatures being detected
first i agree with jade on the original proposal not necessarily the specifics but the general idea the post above is on the money i may have more to add later once ive thought it over more
yes remove local csm get to work ccp starting to go looney with ed changes next we have a space pony that suddenly blows up an entire system on super titan
youve maam have made the best argument for removing local i appauld your effort and am glad i voted for youbut like you said the ship scanner will of course need improvements user friendlness and a more active stateroleuseability like narrowing your scanner would be shown as a graphical representation on the scanner page by reducing the drawn range rings size any hits will register accross the range of the as an arc  so you cant tell excatly where they are at the range but you know they are there at that range  hopefully this could be real time info instead of constantly hitting the scan buttonanother thing someone mentioned passive scanning turning on passive makes the scanner sweep and record hits if they pop bigger the angle shorter the range but better coverage and faster speed on the sweep where a narrowband sweep will give best range but slowest scan you also cant aim this scanneractive would have aimable scanners but would be very noisy in themselves putting results on overview would make it useable too or at least make the results rippable from the main scanner window and resizable on its own we could possibly see an apperance of ships and more gear based around this mechanic  hacking ships that could change thier and neary ships thier iff friendly instead of hostilenetural while they perform thier havok a mini capitol could act as a mobile scanning platform skills to improve sweep speed and scan resolution of course the idea only covers onboard scanners a deployable scanner would be all the more better than the ships provided infoalso any room for a system wide distress beacon launch a warpable to neutral beacon visible system wide as well might be used for baits traps and other fun things
also if you remove maps statistics would it be possible to have a interstellar probe launch platform pos anchorable observatory something that would launch a probe systems away and spill that information about that system but only certain specifics like traffic cyno activations and large object population of course homebase players can find this probe and destroy italso my ears perked up to devs saying how they want to add in fw elements to 00 conquering this included having gate guns that have to be manned if local is removed would you pefer these become automated and squeal alerts if they are attacked or attacking to help ease patrols and personal required to maintain space once again hackers could come into play allowing disabling of the guns iff scanners letting hostile fleets though untouchedalso since these changes are so sweeping i purpose the replacement mechanics to be installed first and fully tested before removing the local
admittedly i havent read through all of the threads responses but id still like to give my own input on the matterim all for removing local i think it would be great and have many tactical advantages scanning would become more universally used and not so much just by those persons that wanted to track down that person in local that seems to be evading themi would think that it might also promote more opportunity in 00 security areas for those corporations and alliances without space of their own it would become harder to detect enemy presence in some backwater outpost that might be claimed but not necessarily defended unless people pop onto local maybe wed see some of the larger organizations scramble to put forth effective intelligence and eventually give up on such huge land claims deciding it wasnt worth the upkeep perhaps theyd resort to taking smaller areas where they could possess effective intel and quick response timesim just thinking of the possibilities here of course ive not been playing long enough to judge the full impact it may have but id be more than happy to see it implemented nonetheless

if you want to remove local you need a whole host of things changed aside from the map giving away your position if youre a ratter the truesec status of a system also gives you away if i were a gankfleet all i would have to do is go to a 10 truesec system and i would be guaranteed to have people out and about ratting dont need anything for that but most of the things you already touched uponif i had to describe an ideal system where there was no local it would be like this1 asteroid belts not visible on scanner but need to be probed out or basically remove all asteroid belts and increase the number of exploration plexes by a factor of anywhere between 3 and 102 longrange permanent scanners and with variation between shiptypes a frigate could have the 15 au scanner but a battleship should have a 75 au scanner and a carrier should have a 150 au scanner3 ability to set passive warnings so you know when people are warping in4 iff transponder tech ie i need to be able to see if that guy warping in is a friendly 5 ability to see whether ships are in use or powered down and remove those from the scanner ie parked ships at a pos need to be filtered out if so desired6 ability to detect the presence of cloaked ships not pinpoint em but general presence in the area you can make it a bit chancebased andor require a specific module but the ability to at least detect is very importantthats the most important things i can think of at this point
first off intelligence needs to be more proactive and its own game mechanic so i completely agree with the removal of the instant intel with local and the statistics info from mapsecondly this change is a boon to pirates and carebears it helps pirates by allowing them to actually set traps at locations other than gates they can camp roid belts with a scout and drag the other ships from roaming safespots and carebears benefit by having a modest level of protection by not being immediately identified when a pirate enters systemthird new tools should be added that gives an alliance the means to get system intelligence  anchored scanning dishes  and gives players the ability to make intelligence gathering their key function  recon probes etc fourth and final now make this information available to fleet commanders  through scout assignments  and alliance leaders  through tactical maps  make it so that having these assets in place and using gathering intelligence actively is a important as having a tackler in your group a player or corporation shouldnt be able to see whats happening in another 00 system all the way across the map if you dont have assets there or the rights to check those assets  a radar dish sitting in one of your covert poss  the place is unknown to you players of all pursuasions should be able to avoid conflict simply by watching a chat channel ive used both myself i know how easy and iwin it is if im in a carebear setup some identified comes in local my cloak goes up and i can wait them out if i am in a corp war or tactical situation and a blob of enemy enter system ill go to station and either log or go afk its too simple players need to be proactive about using scanners and protecting themselves smart fleets already have scouts ranging ahead and behind this will make it crucial for survival and make you post scouts to your sides as wellim 100 for this and have been for two years now please take the iwin button away and make it mysterious again
remove local every twobit lowsec pirates gankers wet dream you go this idea while popular with the small group posting here would not set well with the masses
love the idea and there really does need to be some way of seeing cloaked people if this goes into effect or cloaked guysreconswhatever will become overpowered its been said in the thread before i know but just my thought
wow kinky my thread is back from the dead i support
actually the comparison to naval and submarine combat is pretty spot on as to what similar mechanics id like to see  i got stuck a few hours in a game called silent hunter 4 after watching the movie das boot and i got to say submarine combat is awesome though the game has a fastforward function that lets you roam the pacific in 8000 times faster than normal because otherwise traveling would take weeksi also just learned to use the hydrophone its so exciting listening and hearing the enemy destroyers engines and at which bearing they are locatedand its really scary when youre in the command room in silent running mode and you suddenly hear the sound of the enemy ships active sonar and shortly after depth charges explode all around you shaking the boat like crazybut my point is the most awesome thing about it is the hunt you dont know what is out there and you have to use all sensors and means necessary to find out some methods make yourself valunerable by for example surfacing the boat to use the radarid really love for the scanner to be more powerful and dynamic and not favor either the hunter or the huntedlike in reallife you could have passive and active modes active could have longer range but those using passive would get a warning that someone is using it and thus they would be able to warp outalso detecting someone warping would be awesome
this could make the system scanner pos mod useful
not supportedim no 00 plebe to be sure 00 politics drive me utterly insanebut i dont believe ants like jade should be able to run in and trash the hard work people have put into establishing a 00 presence as easily as they currently canspeed changes wont change the raiders at all except make their nano gangs catchable  more or less i say boost 00 presence allow the anchoring of sentry guns at gates or other defense modules after all theres a whole fleet of covert ships that can bypass them blobs should find themselves under heavy fire when they jump into enemy space through gates

its not fantasy fantasy is were the magical whales from magic century in the magic kingdom weve magically become magically imbued by the magiethis isnt magic its genetic manipulation and nanoimplantation so far ccp has given us laser beams that can transport minerals  not saying itsseriously they could have come up with something better  and missiles that cant hit ships that run right the hell into themi think we can add space whales created by advanced predarkage technology
yes to space whales
whaaaaaaaaaaales in spaaaaaaaaaaaaace
i note that while there is appears to be alot of support for this idea do you all want to really go back to the ways of things before jammers and sov and mega alliances walking all over things like before well i personaly dont this is a hugely bad idea period as it stands now alliance claiming space have to put efforts into it take away the ability of jammers to permi jam a system and everything goes belly up agressive expansionist policys are now held in check and we have all seen a increase of constellation sized alliances in 00 which was the intent i believe as its hard to hold vast areas of space and should remain so anything that shorcuts to a jammer will have a negitive general effect on alliance lvl play in 00 seerindarkness ceo lfa

analysis timelowsec exploration vs hisec missionrunningrisk hisec missionrunners will usually lose one or two ships total as they learn other than that they wont the only time suicide ganking is an issue is if you insist on having a factiondeadspace fit cnr and run it in or near mission hubs lowsec explorers have to travel through lowsec not a huge risk in a covops cloak but getting a huge ship  needed to do the plexes  around safely is no easy task not to mention the risk of being probed down midcomplex profit exploration is very random but given all the time spent probing moving  around and running plexes which may turn out to be  youre not going to be getting too much missionrunners can get upwards of 2030mhour dwarfing what lowsec explorers can get benefits in addition to isk missionrunners get access to lps  gives them a lot of  to choose from  and standing  lets them get jcs and other goodies  explorers getwell nothingskill synergy missionrunnners focus on the same skills that any combat pilot uses any skills used for missionrunning will usually be used for direct combat explorers need the same combat skills  to run the plexes  but they also have to learn probing skillssome of these skills are useful for probing out players although thats of limited usefulness compared to the ability to actually fightso there you have it hisec missionrunning is riskier more rewarding has more side benefits and is more enticing skillwise than lowsec exploration i did lowsec exploration seems like an imbalance to me i did that analysis because lowsec exploration is what im most familiar with however youll find basically the same thing no matter what profession chosen only 00 miningratting can outstrip hisec missionrunners while doing it in quiet systems may not have too much risk in and of itself the 00ers have to defend their space something hisec missionrunners do not dohisec missionrunning is imbalanced period
erm how can you compare exploration with mission running the better analogy would be rattingexploration is off on its own doing its own thingedit exploration is its own miniprofession you chose to skill into it if its not profitable for you skill into something else cov ops pilots are going to be a lot more valuable soon with the proposed changes
whyi just analyzed the pros and cons of one profession  exploration  vs another profession  missionrunning  one profession is superior in basically every wayits not a miniprofession salvaging is a miniprofession exploration is a profession just like missionrunning
how can you compare one disimilar thing with another if you want to do that why not compare trade then thats the fastest way to make big isk in the whole of eve if you are good at it
i can do thattrade has a huge risk  you can lose money if youre not careful  requires careful intelligent micromanagement and doesnt become more profitable than missionrunning unless you are really good at it and have a large amount of capital trade exploration ratting etcall fit in with the spirit of eve because theres risk and competition
ever read the story of the noob who in 6 months made two billion profit from tradecheck the story of devilish ledouxand i also know people whove made billions in low to no sec exploration it depends how good at it you are and also how lucky one pilot i know made three stikes in three consecutive weeks got about 4 billion from them back in the early days of exploration
how is that relevant trade is risky very few people are going to make wtfomg amounts of isk from tradefirstly that was the early days of exploration and involved a ton of extreme luck thats not now and thats not commonsecondly thats 00 00 involves even more risk not so much while exploring but in the fact that you have to defend the space
if you want a perfect example of a worthless profession try your hand at highsec explorationim all for beefing up exploration some
how do you warp core stab a freighter
youre assuming the newbie has to be competitive he doesnt and he shouldnt be newbies are not competitive in pvp they are not competitive in missions they are not competitive in trading what they are is profitable not as profitable as a vet but enough to get them assets let them advance and keep a sense of progress about everything a new player with maybe pe 4 and an unresearched bpo or maybe a researched bpc  should be able to make money and develop without being able to make as much money as a veteran industrialist given current margins on production of nondropped gear thats entirely possible
take out the t1 loot and then the miners will increase to fill the demand for more mineralsprices will rise for a bit till the supply meets the demand then it will balance out again
i support thisnot only will it make mining more profitable  the only aspect in eve that hasnt gotten any love ever  but it will make production something noobs can actually do and turn a profitim a little worried about the lower meta mods though
why he should sell at less of the isk he will get selling the minerals with a bit of smarthe will use 10 more minerals then another 4 more for lacking pe5 the refine tax and refine wastage so all inclusive he will lose something like 10 minerals refining then use 14 more minerals than needed at the same time a trained industrial will build 1000 units at a time reducing his wastage to the minimum level so he can undercut the newbie without problemsif the minerals to build the item at perfect efficiency cost 100 the skilled producer can sell at 110 and get a passable return the newbie selling at 110 will lose from what he will get selling the raw minerals so he is not getting his profit from producing but from mining
i really like this idea
personally id like to see t1 drops reduced but not eliminated and loot to include some amount of minerals and salavage type broken junk items that manufacturers can convert into useful 
i beleive the ideal would be that all items in a game be player made that may well be impossible but progress towards that goal can be madei find myself ahead by running missions instead of mining i get items to reprocess isk loyalty points and increased standings mining i only get ore all things considered one day of mission running is far more profitable than one day of mining the difference between the amount of trit for example i reprocess compared to what i mine can easily be addressed by purchasing trit on the market from the proceeds of mission rewards and bounties there is also the benefit of gaining high value minerals in high sec space that are not available in high sec beltsadd lp only if a lot more stuff is available and at a good discount   maybe give faction lp that can be used at any npc corp lp store in that faction more money not for me thanksdifferent drops i realy like some of the proposals for alt drops bpcs more andor different salvage items that can be added in manufacturing all very good ideas
good
when i see stuff being sold below mineral cost i tend to buy it all up and reprocess it whether its t1 loot or battleships
you forgot another factor a lot of idiots out there think that since they mined the ore the minerals were free and thus dont take their true value in to consideration when costs are calculated thus they end up selling for at or near true cost of the item
lavista strikes again supported but i would like to see meta 1 to stay in drops to keep the loot a bit of fun basic meta0 stuff can go though
have you ever looked at the markup in manufacturing nondropped items from scratch i can make money in the rig market and i have no researched bpos and no pe i cant make money in the ship market but a newbie industrialist could pretty easily yes the experienced industrialist could undercut but experience shows that they dont
get rid of equipment drops of all types except maybe ammomake everything scrap or salvagesalvage components should be used to make the fancier named equipment but there should also be a way of making components from scratch as an industrialistscrap metal drops should stay the same volume but be more varied types as well as closer to ore or standard loot drops in mineral density a ship wreckage should give up like 130 of the orginal mineral valueplayer wrecks should have a hang time of a secure can  30 days  and npc wrecks should have a hang time pretty much as they are nowsimple and elegantfleet action graveyards become magnets to scavengers pirates and the former ownerssalvagers actually will salvage now not just pull piles of magically small components from wrecksindustrialists have something to do before they go out and get a posthe pirates have fresh targets as scavenge operations move into clean up the wrecksthe server gets to dump hundreds of millions of 1mn afterburners small armor repairers small electron blasters and 50mm steel plates from its pile

aye
ccp you mentioned you were going to do something like this when you inflated the sizes of t1 modules to counter mineral compression you guys are slacking off
as shown by zulupark and nozhs dev blogs last fall the developers feel that 00 warfare is becoming too capital centric and measures should be taken to bring eve combat back to the way it was before revelations 1 many players did not receive the blogs well yet ccp firmly retains its stance on the issue what i would like is an opportunity for the csm delegates as representatives of the eve playerbase to reconcile their differences on the topic with the developers itd be an opportunity to report players feelings one way or the other on the topic point out things that are wrong and other ideas that hit the nail on the head and see what future plans they have in mind for carriers and motherships its a chance for people to express their concerns about the issues with 00 combat and what they would like carriers to be used for and if they have to be changed at alldenying this would be a tremendous waste of the opportunity available through the csm
qft this is a really ing awesome idea now i sorta want to go get a lotro trial lolthe only thing i have a prob with is the sounds in jita 44 oand i hope this doesnt mean we have to get a dance emote 
if you dont like their music just pod them when they leave station or beat them up instation
looks terrible in battleship fleet manueveursget rid plz

yes please
drake passive shield tank is way too powerfull 750dps tanked forever and 400 dps given if only it got incresed dps and give 1 more medium slot and some cpu i would call it best bs in game doomsday proof recharges so fastsollution is to narf passive recharging of shield remove 2 low slots add power grid and 1 med slot in order to effectivly fit shield booster cap booster and heavy assault missiles
best way would be to remove passive recharge all the way if u ask me
ccp tried something but ended nerfing bc shield recharge time only slightly just hit it with the nerf sledgehammer like you love so much ccp
okay drake has a great shield tank if you use all the mids and most of the lows for it and then really only if its got rigs toothis means its not going to run around with web and scram or web and disruptor without nerfing its tank something that doesnt happen to armour tankersthis also means means the aggressor to the drake gets to dictate range and when to deagress drake isnt known for its handling or speediness is itbeing a shield tank its got a great big hole in its resists right from the startpcs do a lot more damage than npcs and it only gets to use cruiser size weaponryno supportedit oh and the drake is a battlecruiser not a battleship
its gotta use all its slots to do that yes it is annoyingly hard to kill but it cant do jack to the aggressor so it doesnt matter
hint to the opferox myrmi and hurricane can all mount passive tanks almost as strong as the drake and by almost as strong its within a couple of guess what they cant kill anything either when setup that way
whats a drake going to do with a superpassive tank setup nothing but blow spitwads at youits the perfect baittank in fact it isnt a good baittank to begin with because everyone knows the drake is going to be a tough nut to bust open to get to the pod so why bother with it
the drake is fine
drake tank usually uses all midslots lowslots and rigslotsi imagine if you did the same thing with other bc youd have similar results like the prophecy
its balanced cos the drake cant do 
the overwhelming attitude among 00 players has been that titans logistic abilities should be expanded and their combat capabilities deemphasized players and developers alike have expressed discontent with how the doomsday device changes combat  ie it needs a buff in the fun department  and its high time we did something about it as titans continue to proliferate what i propose is simple lets try to follow through with the often suggested development of more abilities and features for titans that help groups model their organizations around them and in trade abolish one of the worst mistakes ccp ever made the doomsday devicei anticipate that this may not sit well with some people but if you look through the dev blog archive this is more like what ccp originally had in mind for them during the period before red moon risings release and for many months  if not years  afterward ccps development team was dreadfully understaffed and overworked this accounts for why they were unable to make it fit in with their original design and why for almost a full year afterward titans were horribly bugged and in many cases nonfunctional however after the 400 hp buff in revelations 1 a very significant portion of the playerbase agree that titans have become a bit too muchnaturally there are without a doubt a number of technical limitations behind turning them into stations a market service in the titan is likely completely unfeasible as would the ability to dock or log off inside of them however a mobile factory or refinery could be possible and it is important for us to try to come up with other more sophisticated and unique features we could give them without simply turning them into an extremely expensive pos with the same functionsso if you feel that the potential of this idea is worth bringing up in the august meeting or have ideas of your own on this topic please reply to this thread and give a generous thumbs up thank you
in my opinion the titan shouldnt be a hit and run vessel but instead a frontline ship which needs to be on the battlefield to do anything most probably achieved by making the dd targeted and doubling the damage output and reducing the isotope requirement and reducing refire time to say 30 seconds also probably the tanking ability of titans would need to be upped so that they have more survivability in the battlefield
agreed gob
first off dev blog concerning speed nerfsecond off nanoes should be nerfed to some extent but this is going way overboardwhat i am calling for here is a veto of the nerf as it stands now not a veto of any speed nerf just this speed nerfhere is a short list of what will changewebs changed to 5060 effectivnessshort range scramblers deactivate mwdsreactivation time delays on mwds  similiar to cloaks polycarbons nerfed to be worse than nanofibersxinstinct boosters will reduce sig radius not increase speedoverdrive effectiveness pretty much halvedsnakes nerfedgangbonuses to speed reduced but increase to agility addedsome of these i personally agree with but the larger changes especially to microwarpdrives webs and overdrives are horrible and will severly nerf more than a entire play style i would rather have ccp nerf speed from the top down start with snakes and polycarbons a lot of nano fits gets nerfed at that point already reduce the effectiveness of overdrives nanofibers and istabs trough stack nerfing and even more nano fits gets less viable but not completely useless at this point there should be few to none uncatchable nano ships interceptors and minmatar ships should still be alive but a lot of the 3000kms ishtars and zealots would be more or less vanishedthe changes to webs are also too extreme in my opinioni think that webs should have a effectiveness depending on the targets sig radius this would mean afterburners would be usable for burning out of web range while microwarpdrives wouldnt at the same time smaller ships would have a easier time in web range because of their smaller sig radiusi think that ccp believes that after a option has been enabled things will go back to the way they were after it has been disabled this isnt true and never will be ccp enabled nano fits ccp has to accomodate and tolarate nano fits to some degree that is my opinionfor the record i dont fly nano ships i got a neut geddon gank brutix and gank thorax in my hangar i got a alt that has flown and will fly nano stabbers tough
giving this a swift kick in the ass back to the top of the page with supportsimply put csm is here to be our representatives to the devs this is your time to shine  what we have here is one of the most severe nerfs in game history one that will not only severely damage nanoships but forever change the way combat works in eve while speed should be reduced a bit especially on the very high end where pimped ships reach extreme speeds ccps reaction to it is over the top and a kneejerk nerfthey spent 5 hours on it and the results of that meeting will not only nerf nanowarfare back to the point where only vagabonds and interceptors can be viable but in the process destroy the ability of blasterships to fight by denying them the capability to close in on their targetcsm we need your assistance on this one talk with the devs give them reasoned arguments on why this is a bad idea before this is too late  at the very least get rid of that 75km scram boost and save the gallente ships
at the very least toss out the warp scram mwd deactivator
if anyone actually read the dev blog they are setting it up on sisi this monday for at least a month before vetoing it why dont you guys at least try it then moan about changes
the csm is not here to veto anything they do not have power over how the game progresses they simply make agruments from each persepective about how the players see things ccp makes any final decisions as to changesno changes its their game they will do what they feel they need to do with their game not you or any council of the players
i will be adding the topic to the agenda in the next csm meeting and well be discussing it there speaking personally i strongly believe it is unwise to implement the game changes suggested in the dev blog prior to resolving the current serious issues with blobwarfare and overwhelming defense advantage in 00 at the very least we need the covert cyno bypassing jammers and changes to jump bridge functionality on the table before we should be considering any game change to further weaken the small unitroving gang playstyle in eve
5 hours is all youre giving thought to a style of pvp that is so intricate to how fun pvp is and at the same time if done even slightly wrong will forever change the basics of pvp that people have had down for yearsi expect more from a company that prides itself with the most hardcore pvp experience in an mmo please dont do what soe did with swg
im not your biggest fan and i dont make a secret of it your a weighty wordsmith one of the people i dispise most but your comment here will show us if the csm is a white elephant or something ccp take seriously personally im going for the elephantbtw when i say i dispise you i dont mean personally i just fking h8 people that think using twenty words is good when one is enough which to be fair is your forte
how do you know this im pretty sure that ccp as spent a lot more time thinking about something that has such impact plus it will be on sisi on monday they would really have to bust their asses getting that ready if they only spent 5 hours before the blog was released and did anyone actually read the blog then think about it from what i can see speed tanking is still very viable i mean look at the graph your hacs will still be able to get to 25003000 ish with a reasonable all nanooverdriveistab setupblasterboats will be fine you just actually have to consider your fittings most folks who argue this are just stuck in the must have mwd paradigm after this many targets may not be fitting a mwd and your not the only target they might face your targets would have to fit specially to really render your ship useless im not going to put down all the combos of mwd ab web scram etc that would just be tedious and your pretty dumb if you think only one setup will be an iwin in eve actually i think if the exact stats are worked out  and they may not be  this could actually be a boon to blastershipswhile i have a few reservations about if the exact stats are needing some tweaking im excited to see the changes in action this nerf does more than nerf speed its also a boost to some ships and gives pvp roles to ab and scrams who have needed some for along time so my opinion is just see what its like on sisi before you complain you may actually like some of the changes keep an open mind if you go on sisi and genuinely  by that i mean try the changes from all roles blasterboat sniper nanoship antinanoship etc  and you still dont like it then i could accept your complaining as legitimate and im guessing so will ccp as is you simply dont have any credibility
two thumbs down
though it does not surprise me in the least that jade would be one of the ignorant pubbies that drops a drama bomb based on theorycraft and speculationand like that other guy said this is not a csm issue you are not the ing swg senatekeep this prenerf whining bull out of the assembly hall
i think the issue is more that broad sweeping changes are counter productive compared to smaller subtle ones aside from the fact the coding has already been done if monday is the day its dumped on sisi which we all know is such a good indicator of tranq performance
oh so this is what should concern the csm the methods used by ccp to develop eveyou tell em csm
i guess i could always email helmar with my concerns
scream wah crycome on people for the better part of the last 18 months the speeders with buckets of isk have laughed and pointed saying adapt or die adapt or dienow its you who will have to adapt and what do we see wah dont change our nanophaggotryget a life adapt or diewhen you die escrow me your stuff mmmmmkay
supported a bit small to moderate nerf to nano ships that were not meant to be nanoed and speed tanked ships that are not meant to be speed tanked is in orderweb and scramb and mwd changes are too extreme and all together will completely break all gun rangetrackingdps balancebut i cannot fully agree with jade running a hac at frig or dictor speeds cannot be one and only counter to blob warfare and only option for small gang play its too broken
because they said so in the blog four guys spent five hours and from the look of what they came up with and the little consideration for the far reaching consequences of their proposal it showsthe consequences to transports and covop ships agility are just some of the downsides that will be affected nerf top end speed while that may be needed it cannot come at the price of so much youre talking about changes that will affect every ship in the gamewindjammer
i dont think anybody has said that it should be the only counter to blob warfare what we actually need is a proper rebalance of 00 warfare designed specifically to punish and provide strong disincentives to mindless blobbing we need the hideous situation with cyno jammer spam dealt with we need jump bridges weakened so that 00 logisitics needs to go by gates again we need black ops fixed and covert cynos working correctly and we need distributed parallel objectives in sovereignty warfare introduced to give meaning and purpose to smaller gang pvp again what we dont need is a sweeping nerf to guerrilla warfare that further empowers mindless blobbing  this is against the best interests of the game at this time
what if they come out with the changes to allaince warfare you know the stargate timer based systembecuaseships going 20000 ms would make that not very fun just orbit a gate
when did game design become a democratic operationi mean can you really use words like veto accurately theres a lot of misinformed players out there im one im not coding this game so why should i have any more say in what changes are made beside a constructive suggestion now and then that i neither expect nor require to be headed or the money from my wallet
obviously whoever posts a devblog is solely responsible for its content fail
and i think he did mention that they as in a room full of geeks has been working and arguing about this
funny i tink hes fixing an obvious imbalance in the game perhaps you should take of those rosetinned goggles you appear to be suffering tunnel visionalso the csm raised the nano problems already ccp said it was being looked into dev blog is likely the result please check the thread in this forum from wrangler
lal mi vagabund iz usles nao                            
i read that as im hot and bothered at first
failwe called for a fundamental fix to the problem not a across the board nerf to make everyones ship slower and more uselesssomehow that seems to translate into massive nerfs cause carpet bombing is such a great tactic when youre trying to kill one mani recall from another game the cruel case of the mercy suicide bomb unit the unit which flew  the game supreme commander was an rts  was fast nimble and enough of them could be extremely deadly the problem was while the unit was broken it was only broken because of several underlying problems within the game one key aspect was in all ranked and competitive online matches the game could be won by taking out the other players commander and another key aspect was the fact that you could micromanage the movements of your units players would uses all these facts to fly several mercies around whatever antiair systems the defending player had thrown up and take out the commander with ease naturally the community was very upset to say the least they whined and they moaned and they cried and eventually the game developers introduced a patch to fix it now you have to realize the community had suggested various changes such as introducing a new unit to counter the mercy fix the tracking and the way aa picked its targets or simply increase the build cost of the unit and decrease its damagebut what was the developers solution add a new unit reduce its damage no their solution was to nerf all aspects of the unit increase its build cost its build time its turn radius while decreasing its speed its damage its nimbliness in other words everything that made the unit useful they nerfed nerf to the point were it became a useless unit i fear that ccp is taking a similar philosophical point of view with nano ships the problem is however is that nano ships are not real but rather a collection of modules which are used by all ships and some ships that capable of fitting the problem is all ships can fit mwds all ships can fit nanofibers all ships can fit overdrives etcnerfing these modules is a global nerf to any ship that does not abuse these modulesthis is what this whole issue boils down too ccp wants their sandbox but doesnt seem to understand that a few bad eggs abusing the systems shouldnt unfairly hurt us as well nanos reveal a fundamental problem with the way the game handles certain weapon systems like missiles and drones because they can be used without any drawbacks people are upset ccp wants to do something i understand all that but carpet bombing the problem isnt going to solve anythingif you seriously dont see the problem with a massive across the board nerf like ccp is proposing you really shouldnt have been elected because you clearly dont understand the magnitude such a change would do to the game not just nanoer and speed tankersand for the accord no i dont abuse nanos the only time ive used nanos was on my interceptor where they belong
we actually didnt raise it formally some csm members had some talks on the subject informally but we havent yet passed an issue addressing speednanos etc this latest blog is the result of work in the pipeline for a while that doubtless began before we took office
for what its worth i can see this causing many many problems with game balance in 00 warfare particularly in raidingsmall unit combat which will become even more difficult to pull off with defense bonuses increased for blobbingbut the nanonerf brigade did build up a head of steam and the developers will now try to address that and weve got to adapt and attempt to make the best of it i do certainly take your point re supreme commander and yes i agree but this is probably a case of letting the eve community see the consequences of game balance filter into the playing environment for a while im hopeful it will serve to highlight the horrible situation in 00 sovereignty warfare and might help us get that addressed
the problem with supreme commander and now eve is that a very small segment of the player base regularly posts which forms the majority of the these nerf brigade which is part of the problem if out a true representation of the views of the game a proper course of action cannot be determined in supreme commander it led to the complete re balancing of all static defenses and economic structures which imo caused the player base to leave because the game had turned into a rehash of the zerg rushjust a word of caution making informed changes because of the opinion of such a small angry group of players could be disasterious and irreversible
this nerf is fail i am of the opinion that nanos do not need nerfed and that it is simply a vocal minority that is whining not that everyone wants speed nerfedhowever regardless of these differences in opinion i think we can agree that this is not the proper way to go about nerfing nanos
and not fixing a fundamental problem just because of a small angry group of players  nanos  could hurt the playerbase i dont see a solution forthcoming from youi do agree with you though it would be much nicer if more of the eve population older then 10 months came to the forums and not just caod i also agree that these changes might be a step to far  my poor blasterboats  which is why i am thankful that ccp is running the changes on the test server first and will take player input firstim not exactly sure what you expect from ccp since they have done everything they can imo now its our turn to playtest and  and moan some more
any hopes of csm agreeing on nicely asking ccp to first only try a moderate approach by changing polycarbon and od stacking penalties and rebalancing base speeds with maybe a small tweak to snakes much smaller than proposedand seeing the effects of such moderate nerf and then considering further gameplay changes
woah such attitude and from one who seeks to represent the masses of eve you should drop out of the election now
turret users should be treated same as missile users if someone wants to train cruise misiles he trains crusie misiles and nothing elselets see someone had large hybrid and want large laser die loser training slow all turets from small to large dont talk about secondery skills becouse guns get same amount of secondery skills like missiles turets should be easier to train or misiles tree updated to reflet training as in turets so torpedos would need heavy assaults t2 crusie misiles t2 would need heavy missiles t2 heavy assaultheavy misiles would need rockets t2
signed
supported missile skills are a joke for a time i considered training for freaking raven for missions  no gameplay there anyway just grinding for cash so why not do it in efficient way  thankfully i saw the wrongness of training for raven and gave upbut i saw that i could t2 fit a raven  tank and gank  in less time than i would need just for t2 medium hybrids for christs sake ccp why do caldari really have to be able to do everything the easy waydont simplify gun training getting full t2 weapons in month or two is stupid rework t2 bs missile weapon skills so they need all lesser skills and hear the wines of all caldari sheep
edit  disregard i goofed but i still support the idea
turrets are easier to train you moron did you even look at the lengths of the missile and gunnery skill trees
moron compare skill requirements of t2 siege launcher with for example large hybrid turret t2
thats an idiotic comparison youre comparing the training time to use a single weapon system  t2 torps  vs the training time to use three  t2 small medium and large turret here are the sums of the skill ranks of the skill trees split into weapons and support skillsmissile weapon skills 50missile support skills 26  24 if you exclude defenders turret weapon skills 41gunnery support skills 18qed
yeah and why i cannot just train large blasters without learning small medium and support skills as you can do with torpedos
because thats the price you pay for having a shorter skill tree in any case the ability to go straight to say t2 torps really isnt that much of an advantage especially in pvp any serious missile user trains the other skills anyway normally first  because you cant use torps on smaller ships
you have no clue i see what we talking about here
oh i think i do you didnt have a clue about the realities of the skill trees youre not content with turrets being easier to train for or the gunnery support skills applying to all turret skill trees neither are you interested in game balance you just want to whine until things are made easier for you well carry on
i support this change kinda halfheartedlyi fly minmatar and i have to train both missiles and turrets to be effective with missiles the way they are now it cuts down on my training time a lot although i still think its b0rked edit btw to the guy arguing that its shorter for guns just the base skills to get t2 large arty and t2 ammo takes 78 days to train into bs sized missiles  torps  with no prior skills and using t2 ammo it will take you 30 daysedit 2 im a tard i forget guns make you train the support skills while missiles dont its odd
as explained previously its a silly comparison you should be comparing the training times to get t2 large arty with the training time for t2 cruise t2 hams t2 heavies t2 rockets and t2 standards then add the requisite support skills on top as well
except that there are a lot of us that would never fire rockets so why add them
why i want to suport this change nearly 3x time slowertraining in misiles caldari fanboys just will whine that it is bad
so basicly what youre saying is you want to be able to train all your gunnery skills in the same time itd take to train all missle skills lets brake it down here shall wemissleslauncher opperationrocketlight misslesassault misslesheavy misslesheavy assult misslescruise misslestorpsgunnerysmallmediumlargeseems to me like theres more missle skills to have to train than gunnery what youre asking is to be able to train 2 races worth the guns in the time it takes to train 1 races missle skills  counting out minmatar from this since they use both  sounds quite logical to me so what you have to train up specialization of smalls to get mediums and mediums to get larges suck it up you have 3 gun types missles have 6 not even couting the inbetween ones like assault and heavy assault lets look at skill ranks for a secsmall projectile rank 1small spec rank 3medium projectile rank 3medium spec rank 5large projectile rank 5large spec rank 8missles launcher op rank 1rockets rank 1rocket spec rank 3standard missles rank 2standard missle spec rank 3heavy missles rank 3heavy missle spec rank 5heavy assault rank 3heavy assault spec rank 5cruise rank 5cruise spec rank 8torp rank 5torp spec rank 8seems balanced to me the only difference is we dont need to train up the trees to get the specs so if youre only shooting for 1 type of t2 gun then yea missles get their t2 faster however if youre looking to max out all weapons for a specfic race guns are done alot faster the missles not to mention the 67 support skills you need for missles just so they actually do any kind of damage to a nonstationary target not to mention with gunnery if you can use t2 autocannons you can use fair damage t1 artys however just because you can use t2 torps dosnt mean you can even use cruise guns get a static bonus to both long range and short range guns prior to hitting the spec skills however missles require you to train up each skill seperatly from the others so to summarize this all suck it up
fypgunnery surgical strike motion prediction controlled bursts rapid firing sharp shooter and trajectory analysis itt caldaris show their ignorance of turret weapon systems
i see problem with missiles vs turrets misilles hit low orbit target and turets dont they arent effected by tracking distruptors alsosollution would bearming distance for missiles in this way misiles and turets would be more in par
good point with upcoming nerf torpedoes will be overpowered in comparison to turrets
fully supported anyway doubly so if ludicrous speed tweek gets passed
needs rebalancing
also for a purely tracking disruptor boost they could be renamed targeting disruptors and effect turret optimal missile flight time turret tracking and missile explosion velocity
seriously this is ridiculous some eve developers posted a dev blog and there are issues about the dev blog this isnt even on the test server yet how can there be issues about itpropose to have untesteduntestable speculation posts in the assembly hall to be immediately locked as there can be no issue and they are just spam threads taking attention away from valid issues
i agree this is just silly i mean did people even read the very first line of the devblog
people dont need to test all the specifics of the nano nerf as outlined in the dev blog they can read some of the amazingly bad ideas right there it isnt even that people are specificly against reducing speed in many cases its about how its being proposed to be done in the blog and what else it would affectagility will take a fast boot to the butt and deactivating mwds with a scrambler what bullwindjammer
agreedthere are so many other issues to look into that are active problems with the game nowfaction science corps being in enemy space for oneui windows jumping all over the place  pinned or not  for anotherjades personal little war 00 alliances actually being able to defend their turf from raiders like her  as they should be imo  and other sov issuesspeed is being examined and will be tested all the complaints have been heard so stop screaming go test them fistthen adapt because the changes are coming if you cant adapt send me your stuff and go play wow
is there a feedback and suggestions forum for the test servermaybe the test server speculation and the more valid usable feedback from people who have tested it could be posted in a special forumposting issues about test server stuff especially before it has even become testable shouldnt be issuesask yourself what is the csm supposed to do with thiscsm to ccp were proposing that the changes described in the dev blog not be implemented and tested on the test serverccp  uhh  this isnt really what we had in mind for the csm
i dont know what you had in mind for the csm but the rest of us had in mind that they would be a voice of the subscriber base to ccp i can appreciate how you would want to censor this discussion thoughwindjammer
agreed
thats just it though it is a discussion not an issuethe csm cant do anything with this its just noise
yeah this is ridiculous reminds me of south park rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble
the problem is that the csm does indeed represent the subscriber base of eve however when that subscriber base s nonstop about the nano problem  and there is a problem  then goes around and s about ccps proposed fixes without even testing them without offering anything more constructive then zomg u suxz it becomes hard for ccp to listen to us at all how the hell is the csm going to do its job with people whining about fixes days before they are even in beta ninja support edit
im going to disagree i think this is actually a very important issue and its about the priority of game fixes i think its vital that we fix 00 warfare before we further reduce the ability of players to engage in it by reducing the chance of survival for small gang pvp in that sphere if wed had the chance to discuss priorities on these issues in iceland id have voted to put fixes to the broken 00 sovereignty game well ahead of nanonerf and i think its important we now let the developers know how we feel on this matter
yes it is true that it is just a blog and it is not set in stone however as jade had mentioned and nozh had stated is that he will be listening and seeing how things goif they are indeed listening and paying attention this is a pretty decent place to voice the payer base concerns and or support of the issue you thinkbut i am not surprised this kind of post popped up since the against crew is picking up decent support and the for squad is lagging behind just let it run its course and see what happens
this serpent must be swiftly beheaded and burned before it ever picks up steam why should we let it get onto the test server before attacking it
i also dissagree and quote jade constantine on this onesome quotes the ccp should take into consideration
thats because when people like somthing they are in game playing not on the forums postingthats why befor the anouncement the forums were filled with nerf nanos threads and the people in those threads defending nanos were prettymuch the same few people all the timenow that the nerf has been announced the antinano crowd is happy and in game while the nano crowd is riled up and on the forumsthe only true way to get a tally of the populations opinion would be for it to be a vote on the login screen and track it by accountjade and i have had vocal dissagreements and i disagree here too nanos imo needed fixing because to me at least they were the problem in 00 when an alliance sets up in a constilation that supposed to be like their little empire roaming gangs should have a hard time getting to an enemies core systems thats the whole pointme personally i left 00 because defence was pretty pointless you couldnt keep the enemy out so unless you played at off hours you generally didnt get alot donethats just me though i know that people that go on roams like to hit the heart of the enemy ive been on a few of them station camping the enemy isnt really my thing
its going to make it to the test server csm has no control over thatin a situation like this where the devs want to make big changes to a flawed system yet arent 100 certain about the method or values test server must be used to collect datathat data will be much more useful than viewing the forums where people give reasons like too much nerf cancel the whole ideano like it or not the flawed speed mechanic has caught the developers eyes and some kind of change is incomingyou can be constructive and test them and then leave valuable feedback like i will or you can be just another forum whinereither way this is not a csm issue at all
anything that concerns the interests of players in eve is a potential csm issue this one more than most
a viable antimissile system for mid to large scale battles have a couple of missile boats rack up on rocket launchers and fill them all with defenders each rocket launcher holds 10 defenders with a rof of about 2 secs if ya use a drake thats 7 launchers giving one nasty missile defense grid granted the gangs dps goes down quite a bit but it will seriously hamper the opponents missile throw weightas for defenders id say double their speed but leave flight time alone 2x speed and 12 time on everything else sounds good to me
i propose that all achura caldari players should get access to dev console and ability to kill any ship in game or delete anyones character

just a friendly kick back to the front page so the csms might actually offer some idea if this is intended and will remain or shall be fixedive got 6 rp agents and cant get to them because of fw standings im sure the same goes for people that have joined fw for the other factions as well
you should check ammar khanid rd it stink no lv3 agent rd i think
well its not research but spying clearly you want to be in enemies territory for that
wait you didnt figure out which agents you were going to lose access to prior to faction warfare ccp is not responsible for your brilliance
in its current state ecm rules on the battlefield never has a ship class been granted anything this close to immunity to make matters worse eccm is virtually useless as a counter example herei was testing the other night with remote eccm projected all on to one raven the raven wound up with over 250 strength i turned on one ecm module on my falconand the raven was jammed can someone tell me why this makes senseheres for making a move to change eccm equipping eccm of your ships race should completely null any eccm thrown at you some may say this is imbalanced because everyone would fit eccm modules as it stands right now every fleet consists of at least 3 falcons so what other countermeasures do we really have
i think ecm is quite balanced falcons are specialty ships and that means they should be good at what they do you dont blame a rails just cause a rokh is a specialty ship do you secondly your experiment is stupid because you take only one sample and ecm is all chance based a normal  no eccm  raven has a 10 chance of being jammed my falcon using only 1 ecm if the raven has 5 projected eccm iis on him that drops to about 1  thats 90 more immune to ecm  so there is still a chance ill get him just really small im guessing thats whats going on in your experiment you just happened to hit that 1 these percentages would be even smaller if you used a nonecm specialty ship to try it out ontldr ecm is fine
loljam is chance based and oops you had that 1 chance and got itfalcon is not broken nor is rook or griffin in fact because ecm is chanced based eccm can be surprisingly effective as a counter just fitting 1 makes you twice as resistant
kassuming you have a falcon with 2 t2 racial jammers max skills 2 signal distortion amps and 2 particle dispersion augmentorsvs none eccmhurricane  98 chance of jamming every cyclesleipnir  98tempest  92dominix  86rapier  81falcon  74 chimera  31vs 1x eccm iisleipnir  68tempest  60dominix  54rapier  50falcon  44chimera  17for anything smaller than a battlecruiser its pretty much 80 chance of jamming with eccmwhen you factor in relocking time and the likely hood of fotm status as every gang has 12 falcons in 46 battleships can be out of a fight for 23s of the time during current engagements with eccmand considering that this is with only 2 racials from one falcon you can see why i think its particularly imbalancedif eccm was stronger  say you fit one and you had 10 chance of being jammed  it would in turn make ecm more situational it would provide much needed competition of slots in amror tankers with 4 mids and would provide the lack luster 5th utility mid slot ships with something useful to be fitted withsure 100 jam immunity is a little much but eccm really needs to be looked at as it could solve a few iusses

once upon a time all pos modules  including guns and ecm  were located inside the pos forcefield back then the absurd explosion radius of citadel torpedoes didnt really matter as they were just as useful against poses as other capital weaponssince then ccp has moved offensive pos modules outside the pos forcefield as it is wise and often entirely necessary to incapacitate some or all pos weaponsecmneuts before assaulting the pos itself the explosion radius of citadel torpedoes vs module signature radius is in need of a serious rebalancingby way of example a citadel torpedo hits large pos modules  large gunsneuts  for roughly 40 of the damage it would cause to the pos itself all other dread weapons hit for full damage on all large and medium sized pos modules and often hit for most of their damage against small pos modulesthis is effectively a standing nerf to caldari and minmatar dreads and should be corrected as soon as possible
as a naglfar pilot i agree with the op
i agree with the op
absolutely its one of the reasons i havent even bothered training for a phoenix
as a capital pilot i support

is it a bug or intentional
either way it seems unbalanced and an easy fix can we get a colored response in here to this
x  signed
fully agree either up the sigs on these modules or lower the explo radius on the citadels
signed
as i understand the tracking formula a stationary target and a stationary shooter  sieged dread  means perfect tracking regardless of the targets sig radius and weapon sig resolution so its silly that citadel torps get penalised
signedi can see why some weapons arrays would beless than optimally targeted by dreads  the bring smaller ships into pos warfare idea  but at the very least warp scramblers and large guns should be able to be attackable for a reasonably high  of damage on target even medium guns should get most of the damageneeds fixing
i think there should be a faction warfare channel added to the forums this would make it much easier to find information and for pilots to talk about it
please relook all of their ships they will be worthless now
huhminmatard ships rock speed changes will make them rock better so your phagabond cant run 15kms ooohh but your huginn will still be just fine
dude all ship goes slower sweet minmatar boostmy ships will still go omg fast in fact it will now be harder for other races to catch our speed muhahahahaha
you guys realize the only way vagabonds stay alive is because they can speed tank the turrets and missiles and choose when to engage and gtfo when they need to this is cutting their balls off
oh noes my vaga only goes 6000ms what will i doi fail to see how this is an issue now it just means nonofficer fit interceptors will be able to catch them
actually the changes to the webifers will impact tracking dependent vessels at close range
the speed nurf will screw most min pilots think about this for a moment for pvp how often do you see a minmatar ship armor or shield tanking in anything smaller then a bs rarely now with the nurf any ship dependent on speed tanking will be screwed and the drake will become the new king of pvp and take its seat next to caldari recon ships the current queen of pvp
hahahahhhahahahahhahaahhahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaoh wow thats some funny stuff right there lol
it seems that the balancing team these days dont have much of a clue about eve and how to play it and i say its time for us to get tomb back to evetomb might have been one hell of a nerfer but at least he nerfed using a nerfbat and not tactial nukes like todays devs does
doh forgetting to give myself a thumbs up
whos bright idea do you think it was to buff istabs in revelations 1
he was no better tbh to busy loving the fanbois crawling up his ter on sisi to be of any real use
i propose a simple change if once the speed change goes throughif you appose the speed change fine but lets look ahead just in case and support this is case you like the idea not the causereplace the bonus for mwd on the thoraxe to a 15 to afterburner velocity bonus per level this coupled with nanos and overheating would allow for a thoraxe to go 1400 ms on an afterburner with no change to its sig radiuscome on you know that sounds fun  and even then it wouldnt be able to catch a vaga going 400ms with a mwd it would just be able to rush in and destroy anything going slow it wouldnt even have to care about the web nerf as its speed once a web was applied on top of the mwd killing warp scram it would effectivy be able to tackle and lock down any ship in the gamecoupled with a interceptor or two or other range bonus war scram ships it would be awesome
id suggest 10 increase to ab effect and cap cost per level but something like this makes sense
supported if proposed mwdwebscram changes go troughall blasterboats with mwd cap use reduction should have it changed to 1015 ab speed boost  per level of course 
thing is so many ppl disagree with the nano nerf as it stands because it nerfs so many non nano ships as well to boost all the non nano ships that get nerfed is just going to create a whole load of messprimary example reduce large bubble size because bss move slower after nano nerfhow many boosts changes are going to be needed to counter ballance a vaga flyin at 7000mps
vaga flying at 7km is not a problem missile and drone hacs going over the top are issue if vaga cuts his speed or zeroes his transversal oh with a mwd sig the size of planetbut yeah if this were to go true ccp would spend years listening to a hundred new whines about real issuesif they go with this lunacy they should for starters give 10 tracking and 10 to optimal and falloff of acs and blasters
the scifi lore supports the noble act of selfdestruct but it does neglect the wholeif im going to die im taking you with meno giant deadly explosion nothing but a pop and a pod how about an equivalent of a large or giant sized smart bomb going off after doing sothat could be your penality a person might be reluctant to blow up his allies along with his ship
not supported its called the last great act of defiance just because you think you are winning doesnt mean you are guarenteed to get the stuffi could support the destruction of the pod if they didnt eject and warp away in time aoe blast when the ship blows loss of insurance when you initiate etc i could even support that all damage done be put on a killmail and sent out so that you know you did that 1 damage and so does everyone else but profit automatically time to bring more firepower
signedthe only change i would push for is ship size should determine how far away it is forced to decloak

id have to disagree with thisagents being spread out is about the only motivation people have for moving from system to systemif you could constantly work out of a single system for all your l1l5 missions people would eventually flock to the prime locations like was stated above 05 with no dangerous low sec close by then youre guaranteed to make the most money since youre saying there will no longer be a difference in quality based on locationyou think jita is bad for all the trade going on imagine when every single rookie is told hey the best place to make money is the  systemits much easier on the servers to have people spread out which they wont do on their own guaranteedand besides it makes more sense agents are assigned to various locations they live there everyday making friends with the locals then when they hear about something exciting in the area they make a note for the next capsuleer who passes through you do the job and he pays you for helping out his neighborhood and its no surprise that they would rather do business in person than discuss killing people for money over some emaili vote for status quo
i still hold the opinion that the way the csm voted down this issue especially with the argumentation that explorers are just lazy and eve isnt a solo game blahblah was very narrowminded and that we as csm should look into this issue again im willing to handle the paperworks of this issue if it matters

disclaimer this is just my thoughts i write this as an conceptual idea for how the council should work which is largely based on feedback i get from people as wellthis topic comes from the discussion there was in another post link here  about streamlining the process of raising smaller issues which requires little debaterecently we have seen a lot of discussion about balancing certain ships its pretty obvious that it was going to be the case but i think that the issue as i see it needs to be discussedso what is the issue its what csm it turning out to be right now the community is concerned with ship balancing which is quite fine it just shows that people are concerned about the game but there is a downside to it as well whiners and people who wants their ship to be fotm and is this already the case i tend to think so let me tell you a historyi was recently sitting down on irc and ingame gathering feedback for an issue that was raised about ship x the issue being raised was that the ship was underpowered and needed a fix i ask these people approx 10 different persons  whom i consider to be reliable sources and ask them about their thoughts on the proposed ideas and the response i get from large majority dont listen to those whiners the ship is fine mind you these are people who actually flies the ship and knowing the community i think its obvious that if there was an issue they would have said so so i went onto sisi and tested the ship myself the conclusion in my mind was that the ship was quite ok as it isthis is just an example of how some issues especially in regards to ship balancing is a matter of personal taste and how you fly they made some good points but we are seeing an increased amount of eft warriors which doesnt account for piloting skills of the individual so for the council to actually act on ship balancing issues is a totally slippery slope but if that is what is the concern of the community surely that is finei actually tend to disagree if the council ends up just bringing forward ship balancing issues we will forget what the council is supposed to set a vision for the game that is what ccp expects us to do if we waste all our time with ship balancing which im sure ccp is already doing plentiful we will become narrowmindedi think its much more important to discuss how we can make 00 sov mechanics more interesting by adding more layers or how for missions to become more interesting but if we focus on specific ships to get buffs the collective creativeness in the community will go lost its in my eyes much more important to talk about larger mechanics which affects a lot of people than the ships itself in my eyes its much more important that missions are fun for instance  than the fact that ship x should be able to do x and y while im setting a bad picture for ship balancing that is not to stay it shouldnt happen at all again its important that if there is an issue with ships ccp should get informed but im not entirely sure if the council is the best way at least not in its current form we need to focus on what is importantbut how do we fix this the ideal way would be for a handsoff approach from the council in regards to ship issues but i think this will eventually be counterproductive as well we need to streamline the feedback channels for ship issues an idea could be for the council to give ccp a document a bit like the patchnotes we get with the suggested changes to ships but its obvious that some ideas are not going to be good so together with the attribute ideas a target effect should be included this means that if the idea that is being put forward sux ccp can propose an alternative solution that will fix the i
thats the first sensible thing ive heard a member of the csm say yet if im honestyou guys should be focusing on bringing gamebreaking issues and advancement in terms of content and stability rather than putting suggestions to the panel at ccp about how to make ship x a solopwnmobilei was sickened to see the amount of people come to this section of the forums with their nerf this boost that threads in an attempt to drag the csms focus away from what they should be doingin my opinion elements of game balancing in terms of ships modules and any other numbers and and effects should be left to ccp they designed and built the game from the ground up they play it every day it should be ccp who play god in new eden not players
yes i was quite displeased with the very specific ship issues brought up in the recent meeting i already said there that if these issues are brought to ccps attention i dont want them to be more than look this is the list of ships the community has complaints about pass it to the balancing team kthxbye without much further discussion there are many more very important issues that we should deal with and frankly we shouldnt spend 20 minutes discussing if ship x needs a powergrid increase since that is up to ccps balancing team not us nor the players nor ccps csm group ccp already slapped us on the wrist last time for bringing up too many trivial issues and urged us to look at bigger things and i think that is the way to go as well if you dont think a ship is valid to fly then dont fly it theres plenty out there that is
players that complain about ship issues are focused on these kind of issues because its part of their play style either rp as in the fw thing or just they specialize in that field and thats how they roll and it is important to themis it small issues yea probably in the grand scheme of things but anna telling some one to fly something else is the wrong approach i am pretty sure if the procurer or any of the mining ships were unable to full fit a decent set up and be effective for example and you told the miners if you dont like it fly something else you would have the villagers wielding pitch forks and storming the castle there has to be a different approach to this i think in the form of ship specs it need to present to ccp in that form no trivial bantering kind of thing something a dev can look at quickly and see numbers and say  yea that sucks or  what are you smoking its in line kind of response but also what would help too is communication from the csm and ccp telling us what you are looking for to bring up for discussion what are the parameters and the scope of the issues you are looking for so we will not get the niggling stamp on italso what constitutes niggling give us definitions so we know how to approach it if your player base has the understanding on what it is that they and you are looking for this would be a lot easier
yes and noi do agree with you that ship balancing shouldnt be the realm of the csmhowever i think the csm is missing the forest for looking at the trees wouldnt it be a better match to the csm idea be going to ccp and saying something like ship balancing is a very important part of the game for many players you should put a forum section up along the lines of the one used for comments to devblogs that allow players to respond to topics but not create them put a topic on each ship where a dev discusses just that ship and issues with it  comment just off the top of my head i think the biggest problem with balancing issues is that most players dont even know if the devs are aware of the percieved issues i think most would be fine with ships if they had a dev comment along the lines of yes we know that here is why we did what we did so i do see the root cause of why ship balancing discussions overwhelm the assembly hall being of great importance to the csm the specifics however shouldnt be
im very impressed by factional warfare ive got corp mates that are playing extensively and its great to see the game play starting to evolve out of iti would love to see the next generation of fw game play enhancements to see the birth of dynamic empire the fleets that go around are basically playing a huge game of capture the flag that resets every day what would be cool is if the territory you capture actually stayed with your faction and your faction starts to take those systems and populate themi suggest making dynamic frontsso if im the minmatar and i take a system then while ive won the battle i really havent won the war i need to go to the next system and take it until ive conquered the constellation if i take all the constellations in a region then it should make the connecting amarrian regions become the new fronts for the minmatar to invade the region i just took should now be the amarrian front to reclaim and the minmatar regions i leave behind locktwo home regions should never be able to be conquered  so that there is always a place to start  but make it so that the rest are up for grabsthoughts csm membersnes
oh god yes
oh at least some news lets hope this makes it to ccps attention next timecan you make sure it was actualy submited to ccp because from what i read it seems to me ccp intentionaly forgot about this issue
i wouldnt assign intent to the situation more of out of sight out of mind type thing we should hear something in august after the next ccpcsm round table

sry but i am against thats a madnes to change half of the game to kill ubernano
against it in its current unbalanced form too many variables nerfed at once
i dont really see how the proposed changes would support my goal of enjoying pvp without getting entangled in laggy blob warfare
votingas with all reactionary game mechanic changes it goes way too far
voting
no more nerfs
voting no to blobs
they cant be serious
voting
do you really need to nerf everyone to take the edge off a few people who you claim have an unfair advantage ccp apparently you think you do that is why i have to give this a big againstif you need to address people that you see have an unfair advantage fine address them thier ships their highend modules and implants why does everyone have to pay for your perceived abuses of a fewfind a way to do this with some common sense or leave it alone ccp
definately against very badly thought through as usual from ccp
against
yes the nano needs a nerf but wow talk about a sledge hammer way of doing itfix the stacking penelties to where they should be fix the overpowerd pollies then see where we are at before smashing the 1 style of play that actualy requires some skill from the player
in present form this is a bad nerf
supporti supported both sides i think making votes and vetos on a dev action though is pushing the rights of players personally this is probably the best argument against having csmsa lot of players believe they have some mysterious godgiven right to control how an mmo grows and develops they forget they are consumers and thus their reign of control is limited to continuing to pay for the product or notwhen players starting holding sitins votes and vetoes thinking they will be taken seriously  especially before the changes even go to test  thats when i think devs need to take action and shut the program down
allo please apologize for poor english it not my native speaking
what voting darn right fix those developers for changing our game
vote for boosting interdictors speed to be faster than everything larger than itother than that i dont careweb nerf is sorta ghey
absolutely againstthe proposed changes will break way too many things whilst fixing almost noneccp  bring the tech i polycarbon rigs in line with all other rigs  why were they released like that in the first place  and thats about all the balancing you need to doif you nerf snakes nerf all pirate sets  thats called balance
while i fully agree that under certain conditions ludicrous speed does exist and needs to be fixed the proposed fix is simply moronic and beyond stupid
start again with the same list of ideas that are at the top of that blog ccp this time come up with a simple solution with only one or two changes that fulfills them if it doesnt have the desired effect on tq change a little more the next patchdont just go argghhheahdiajdcsmpmcps and change about twenty things completely blind and frack off everyone and come out with no idea what change was good what was bad etcno to the proposals start again nerf speed but do it carefully
bad changes  nofix the speed but have a better look first at whats really broken after the proposed changes youll have to rebalances most of the hacs and quite probably many other ships modules and game mechanics try again you can do better than that one can hope right

against yessome overpower stuff need to nerf but i dont see any balance in dev blog itll kill nano blast boat small shipsmall gang and guerrilla warfare ones again ccp turn overpower stuff to trash is it nerf  i dont think so it is kill
againstdont kill nano
completely againsti dont need to see it on test for a month or even wait another 24 hours before i test it myself to know that it will completly screw up the entire game cause server crashes and ultimately force 150 of the playerbase to stop playingthis is nothing but a reaction where ccp was bullied by forum posts threats and csm polls i am absolutely certain my opinion is that of the majority of players and as such you apparently listened to a very vocal and whimpering minority when you came up with this new nerfyou should probably always clear any decision you make about the game with me personally thatll help you guys in the ccp offices to stop looking like raving jackasses i know for a fact id keep you from ruining how the game should be playedagainst and if this buggy thing will let me vote with my alts it damn sure should let me vote with my main repeatedly you suck ccp
againstccp please make smaller changes that can each be assessed on tq instead of this godawful huge change to small short range and nano combat all at once and risk breaking more things than you are fixing
against
against again cause i didnt see the support box  
against too many changes and too severe
against
against
the commuinity is against these changes this was made evident by it not appearing on the 20 complaints to be handed to ccpskunk
againsti dont believe that this voting is the right way to go it is useful a little bit to judge the community response but it certainly cant be a major deciding factori have written my concerns regarding the big redesign of pvp system here
against the nerf
how many alts have voted i wonderi can count the number ive used on two hands at least
this entire solution reminds me of someone running through thier house with the lights off trying to smash a pesky mouse with a baseball bat destroying everything he owns in the process all this will do is encourage people to blob more one of the proposed changes might have been fine but jesus why drop a freakin nuclear device on the problem when a hammer and chisel might have sufficed chani is not an alt she is my wife 
cause i think its going to break parts of eveand no my main doesnt post mr uhh guy who was talking about alts before
signed against
im against the nerf
against
alts can vote to support the proposed changed too
all hail the mighty drake blob ccp cmon use ure brains this nerf is ed
againsti dont deny that nanos need looking into but this is not the way to do it these changes will harm ships that require speed to commit to combat and enter webrange
yeop cry doom i have already supported this thread
against although i do like the look of the assault frigs post patch with 60 webs would be great to have those things less then useless
there are 4 races atm if you go through with this speed nerf 1 of them will be completely useless and 2 of the rest will be crap
against dont break your game
im caldari but i still think that speed nerf is bad for the game
against
but but but  i have multiple accountsi have voted against the nerf with all of them all my alts all my accounts and a few trials too i seriously dont want this to go through all propaganda aside i dont think the changes fix the issue which is why are there so many ships that cannot be used with the same amount of effectiveness and survivability as current nanos its a bigger issue here 
i think speedagility could need some rethinking butthe changes that are proposed right now are too many and too grave for one single patch also they look like bandaid solutions that could break more than they could fix needs moar caution imho
in its current state the nerf is a bit extream but only testing will tell for sure
insert generic argument here

againstsigh this is becoming an ever ending cycle i spend my time and sp training to be good at somthing  exploration for example  just get 12 decent at said thing and voila theres ccp pullin out the neurf bat why not fix problems that require fixing instead of just outright breaking your own creation ccp maybe nano ships need a little tweaking etc but this purposed nurf is just simply put a sledge hammer to knock a pin into plasterboard oh so wrong 2isk

against definitly 
against nanonerf
no nanonerf
quite the opposite nanos will still be viable just not invincible it has 0 effect on a blasterboat  fyi after the change a scram web combo will slow people down more than a web does now small ship pvp this change is the best thing to happen to small ship pvp in a long time fit an ab to an assault frig and it can still orbit at 1km at about 450ms while webbed you have any idea how hard it will be to hit somthing with that small of a sig radius with that high of a transversal huge buff to small ship pvpyou just have to adapt instead of staying out of web range you want to get in as close as you can
votes against returning to caldari online

so ccp you want to nerf speed huh so you take an axe to webbers and the hardest hit falls on the race that is best equipped to deal with the nanoships aka the minmatargreat plan as usual not like i actually have to say against jeeze get some people on the balance team that actually play the game in a mode other than testing pvp on sisi
i can see the need for ludicrous speed to be brought down a notch with slight nerf to some speed mods and implantsbut the proposed webifier nerf with the new mwd disruptor funcitonality hits gallente blaster boats even more other weapon systems are close on their heels without the range penalties
against the nerf as it standstoo many things changed all at once  higher likelyhood of seriously breaking the gamegive mwds a maximum run time based on skill and a cool down time  also based on skill  that would limit how long people can keep a mwd activethink about scripts for webbers so they can actually web rather than just engine damp ie add a kinetic damping script to webbers and an engine damping script for normal operation this would stop people gliding back out of web range due to their velocitykinetic energy it would encourage dual webs one with each scriptmake webbers chance based  not change on or off  but chance  of effectiveness 
no significant nerf
against  this kills small gang pvp
againstbecause i didnt spend months training skirmish warfare specialist v only for it to be nerfed to hell on a whim thats send the wrong message to people who dedicate to specialisenerf mwd or polycarbs which cost literally no skill to fit dont nerf things which require insane skill training like skirmish gang bonuses
against
lol even if every second character is an alt in this thread it still beats the hell out of the whiners who instigated this whole speed nerf thing and their thread 3 to 1 as i said even if 50 of posters here are alts and 100 of posters in the for the nerf thread are mains the number of mains here would still outstrip the other bunch there feel little scared that ccp might wake up and actually reconsider the nerf
against
uhm all i can say to the proposed changes is noi find it to be such a paradox that ccp is so uber careful about the implementation of new ships  like black ops and marauders  as to make their usefulness questionable or broken yet they are willing to instigate broad sweeping changes like this maddness on a whimit makes me really worry about the mental health of the people up at ccp hqoh and against especially against as proposed

against the proposed changes
against nerfing speed in souch a drastic way if you do so nerf shield and armor tanking as well because if you add all bonuses that exist in game for tanking  implants boosters faction mods  you can get a pretty invulnerable ship which is very hard to kill as opposed nano can be easily beaten by webbing even now for a solo nano hac worth 250 mil it is hard to kill a single bs worth 100 mil  insured to be worst  if he is fitted right in vaga for example one nos and you are dead or need to fleeccp you are wrong fix your engine and beat lag dont mess up with existing game mechanicsagainst

its overkill there must be some otherway off doing thisimplant suggestion is off the wall  imagine the whines about them not being inline percentage wise to eachother with theese changes i wont have anybody elses day to ruin ps if you cant counter nanos in its present form you fail hard go play with the veldspar instead mmmmm k

polys into line nerf the ships that can deal damage at 4kms  ishtarsac  decrease bonus on snakes i like the skirmish link change i like the base speed realigning but other than that its not good  making polysnanos a crossbreed mod slows down the hacs and recons too much  other than vagabond which is would still be faster than most of the current nanocruisers webscram change is not so hot gonna screw blasterboats give the webs 5km opt10km falloff  which effectively gets you to the same end result you desire but makes them still work for blasterboats  and do something different with the scrams
supporteda nerf is needed but a big change of this scale is not requiredoh and when a dev posts what he considers a nothing special setup that contains a full snake setup and t2 rigs it doesnt inspire confidance in his idea of good balance come back tux we all miss you

those of you who supported this thread and did not click check here if you want to give support to the ideadiscussion going on located bellow your smiley faces  go back and edit the post and click on that button if we do not win by virtue of popular demand at least this issue will have to be raised to csm and ccp and thus we will get at least an overview and proper balancing of the proposed changes as opposed to the unilateral and heavy handed approach ccp has chosen now

hello
against 
definately against poorly planned reactive tactics as always
against the death of small gang warfare
i think nanos in their current form are overpowered however this nerf hits them too hard removing one of the few viable methods for small gangs to exist particularly considering the state of both lowsec and 00 with them both inhabited by blobs that the smaller gangs need to get away from also this nerf is too widereaching and changes too many different mechanics making me fear that it will hurt the viability of blaster ships and cruiser hulls in general as they cant tank enough damage to engage larger targets nor can they avoid damage anymore
hah we can win in an internet forum argument frickin awesomeoh i definitely want to see a new vote go up about two weeks after the changes have been in test only those who have gone on sisi can vote that might actually be a vote worth winninghahahahaha
against nano nerf  with all my active accounts ccp  this is the type of mistake that will alienate such a large part of your base that you will irreparably damage the game and your subscriptions will fall precipitously just remember when lucas had already screwed up swg and they made radical changes they alienated their remaining subscription base causing subscriptions to tank lower then their lowest lowsother scifi mmos are under way and eve helps distinguish itself from these offerings  some of them not yet so public  in part by its rich and diverse combat system take that away and lave this games subscriber base that much more ripe for the poaching
small gang warfare died a long time ago with pos and capships

nerf is bad
a good idea tbh worth looking into for those with the powers
i agree with this onei also agree with someones idea about actual logistics ships vs space nurses

i support this and to go along with it making stations much larger than they are now put the two together and you bring a lot more logic into the application of this huge space station
my thumb you can have it
nanos need to be balanced so armor and shields are options to pvp again
support
i support 
im supporting the nanonerf
supported all small gang pvp should not be around the same shipkind of ship
by the way if ccp did succumb to some kind of vote or veto it would really lose a lot of its respect players should never dictate major changes to the point of being able to bend the companies armoffering suggestions is one thing but now that i think about it im really appalled that ive voted at all no matter what my stance is
rabblerabblesupportrabblerabble maybe some further balancing is required but speed defiantly needs to be drastically changed in my opinion and the suggested changes sound like a good idea ill update after play testing on sisi
support
i support this endeavor
i wonder exactly how many alts are posting
i support it
supportall those changes in pvp will be fresh air lets see who will adapt better
i support this rebalance and all the goodies that come with iti choose chaos

support it
supportingi hope i checked the box correctly
speed tanking needs a few tweaks what can i saythis is a good place to start i dont want it to go too far the other way but a good long look at balance is long overdue in this regard
o
down with speed
mostly support  minmatar ships   claymore claw etc have speed bonuses inherent in them 
nerf nanos please they all need to be nerfed
 the nerf nano gangs are small roaming gangs with the nerf there will be more blobing and greater lag bc all fights will be blobs
10
bring back different setup options please and skill for scouts
i hereby support this idea
i actually think it will help the game by increasing variety of pvp fits and thus seeing more types of ships used
i think the changes are heading in the right direction and we should help tweak them rather than reject them
bout time
i am 100 behind this like others i thought that stack nerfing the speed mods was a start but the webifier nerfscrambler redesign is ingenious and already the forums are filled with much discussion of new strategies and tactics eve will be the richer for this longoverdue balancing
nano nerf is good but they change so many things that i cant yet figure out if this nerf is not enough or too much
its about time i really like the goals the dev stated i hope they go through with it
let all the nano pilots cry their sweet sweet emo tearsill pack them into snowballs and launch them against their backsides

make pvp fun again
do it
look at all the emorage in this thread clearly completely eliminating minmatar from pvp will increase diversity of fleetsmassive buffer tank here we come ill bring the logistics since tempest blows
all for it
for it
as long as it keeps reasonable the nerf could be a good thing
a t2 fit vaga withough implants will still do over 4000ms go do the math yourself and then remove the foot from your mouthif that is not fast enough for youfly somthing smallerif that doesnt suit you wow  
i agree this has been an exploit for too long
i support it
until someone tries it out on sisi and proves that it is a bad idea i will assume that ccp know what they are talking about
nano nerf for the win

nano nerf gogogo i find it rediculous that when i fly the one ship class supposed to counter a nanowimp it doesnt work i have experienced many times multiple webs on a nano hac or frig and it still makes it back to the gate and jumps through i have sensor boosters on my huginns and rapiers for faster lock as wellpotentially the apparent nerf could be too heavy and the proposed changes to webs without buffing the minmatar recons to compensate has me prepared to mourn for them as i mourn for my presently useless arazu  damp nerf  and pilgrim  nos nerf  maybe adjusting the physics on inertia in the game or the speed of the web effect or the boost on a mwdpolycarb would have been enough oh well i have one toon training caldari and i just started a new caldari toon for the overpowered ecm  the only ew worth much atm if you cant beat em join em 
a move for the best
i support the nerf although i dont entirely agree with the methods talked about in the dev blog
nanoships being effectively immune to half the weapon types in the game is just stupid  blasters dont have the range and drones and missiles cant hit at all hacs were never intended to acheive the current speeds except for the minmatar ships which if you actually look at the math are still going faster after the patch than the other hacs were before the patchthe minies are still fast enough to speed tank and the ships that have weapons that can hit while speed tanking no longer canthe only legitimate argument i can see against this is the blaster folks complaining about blasterboats not being able to track similar sized ships without the 90 webber and not being able to catch ab without their mwds and even that argument is a little weak the reason that they cant hit is because they are going for max dps instead of tracking if they were willing to fit lower tier guns or sacrifice some damage mods for tracking mods or even  god forbid  fit longer range ammunition to stay out of scram range it would be less of a problem blasters are already beastly enough dpswise as it isalso someone the patch thread mentioned the negative response bias saying 90 of positive reactions never respond while 90 of negative responses do if they are right with the against thread having 761 at the time of this post and the positive having 301 that means there are 3010 for the patch  846 against thats in excess of a 351 ratio there i think ccp is on the right track
high dps is balance to f short range of blasters so stop talking this b  about sacrificing dmg mods blasterboats can survive only when it put all dps they can get from weapon with this change blasterboats cannot compete with other ships
i voted for balance
if they cant survive switching to longer range ammo or swapping a single damage mod for one that increases range and tracking then its not this nerf that killed them they have been dead for long time zombiethrons
i support these change
fly one then write
for the changes as long as they dont make missiles overpowered

meh
i support these changes
im for the balance
swing that bat high high high
its not perfect  i think it doesnt go far enough as well as those changes i would extend web range and slightly increase scrambler range to 10k
voting is stupid this shouldnt be about voting it should be about ccp doing its job and balancing the game im sorry but they know better than we do about how to do thatin the meantime i vote yes
slow them down
its just the guys who fly nano ships who dont want them to be nerfed support
durrlike these threads about this particular case should matter in my opinion like anyone even knows  really  how it will work out yetits all about bla bla 1000 pages of personal opinions with no calculations or whatsoever to back them up p
i say slow them down while i do see a few possible bad things poping up thanks to this those can be fixed in time right now its about preventing the nanoblob from being the only realistic way to beat your enemy because they to are in a nano blobi like my ishtar when it actually tanks like a gallente hac was supposed to not when it flies off at 5k meters a second due to an insanely expensive fitting that only the ultrarich can afford to lose with a smilenerf it

dont forget the third bugif youre fighting at a pos and tell drones to attack something thats on the other side of the pos or the shields are between you and your opponent in any way the drones will try to go through the shields lose lock then return to you
2nd is so friggin annoying
this would be a disasterzero evidence to your claim windjammer currently drones have two big bugs wheres your poll did you simply shoot the breeze with your other gallente friends and reach this conclusionthis will not be the first time windjammer has claimed to speak for the majority of the player base or claim ccp has a stance on something they do not buffing of doomsdays increasing the skill training time for capital ships are things he has advocated and is fond of saying he thinks would make everyone happy well it would certainly make gallente pilots happy according to windjammer himself gallente is dependant on drones they dont want to waitwindjammers advocacy is based upon what will be good for gallente not what is good for eve and those are often mutually exclusive goals gallente are a large semi static group they specialize in drone blob tactics and do not set up gunnery skills as youd think they would given their hybrid bonuses they prefer to click engage target rather than using functionkeyseliminating the bugs of the drones and at the same time requiring more server processing for drones would serve 2 wishes for gallente take away an important weapon  lag  and significantly reduce their need to train gunneryjbev

the idea of committing forces to try and contest a stargate is indeed required the idea of disabling warp drives of the gangs involved in stargate capture is very very good it is both commitmentinducing and a great way to get some smallgang pvp something i believe everyone wantsthe idea of having the timer based on ship sizes is not as attractive also having 10 ships as a number to induce stargate capture is a bit on the high side smaller gangs are faster and can hit many more gates all at once and less numbers scattered across more nodes  less lagperhaps the timer could be based not on ship sizes but the amounts of ships in the gang that interfaces with the stargate to induce the contested status 5 ships could take as long as 1 hour to induce contested status whilst 10 ships could cause contested status in as little as 30 mins any more and you could have penalties like the timer taking far longer than 1 hourthis would indeed give both the attacker and defender incentive not to field too many units but just enough so that the timer penalties for having too many ships would be reduced it is also a good limiter on blobbing thus less lag more pewpewalso ive just thought of the resource required to capture stargates soldierswe have them in the market theyre available from npcs and theyre currently used for fluff why not put those grunts to work this would also go handinhand well with any other plans ccp has for ambulation being able to watch your soldiers andor command them in an rts format aboard a capturable shipstation2mil isk in

im interested in any mechanic alike to factional warfare which discourages blobbing through the general idea that different zones or even just tasks can be completed only by certain shiptypes which in fw isminor t1 frigs destroyersmedium t2 frigs t1 cruisers belowmajor t1 bc t2 cruiser belowunrestricted everythingi cant tell you how excellent this works to divide blobs both my own and hostile to fight in more of a skirmishsmall gang manner which of course results in less lag oft my gangs will be among 3 or sometimes more plexs and will net a good ammount of kills in the process ofcourse npc plexs arent needed in lowsec and implentation in a serious manner requires mor detail than i care to investigate here but the simple idea that large gangs are given incentive to divide and be more mobile is brilliant
bane this question has been asked and answered at a csm meeting the vote to escalate went against you in that meeting and for good reason you were trying to get the csm to agree to let you present any number of suggestions to ccp without specifying what those suggestions would be the suggestions you did let slip were objectionable for instance you advocated decreasing the time it takes to train for capital ships what do you hope to gain from this threadi see no indication that ccp has adopted the stance you speak of if i recall the dev blogs from last year were concerned with carriers not all capitals youre right though those blogs were not received well thats a bit of an understatement given some of the inventive suggestions for the demise of ccp zulupark im sure everyone was kidding but there was still a marked level of animosity in the player basethe main concern ccp had was that the carriers were becoming a jack of all trades ccp nerfed the carriers ability to be a jump drive cargo hauler and they seem to satisfied that took away the do everything title for the carrierswindjammer
i agree that this is an important topic in general but this proposal needs some specifics as its unclear what the csm would be recommending to ccp in their discussion
so you just want to discuss with the developers those ideas would have to be presented before we talk to the developers else we will we wasting timeso now you went from wanting an open discussion about carriers and motherships to talking about 00 warfare why dont we just talk about everything you feel like thenaccepting this would be a tremendous waste of time it would be nothing else than a small opportunity for you to discuss with the devs with no reason
im not sure theres a solution if you see risk vs reward as the fundamental issuewith t2 moons suppose ccp balanced the static data so t2 products used even amounts of r256 stuff who cares if you are defending 3 r256 moons or just the one worth the most isnt the riskreward about the sameall mineable moons are in lowsec and thus bear some risk however a lot of their risk comes from other players who want them just for the isk they can generate if you shift the bpo requirements around so the r256 minerals are used evenly you just shift around the risk between moons in 00 however the activity 00 moon mining is as risky as it was beforeonly the risk is split between the r256 mineralswith t1 stuffriskreward is fubared here  ccp needs to remove loot drops in empire that reprocess for high ends i would also cut down on empire drone high end ore drops

drake is fine
drake is fine the op however is not
the drake is overrated i tried it once good tank to be sure but i could have done more damage to the enemy by getting out and widdling in their fuel tank i dont know where you pulled 400dps from
god go figure a minmatar player whos so far cried about drakes missile vs gunnery train times and pretty much any other caldari aspect of the game cry more little girl cry moreoh noez guys a drake thats not screwed over by a neut barrage a ship that can actually halfway tank like a bs at the cost of dps output oh noez thats opbeing someone who started caldari and went with minmatar later on i can see the strength of the drake but i can also see the weekness
the scathingness is there but you need to work on the delivery your current method makes you look petulant  
2 dmg mods and heavy missiles and drones is 450 600dps with hams and 3 dmg mods
show me a fitting with a tank that permasustains 750dps while doing 600dps and has the ability to stay in range to deal that dps and you have an argument otherwise no
why would i want to perma sustain 750dps and i presented no argument appart from drake can and does do 450 dps but since you bring it up 1 dmg mod 3 spr ii 3 large extender iis 2 invuln 1 photon 7 hml ii and 3 purger rigs tanks 750 while doing 400dpsof course useless and thats why the drake is ballenced

welcome to a few nerfs ago ever try and do dps in a passive tank drake its just like ubertanking a dominix only not as dangerous
you are full of failshow me a 750dps tank passive drake with 400dps if you happen to post a setup please dont show me setups without mwd or only tanking highest inherent shield resists and ignoring othersdrake is fine
wow this post must have ignored every other post in existence about how terrible passive tanking is for pvpa drake that is using a fullout passive tank has the following problems that balance it by making it embarrassing to bring to pvpa  it moves as slow and handles as well as some type of space snail because all of its lows are filled with sprs and possibly a bcu if they are willing to skimp on the tank allowing enemies to fly circles around it  rig slots are also devoted to tanking b  it is completely unable to stop enemies from warping away from it web them disrupt their tracking jam them or do anything else remotely useful because it has devoted all of its mid slots to tanking this means any enemy can freely disengage while the drake pilot cries and wonders why he stinks at pvpc  it is so crappy in fact that it usually survives fleet pvp because the enemy fleet commander knows that it has no means of hindering their fleet in any way and its dps is relatively mediocre due to using low slots for tanking who calls a drake primary if it is obviously using a passive tanking setup might as well kill the useful ships first d  im sure there are many other facets i am overlooking about how this is completely balanced as a passive setup basically makes a ship worthless in pvp except as bait which was previously mentionedi vote not to narf it
youre grossly exagerating either you passive tank 750 dps or you do 400 dps but you dont do both at the same time unless you have a drake with 7 low slotswhat need a nerf is large shield extenders something like 350 pg  to be reduced to 2625 pg with skills  and sig radius penalty replaced by a speed penalty would do the trick
i was flying around in my passive shield tanked explorationdrake the other day and got jumped by 3 guys i almost got a deimos kill but he warped off i almost got a jag kill but he warped off meanwhile i couldnt kill the myrm who had me locked down as my dps is awful in a passive set up the deimos pilot came back in an ishtar and killed me with praetors  lol the most i could do was harass them and make it expensive to kill me by shooting their t2 drones  which is what i did  i couldnt kill them or get away they could and did kill methe drake is fine as is obviously the problem is you learn to play eve
they should nerf the shield recharge time again compared to other t3 battlecruisers the drake by far is way overpowered its passive shield tank is way overpowerd
overpowered for what pve
a passive tanked drake is essentially worthless in pvp which is the only place that balance actually mattersoh and a myrm can actually run a better passive tank and do more dps
both titan and black ops should have 5000m range
i actually like this concept the doomsday device is decidedly deathstar true its cool but maybe theres just too much emphasis on these being weapons to be deployed with blobsi like the projected changes but i wonder  when ambulation goes live will you be able to walk around in your titan cause that would be cool jtitans an outpost that can be deployed and anchored
signed a thousand times titans in combat right now do nothing but remove the chance for spaceships to shoot at each other arguing specifics about cloaking supercaps drivebys lag etc is all meaningless next to the fact that we dont get to do the shooting thing ddds are a fightstopper one way or another and fights are why we are here
mobile outposts come with a lot of issues in how they change game mechanics i looked into a lot of these issues in this threaddestroyable mobile outpostprevent most of the issues this causes by limiting roles to offline location and a bit of storagelogistics a bit of protection against the 3am blitzkrieg assault using some existing pos mechanicsfixing the we retreat every time you attack us issue and also giving a bit of opportunity for young alliances to learn and get better through measured lossrefugee stats for entering losecprotection for the titan only by the popoinability to undock in anything except a shuttlemust pay off large fine to systems owning empirecan only retrieve ships and goods without reentering 00 on condition of leaving alliance and paying a hefty portion of basevalue to empirediplomatic peace treaty contract with ransom supportdropped loot is low destroy a bitter enemy ransom the random transgressor
so you want more ways for people to hide i mean we have outposts and pos alreadybut you are going to face 2 issues1 how will a titan jump if there is people inside the titan if a person makes a session change and then titan then jumps this person could get stuck2 what happens to people inside the titan if it gets blown up they have to be forced a session change which i doubt is realistic for it to happen especially seeing as these people could be logged off inside itso i doubt its even possible hence why ccp didnt do it in the first place
its all software anything is possible anyone who says different is just parroting off the favorite excuse of coders were not sure its going to be feasible the key word being feasible instead of possible because everyone knows its possible and is just hoping to avoid having to engage the problem its what software people do its no secretgood code is versatile extensible and easy to adapt to new implementationsits a very healthy change to mechanics it deserves the attention there have been countless changes to eve that have required new solutions to the code this one would be no differentthe devs will already be having this conversation about implementation in much greater detail than any of us can possibly pretend to address on this forum we should talk about what we want as players and not try to do the devs jobs for them otherwise theyre sitting up on the high dev summit asking themselves are the players wanting this feature or trying to shoe in solutions derived from existing mechanics because they know were humancome up with a great idea now let the great idea be implemented with good code it will solve so many problems now and head off so many problems in the future that it will definitely become the best investment of resources
i think that titans need to provide more front line support not add more to logistics abilities to them make their defense more powerful and replace the dd with something else maybe a defensive oriented module like a point defense system that helps kill incoming drones dictor bubbles frigs etc also improve their guns so that they can be effective at engaging other capital ships i think titans should be leading the charge not sitting back give them a reason to get on to the battlefield other then to show up for a few seconds and dd the place then run off again
have you ever made a game do you have any idea about eve works despite the fact that you in theory could implement it it doesnt mean it actually possible games has to be tuned for performance and security as well as working around some of the inherent issues of the internet which makes these kinds of things extremely unlikely
i am neither for nor against this but he is right anything is possibledoes it have to force a session change nodoes it have to cause lag when a titan jumps to a different system with a full fleet in its belly no it doesntif you know anything about code then youll know that objects can contain other objects through pointers when you do it this way nothing need movewhen you click undock server could just say ok youre in a titan where is the titan ok were spitting you out therein general the whole session thing is only necessary if you insist on a session change tbh i dont see why itd have to be that way a player could be docked inside of a titan being happily oblivious to which system they are in it could be that they only know that theyre inside a titan and who is inside it with themagain as far as local is conserned when the titan jumps it it could simply say that ive got x amount of ppl inside me bump the local up that much and those inside the titan need not be listed until they undockits all a matter of what you insist on having but moving a station around need not cause the problems you mention lavista anything really is actually possibleyou can think of programmers as gods of the memory realm whatever they say goes
oh my need credentialsim an active contributor to the opensource graphics rendering engine ogreits oop out the ass pointers galore exactly what above poster explained beautiful code a dream to use very fast its not too much to have it all or at least most of it in softwarethe do you know what youre talking about crossexamination is mindboggling as a boneless chickenstick to game mechanics csm rep
a market service in the titan is likely completely unfeasible as would the ability to dock or log off inside of themim gonna call you out on not even reading the op but lets assume ccp did want players to dock in titans 1  session changes also take place when entering and leaving stations so theoretically the only thing that would change is the location of the titan in a pilots titan hangar display  similar to the station hangar display 2  if a titan is destroyed everyone essentially loses their ship and gets podded if their clone contract was located in the titan it gets reset to something simple like their original rookie system or their alliance hq stationimo both problems very easy to deal withedit dang the guy two posts up said the same thing
i did read that but that is a contradiction on the op from my understanding it was pretty much the point of the original titans as well does a mobile station suggest  way of workingso we are talking about a mobile pos huhas for your other points1 but if you join a gang or there is changes to the gang you will be forced a session change so i must imagine that the state must change too for the people docked when the titan jumps2 that is possibly the simplest solution but then we will be having problems about scenarios like when people get disconnected and cant get out before the titan blows up
why not the state will have to be persistent in the database why do you think we have session timerspossibly depends on how the database works doesnt ityes but now we have code living on different nodes some in database and things like that all these things have to be in sync and the eve cluster has a very costly internode connection system so its not that simplebut what about the database again you have to consider a persistent state so from my understanding of the evecode you are simplifying it a bit too muchagain session change timer is required in order to make sure that the database doesnt blow upno that would also break the database anything sure is possible in software but this is a game there is rules to follow there is safety mechanics to make sure the game is always in a good state and there is behaviors that must always be followedyour post does not take all this into consideration your post just suggests that you can do whatever you want and not care about the consistency of the game itself and its database
the tldr version of what you just said isccp may have designed the architecture of the current code badly in which case doing this would take longer than theyd likepersonally im bored of people giving ccp this excuse espeicially when they apparently have enough time to waste on concepts like walking in stations the development of eve includes a history of ccp working more on flashly additional systems than on fixing core gameplay
i think there are things about session change that we are confusingwhen you jump to another system or when you dockundock from a station your computer performs unloading and loading of environments it happens on a need to know basis so when you change environments there is potential for a lot of delay and lag this is a problem when undocking or jumping into jita because thats a lot of data to loadwhen a titan jumps into a system sure the pilot has the pilot view he deals with the normal session change load of all of the ships around him and the new environmentfor all of the people inside the titan they dont necessarily have to deal with that but this all depends on how the coders implemented their system and that is just speculation but going by the needtoknow standard there isnt a whole lot of data that would need to be updated for the person that is inside the titanupdate what system youre in and where the titan is in the solar systemchange chatroomsso it is possible for the session change from the clientserver pov to be no different than 1 person loading a new environment and x number of people changing chat roomsas for the backend database stuff it could be as simple asplease visit your user settings to reenable images assuming that a database is used to keep track of these things at time critical moments rather than server objects which i am not convinced of 1 solarsystem server object  database table gains reference to titan and updates local chat2 solarsystem server object  database table loses reference to titan and updates local chatit could be that simple or it could be completely unfeasible it all depends the design of the information systems if eve is object oriented at its core and solarsystems contain stations  separate server object entities or database tables  then they can lose them and gain themif however the station is part of the solarsystem  literally the same server object  database table  then it wouldnt be possible without a code rewrite or extremely ghetto riggingso youre both right it just depends on how eve actually works on the backend and that is just speculation
there are those that claim that doomsdays act as an antiblob weapon discouraging alliances from forming up large fleets only to have their ships destroyed in a flash by a single opponent but this is a red herring  doomsday devices can be and are deployed against small gangs just as effectively as large fleets as such the titan in its current incarnation serves mostly to prevent combat from taking place whether on large or small scale because anyone going up against a titanholding opponent knows that if they commit themselves to a fight they can look forward to every ship in their fleet being hit for 70313 damage simultaneously it forces 00 warfare into a long tedious waiting game as one side or the other hides inside a pos for hours until the titan s  either doomsdays prematurely or logs off  and lets not even get into the absurdity of the doomsday through pos shields ability at the same time id be wary of removing the doomsday ability entirely  every titan pilot who spent the 10 weeks or so training doomsday operation v needs to have something to show for their efforts  but press altf8  or whatever  to obliterate enemy fleet is a literal iwinbutton and a violation of many of the principles which eves combat system is based upon there are alternatives like the idea of making doomsday weapons into aoe ewar devices  like the remote ecm burst recently made available to motherships  or superpowered warfare links which have come up before and these would make a titan an important element to a fleet rather than the alternative to deploying one at allas for logistics buffs even making the clone vat bays functional and useful would be a nice start
definitly at the current rate titans will be able to dd dreads soon
i could support this ideaanother idea would be to remove the doomsday device and give new aoe weapons that are smaller in scalesay a new type of projectile ammo for minmatar hybrid ammo for gallante missile for caldari and some sort of energy weapon for amarrthe system would be set up such that they could shoot it at a designated point  created with a bookmark with another module like a target painter that highlights the spot does damage in a 10 km radius youd need to retool them though with more turret and missile hardpoints and possibly more hi slots
all my opinoins have already been said so im just gonna say agree remove the dd please ccp
something has to be done about the titans or eve will turn into a very static stratified cluster those who have being able to hold and those that dont have only able to get leg up by joining the established those that haves
i always like the idea of them being a forward mobile baseonce jumped into the system and deployed they can hand out cruiser size and down ships by the request of pilots coming to it ie a new ui where the pilot doesnt have to kick ships out etc  logistics drone bonuses so that it can repair multiple ships quickly having defences to take out attacking forces via something like bsgs ships flak cannons even leave dd in and make it a sort of last ditch effort to remove the attackers while you being completely outgunnedim pretty sure itd never be changed  but i at least like the idea  
ok i see what u meant originally so ill take that back it definitely looks technically feasable though judging from many of the recent postsas for the titan exploding scenario disconnects shouldnt matter as they are not petitionable as anyone can just say argh my internets were broken it certainly make the most sense and would be really funny if in the titan loot were ship hulls modules and corpses
give them the role they were designed for plzdd spam ftl
i dont think we should throw away ddds i dont think ddd should be the primary purpose of a titanallowing it to play greatly a more logistical role would be nice the idea that it might function as an anchorable outpost however intriuges this would solve a few issues but mainly the problem of what happens when the titan pilot logs off or disconnects if the titan was to anchor and become an outpost that would stay in place when offline atleast docking is more feasible now when giving away its mobility i believe it should now gain an array of benefits the first ofcourse is the doomsday itself but now as a defensive and not an offensive if a hostile fleet makes a move on an anchored outpost mode titan the ddd is the perfect gtfo button assisting its allied fleet to play defense secondly i believe it would be fair to allow it a greater deal of hp perhaps that of or greater than a large pos  depending on fitting  resistance  as well in scenario its a station you can park anywhere great for offensives park it on the edge of hostile territory instant outpost with the pricetag i dont feel this is unreasonable and its a whole lot better than the ninjadds where seeing currently in short give the titan a strong and tangible logistical role
i think part of the problem is that dd has a cooldown on that particular titanif they made a dd leave a residual charge in the aoe so that other dd couldnt be used for a certain amount of time then fleets couldnt bring in a dozen titans and wipe out any size opponentfirst to fire off a dd gets the hit second to fire does 50 third does 25 until the timer resets which would mean an hour or something from the last dd set off so setting off that 2nd blast 45min after the first would mean you have another hour to wait and not just 15minas for making them into a station of sorts i would say that docking isnt terribly necessary make them a mobile pos you can switch modules if you are within a certain range and perhaps allow their shields to cover you for a time thats not to say theyd have the rediculous amounts of shields that pos do and if the titan is reduced to armor then your fleet hiding under its skirts is open to attack as welli firmly agree that titans need some encouragement to become a fleet support craft again instead of a fleet annihilator
you mean like one of those costly internode systems for parallel computing clusters the kind that are point designed for the lowest latency and have high bandwidth the kind meant to keep software distributed across several nodes working on one data set aware of the changes occurring at each nodes problem boundary is that the kind of interconnect youre talking aboutif its that kind of uber complex system ive worked on one of those too and theres no excuse for not having the system in sync absolutely not one you can transfer 10 of a nodes data sets to nodes on the data boundary and not bat an eyelashforgive me if i fail to make the distinction between software and a computer gameyoure continuing to describe this like a junior accountant playing a game of file cabinets no we cant move this entire drawer to another cabinet we built the system around me pulling every file by hand remarking the progress sheet and then refiling in a certain order you cant just pull a drawer out the back and refile it according to the same rules in another cabinet i wont see whats going onbut the boss had experience when he pulled a whole drawer he followed the same rules for every individual file lo and behold the junior accountant never noticedthis is how good interfaces work accessors and mutators do what they are supposed to when they are supposed to following a common set of rules for accessing and modifying data and they dont have to know what the others are up to because every one follows the rules when they do something and the whole thing stays in order database order should be implicit in the consistent construction of accessors and mutators not having one way to access or modify dataquit trying to overcomplicate the eve cluster a sophisticated system is elegant a complex system is just disorganized
no the eve cluster is not designed for parallel computing the nodes are connected with gigabit ethernet or something like that they are working on implementing infiniband
agreed however i would like you to look at my idea on making it so capital ships liuke titans have muliple points in which to shoot at making them harder to kill yet they lose parts as each is taken outit doesnt make sense that a ship that big can be killed by shooting one little spot untill it explodes
work around the theme battlestation i am only 2 months old but i believe working around this theme should give atleast some potensial
im running for csm next electionyou missed the point designed for parallel computing or not a system with a highspeed interconnect should have no issues updating nodes of changes across each ones data boundary if there are problems its because of poor utilization and there are no excusesthis isnt a feasibility problem give us mobile stations and make titans serve a higher purpose than ramming the overview
signedthough personally i would go as far to reimburse the build cost of all the titans in game10 recompense payment then delete them from the server and database altogethermost game breaking addition to eve ever tbh
this would be a disasterzero evidence to your claim bane overwhelming attitude among 00 players wheres your poll did you simply shoot the breeze with your corp mates and reach this conclusionthis will not be the first time bane glorious has claimed to speak for the majority of the player base or claim ccp has a stance on something they do not elimination of learning skills decreasing the skill training time for capital ships are things he has advocated and is fond of saying he thinks would make everyone happy well it would certainly make goonswarm happy according to bane himself goonswarm has a lot or relatively new pilots they dont want to waitbanes advocacy is based upon what will be good for goonswarm not what is good for eve and those are often mutually exclusive goals goonswarm is a large semi nomadic group they specialize in blob tactics and do not set up sovereignty andor poss in nearly as many systems as youd think they would given their large size they tend to spread out a lot rather than build an empire in any one place they are oriented toward destruction rather than building poss and outpostseliminating the anti blob weapon of the titan and at the same time making it a mobile station would serve two wishes for goonswarm take away an important anti blob weapon and significantly reduce their need to create posswindjammer
gs has the second most sov 4 systems of any alliancezero evidence for you claim wj your description is not even close to accurate i truly believe bane wants this because it will make the sovereignty game more fun for everybody  except maybe for titan pilots but who knows 
uhh we obliterate entire fleets with our titans too removed navigatorask noobmercs about their satisfaction during their expeditions into 00
there are over 70 titans in existence and less than 10 have ever been destroyed  in 12 months we could be looking at over 150 titans in existence and maybe 15 destroyed total  this game will be totally and irreparably broken well before that pointthe sooner you do this the less tears you will have later when it becomes obvious to even the stubborn that this must be done
it is possible to make gold using a cyclotron but it will cost much more than digging it out of the ground while something can be theoretically done it is not always possible to implement it in a economical and functional way
stop it with the theoretical vs practical analogies already you sound like a presidential candidate trying to reach out to all the downtoearth sentiments of the good ol boys something that has nothing whatsoever to do with software engineeringyour analogy makes it sound like a good solution is a billion times harder to do than a cheap kludge and like the readily available kludge is an equivalent product as the good solution which anyone who writes and maintains software will tell you is completely not truegood code  spaghettithere are three issues that are naturally connected to this thread1  ddd needs the axe2  mobile outposts3  destructible outpostsa lot of people are interested in these problems individually because they are all tied together its worth it to look at them as one issue because it would likely become a central part of game mechanics its worth it to invest in a good solution that will be able to evolve with the game the i cant shoe it in with five lines of code excuse isnt going to fly three major issues long term impact fix them all at once and fix them well
so i am in the software development industry in a way and on the project lifecycle end of thingsthe feasibility is more about cost to benefit in that way an analogy can be made that it wouldnt be profitable to expand an existing design to allow more possibilities vs spending that same amount of time implementing new design and contentnew content is more profitable as existing customers need to feel that the game is still alive and well that things are improving that their chancy investment in eve is being rewardedhowever maintaining and expanding on older more outdated content is also essential to longterm game health and ccp is doing thattheyre attempting to transition from static node based server architecture to a more adaptable expandable and sustainable distributed cpu server architecturethis is costly and challenging it wont bring new content it will simply make the current game world more stable and playable not profitable but ccp is doing it and i believe that this is a good display that ccp loves eve on a level that other game companies do notthey dont have to bring eve into the next century but they areas far as destructible stations and moving stations it may be quite a challenge and cost but if it improves the quality of the game for the long term i believe ccp will do itso the real question is can you convince ccp that using titans as stations and being able to blow up static will improve the long term health of eve or will it be some unsuccessfulunused feature
for the benefit of those of us too lazy to trawl through this websites horrible search function could someone link to the original dev blogs referenced in the op it would be interesting to take a look at the original conceptstia
and goonswarm has twice as many members as the second largest alliance so when you post that your goonswarm has the second most sov 4 systems of any alliance your own post is evidence supporting the accuracy of my claim ive put that claim in bold and underlined it for your pleasure and ease in readingyou say more fun for everybody yeah ive seen bane say exactly the same thing exactly the same thing he claims it for just about everything he suggests im sure it would make things more fun for everybody in goonswarm but that is not everybody in eve goonswarm is large with a membership of around 5000 but there are around two 215000 other people in evewindjammer
i havent heard any arguments against this other than unfeasible and only alliances use them so its not worth it for the first there are lots of posts showing or suggesting ways to implement them the strongest argument being code is code its a game and can be donefor the second not all major changes are meant for individuals players who dont think that titans deserve attention because they only used in nullsec by large organizations must realize that 00 based alliances saw little to none in changes or new content in empyrean
im sure you do but other alliances do not have the capacity for or penchant for blob tactics as goonswarm doeswindjammerremoved navigator
link to features and ideas discussion thread on this subjectone of the things ive noticed how about mining is that it doesnt really need a lot of thought its just a case of turning up at a fixed asteroid field targetting a boulder and letting the lasers do the work while you watch for rats on your overviewthis seems a shame especially given that several of the races give options to be a prospector without really having mineral prospecting available as a viable profession in game therefore i propose the following changes to how asteroids currently behave to allow the formation of this role1 all asteroids will not show their type when initially discovered instead itll show up as being an unsurveyed asteroid2 you can mine these asteroids however all youll get is a hold full of bits of rock  this wont affect the ore content of the asteroid  if you want the valuable ores you need to survey it first3 survey scanners to change from an area of effect to working only on the asteroid currently targetted4 once surveyed the asteroid changes from unsurveyed to its correct type mining then occurs as normal5 once the ore is depleted the asteroid doesnt just vanish instead it becomes a barren asteroid completing a cycle on a barren asteroid will again give you bits of rock which youll need to jettison or perhaps a use could be found for these  a bpo for construction blocks for example the current ore fields should be changed to only have access to the basic ores  for example youd have access to scordite but not massive scordite during downtime 10 of the current barren asteroids will be chosen at random from all depleted asteroids across new eden and changed to become unsurveyed asteroids this allows a supply of asteroids for newbiesmeanwhile veteran miners should be capable of hunting down richer fields  which would be located in exploration sites  which would not only have access to the richer asteroid types but would on the rare occasion have access to ore types not normally found in that particular security status  for example mercoxit might be found in 0102 exploration sites 
posting in support of my own topic
i do not favor removing agent quality i am in favor of making the quality dynamicall agents start as level 1 quality 20 to the playerdoing more missions for an agent increase the quality   and eventually the level  as does standing with the npc corp and that corps factiononce the standing with an agent reaches say 95 the level and quality do not increase you need to change agentthe new agent takes your standing with their npc corp and faction into account to set the starting point for level and qualitystandings are per division you must start with level 1 20 for each divisionmultiple agents in the same division at the same station would be moved or removedthe current starmap agent id system would be replaced by a notification   character sheet maybe   as to what your starting level would be with a new agent in the same or other division
i disagree with this idea because of the same reason stated aboveplayers dont want variety they want the bestand they will seek out the best agent to make them money no matter where they have to go to do it thats why the lag is so bad and why there are so many places being called mission hubs so taking away the quality and making them all equal will mean that everyone will find the best system based on sec and everyone will gather there find a dead end 05 surrounded by 06 and youre guaranteed to make tons of money without any risk of dying in a gate campthis dynamic idea where quality gets worse as you continue to do missons is also a lame idea it sounds balanced but it doesnt sound plausibleagents are hired on by their parent corporations to work out of a particular location they make friends with the locals and listen to the rumors being told over drinks in the station bar then when a capsuleer comes along they see if you have a decent reputation for performing missions well if you come well recommended then they offer the job when you get back they put in a good word for you and you move on to bigger and better missionsi think the key to breaking up mission hubs is limiting the missions how many people have had to rescue the damsel a couple times a day or a couple days in a row wouldnt it be nice if the brat stayed rescued for a little whilei think a fix is to sprinkle around a few more agents and then make their missions run dry after a while that way you are eventually forced to move onto another system anyways not because you graduated to a better agent or higher level missions but because you did everything that was needing done in that areaand if you use up a q20 agent then the best nearby might just be a q10 or q2 once again giving use back to those lower quality agents who didnt get the prime location assignments they are still working for the corporation just not out of paris or las vegas
supportedsort it out pvp why not just make ravens completely immune to any for of pvp so all the isk farmers can farm in peaceat least nano pvp adds an element of skill to the game
how so
vote here instead bigger thread already
rereading the blog your right they did say 5 hours however i think this relates to the goals of speed the section the said quote is from not about the entire proposed changes basically he says that they spent 5 hours coming up with the goals not the entire changealso you have no rebuttals to the rest of my post
just for you
all games that are funded by subscriptions are democratic game designers just have to pray the players never figure it out
no the players need to pray the devs never believe that nonsense games that let the players run them fail hard see soea true democracy destroys itself even faster than true comunism hell comunism can actually function on a small scalehaving said that big no to the veto its a game balance change its a damn good game balance change nano will survive however itll be counterable by all the races not just four specialized hacrecon and bs willing to fit mostly neutson that topic the bs cant tackle the current gen nano they can only scare it offnano will get less common and thus inversely more powerful on the few ocasions where it is used ecm is this way as the many many falcon whine threads attestas for the 00 fix its comming if nano would be overpowered when they implement the changes ive been hearing about then it has to be balanced first after nano is fixed well have a little while of static 00 time while people retool for whats comming then well see the change to sov and hopefully itll favor small gangsblobing will always be common combat in all its forms favors having more people on your team than the other guy has  unless they cant work togeather  this is a good thing since the only other option is to allow certain individuals to be catastrophocily more powerful than a group of people arayed against them caps and titans are as close to that as we should ever dare to getabout the 5 hours thing you tinfoil hatters are acting like these changes will be going live tomorrow they took five hours to outline what overall goals should be for the change they included in there goals that hit and run attacks must remain viablenone of those goals are bad for the game none of them note missle intercept is not the same as missles should always do full dammage to everything speed will still shelter you from their dammage just not all of it similarly you may get run down by drones so fit a secondary tank or some ewarthere will be an entire month on the test server while they work these changes out if you are that worried about your precious fotm ships get on the test server and proove to them that these changes will be unbalanced until you see how they work calm down a bit and realize that everything changes in eve sooner or later and this time arround its nano believe me nano has had it comming just like all the previous nerf bat buddies did or do you honestly thing wed be better off when everyone and their mother had ecm and nosgalan
i agree with jade i play this game solely for the small roving gang and any changes that negatively effect the ability of small gangs to roam i would be against i actually dont care if they nerfed speed in half if they were able to do it while still keeping small roaming gangs viable however what i saw in the blob   i mean blog was just more nerfs to help the big alliances out flying in a fat tanked up ship in a large gang is easy flying a fast ship where you are constantly changing speeds constantly looking at the distance of everything around you and constantly guaging what your opponent has equipped so you stay at the closest range without being killed is far from easy and with recons eas 30km scram inties nerfed nanofibers  speed bonus removed  24km neuts and heat it is even harder these days for small roaming gangs to survive
i fly caldari recons and hacs in roving gangs just fine none of them are nanoyes nano ships are good counters to blobs but theyre also good counters against small gangs solo players and just about anything else even if it finds a situation it cant win they can usually barring luck escape
nerf nanoesi guess nano pilots will just have to adapt like they have told everyone else too
i already posted in the other thread but im poastin ovah nyah as well
the op in this thread is right on speed does need to be tweeked  down  the edge needs to be taken off the ships that actually break the physics engine in game but to do that you dont have to nukenerf the entire game populacelike many other have posted this is the time for the csm to prove their worth are you guys effective or just ccp window dressing let see you prove its the former i personally am hoping for you but fearing the worstspecific issues raised by the opwebs changed to 5060 effectivnesscomment this is just plain idiocy at its max you want to address speed so you kill webbers come on where is your brain ccpshort range scramblers deactivate mwdscomment good idea but pointless how many nano boats get that close anyway they will just stand off above 10k15k and laugh at this new abilityreactivation time delays on mwds  similiar to cloaks comment best idea  mentioned by the dev  to take care of a large portion of this problem if implemented correctlypolycarbons nerfed to be worse than nanofiberscomment typical ccp overreaction they give us new toys  rigs  dont think their implementation through in the firstplace and then take the nerfbat to them when people figure out a cool way to use themxinstinct boosters will reduce sig radius not increase speedcomment near pointless combat boosters arent nearly as commonly used or as available as ccp seems to want to think they areoverdrive effectiveness pretty much halvedcomment worst idea of them all are you insane ccp are you trying to break the game overdrives are used by everyone not just the speed freakssnakes nerfedcomment this prolly needs to be done in the first place or at the very least there needs to be other elite implant sets that stack as well as the snakes do to increase another  any  aspect of a ships stats say a direct counter to them one that stacks as well and increases the ability to warp scramble or web the shear fact that anyone is confident enough to wear something as expensive as a snake set into combat is a sure sign that they give an unfair advantagegangbonuses to speed reduced but increase to agility addedcomment this is the second to the worst idea on the list this strikes at the very core of eve you cant set up a skill that works one way have your players spend weeksmonths training for it then change it when you decide you dont like it do you want to loose accounts ccp if so this idea is the best an quickest way to do itif you want to add another skill that adds agility to gang bonuses great but dont change the base stat of a skill simply because you are trying to kill the advantage some extreme ship setups have messing with what skills do should be your absoulte last resort before you close the game servers for goodthanks to the op for putting some reasonable discussion into a topic that is rapidly spiraling out of controlcheers
not caring what the polls say still going to test and deal with whether the changes go live or not but despite my belief that having these polls is meant less for getting an accurate account of player intentions  still many in game who will never see the forums  i have noticed a fundamental flaw in the vote systemive vote in both the nerf polls with multiple characters mains and alts from multiple accounts i didnt vote evenly nor do all my alts use my ruze monikerwhile your having these polls please be aware that they are fundamentally flawed and should on a basic level have little impact on the developers decisionsas i said in one sarcastic remark when a group of players posting on the forums use threats intimidation namecalling vetos and polls and they succeed in these tactics what does that say about the developers what is to stop special interest groups from continuing to do thisi do hope the developers continue to approach this and all subjects with open minds taking in all players opinions each argument has weight and is right in its own way i think the ccp guys are some of the best game designers in the biz just by looking at the product but game design should be left up to the company and the professionals not the opinions of uneducated playersat least beyond our defining choice of paying for the game dictate j
oh no the majority voted against what you wanted and so the polls are wrong
neither are 100 im leaving the gamemor tears tee heethreads on the general forumsyes some people will bork the votes with alts or whatever float their boat  im naughty tee hee i voted in both tee hee etc  but the majority wontand the vote system in the assembly is the mehtod used to indicate to the csm what and how strongly players think about certain issuesthe vote against the upcoming nerf is already higher then any other issue and this is a shining opportunity for the csm to prove their worth to the sceptics  myself includedskunk
also many folks who like the nerf will not bother to come to say something they already are getting something they want example when is the last time you saw a protester in you nations capital with signs saying we are totally contentwhich was why antinano threads were everywhere before and now all you see is pronano its just how lobbying works
that is pretty much it by the way the admins of the csm have ability to see exactly how many individual accounts voted so even if we voted with all of our alts it will be 1 account1 vote deal so relaxhere
hey im just saying the vote is borked if the game changes i change if not im definitely going to get myself a nano ship and see if i got the skillz to pilot itwe all assume you assume that because im against this whole voting thing that im for the nerf bad idea im actually for fast ships maintaining the ability to avoid certain damage types and keeping effective speed tanks especially for ships designed for it like the vagabut my little tirades in the voting channels and here they apply just as much to the massive number of complaints i just researched calling for a nano nerf as they do for the barrage ccp has got in the last two days or so after they described the changes they are thinking of makingusing forum politics alt postings and all the mean things i listed above should not and i will repeat never  not  and in no way be an effective way of convincing developers to change or not to change
nano thing is a contentious issue as such no one is content until actual balancing takes place in my opinion at the moment it is imperative for all those who want the nerf and those who do not get behind those threads so yea even those who are content with the nerf should come out and show their support for it because i certainly hate it with the passion the way it is now and i think it needs to be rethought and rebalanced it is too harsh at the moment anyway most people know how i feel from my posts i am sure
i was not saying those supporting the nerf should not come out im saying that most will not simple psychology yes it has an impact but lost who just feel yeah those nanos had it coming will feel less need to come and postedit emphasis for clarity
ok i understand where you coming from and surprizingly   i assumed you were for the nerf  i also agree with this im actually for fast ships maintaining the ability to avoid certain damage types and keeping effective speed tanks especially for ships designed for it like the vaga and this using forum politics alt postings and all the mean things i listed above should not and i will repeat never  not  and in no way be an effective way of convincing developers to change or not to changeproblem is what do we have other then voice our concern for the heavy handedness of the proposed changes they need to be looked at more and refined not just lump everything together so here you see i would not argue against common sense just argue against an overwhelming uniformity of nerfing implants for which i worked really hard together with mwd down to 500 all that type of stuff
i agree with your reasoning isis an accurate vote would be done ingame per account youd still have players with multiple accounts getting votes but it would popup right when you log in so all players would be forced to answer yea nay or dont careall kinds of phsychological reasonings could come into play here my big gripe is the attempt at using democracy to force developers to do what we want them to do no matter what the argument or whos side it isif i stop liking the way the game is my only choice is very simple if i continue to pay i inevitably approve of the game if i stop paying i dontthats consumerism boys and girls mmos are an industry and a highly technical one at that im thankful ccp lets us offer opinions on these boards but ill cry armageddon whenever one side or another states that their opinions are majority
since when is the assembly hall for voting this forum is for bringing up potential issues to ccp ccp wants to change speed so they are doing itif you want to bring up an issue fine then do it dont nerf me is not an issue and a vote thread is not an issue both voting threads need to be moved to general discussion or shipsmodulesvoting threads on the forums are massive amounts of fail
and as another note i think ccp will listen to most players but only after the changes have been on sisi for a bit and if most players who have tried the testing still dont like them if i were ccp i would ignore the most of the signed no moar nurfz crowd which seems to be a lot of folks without any actual reasoning id personally throw out all those votes also recall the carrier nerf the actual nerf was way different from proposed one my point is that whatever side you fall on please take the time to post reasoning for your likedislike of said nerf not just you no want small gang please no nerf or nerf teh azjust for ref i am rather excited to try out the changes on sisi i think they could bring a neat dynamic between all the speed mods ofc im not a 00 guy so most of the fights im in dont involve bubbles and im wanting to see how those are affected before i lay down total support
i am going to get flamed for this but i think the op is absolutely right  about the single point about the votes being weighted unfairly  and i dont see anything wrong with the situationthe poll votes are weighted towards the people with the most accounts not alts ccp can quite easily see through alts if they pay attention to anything  which i doubt  they pay attention to accounts not alts the people who run more accounts and thereby put more money  andor effort if you pay for your accounts by buying gtc with isk  into the game have a bigger say in the votes in the endas far as i see it this is as it should bethe op is also making the fatal assumption that ccp actually listens to or cares about what the majority  who speak up  wantmy two iskflame suit on
one account one votethis was the main reason for why i created this topic a couple of months ago yes the csm can easily see how many accounts voted for a given topic however we as players cant as a result any decent points in either one of those threads are getting lost in a wall of alt spam support votes as people are under the belief that the csm works off the total number of thumbs not the total number of accounts supporting cutting it back to one account one voicevote would help to alleviate some of this noise thus allowing the decent arguements both for and against to come forwardfor the record im for general rebalancing but not to the degree that ships that were actually designed for speed  frigatesinterceptors  for their survivability cant go fast to a reasonable degree reasonable in this context meaning they should be hittable by weapons  light precision missiles for example  and ships  other frigatesinterceptors  designed to deal with fast ships
if ccp is going to act based on player votes then i suggest they reach every player in game by posting a message on the login screen it wouldnt be fair that us forum s get to decide the direction of the game when the majority of players dont even read the forums

i dont see how this is unfairpeople can do exactly the same in the other post for the nano nerf
same as its not unfair if one presidential candidate rigs the election so that he gets to become president the other candidate could have done the same thing rightthe whole idea of players pushing developers around it destroys the reason for stuff like the csms when a csms starts pushing vetos votes and make large disclaimers about getting player approval even before a change goes into testing this kind of goes into showing that the csms think they can decide for the devsmaybe im wrong i probably am but the idea of csms seems great to me but these guys need to keep an even keel and not get involved in biased forum politics like this especially before a change can even be tested seriously thats bad judgement
by the way if these votes and veto topics are not being pushed by our great csm community as a means to intimidate our developers into making a change or decision then those topics  and this one i might add  should be removed from this forum by a moderator
the polls are inaccurate more because of simple voluntary response bias than people supporting with alts people are more likely to take the time to vote in a poll if its an issue they feel strongly about hence since people who fly nanoships have the most to lose they will be more motivated to voice their objection than people who are more ambivalent but still support the changes thus voluntary response polls will almost never give a realistic depiction of the communitys attitudesemotstatistics101jpgps this thread would be better in the jita park speakers corner
says the csm member who got into the csm by virtue of his own disreputable gang of selfadmitted griefers who want to ruin eve for the rest of us you know as well as most people that if your little goon lackeys did not vote for you you would not have a free plane ticket to island i do not trust you i do not trust goons and i do not trust your scamming alliance as a whole so go ahead lend your voice to the cause if anything goons would only lend disrepute and tarnish such cause by their presence
im just arguing that there should be no cause because players are not the people who should be making these decisions reputations aside players offer suggestions not make decisions or try to force someone to make decisions
wow are you rping or are you being for real
i am being serious i do not consider his place on the csm as justly deserved or won by popular acclaim i see it as theft as such whatever he proposes needs to be viewed with suspicion since goons have said it before that one of their goals is to ruin eve experience for the pubies combine that with the blatant scamming that goonswarm leadership and he is the goon leadership condones and encourages we have a clear picture of where this person is coming from or what his inclinations in game might be so no sorry i am not rping i am expressing an outrage a thief cannot be trusted he is the king of thieves and scammers as such he can not be trusted

ccp has done a great gob with this game however i feel they enjoy adding new features too much there are many complaints about the game mechanics that are being ignored and others that get left in the past when a new feature to complain aboutwhile adding new features is an important part of keeping any game interesting i believe ccp is placing too much emphasis on them i do not know much about software design however i do know that continuing to add new features to an unbalanced system only creates more imbalance ccp needs to focuse on simplifying and streamlining their code balanceing combat mechanichs industry and 00 soverntywhile i understand that the game cannot make everyone happy it should at least be balanced in a way that is logical and efficient
i do know gunnery what w my pvp char being minmatar and all however shows your ignorance when talking about nongunnery but since you had to open your mouth lets compare support skills toogunnerygunnery rate of firesurgical strike damagemotion prediction tracking speedcontrolled bursts cap needrapid firing rate of firesharp shooter rangetrajectory analysis falloffso thats 1 skill to affect chance to hit 2 for rate of fire 1 for damage 2 for range and 1 for cap needmisslesguided missile precision decrease sig factormissile bombardment flight timemissile projection missile speedrapid launch rate of firetarget nav prediction targets speed factorwarhead upgrades damagelauncher operation rate of fireso thats 2 that reduce the penalties applied to missile damage because of target speed and size 2 for range 2 for rof and 1 for damageso for a rank 2 skill you get at most 25 bonus to tracking and for missiles you have a rank 2 skill for explosion velocity  to offset targets speed and a rank 5 skill that only works on some missiles to offset the target size stop your forum whineing and get over it gunnery and missiles are balanced if you dont like it why dont you train up missiles and see just how long it takes to get decent pvp damage with them scrub
as someone who started as a missile user and transitioned to gunnery do not supportmissiles offer faster training to whatever one you need and less sp overall but in return its significantly harder to crosstrain with them and they are just not quite as good as turrets once maxed out even if its easier to get thereturrets had the edge before the speed nerf now that there will be less ships the missiles cant catch they will be roughly balanced with the very thing that you are complaining about being one of the benefits for missiles that makes them balanced
supporting caldari nerf
qft the op is clueless do not support
um what check again
signed
and that right there is pure qft seems you do need other missile skills and support to use missiles to be specific you need skills to use guns not ammo and you dont need anything too specific to use launchers but you do need an equaltoguns skill tree to use missiles even the standard ones so in order to use cruise missiles i have to train light and heavy missiles but after those requirements were left with the same 2way training as guns either to spec in light heavy cruie or torpedoes versus your pulsbeam blasterrail artyauto spec orwere left with only limited size to shoot out and thus limited size to shoot atas a t2 blasterrail and various missile user i cant support this i had to train more to shoot 3 sizes of t2 missiles than for guns
this has been asked for so many times would be nice if they looked into it or at least told us why not
this might also be a very interesting use for the tactical map supposedly being made for ambulation being able to sit down and show a simplified version of a battle going over mistakes and suchbut as some have said fraps is currently doing that now
yeah something like half life tv  hltv  which recorded every detail of a match you could switch between the viewpoint of any of the people playing or roam freely not attached to any playernow that would be cool and since it was happening years ago why not
ive fought even responding to this inane thread so as to not lend it any sort of credibility but i simply cant let an idiotic post like this go unchallengeda missiles have flight time turrets do notb turrets have tracking computers and tracking enhancers to improve performance missiles have no such modulesyour ideas  and agreeing with your own posts with an alt  do not a sound argument make
this if missiles are so overpowered then why dont we see them everywhere
signed
not to mention you can outrun damage even after a missile strikes missiles have trouble with distance low traversal high speed targets are almost immune and nanos are completely immune
fail after narf
heavy missiles heave 80km optimal no turret have optimal like that cruise misiels got 240km again no turet can reach optimal like thatif anyway will they will ahve crap tankdps only drawback is that they need to fly to target

and i dont want nonrpers to represent us because this is a roleplaying game but heybut if this topic is actually serious  i cant quite make up my mind  what does it matter what someone does on their own time in their personal lives just doesnt seem very relevent to ones professionalpoliticalpublic lifein other words  so what
well suck for you then that democracy means you personaly dont get the final sayor are you antidemocracy toowhat is it that you have in your closet that you are too afraid to facei mean thats what this is all about isnt ityour repressed feelingscome on tell us share with us it will help you
this whole thread is awesome its like a presidential smear campaignbob dole eats babies do you want your next president to be a baby eaterjade constantine likes to roleplay do you want your pvp and gankfest bloodbath mockery of an mmo tainted with a roleplayer vote no to eve storyline and vote yes for more ways to screw each other over while paying 15monththis thread is full of fail
this is fracking hilarious i mean eve is a general microcosm of real life a prime example of the inherited cruelty and selfishness that is prevalent in every humans nature where goodness and sensibilities are the exception not the rule but thisthis is a perfect example of a smear campaign since we have nothing to blast the candidate for lets attack his wife and his preacher or the guys military record because obviously if he was in the military he will be a war mongerobviously since this guy had fun roleplaying as a female in a brothel hes got to be some sick twisted individualalong those same lines of logic anyone whos gotten a thrill for killing another player in game that perfect trap or trick you should probably see a psychologist because deep down your the kind of person who s dogs and kicks women a pillager and plundering psychopathi dont know jade and i need to figure out what his apparent bad comments have been but if i was asked to vote today id vote for him and wouldnt vote for goonswarm and im not your typical goonswarm hater i dont know them but their forum representatives are simply awfulhahahahaha
my wife laughs at this whole thread
only if you barred all the goons from ever being on the csm for their blatant racism and scamming ways
scamming is not prohibited in eve nor is racism as long as im roleplaying you minmatar 
it is an issue and a discussion of that issue the csm can take their concerns and the concerns amply displayed on these forums to ccpand im sure ccp is looking at the reaction on these forums personally ive never seen such a fast and furious one and i believe that has to say something to ccp i think you know that and youd like to stifle the reactionwindjammer
i couldnt agree more jade id be extremely unhappy with the csm if they didnt consider this a csm issuewindjammer
jade although i agree on the importance of making changes to 00 territory warfare i dont think it is worth opposing the dev blog speed changes on the grounds that they are happening out of order while id support the csm highlighting concerns about some problems these changes would raise  like blaster ships for instance  i dont think its wise to reject them out of hand without offering a counter proposal to how combat ought to look in regards to speedccp has pointed out real problems with speed and combat that currently exist  the ability to outrun drones and missiles first and foremost  and those problems must be solved whatever the csms reaction to this it must not outright reject these changes because they address real problems
hey im all for csm discussing the proposal that ccp gave us hence why i asked you to raise it for the next csm meeting as per my emailbut seriously we are getting spammed with this topic and the thing hasnt even hit sisi yet i
it is called multitasking jade you should look it up sometime
the thought of ever having to remote hull reppay for repairs to my freighter after a narrow escape makes shuttersigned

eve is a game it is played for entertainmentit should thus have a design goal that each type of activity should be funposes are not currently fun to put up  huge time sink waiting 51015 min per module  they are not fun to fuel  it needs doing regularly and one cant automatically or remotely transfer fuel from the corporate hanger arrays to the control tower and they are not fun to blow up  big time sink lots of hitpoints very little in the way of tactical or strategic decisions while attacking them in the absense of a defence fleet thus they need some serious work by ccp to make them more fun to useps posting this while waiting for modules to come online after forgetting to fuel my pos by about 12 hours
look this thread it is like 5 threads bellow yours and has like a tone of people in it and stuff so look pos dead horse  go support it
from the last few replies ive gotten they switched from saying unverified lag to you knew it was going to be laggy when you warped in you get to deal with the loss
the problem with reimbursing for lag is that it depends on customers being 100 trustworthythey arentit isnt about the customer always being right because if you allow those customers to abuse the system the fair players are effectively penalisedif there is no serverside proof of ccp being at fault then there should be no reimbursementto be honest there shouldnt even be a ship reimbursement category for petitions it should only be considered if part of a full and detailed bug reportyes i have lost lots of ships to lag and no i dont petition them

what about stargates dropping you at semi random points in the target systemwould eliminate gate camps completely
elaborate please like how after jumping you are somewhere 12km off the gate
yes lets put people at random locations in the solarsystemguys guys im being shot at by a deathstarhow  lol that guy  fail system placed me hereah yes hacate his change got trough no thank you
oh i see what you mean but it doesnt work within the storyline of eve stargates are basically linked permarunning cynofields with definite inout points  see the fictional science section released by ccp and gate camps are fun dont nerf them
what wrong with gate camps gob
please explain it to me oh great gurulast time i checked defenders automatically target chase and hopefully destroy an incoming missile if someone tosses 6 cruises or torps out and you launch 4 defenders you have a chance of reducing the incoming damage by 23  not likely but a chance  with the rof of rocket launchers you have the possibility of getting enough defenders out there to hopefully destroy all the opposing missiles also defenders seek out any hostile missile you do not have to be the target biggest thing is you have to wait until the bad guys launch before you can activate the defender launchersive flown missile defense in a kestrel with 4 rocket launchers sometimes it works some times it doesnt if there were no missile boats in an engagement id just switch to normal rockets and provide what puny dps i coulddefenders are not perfect theyre too slow to be of any real use you cannot set them to auto fire but they do work sometimes
simple they block only missiles fired at youedit i stand corrected someway around the way they have been changed without any note and now they can intercept missiles targeted against othersso my apologies
nice idea would probably make more people use missile ships in fleets or at least get some kills if they already are
and you think having to use more slots to do what you do with 1 slot is an advantage of guns
would also neatly decrease the problem that some caldari pilots seem to have in working out how to hurt nanoships i like this idea
to the op you are a fool think about the effect that missiles that go twice as fast will have on pvp  no longer will damage be mitigated by the speed of the target since the missiles will be going so quick that not even inties will be able to escape let me guess  you fly a drakeraven and never do anything other than lvl4 missions in a 05 systems somewhere couple your ridiculous suggestion with the speed nerf and small scale pvp will die once ppl accept that to be viable in fleet pvp they will have to train turrets and accept that a valid pve fit will not work for pvp the happier eve will be
i believe the topic was raised before the proposed speed nano changes were brought up at least i voted before i saw the dev blogsince when was eve supposed to offer any way for someone to be immune to being damagedanyway with the proposed changes to speednano i suggest that this topic should be held in abeyance until after change testing
does anyone actually ever use defenders i mean apart fom lolfit small ac active hulltank raven pilots
cruise missiles already do over 10kms on unrigged ravens yet inties are not in danger from them
wowthats a lot of hate from people who have decided that missiles simply most not be an option in pvpi use them already anyways and never get kills still happy still having fun and losing a lot of ships but hey so whatas it is now missiles can only be used to secondary smallish support ships so i think this is actually a good ideaand i hate you severely for getting it before me signed

this is one bug thats really driving me nuts
why is it this nitwit makes anticaldari posts and then supports them with his altcheck out all his other posts and early supporters
kalintos please stop posting you are terrible at it i recognize you fly minmatar and are bitter about the speed nerf but thats no reason to lift your bowels on high and  on the forum
sorry but i use torps and typhoon and they are much too powerfull vs guns
im not an alt silly
do you think you could give me the link to were i can dw that software please
err like they used to be before the torp nerf  buff you mean 
terrible idea not supported
welp
hekaudaerne highsec route
can you list the systems in your route im pretty sure ive run that route and theres a lot of 04 and 03 systems  i call lowsec gankspace as its often more dangerous than 00 as 00 can be carebear if you have good relations with the people who hold sov  lowsec nobody really holds and its true gankspace 
so speaks brilliancewhen the agents were chosen fw was not even a glimmer in ccps loins the placement of many minmatar  gallente research agents was placed at the creation of the game again long before fw ever came about despite the ideal that it would one day be implementedthus people who have put resources and effort into establishing their research agents and in a purely game standpoint it is now more illogical than ever that empires at war would have any of their assets much less science in enemy space
to make matters worse eccm is virtually useless as a counter you are just wrongmore generallyecm is an interesting case because while it is overpowered its balanced by thisa  ecm is chanced based 100 work or 100 failureb  ecm boats are fragilec  you are primaryoutside of the small gang setting you fly ecm you die in the small gang setting when everyone dies except one or two ships those one or two are usually cheap tacklers or the ecm ships i fly both ecm and nonecm ships  the ecm ones die a lot morethese dynamics cause ecm to be fine as it is the falcon in particular might need some toning down because the cloakingrange allows it to have the power of ecm without the whole constantly dying thing its easy to counter  snipereccm  boom  but still may need some weakeninganother thing to consider is the speed nerf once that goes into effect the falcon  along with ecm as a whole  may be weaker the three prevalent organized gangtypes  not the only ones but the most commongeneric  are sniper nano and rr sniper rips apart ecm and ive heard  but not sure havent flown in an organized rr gange personally  rr often fit eccm because of how important it is for them to not get jammed so with the nerfing down of the most vulnerable ecm target the falcon might be brought down to earth by the changing environment of other ships around it
this is a very silly analysis your using a falcon its a specialty jamming ship its supposed to be good and falcons are paper thin you only need to get a few good hits on it and hell run off plus look at ecm with respect to other ew such as tracking disruptors you dont even need to fit special racial td and you can render any turret ship useless 1 eccm should not be able to render the falcon utterly useless either you should compair at least an equal number of ecms to eccms to get a really fair compaison otherwise your just saying that one module should render the entire line of ecm specialty ships uselessalso i think there is something horibly wrong with your numbers i only read a falcon as being jammed 30 of the time with 2 racial ecm and one eccm and a hurricane only has a 50 chance with 2 racial jams and one eccm
by your convoluted logic of its supposed to be good im going to assume you dont want your only useful caldari ship to be nerfed but hey its ok if they nerf nanos and everything else that promoted guerilla warfare as long as you can keep your perma jams right
you want to talk convoluted logic ecm is balanced it is only very powerful when used by a falcon a falcon has no tank at all so if you bring it to action it will die yet you dont want to balance the falcon you want whats left of ecms balls smashed ground into a powder and smoked in your personal hookaecm is fine the falcon may be slightly overpowered but it is soo amazingly fragile that its not that big a dealas a quick bit of advice when you are running a roaming gang have one of your guys fit a scan probe when you get into a fight with a falcon he probes it warps to it and wtfpwns it with ramming and drones when hes not wtfpwning falcons he can be your logistics guy or a scout or some drone dps hell there are all kinds of uses for a goof drone boatecm is finegalan
i have to join this debate i have tried specing a prophecy with racial eccms 2x at least and 1 0r 2 c racial backup arrays in the low slots  the apropriate rigspermi jammed on the 1st try same with a scorpion fitted to jam falcons no dice so far every attempt at a eletronics solution to the falcon has been a failure and i get to test daily just about so far the only solution has been to chase them of with intys or somone gets lucky and blows one up but then gets permi jammed by others  and these hac fleets iv been fighting arnt useing just 2 or 3 more like 56 and have proven able time and again to jam fleets to death so yes their is something wrong and unbalenced with the equation basicly i feel that the chance based total delocking jamming effect is the heart of the problem jamming is supposed to make weapons miss target or be less effective in practice it totally wipes your target lock and prevents relocking and is so effective we call it permi jammingperhaps the entire ecmeccmtdsens damp mods suite needs to be looked at as the td module preforms a lot of the functions of what the ecm unit should be doing in practice along with remote sense damps that effect should be also part of the ecms modules range of effects currently sensor boosters sig amps back up arraysand eccm provide aparently zip effect against permi jamming inculding rigged anti ecm ships specifcly fitted to resist being jammed i dont propose to nerf the falcon though the way its special ablity works should not be so overpowering though one of my primary wishes would be for the falcon to not be a cloaker dodges the bottles and cans of outraged pilots i dont have a concrete idea for a fix of the issue however i do believe chance based ecmno target lock is the heart of the imbalenceoverpowernessperhaps we could get some dev comment on this issue seer
alright another ecm pilot speaking up heresome quick fallacies with thinking ecms are overpowered1 ecm ships are paper thin tank what tank this means if you have less than perfect skills and cant jam as efficiently you are going down if the enemy simply outnumbers you you are going down  primary  most ecm pilots are forced to flee as soon as someone locks without getting jammed racial jammers are a poor standard at best they are very situational and only work reliably against their targeted race  eccm are effective even if you do get jammed i can tell you that you have more jammers pointed at you meaning less at your buddies fof anyone with no tank those missiles hurt like a  drones right again these hurt like a notice anything here unlike nanos ecm doesnt take a large skill investment to counter do not need to train a sepcialised ship just to kill them just tactics and weapons available to virtually all pilots how many pvp pilots honestly cant fit an eccm or use drones at allecm is just another one of the pieces to the pvp chess board its been balanced plenty before its only coming back to the stage in force as a mitigation to the damage nanos do i know its the main reason my fcs ask me to bring my falcon over my cerberusso for something that isnt survivable takes little skill or sp to counter is chanced base and made a primary target without fail it seems to have found a pretty good balance good job ccp now lets move along to other matters
leave ecm as is and boost eccm this has my full support
againecm is fine eccm is fine the falcon is fine you are just using the wrong counters or getting blobed in which case you were dead either way but its less fun to die to ecmgalan
wasnt exactly the same argument used by nanoship pilots
i agree there i just came back from a year away from eve because my credit card will not work with eve  paypal  they say we dont know why and a bunch of silly robot comments30 day time cards was what got me back into this game was thinking of opening a 2nd accout againno way not nowas it stands once my sub runs out all will be dark and there is no way i can come back unless they bring back the 30 day tc or fix my cc problemsgood luck whith your premium product ccp
the lack of thirties isnt such a big deal because they encourage farminguse a thirty do the training set a reaaally long skill repeat or farming datacores these are things that do not benefit the game and do not benefit ccpits the higher prices  in isk terms  per day  compare new 60 to old 90 or even old 30  that will result in the cancellation of longterm consistently  each month  paid alt accountsbest and least painful thing ccp could do is sell 60 day gtcs directly to players through ccps official website at the cost resellers pay now no financial loss for ccp pure gain from players and the resellers are just leaches off ccp and their customers anywayedit the timecard change is a real concern for much of the subscriber base and the csm is supposed to be a gobetween and mouthpiece between ccp and that base if the csm is limited to topics that ccp wants discussed disregarding what matters to players that completely delegitimizes it but im a democracy loving american so i may be slightly biased
you can still buy 30day increments1  start subscribing at one month intervals2  ccp gets money from first month3  suspend account4  play for 30 days
i apologize for being unclear my intent was to specify that altering titans would be fixing numerous balance issues on a large scale exploration ships would have no more impact than any other buffnerf  a good idea but without nearly the same sweeping change i really was trying to be constructive sorry if it clicked something off in your head bane glorious made a great post today clarifying his position on mobile stationsalso define nonalliance content is it something alliances cannot do im in an alliance am i blocked from this content i think that this term is inherently an oxymoron
even as a explorer i can see the argument against a all in one type ship but our only choice now is lucky to last 12 hits by low lev pirates i at least would like to see a exploration ship with maybe still the one high slot but with some added mid and low slots and some more cargo area no offensive capability at all like we have now but you can take more than one shot from the npcs without going down something where you could at least jump into a area and last long enough to open a can or something without loosing your ship in 2 shots
maybe something out of the mining frigates instead of covops cloaking bonuses make them flying astrometrics bricks
what might be offensive somewhere it might be considered normal somewhere elsei dislike behaviour limitsalso limiting bigots views makes you a bigot  by definion of dictionarycom 
skillpoints dont dictate anything exept the most perfect situation competeing with older players is all in the mind a 3 year old player could be a complete idiot it is just how you deal with it is what counts and after a few months in the game you will have enough skillpoints to start leveling the playing field in that regard
move to 00 where you can shoot anyone who tries to loot your wrecks
agreed there are a metric shed load of roid fields about just by using the in game filters you can find them via the players in solar system you can also get some nice quiet spots in low sec just take the time be willing to haul arse and find them
well at least there will be a week to test the speed changes before you try to convince to devs to not test things on the test serverhay hay hay i found the reply youll get about last weekends temper tantrum jade
damn im leaving for my trip to seattle that dayhow come its on a sunday anyways
hmm i think part of the problem is lack of feedback from ccp there are a lot of issues that get raised and discussed in fi and gd however the feedback is tbh lacking so the issues are raised with the csm instead or as well as at least we get to see some discussion and get some feedback if ccp want player involvement feedback from them is key or we will concentrate on issues we think we can affect a change on such as ship balancing
csms are there to represent players nothing else if you dont want to represent players step downyou were not voted in to be devs balancers get trips to iceland or provide some sort of nonplayer related grand vision of eve thats up to the players not you your job is to represent usif we end up wanting you to ask ccp to give us stupid things thats our mistake not yours do your job or step downi didnt vote for a council of elitist idiots who decide via some nebulous we dont think thats a great idea its not grand enough process what to bring forth to ccp thats exactly what youre starting to sound like
since the announcement of the speed changes i was wondering what the csms thoughts were on tracking disruptors since most ships can out run tracking even with a burner at close ranges and tracking disruptors affect tracking even more what modules if any are going to be implemented to disrupt missiles and drones now that most not all ships will not be able to out run missile damage and drones what midslot module will be added to counter tracking disruptorswhy should some ships be able to negate a large amount of damage because of a game mechanic when other ships cannot why should drone boats and missile boats do full damage all the time and turret boats do not turrets still have to deal with tracking optimalfalloff and sig radius where missile and drone boats only deal with max range and to a smaller degree torps not included  sig radius
bump
destroyers work fine and i think this was fixed when salvage parts were made smaller so more could fit in cargo  unless you find more than 40000 salvage at once 
what he said
you forget all the other skills needed to make a missile usable the range payload rof guns do dmg instantly missiles have to wait its a fair trade off
during the in person meeting ccp actually asked for clarification or further development of ideas from specific suggestions the wording by jade is that only one discussion per person so you can have multiple csms bring it forth this is a stupid way to try and gain power in the csm especially since in a 6 month period the gameplay can change sometimes up to 2 new expansions in six months
tldr team fortress 2 cap points worked better than battlefield 1942agree with op and support a common problem i saw arose due to the particular geography of the minmataramarrboundary lowsec systems the minmatar hed constellation  amamake dal  is the only constellation bordering amarr lowsec however oftentimes amarr would go north towards essin tiat and eugidi  constellations deep into enemy militia territoryfrom a meta gaming perspective this allowed amarr gangs to spread out their targets but it wouldnt make much ingame sense to allow system occupancy many jumps away from the nearest friendly system  eg avenod could be contested 9 jumps away from kourmonen  the lowsec regions of space may not have been originally intended for factional warfare as certain choke points are clearly unbalanced and factions respective lowsec space isnt nearly tactically symmetricalto further define the op only consecutive constellations be contestable and only consecutive systems be susceptible to capture a faction would occupy a system by holding the control bunker  as is currently  and would occupy a constellation by occupying say twothirds  or some other definable fraction  of its systems region occupancy could be determined similarly such a system would provide proper mechanics to lock nonconsecutive systems and force militias to fight on smaller fronts as suggested in the op
well according to the csm members that commented this issue it was submitted to ccp to be discussed during the f2f meeting in iceland but did not show up on the agendamaybe i am too paranoid  
signed
agreed to all points presented by the op
yepcapitals may be far the easiest category to compare apples v apples and minmatar fail here significantly
agreedand the rest of the minnie ships are now being nerfed to bring them alongside the capitals as the worst of all the races
ah cool iw as looking for this post nice to see that things are noted any eta on which we can test improvements on the test server 
true as it is now there are only a few places where the black op can jump from lowsec and into 00 and when you are finally in 00 you have burned so much fuel getting there that theres not much you can use it for but then again not a big issue since most of the sytems where targets are hiding are cynojammed fuel bay is the way to go i thinkadding a second ship to fix flaws on a current ship is just wrong why would anyone use normal haulers when all that will be needed are bo and jumphaulers and you can move your stuff without any risk already have jumpbridges carriers jumpfreighters and so onalso adding such a ship you are opening a whole can of worms covert jumping in a bunch of haulers with towers also when ccp had a live devblog there was a ccp dev who was concerned giving black op bigger cargo bay cause it would be exploitet as a covert cargojumper reason for a seperate fuelbayand now you suggesting a covert jumphauler a mustseperate fuelbayjump to covert cynos in cynojammed systemslonger jumprangefix that scan resnice to getslightly better resists or some more hpcov ops cloak but then again that could make it overpowered and if the tradeoff would be loosing damage then no already doing small damage
i believe adding functionality to the deep space transports is a good idea as far as my experience goes  1 black ops op  the range isnt really the problemblack ops in the real world represent something equal to the men in black movie noone knows about it  excluding aliens etc making the black ops able to use covert ops cloaking devices can achieve such a statusthere has been a post on full overhaul of their bonusses which i think is partially ok but if you give black ops such bonusses whats left for the recons firepower and limited ew seems like the way to go tank should be minimal as all recons have it  compared to capabilitys of hachic keep it up imo we arent there yet
i support this topic although i aprove some little changes in nano nerf this measure looks like too too too much more than its needed
nano nerf is absolutely good i would love if it is even nerfed morein my opinion mwd also need some cap usage increase and more cpu use

the dev giveth and the dev taketh  its easy and planewho said nerff   i would say balancingi would like to see what will u say if i had 3 differents tracking modules without penalty that make me able to hit any nanoshipgo go go devs its time to balance the game

save the nanos
signed and ccp please introduce new content leave the universe alonemorphing the universe is the stuff of hollywood and time traveler movies  cue claud vandriver there just is no way to roll this out without breaking peoples suspension of disbeliefwhats next removal of an entire classification of ship concerning any and every nerf past present and futurei urge you to think about it a bit more and then if you cant dream up a storyline for the nerf dont do it surely the scientists and engineers of eve might have put their heads together and produced some new weaponry to thwart the threat at least its believable and some story driven from its conceptionim not a role player but i do appreciate a backstory existing to bolster and flesh out what exists in a universe
againstthere are counters to nanos as can be seen on many killboardscurrent proposed changes will tilt the battle towards a larger group
this is crazy this nerf will hurt the game more then help alot of minmtar ship will be crap now  
i support the changes to polycarbon engine housings to be inline with other speed rigs and support in general the lowering of maximum speeds  we dont need a linear speed decrease just adjust the far edge of the curve down a bit  but the rest of that devblog is pure horse
going fast is just to much fun
while i support the spirit behind the proposed changes i dont support the changes themselves id rather see new itemsskills added to provide better counters rather than crosstheboard nere

this change has absolutly no effect on blaster boats if the ship you are fighting against has a mwd equipped too heres the breakdownif you are a blaster boat you will be webbing your target if you are within web range then you are withing scram range too guess what after the changes turning off their mwd and webbing them down 60 will ruduce their speed by i believe 92 thats slower than you can tackle them now this change benifits a blaster ship very slightly

small gang warfare must be a viable part of eve or i fear the game as we know it will die ok something might need to be done about the most extreme speeds but there are really already counters and tactics to meet the more normal nanogangs in any case plz ccp be moderate dont do all those changes at once the chance you break more than you fix is way to high and it usually takes ages to fix the fixes after such huge change the game is currently probably more well balanced at least on the nonecapital scale than i ever can rememberconcentrate on doing something about how the sov works and have a look at what impact the combination of jumpbridgescynojammers and titans have on the game  this is probably where we have the biggest problem in the game currently and what forces a more and more blobbing environment

well nanos are the last thing that will prevent all of pvp to be blob tactics and small skirmish warfare and its one of the few pvpaspects where it still rquires more than just be able to press f1f8 so lay off the speed you will still be screwed if they got neuts or huginnrapiers and soand tbh people that are raging against nanogangs are usually new people that cant understand why their precius ratting raven got killed by 2 vagabonds or other pvpers that only pvp in blops the proposed speed nerf is removing one of the most challenging way of fighting for me in the gameif anyone is in doubt im against the speednerf

some changes are indeed necessary but as it stands this is far too sweeping polys were out of line high grade snakes were out of line high level meta mwds were out of line but these are relatively easy changes not to mention that this change is being proposed after factional warfare has introduced an awful lot of new players to pvp who instead of understanding and adapting to current mechanics have generated an epic level of forum whining that appears to have given them exactly what they want  devs promising to make it even easier to kill speeddependent shipsthese are not the changes to make ccp i vote against

just couple of questionsfirst is anyone going to bother counting how many of these votes of opposition were made before we have even been able to test what exactly the changes are or should we create a new thread to voice rational objections based on fact instead of speculationsecond do we need seperate discussion for what could be viewed as two different changes1  there is the nerf to ludicrous speed done by changing the attributes of nanospolys and various highend modulesimplants2  there is the boost to afterburners by allowing mwds to be scrambled and changing the webber attributesis there a thread anywhere that allows for rational and reasonable discussion of these needed changes or is only irrational ranting permitted

dont like the web nerf cause its gonna be tough to get in range with a blasterthron and maybe too difficult to hit with only a 60 web but speed has become the iwin button being able to engage or disengage at will is a great advantage and now as it was before maybe small gangs will have to think a bit more about positioning and the use of recons etcanyway yeah im mostly for it a bit much at once thoughthink it through before you shove it all on tranq at once

i support this because that dev blog is right and this nerf is needed its rediculous when people think they shouldnt be nerfed i mean cmon everything has stacking penalties that actually work but ships that were never intended to go that fast are going moronically fasti mean cmon this nerf has been a long time coming
using covert cynos to move around is allot of fun being able to use it more places would be great
agreed
it seems unfair to me that the csm should somehow figure out a percentage on their own ccp dreyjog being an economist should at least be asked about this  it would appear to fall squarely in his domain
the attack upon me is retaliation for posts im making in another thread he has very roughly paraphrased what i posted laced it with absurdities of his own invention and misrepresented me all this in an attempt to get under my skin using what he imagines is clever satirefor a goon it is clever much more so than their usual postswindjammer
i am interested in a resolution to both bugsid be especially interested in a removal of collision detection from drones since on a number of occasions the decision to recall 5 x 125k isk drones before warping out has almost cost me a 60m isk ship due to being bumped by my own drones
in a way removing collision detection from drones would be the best thing in the world too many times has my moros or domi been bumped by my sentriesheavies besides wouldnt that speed up server performance not having to perform those calculations this could lead to odd behavior such as drones flying through buildings and asteroids etc to reach their targets but im not entirely clear on how their pathfinding relates to collision detection its funny how something so tiny even matters to something as massive as a ship  even a frigate btw i havent experienced the drones breaking off before i did back when i used multiple drone types with different speeds before trinity but after they added that stay as a group function they dont seem to randomly break off that said the group toggle does get turned off at seemingly random times but a simple tap of the shortcut fixes thatedit for support
signed especially the drones clustering was said to be fixed with fw which it was notand why can we shoot missiles and gunz through roids but drones have to go around them
salvage thieves bumping mission runners so they agro everything or cant warp out repping npcs and so forth are easy ways to harass hisec mission runners this lowers your income and theres nothing you can do about itin lowsec you can just kill the person higher reward but higher risk
steady job vs gambling comparison you are comparing the return of something that if you are very lucky will give you several billions and if you are unlucky noting to something that will give a stable income comparing ratting to mission or mining to mission is comparing something with a semi fixed hourly return and the possibility to do it practically always to something with the same characteristics making it a valid comparison exploration is extremely chance based you could have a exploration site or it is possible that it isnt there then it can be any of 5 kind of site several levels of difficulty it has a chance of spawning something extra good or practically noting at all at the other extreme whit your analysis system i can compare potatoes with sandstones as they are both yellow or red and find that it is too easy to squash the potatoes under a stone
as this is up for discussion by the csm in their next meeting on sunday please chime in with any feedback or ideas
tactical arrays could be restricted by ship class alliances would be given  some  freedom over which size they want to buildminor ta has no requirementsmedium ta requires 1 minor in systemmajor ta requires 2 minor or 1 mediumunrestricted requires 1 major 2 medium 1 med 1 minor or three minorsthis system forces smaller complexes the defending alliance would have access to them attackers would need to scan them out the defending alliance can make all 5 ta small sized to force a frigate assault but would only be able to defend with frigsthe larger the ta the more resources required but also more defenses can be added construction would take place by first dropping off the acceleration gate then moving construction materials through that gate  industrials can use all gates  freightors can only go in unrestricted making those ta the most heavily defended but also the most vulnerablei have a feeling the occupancy system was a trial run for 00 mechanics so it makes sense to look at how the current fw mechanics can be transferredalso great work op
the recruiting forums are enough to drive to anyone to distraction can these classifieds be divided into individuals looking for corps corps looking for members and alliances looking for corps the 35k posts make my head hurt every time i think about reading through them looking for recruits subdividing the forums could greatly increase their utility just by organizing the chaos a little the recruit forum could improve i hope im not the only one
supported under the banner of forum improvements

i am guessing this is the reason they gave us the new cool recruitment tools in game of course i dont think anyone bothers to really use them
narfthumbs downtheres only 2 types of drake setups and one is worthless for pvpyou just called for its narfingnarfdrakes fine when fitted for actual pvp uber passive drakes are just drakes that are hard to kill they have no firepower and couldnt blast a whole through a wet paper bag so who cares uber bait ship maybe but i dont think uber bait ships do much to upset the pvp balance in evenarf
note the change there ornot supported seems perfectly balanced to me
i forgot that noobs dont know about heat
nurf itand the myrmidon  again  while youre at it it can passive shield tank even better than the drakeyou know what just make all ships in eve the same so that fkin noobs can playop  die
ow i made wrong staempent with forever d
nobody who flys a decently fitted drake will give a crap if u nerf passive tanking or not
drakes are useless without at least mwd and disruptor and one or two bcs how big of a passive tank does that leave nothing overpowered imho
just lolling at all the bears ting their pants coz they might have their ratting boat nerfed
not supportedyes the drake has an amazing tank but it does nothing else its not a damage dealer  400dps yeah with all level v skills drones and implants and gang bonuses but only with heavy assault missiles gl getting that into range of your target without the mwd cause you fitted your passive tank or aint got the capacitor to run it  leave the drake alone its fine
passive drakes are horrible very strong and without cap one of the best tanks in the game they contribute nothing to the fleet usually not so much as a point and my destroyer can muster more dps theyre obnoxious and i cringe when i see thembut im not supporting this thread im not supporting it because its valid because like a nanopilot dishing out 4 bil for a snake set the drake pays for his tank it sacrifices its mids that would go to tackle and a speed mod and lows that would go to damage mod then it drops over 40 mil into its rig slots when it finally gets locked down it dies becuse it has little in the way of escape if it doesnt bring ecm drones no reason to whine about it now lets hope the good karma comes around and one drake pilot looks at the sitution that any race of bs can be a nanokiller with the right skills and that theres no reason to whine because when you finally do get that vaga popped and his pod hes out 7 bil and you scoop 200mil worth of loot from that wreckstop whining post less
hey i use my drake as a pvp ship theres not a long list of good caldari solo ships but the drakes on there
passive shield tank a domi it does pretty damn well too all those low slots better than a raven which i find funnyno support the price is extreme to tank that much in pvp
ok ill bitefirstly the op is an obvious trollthe drake is fine like all passive shield tankers it has no speed dps or tackle also 750 dps sustainable with no cap i beg to see your fit if using active hardners maybe but passive hardners dont cut it unless youre talking officer or pithiever neuted a drake and shut its resists off they die fastop you obviously dont know how to play minmatar name a drake fitting and ill show you a cane that can smoke it 1v1
yes a full passive tanked drake has a defense of 750 hp per second and an effective hp of 83000it also has a dps of approximately 200 not 400 200 with a full rack of heavy launcher 2s  not hals as they need too much pg and not enough range for you to ever hit anything  so 7 t2 launchers filled with the tech 1 ammo of your choice no damage mods maxed skills  achieves approximately 200 dpsthis is so overpoweredfacepalmwrists
just my 002 isk herewhen i started looking into a myrm for missions battleclinics highest rated build was a passive shield tank tooi considered it for about 15 seconds before i changed my mind and closed the windowthere is no way you can call a build like those useful when every single mid low and rig slot is filled with shield buffs sure your shields are awesome and you have plenty of power for whatever guns you fitbut warp scrambler  webber  nosneut  you sitting in place while i find out how long before your uber leet shields finally do fail
i realize that agree the drake is not overpowered but i must askwhat damagetype is that 750 against also how are you fitting that t2 faction in gang with maxxed vulture pilot ive fit plenty of drakes and that seems a little much for anything more than a fairytale full passive fit i can easily see that with active hardeners
if something becomes a problem technology should be developed to counter it this is military and technologicial developement and evolution if titans become a problem similar to your projection then a titan killer ship or mechanism should be developed this would be adding to the game instead of subtracting from itnerfing a ship or module etc invariably ticks the subscribers off an addition to the game has a greater potential for pleasing the subscribers though not all as well as presenting a cure for the problemwindjammer
youre right there isnt a perfect ratio but that doesnt mean the we dont build our empire or set up infrastructure like you suggest its simply not true and i owe it to our logistics to defend themok not for everybody it will make it more fun for goons and probably many other 00 alliances no it wont affect anyone in empire but empire works  concord shoots people drugs are illegal people can participate in factional warfare and there are no huge obstacles to accomplishing objectives other than skill points and isk00 is broken and were trying to fix the mechanics of the space in which we play one step at a time just like the small percentage of explorers want their own special ship etc everyone wants new toys we think this one will be cool you are absolutely correct that we are lobbying for a change that we think will be good for the game i really dont think we are wrong for doing so
thats it thats what you base your allegations on this is what you present as proof of what ccp had in mind this single paragraph out of a single blogthat was an extremely brief and very generalized description of upcoming classes of ships from over three and a half years ago essentially an upcoming attractions list that was in the process of developement at that time they hadnt even finalized what they were going to make the ships capable of thats what is meant when someone says something is in the pipeline and why oveur wouldnt go into details when oveur writes planned to be as close to a station as can be doesnt it occur to you that he had some restrictions in mindno mention at all of course that a dev believes the doomsday devices were a mistake much less the worst mistake ccp ever madewindjammer
talk to hammerhead about that one i believe
too bad in lag eve does weird things and such restrictions wont be observed by the game
hah wow you are making yourself difficult to take seriously buddy friend guyi know you hate goons with a fiery passion you prove so with ever post even ones that have nothing to do with goons which means youre probably jades posting altbut my god nobody can be that spastic please tell me youre roleplaying
i have not once suggested that goonswarm doesnt build empire or set up infrastructure not directly not indirectly not by inference and not anywhere in any forums or communication through any medium of any kind what i did say regarding goonswarm was they tend to spread out a lot rather than build an empire in any one place they are oriented toward destruction rather than building poss and outposts thats a far cry from saying you dont build your empire or set up infrastrucutre at all it merely points to the preferences of the majority of your membership and as a result where the majority of your resources are directedid find more comfort in your assertion if i saw any evidence that other alliances agreed with you when you say it would make 00 more fun how about some that are smaller than your own and have different orientations say a smaller alliance thats set down roots and is trying to defend itself from a goonswarm or bob assault as to making things more fun for goons no doubti have no objection to new toys none at all i love new toys i seek out new toys i want new toys however i do not want those new toys to give a disastrous advantage to one group or the other i think banes suggestion will do that in favor of large alliances besides eliminating the doomsday devices is not a new toy its taking away a toy i have firm views regarding people trying to take away my toyswindjammer
too many titans in game if it were just 5 or 6 it would be fine but theres simply too many to keep them how they are
youve lead a sheltered life the facts of life are there are a lot of people who dont like goonswarm jade is in good companybut youre right the real way to make people take me seriously is to post as you have donewindjammer
absolutely this is an excellent ideamy own two cents id like to see titans with two major viable configurations either as a mobile station as you suggest or as a superdread with more than 3 capitalsize turretslaunchers and a siege mode that increases damage and effective hp like a dread but also increases the efficiency or speed of refining  manufacturing  etcthere are a lot of interesting directions you could take the titan  definitely its worth exploring
this is an interesting direction  the ability to fit a siege module triage module industry module and the station module  just one at a time and takes some amount of resources to reconfigurei think you have the right idea  maybe not stations or anything yet but it is worth exploring id be willing to make that trade  but ill be carefully speaking for myself this time as wj has correctly pointed out previously 
agreed
that sounds pretty awesome to me really im sick of the big stagnant alliances hiding under thier cynojammers constantly camping gates and playing defense eve should be about the offensive about the roam about the fights its one of the leading pvp mmos afterall isnt it what this would do effectively would be to make the titan encourage the fight rather than discourage it dont believe mecurrent day scenario enemy fleet has a titancurrent day reaction jump into the hostile fleet half our size are you nuts they have a titantheoretical scenario enemy fleet just parked a titan in outpost mode 4 jumps from our alliances home systemtheoreetical reaction are they nuts x up everyone now this is probably biased ill give you that but that doesnt it make it unrealistic fact is that in its current state theres nothing unrealistic about the current day scenario any future titan that encourages a fight is one ill support
tbh i was very surprised to find this  no its not an alt 
its amazing how fun things can be when you arent dodging doomsdays every 6 minutes
windjammer what do you suggest be done when an alliance or coalition of alliances reaches the titan saturation point  enough titans to dd a dread fleet to structure or dead  making it extremely costly if not impossible to kill a pos
im a programmer and its emminantly possible for example if there are people inside the titan and there is a session change then the titan wont have a position so the system will poll until its got a position again or if the first thing thats updated on a session change is the position  which seems likely given that if you discon during jumping you end up in the destination system  then the person pops out there either way your first point is a nonissueyour second point is also a nonissue that i can see just have the people inside who are disconnected have a position 1000000km from where the ship blew up  instant emergency warp call it a shotgun emergency exit system or something but its possible then anyone who is logged in can just use the usual leavingstation mechanics in that they appear from the wreckage at a random angle at full speedthis is a brilliant suggestion but if youre going to mention docking then you need to bring in the mothership  after all thats what its designed for by all means have it on a titan but itll have to have something else that a mothership doesntwhen i first heard about the motherships i couldnt dream of anything more exciting that flying around in one with my corp inside it proper logistic support  for mining ops warp in everyone ships out and mines and brings the loot back for combat warp in everyone ships out and shoots the hell out of everythingi fully truly utterly support this idea and will quite happily challenge anyone who uses bad logic or doesnt think outside the box about this especially if they claim it cant be done programmatically  the programmer doesnt dictate what can and cant be done at that level they are just told to do  at least i am  
i agree and disagree at the same time i understand the want to remove dd but imo i think titans should have at least 12 high slots  lol  if you remove dds titans are really stupid without the dd because they cant fit any sort of dps yes they can fit about the same dps as two dreads but two dreads cost a lot less then one titan and most of the titans other special skills are wasted because of a lack of high spotsi mean these are going to have to be serious factories or refineries in order for titans to be worth the cost
personally i enjoy the challenge of beating something difficult even if you have to lose a few times to do it it makes the victory all the more sweetthen again i would say that wouldnt i i am an ebil bob who wants to protect my titan fleet because we are the only alliance with them rightbasically i would rather face a tough challenge rather than just be a challenged individualwhats the point of being david if goliath suddenly becomes a diminutive goat farmer with a lame leg and poor visionthere is a real rush when you think you might kill a titan rather than say shooting a pos or station services and that is a level of fun and excitement not found in other gamesthe op is a fantastic work of fiction and i especially liked the speaking for the playerbase writing style but i fear that is all it isnow if bane produces a survey completed by all 00 players showing that they overwhelmingly support changing titans in to glorified rorquals then ill graciously accept his positionuntil then im just going to have to believe he is trying to push his alliances agenda of nerfing that which they are unable to effectively use  againim not saying that the titan as a class of vessel is above balancing because it isnt however i am against getting rid of things that are hard to overcome because without challenge where is the fun
good point a better first step may be to examine the cynojammerjumpbridge phenomenon and then see if it is enough of a change or if ddd is still too much
we have enough antifrigate platforms alreadyhow about a frigate launching platform instead
well im with you with the challenge part titans will always be a challenge to kill imo unless dreads become the new frigatethe ddd on the other hand isnt really a challenge if youve got a fast ship you can dodge it if you dont and you arent aligned gbyeafter weeks of production and hours of planning and organization people expect a real fight where they can shoot peoplea lot of people like to make this a goon vs bob issue well thank you so much i had no idea i was so influential that i warrant the existence of such an op button im getting a big head hereas far as antiblobs are concerned ddd is very effective after having those hours of preparation and weeks of production skidooshd in seconds by a single button press most people just log out dissatisfied no matter what alliance youre ingetting blown up by a ddd was neato the first hundred times but the novelty has worn off we get it theyre big theyre giant s wow they cost a lot i guess because they cost so much that its ok that they ruin an entire fleet fight and cause hundreds of people to log offits not even frustrating anymore oh i died to a titan again welp this is dumb time to go ride bikes maybe try again tomorrow
the real issue with titans is two fold  what is its role and the doomsdayweaponsalpha strike is bad has been ccps catch cry for battleships yet they then allowed a massive alpha striking area of effect weapon remove the area of effect and make it a targettable single strike alpha with a 250km range make each doomsday shot have a slow rate of fire but lessen the cost of each doomsday then a titan fleet can be a massive anti capital platform but if not supported properly its going to diegive titans a carriers drone capability that way it can also deal with battleships provided it is supportedrole titans are the ultimate logistics platform they are meant to be mobile stations however a mobile station must be anchored for it to be used as a stationthat is make titans work just like a station only when they have been anchored on a planet then you can set them up for jump cloning manufacturing reprocessing and market but station mode is very different from jump mode when not in station mode they are simply capital ships with no additional capabilitiesthis also means that anchoring a titan creates a sovreignty contested situation where a sov level 4 system is downgraded into sov level 0 within 7 daysthe downside is the titan in station mode can have its services degraded through killing them and just like a station will be in the future you can strip it if it is undefendedcyno jammerscyno jammers should require more cpu and power so that attacking a cyno jamming tower is not a slaughter house by all means allow for a weapon spammed tower but the present towers are simply too powerfuljump bridgesjump bridges should only permit freighter class capital ships to use them that way if you wish to get capitals into a cyno jammed system you have to take down the cyno jammer the present system means that the defenders advantage is far too strong
good point  when titans are not in station mode they can still be viable weapons and vice versa dunno about your sovereignty idea though
weapons  i can understand the overwhelming power of the dd but i dont think it should be totally nerfed down from aoe id agree with a lot of other folks who have suggested a script for directing it then it could be both depending on the situationi also suggest during most of these antititan discussions that the aoe should leave a residual charge basically stacking penalties for firing too many too often then people wont deploy a dozen titans in a single fight when the first couple will have reduced the dd usefulnesstitans using fighters would be interesting but ultimately would defeat the point of bringing a carrier in the first place titans are supposed to be a part of a fleet not replacing several parts by themselves so no drones imorole  i agree they are supposed to be logistical titans were once the best fleet support but theyve since become fleet annihilationi could definately see a couple approaches to correcting that matter1  the aoe dd can only be fired from the standard ship configuration with the stacking penalty above thatll give them one shot and then they are basically reduced to a massive gang booster2  make them a mobile station but they dont have to find a planet to do it basically they siege into a station becoming rooted in place for the duration while in station configuration they can use the directed dd provided they can still fuel the thing remember that a dd takes a lot of materials to fire off3  also they can provide protection while in station mode their typical shields can extend to cover nearby craft thats not to say they gain the ungodly amounts of shields that a pos has but while their shields last they can cover their allies when the opponents break your shields and start getting into the titans armor then the covered ships are vulnerable once again no reinforced mode for these guysas for the many debates about docking with a titan and database conflicts dont allow docking make them function like a pos in that you can do some of the same functions while in close proximity rearrange modules get repaired  via remote reppers  and establish clones but actually docking seems to be too much of a hassle according to everyone else
would certainly be cooler  and more interactivity would require more attention and demand less afk
how about if you dont watch some certain reactions it can create an explosion that can do some damage to your ship and or modsthere be some risk
sounds like a good idea ties in well with another idea i had involving the possibility of traces of some of the metallic elements being found in addition to the oresso for example you might find 10 veldspar asteroids of reasonable purity  10000 veldspar each  along with a few with traces  up to 100 units  of the more common elemental moon minerals  like tungstentitaniumcobalt  of course mining these asteroids would be a hazardous prospect theres a reason why moon mining is done from thousands of kilometres away in orbit using a strip miner on these roids would destroy the elements and deal damage directly to the strip miner module proportional to the volatility of the element in question in order to get at these elements youd need to go in with lighter ships equipped with more precision lasers  standard beams instead of strip miners youd still need a pos to turn these elements into something useful
yes thats actually a great idea i like it very much it gives them something to look for tweak certain systems or use some sort of timing to capture rare minerals it will give the miners a step up above the macros to allow them to compete i think the damage could be repaired with paste possibly if the adverse reaction is not as severe i also think there should be a possibility of actual ship damage and rare catastrophic reactions ofc this would be commensurate with the rare mins you are trying to capturei support this and the direction your are taking
mining need to be less interactive thankyou very muchits already an activity i engage in as a fallback when i cant devote 100 attention to combat  eg when im ironing vacuuming washing dishes  the fact that my retriever still needs my attention every 90 seconds is annoying im itching to get into a hulk so i can actually finish my ironing before having to look at the computer againperhaps some enhancement to mining to allow clicking buttons in the ui to translate to higher yields or more mineral per cubic metre of ore or some suchplease dont take away my afk income earning potential 
trollingflame bait support nice
if im at the keyboard ill pursue mission running as an isk generating activity anyone who thinks mining is actually a viable income generator either hasnt tried mining or hasnt tried anything else except mining mining npc ships is far more lucrative than mining asteroids especially considering the hefty skillpoint investment required to become productive in mining  ie flying a hulk in a fleet with boosters  versus the same level of productivity in missionrunning  ie flying a drake  dps duo for the level of reward that mining produces it needs to require much less attention than missionrunning im almost at that level now  i can suck asteroids dry almost as fast as i can target them especially considering that strip miners take three minutes to excavate 12000 units from a veldspar asteroid which may only have 18000 units of oreto make mining more interactive just produce asteroid belts full of more smaller asteroids then the miner has to be continually targeting a new asteroid and running one cycle leaving up to 11000 units of ore for the next person to come along with their mining frigate or cruiser and finish the jobif you want to try out the sheer frustration of the exploding asteroid idea find someone whos running a blockade mission and try mining the asteroids in that deadspace good lucki do support the idea of having activities that a miner can participate in which will improve the productivity of mining above the afk mining baseline without having to engage in combat while flying a mining bargehaving event occur that require the miner to react in some way or suffer damage to their ship will only lead to frustration as bored halfasleep miners end up getting their mining fleets killed heck theres also the possibility of goonswarm miners intentionally triggering damage events to grief the newbies in the asteroid belt who are still flying frigates and cruiserswhat about the folks flying industrials with mining lasers while theyre off cooking dinner or watching a moviemining is a boring activity already requiring more interaction with a boring activity does not make it an interesting activity it merely makes it a boring and tedious activity
quoted for truthim not completely hostile to this idea with a bit of development it could make life a little more bearable for miners  in the sense of giving them something to do  your suggestions would pretty much put a stop to afk mining or even readingabookatthesametime mining of course its debatable whether or not afk mining was the original intention but this is the real world and people will use whats given in the way that benefits them the moston the surface i think you have some good ideas there but it would perhaps be better to make them optional instead of forcing players to watch the screen like a hawk simply reward those who have a reason to stay at their desks with a greater intakeefficiency
have the interactive mining reward those who take part in it and leave afk mining aloneif people want to take part in tedium to speed up their mining go right on ahead as long as this is an optional and nonmandatory method of increasing ones mining yield i will support itas it stands i will not
in a way this idea doesnt really penalise afk industrial miners all they need to do is find an asteroid bigger than their cargohold with their scanner then chip away with their standard mining lasers their beams will shut off once their hold is full you could even do this with smaller asteroids though you would need to lookout at the end of your cycles to make sure that youre not just mining rock youd even get a slight bonus if you find an asteroid with impurities  moon materials  as the standard beams arent strong enough to destroy the impurities and so wont trigger the destruction of themwith strip miners its a little harder as youd need to find multiple pure rocks first before activating your beams the asteroids with the moon minerals would be clearly marked upon surveying them and would be reasonably rare activating a strip miner on these asteroids would result in all the moon minerals being destroyed and possibly 12 damage to the strip miner module not the ship as it tries to mine something its not designed to process once the minerals are gone one way or another these asteroids will behave just like any other asteroid enough that if you continually mine such asteroids  say by using a macro program  your strip miners will eventually offline through damage a human miner on the other hand will know that the impurities are there and so be able to avoid these asteroids with strip minersthis gives a larger role to mining frigates for example as fast prospector ships scanning asteroids to find suitable rocks for their larger slower compatriots in the mining barges meanwhile if they locate an asteroid with impurities they can mine them directly to pull off the moon minerals thus making them safe for the bargesthe challenge in this isnt in the mining its in the prospecting for the good asteroids

didnt one of your glorious cohorts referred to eve as serious business very seriously i might add but no matter i am not getting angry with at the video game eve is a hobby i like playing it and when someone like you with the help of your alliance who are hell bent on ruining eve worm themselves into the csm where they can affect the state of my gameplay well then it would make me upset so bane go preach to your choir of goons and sell crazy someplace else we are all stocked up here one cannot maintain a veil of indifference or ambivalent neutrality  while being a leader of scamming griefing gang of scoundrels with admitted goal of making eve unplayable wait arent you a leader in goonswarm so forgive me while i look on everything you and your mates do in game or to the game with extreme suspicion
well delos couldnt you insert about any other name or organization that has been or currently in eve that does pretty much the same thing based on your point of view ofc i do not see what they say or do to be any different than any of the other alliances corp or individual dating back to the release of this game i guess i am being naivete about all this i looked at the csm and all that it entails as a group or rl players that possibly would drop the bull at the door and focus on whats important and i would hope that the players would do the same while working on possible solutions or changesbut maybe i expect too much out of people to actually look past their own noses
farrqua my issue is not with people who are able to drop the bull at the door but with people who have consistently exhibited views of animus toward the game i would trust a biggest scammer in game to be part of csm so long as his activities stay in game and benefit the game and were never found to be contrary to the game mechanic like hacking the game which goons have done like hacking ts which goons have done like proclaiming from the highest mountain that whatever they do from now on will be to ruin the game as it happened after they accused sharkbait of doing stuff to their pos if goons were just a bunch of raucous scamartists who ran around and fought all day because they actually enjoy the game and made it their character vs people who have said a number of times that they are out to ruin the experience for the rest of the playerbase i would not doubt them i would not say a word but when proven time after time to use every underhanded mechanic they can find from crashing the forums with their threadnaught to hacking the client or ts servers no this should not be overlooked and should not be forgotten because at this point their representative is part of the csm and is able to fullfill the promise of ruining the game by trying and influence the way thing goso you can look down on me all you want and bain and goons can poke fun at me all they want but it would not change the fundamental fact that we can not trust someone who is a leader in an organization that selfadmittedly wants to ruin the game for the majority of the players no matter the cost we can listen to what they have to say but we have to look at it with some suspicion and take what they say with a grain of salt just to be sure there is not underhandedness in the works that is all
delosapparently you have issues to grind with them and i wish you luck with that i am backing out of this little rant because i can recognize the signs the same signs i see from my kids when they have some kind of obsessive view about something that no one can actually reason with  and dont worry i am not calling you immature the kids i am reffering two in college and two in high school so enjoy your game dude
just to keep reminding about these votes take a vote in the general channel after these changes are on test for a solid two or three weeks

nice spam and so whats your point with all the doesnt represent us stuff
im assuming theyre a parody of the people involved in rp brothels thread
yea i am aware of that just asking what the point was
to make a funny parody i guess it does drive a point across how the ot was pretty dumbexplaining it makes it funny
people spamming the assembly hall shouldnt be allowed to post here
well that essentially wipes out everyone everybody does it one way or another
bitter players involved in forum spamming shouldnt be allowed to post on eveo anymore
u fail
players involved with eve should not represent us to ccp
everyone then
this was my pointpeople could argue day and night over aspects of gameplaywe dont want pirates representing us or the game will end up with more pirate activities and buffswe dont want care bearswe dont want minerswe dont want explorersthere is never going to be a single group of people that represent the whole player base
wait but i still dont get it
fortunately ccp was wise enough to release that no one player could represent the whole player base thats why we got a council of nine each of which represent different bits of the player base none of us are supposed to be selfeffacing paragons of sacrificial humility  were just eve players who enjoy different bits of the game and our combined opinions and votes represent a decent straw poll of the player base thats the bottom line
how about were tired of hearing people complain about this csm or that dev not representing all the players of eveno this isnt just about the gripe over jade nor is it just about the gripe over nozh its about peopleas much as i cant stand ccp for their lethargic approach to fixes at least there are people trying to get things done sure the nos nerf made them useless but at least there was an attempt sure theyll probably make nanos even more annoying but itll be different than it is now and theyll probably extend the titan ddd to encompass several au before they actually take the hint and make it more restricted instead but there are still people listening and attempting to do something about itim just tired of seeing people btch that their voices arent heard only to btch when a system is put in place to finally allow them that voicecsm were elected so put yourself up as a candidate next time if you think you can do betterisd are volunteers so volunteer yourself if you think you can do betterdevs are well we cant exactly step up and take the reins entirely now can we
i never said that they shouldnt fix the problem but i see the problem having less to do with the various modules skills and implants you use to get the ship to go really fast but rather a fundamental flaw in the game mechanisms for example one flaw is the whole design of webbers the idea is good in principle but the fact is it effects slow ships greatly and fast ships nearly not at allthe problem is of course math reducing the speed by a percentile value by 90 currently works like normalspeed  normalspeed09 the following is a table of that10  120  240  480  8160  16320  32640  641280  1282560  2565120  512normalspeedwebbed speedthe fastest nanoed ships when webbed still go foolishly fast so heres an idea rather then multipling it by a percentile why not take the square root of the original speed and turn that into the webbed speedlook what happens10  31622776620  447213595540  63245553280  894427191160  1264911064320  1788854382640  25298221281280  35777087642560  50596442565120  7155417528normal speedsquarerootwebbed speedsuddenly really fast ships are going really slow but you see the only way to create these numbers is to address the underlying issue which has to do with the way the webber subtracts a percentile of the original speed which works fine for slow ships not so well for fast shipsthis is just one example of how you could fix the issue by fixing or changing the fundamental problems that arise in any game i havent looked that closely at other modules but i imagine its there are similar or at least other fundamental problems across the board that im just not picking up on
yea thanks for listening but next time dont listen to the noobs d
i think ccp nozh is doing a great job  and ive slammed nano whiners for as long as i can remember did any of you guys read the first line of his dev blog in yellow italic lettering it states attention the modifications discussed below are all subject to change based on player input and testing experience his dev blog was well written and he showed exactly why he want changes to be made some of his reasoning was a bit off and i dont think he has a 100 understanding of nanotactics but he does have some understanding and is simply throwing out a fix and will tweak this fix until the game is how he wants it to be much better than most of the dev blogs posted i say good job ccp nozh dont listen to any of these dorky whiners
itll be too late by then anyway i am supporting this thread
yay maths has everyone here read goumindongs web ideas them or some variation would be much better than the proposed mega nerf
the biggest problem is that even more speed is an effective counter to speed no web modification wihtout unlimited range will work on the fastest nanos because you simply cant catch them there needs to be something that at most 34 slow ships in a gange can do to catch a single target he can still  them up if his ship is better and what not but they need to be able to catchhit him this is comparison of similar level ships mind you 4 t1 frigates catching a nano t2 frigate should get vaporized even if they catch it
posting in a thread started by a tool
its a good idea but im still worried about percents natural inability to effect fast ships
lets get ccp nozh an eve online account maybe
havent heard too much from the swiss army knife of eve dev maybe this blog will deep six this guys cred as it very well should
it is true that nozh makes zulupark look like some kind of incredible genius compared

first off i would like to say fw has put the fun back in eve for me i was going to quit this game until i joined fw on the 2nd day it was released i play eve for the pvp and i know that others may have different opinions which i respect after experiencing pirate pvp 00 pos warfare pvp and 00 roaming i have found faction warfare to be the most playable and fun form of pvp in the game the first and foremost point i would like to stress is that faction warfare should not be viewed as a stepping stone to 00 personally it is my end game destination if it is viewed as a temporary place for players than the system of fw will be inherently brokenthe very first thing that needs to be changed within the faction warefare is the ranking system now i am aware that rewards are being added next patch however it is the audience that will not be receiving these rewards that needs to be examined the epitome of this point is battleship pilots while they fly the most expensive base ships and form the backbone of any powerful fleet those skilled pilots get little to none of the reward while any t1 frig with an mwd can farm plexes and rank up quickly to give you an idea of the ranking system i as an fc with 5 major battle victories and 0 losses in the past week alone am ranked as a second leutenet or the 2nd lowest rank of fw a player in a t1 frig who sotle 4 90 capped plexes while my fleet protected him from a 30 man fleet and lost 3 good ships is the highest rank in fw and after then next patch will be able to purchase the best fw ships next patchfw is alot of fun granted however it can not sustain itself the loot from pve and pvp isnt enough to buy pilots back their lost ships and with alliances war decking corps it is hard to mission which frankly pvpers dont want to do anyway a possible solution is either adding bounties to enemy pilots and npcs or giving rank up for kills of the enemy faction i could understand that the system calls for mission running or mining to fuel isk needs of faction pvpers but the fact that these pvpers get no bonus to the faction is ridiculous it would seem that the unpredictable enemy players of the opposing faction would be the most rewarded for killing however the predictable enemy npcs yields the faction reward as where the enemy player yields absolutely nothing in the way of factional rewardsi do not think the problem is that fw was poorly thought out i just think it evolved into something much more than previous ccp expectations clearly end game players will be participating in it and be rewarded as such what was meant to be a stepping stone for pve players transitioning into pvp has become the most competitive active and fun pvp in the whole of the game please ccp give the pvpers faction rewards and credit
we should have an approval system for rewards such that after a fleet engagement or operation is completed the fc can approve all of the rewards to be given the the fleet pilots engaged in that operationthis way every pilot who deservedly achieves a reward for playing their part in the engagement can be motivated to continue doing so if rewards are to be given based on killmails then the logistics and support pilots  such as scouts  are left out in the cold
oops i posted with my alt streets sally this is my main james drakeson
damnit yeah you get the point
respectfully im not sure i agree pvp already has some significant rewards in facwar  its a lot more exciting interesting and adrenalinepumping than how to dodge or demolish npcs within a specific ship constraintranks are given out for people who are willing to grind plexes and flip systems killboard stats and loot are given out for people who are willing to hunt the plexerstheres a balance therei respect that battleships arent getting the use in facwar they might elsewhere  since they can get into only 25 of the plexes  but im not sure thats a bad thing eitherive been playing for two years and ive never put as much serious time and thought into the finer points of fitting a catalyst as i have in the last month nor have i carefully compared the merits of the catalyst vs the coercer the thrasher and the cormorant as i have recently tightening the restrictions on what can enter a plex forces a lot more variety in ships entering the field and dare i say it even the faction frigs have a new lease on life less battleships in plexes means a lot more fleet variety  and pvprs having to think more creatively means more fun for everyonefacwar is an excellent system and there are things that might need examination  like how defense of l4 plexes requires a naked atron heh  but im not sure the rank rewards are amongst them plexers get rank pvprs get killboard glory and everyone has to fly something a little less common win  
the broken mechanics are not just about battleships however hard you try to cover that up with your agendawe are trying to fine tune the rewards that fw gives to all pilots involved currently there is no incentive for pvprs other than a killmail that is sad
edit because i was tired when i first wrote this and needed to clarifypart of the issue is that factional warfare is an end game option for players just like level 4 missions are the end game option for some players corporations taking part in fw are similar to corporations in pvp alliances without all the benefits of alliance mechanics or the possible industrial corporations utilizing the space using the space you are defending pilots taking part in fw are defending space on the behalf of an npc entity and thus can not highly suggest the npc entity provide them with iskships to defend themi would like to say that yes there should be rewards for engaging in pvp on behalf of a npc entity the pilots are putting themselves and their property at risk for the good of the npc entity and deserve some reward for doing so presumably in 00 the pvpers defending industrial operations get a reward of some kindi do not think the pvp rewards should be tied directly to the militia rank the militia corporations  24th tlf stpro  fdu  have objectives they have laid out complexes and missions and completing these objectives earns you standing with them and the militia rank how many ships of your fellow pod pilots you killed is not a huge concern of theirs they want you to defend their space and attack their enemies as a reward for pvping i suggest a new decoration be developed that rewards pvpers as you progress it provides an additional reward  possibly faction standing or maybe it should be militia corp standing and thus rank the progression will be slower than capturing complexesace decoration ideaa decoration option for pvp  the acefor example lets take the classic idea of the ace each nation has its aces these individuals may not be the highest ranks but they are experienced combat pilots and are decorated for their contribution to the war effort when a pilot is listed as dealing the most damage on a kill he is receives a confirmed kill if the pilot participated in but was not the main damage dealer they get 25 confirmed kill this is only against opposing militiarookie  0 combat kills the pilot has yet to be tested by his peers in combatbloodied  1 combat kill this pilot has had a taste for combat but not much more than a skirmishveteran  3 combat kills this pilot has seen combat several times or been part of a major battleace  5 combat kills this pilot has made a name for himself opposing forces should be wary when he takes to the fieldmultiple ace  for each successive set of 5 kills a pilot receives a device that is added to his ace decoration
i agree with that system dex set them to a threat level and give them maybe lps and standings but not necessarily rank upgrades or at least slower rank upgradesthis would encourage the pvpers wanting rank to also set aside some time to find and flip coins  capture plexes 
the kill board is not tethered to anything in game i do not get isk for my kill board standings or get the option to buy new ships it is not a reward nor a realistic means of ranking anyone and the loot while fairly valuable at times is still not in any way tied to the way i am viewed by the militia i am a part of i think that devs need to give rewards within the game for faction pvp kills by rewards either isk per ship type or and this is the more realistic one points towards ranking up i agree with dex but the only thing that bothers me is that come patch time plexers will have a bunch of new faction ships to purchase while the pvpers who are taking part in the more difficult and unpredictable and many times more dangerous combat will not have the option to receive anything
i concur rewards need to be given out for kills in fw maybe lp based on size of ship or something
this is an important point but giving the entire fleet the reward isnt fair especially if everyone is spreading out pvp kill rewards and some sort of plex sharing would help
i do agree with that however i think that scouts remote repars and ewar should not be left out of the the loop as far as gaining lp
1 could we get a link to a dev postinterviewetc to this effect if there is any regarding those with already high militia standing receiving significant lpiskship rewards based on their work to that point2 those doing faction militia missions are currently the only ones gaining lp reward and thus access to those ships but even then it takes quiet a bit of effort and collecting the loottags from the npcs in missions and plexes to get ships from the lp storemy current guess is that the lp for capturing plexes  if any is implemented  will not be retrograde the advantage that the high ranking characters will have is access to l4 militia missions which no one is going to run because you seriously need 35 battleships plus various support  2 ceptors maybe a few sniping hacs some destroyers etc  to make it feasible plenty of characters with 000 standing with the militia corps can get access to those missions because they have 600 faction standingall that being said it would still be beneficial for the game as a whole  to include possible future corp or alliance decoration system  if pod v pod combat pilots could be recognized in some way in gameat this point i am going to give my support to the discussion going on because i agree that recognition for pvp performance is needed and it will hopefully close the gap between pve and pvp in fw additional ideas have lpmilitia rewards that require a mixture of achievements like contribute to 100 vp be on 5 killmails against opposing faction and 10000 lp achieving any one requirement may not take much effort depending on your play style  plex roamcamp mission  but achieving all 3 means you are taking part in the overall war effortalso would be cool to see decorations for corporations who show outstanding performance when it comes to supporting their faction these might include campaign ribbons for performance in various regions  corp achieves  kills and gets  vp in region  defense decorations  corp achieves  vp and  kills defending systems of the sovereignty they are loyal to  offensive decorations  corp gets  vp and  kills in opposing faction systems  and any others that could be come up with out of the data collecteddecorations provide an opportunity to recognize the efforts a multitude of play styles and achievements in game i suspect many players will work their butts off to get those decorations

but your working off of chaos theory with the concept of balance and game development here are some of the laws no game designer whether its one or a thousand can see the results of every piece of code and every usage of that code this is the primary principle of hacking with any complex coding there will be unexpected events and sometimes they will have no discernible reason at all the moment a game designer goes over six months without releasing new content they lose gamers as the game is believed to be stagnant and dying not that its a fact but perception is reality any time you put thousands and tens of thousands and millions of players using a game  or any code and program  they will push it to the very limits designers can either allow these exploits and change their viewpoint around them  as what has happened with jet can mining  or they can change the basic rules of the game to fix the exploit you will never please everyone as each player feels his viewpoint is the right way every changecorrectionaddition you make will face more criticism from a group of people who are generally immature pushy and secure behind a wall of anonymity you dont make players happy you just try to give them a strong productwhat your asking for because of the reasons above it doesnt work the game is what you make it you dont make the game
balance is an ongoing process forevermore to make balance easier they need to reduce the game to two objects and monitor them closely as to prevent the red item from gaining favors over the blue item now tell me youd pay for thiswhat id support here is a thumbs down option
a successful game does both at the same time  introduces new features in blocks while dynamically balancing mechanics for fair play they are quite capable of doing both simultaneously please dont prohibit their creativity
balance play pong we all know the right side controller won every game anyhow even it was unbalanced i think its a conspiracy
balance and content are worked by different teams simply increasing the size of one team provides diminishing returns even negatively affecting progress

if everyone wants to have missile training time increased then missiles should obviously be buffed to compensate for the longer training timeswhat most people fail to realize is what these skills grant tech ii gunnery skills grant you a dps bonus through damage tech ii missile skills grant you a rate of fire bonus that increases your dps by 18 at level 4 it isnt really that amazing is it a 2 rate of fire bonus vs a 3 dps bonus id rather have each of my missiles do more damage then have to waste more of them to try to achieve the dps turrets are able to dish outmissiles are not the omgwtf op weapon systems people give them credit to be theyre hardly passable in pvp sans some very special circumstances and theyre only used in pve due to being able to choose your damage type and yet caldari ships are still pigeonholed into using mainly kinetic or they have a wasted bonususing missiles in pve is as fun as pulling teeth they fly so slowly that it takes forever for them to get to their targets you often waste an entire volley of missiles because they dont impact and do damage before you start to fire again and all those missiles are lost missiles tend to not always reach their target in the first place their maximum range is a joke considering that it depends on how quickly they accelerate if they accelerate slowly then normal they wont reach their maximum distanceyes missiles do damage no matter the range but the weapon systems firing rate is slow can be very unreliable as the ranges increase and have to fly to their targets to do damageturrets rate of fire is much faster their damage is instant once you get into your optimal if you know about transversal velocity youll be able to do some great dpsoverall turret systems take more skill points because theyre more complex and more rewarding while missiles generally are pve and are stressful to use despite being mostly effectivealso ever notice that almost every faction uses defender missiles not every faction uses ecm vs turrets
ok heres my take on iti have two characters one is minmatar and cannot use missiles  just rockets one is caldari and can use bothwhile it may be easier to train one single type of missile up to t2 it is not easier to train both the short and long range versions to t2for instance even if i trained up torps 5 while you trained large hybridprojlaser you would only need to plug in the two spec skills to be able to use rails and blasters  or artyautos beamspulses  for me to use t2 cruise missiles i would have to train cruises to 5 as wellalso i would have to train heavies hams standards and rockets independently so the facts are that it takes missile users longer to skill up to be effective also missile support skills are longer to trainthe real reason for missiles to train the way they are is because they are rarely a primary weapon system take the typhoon for instanceare you telling me that typhoon pilots should have to train up through the projectile weapon tree then train for every single missile type on top of that just so they can use t2 weapons in all slots same for gallente recons and stealth bomberstry to think beyond your little world please and allow the rest of us to enjoy eve
i think all weapons systems should be exactly the same lets just reskin hybrid turrets to look like missile launchers reskin antimatter ammo to look like cruises and have the exact same skills now everyone is happy and identical
we can be cruel to devs sometimes it can be warranted one of the reasons for this is a lack of faith whether well founded or not that ccp are actually looking at the game from the same way we dowhat id like to see is some devs sent out into the wild and then returning with a series of dev blogs detailing their experiences and how they feel the game works this facilitates more relevant and accurate debate around the shaping of the gameim well aware that devs play eve but does the forum admins experience with pirating ever get to the dev in charge of balancing ears and are all the devs working in balancing actually motsu mission runners the hope is that we all might learn somethinghow community and csm assemble a short list of corps representing all walks of eve life csm approaches corps to determine willingness to participate if the corp is happy a character is rolled up and joins the corp as a regular player character and not as a recognizable dev character  to the rest of eve that is as it would be rather naive to assume everyone in said corp wouldnt know whats going on dev spends one month flying with the corpia sign off on no wrongdoing during the period character gets biomassedcsm interviews dev on his experiences possibly in the shape of a live dev blog with player submitted questionsinterview posted as dev blog including all information such as corporation flown withwe get to see how ingame play influences change devs get to see how mechanics influence play possibly from a viewpoint they wouldnt be able to otherwise
from what ive gathered over the years devs tend to be more into the pirating the large 00 alliances and the large and small scale pvpi guess the bigger question is if they have the same idea for how eve should work as we do the answer is simple even the playerbase doesnt agree with how eve should evolve the developers probably all have varying opinions toothe real problem is the fact that players get very upset when they realize that the game they love so much isnt theirs to design and build devs work for a company and as much as they love the game  their own words  they also market it to a very broad audience and have lots of agendas and plans that dont make sense to the average playerwhen you realize that your buying a product not contracting a service it helps it does for me at least when you buy a product the product is made and you get what you get if you dont like it you either return it or throw it outbut when you contract a service like paying a construction company to build you a house you usually have some say in how the thing your purchasing will come out we get confused with mmos because the paybymonth gives us the feeling that we are contracting which is falseyour rights as the consumer is to either pay for the game each month or not so many forget that sure you can help them test out changes you can profer ideas but itll never be your game to make and shape nor any other players only the developers and the developers bossesthe idea you posted is sincere im sure but im also positive that the guys who code this game play it alot and apparently they cover the entire range of experiences from 00 to high sec the only real advice i can give is that if it doesnt turn out how you like it dont pay for something you dont enjoy
id love to see this in
if you saw what are demos in games such quake3 you should know what ninjaholic is talking aboutit would give a great potential to fan movie makingbut ccp can consider it as a threat cause players will be able to make better movies then ccp
this would give those who wontcant use video capture softhardware a chance to create their own videos also this also allows for replays of battles people can study and thus improve their battlefield tactics uponit would also make for easier distribution of an epic fail moment of an enemy of yours at least you dont have to compress a video of it and upload it to youtube which destroys the quality and viewing pleasure you can just send the record data in an evemail or a shared upload website  rapidshare  and everyone can watch it in full detail on their clients
if this was posted in features and ideas why is it being discussed as an idea in an issues forum good job on the crosspost gtfo
replays from the command central in ambulation where corporations can buy more video storage than the default setting for even more isk sink
and 2x higher optimal per ship class got clue
explosion velocityjust because the missile is fast enough to catch you doesnt mean it is actually going to hurt youexplosion radiusbig nasty missiles dont hurt small cute ships muchhonestly people think
ok i take typhoon with torps will use torps on your crusier will see how much volleys will kill you i suspect around 4
okaythen i get to use a turret based battleship and see if i kill you quickerhint i will
if missiles were impossible to outrun and didnt have those variables like explosion speed and explosion radius and would agree with you sadly for us missile people these variables do exist so i cant say i agree with this kind of nerf thereforeyoure matari a little fairy i think on the eveo boards actually once told me that 1 target painter per ship in a gang using lots of long ranged guns makes nanos go away sadly missile ship gangs dont get this benefit and its still partytime for nanos on them so while missiles dont get hit by weapon disruptors they also dont get as much benefit as guns from tps it evens out
dont see any issue here optimal range of heavies from 80 km gives the target way enough time to warp off before the first missile hits not even to speak about 240km cruise missiles time before it will hit a targetmy experiences with missile in pvp is that 99 of the time the target poped before my first missile did hit it because of the instant damage of the turrets
you can start using missiles and overpowered in the same sentence  which you essentially did just not in these exact words  only after the missile velocities get boosted at least 3x fold until then at 80km range we are looking at 101520 seconds flight time before a missile can actually hit anything in any fight other than a fleet engagement any target would just warp off unless he or she is asleep of courseand complaining about turret optimals is just wrong a rokh can potentially fire beyond grid and beyond targeting range captldr versionno support for this issue
guns are affected by the targets transversal velocity so if the enemy is flying from u away or to u u can fully hit with gunsin such cases if u have big linespeed your missiles dont hitrebalance   everything have advantages and disadvantages live with
erm missiles are supposed to be different to turrets why would we want to make everything the same
its funny that you think this is a problem the further a missile has to travel the less useful it is if you were complaining about their damage at a certain range you might have an argument but as things stand you just look silly more silly than some of your other posts even

i seriously hope a ed yes no shoutingvoting contest on any forum be it csm or another is never going to be a serious factor when the devs try to improve the game easiest way to ruin a good game is to give players too much power in balancing since players tend to be selfcentered shortsighted and outright ignorant some changes need to be made no matter how vocally players oppose them

how would you engineer such a mission to prevent me from warping my mining fleet to that asteroid belt and mining it dry before planting the beacon and completing the missionwould the mission reward be more valuable than the entire contents of that beltwould the agent have new code written in order to allow verifying that the belt does in fact still contain the spawned number of asteroids
well you could do that i guess an interesting variant in that case would be to make it a decent non isk payout given that its a storyline mission  for example faction mining gearimplants  then the agent could give the same mission out to other people with the stipulation that only the first active beacon would gain the mission rewards there may even be a trigger on the reward timer so that you only have a limited time to drop the beacon from when you locate the beltthus its in your own best interests to drop the beacon as soon as you find the belt as other people will be looking for the belt as well and might be able to steal the prize from you by dropping their beacon firstof course if it proves to be to complex to code the mission in such a way you could have a dead beacon at the belt which automatically reactivates when a ship warps to it it would be a struggle to find an in game reason for the beacon to already be there though perhaps an ancient beacon on standby with a proximity sensor from when the belt was initially found centuries ago before the collapse of the eve gate
i had another thought that would really help the dedicated explorer shipgive the ship the ability to select how far to make a jump up to a max of say 35 au this way we could get proper probe coverage on all planets make it to where it only works by jumping from a planet and also have it require an advanced skill call it controlled warp gives 1 au per level of jump per level of skill ship specific this would really add to the the explorer career path and the ship capabilities then if they added more things to do in and exploration sites would would be really having fun stories that lead us to other sites that require a key to even find them from a previous site anything to spice things up why do only unknowns have escalation triggers lets give more reason to be an explorer 
how does the old american saying go i may disagree with your opinions however i will fight to the death for your right to express them thats not it word for word but it is something similiarthis has been debated over and over and over what it comes down to is personal responsibility if you dont like the tv show turn it off you dont have to listen to something you dont want to there is an ignore feature for a reasonyes i find most bigotry distasteful but i would not in any point in time desire to control how people think or feel or even what i believe they should be allowed to say that brings the question who would even decide what would be allowed what if what i think should be allowed is not what you think or vice versa who is right you or iif your brother is gay so what how does that make him any different from me that requires me to treat him special you have a black girlfriend does that mean you are any more special than me why cant i have special treatmenti assume that even though some of my post is a bit sarcastic that you get the idea forcing people to think or speak how you want them to does nothing but turn you into the same kind of personpeople that many races religions genders and so on have been fighting against for centuries
i hate learning skills tbh i have v in all basic and iv in all advanced also 4s in most of the time yet those ivs bug me i want to waste the two months training them despite the fact that i know they will not repay the time spent inside two or three years argh also i think level v skills take too long but i dont think that can really be changed nowinstant 10 to all characters and refunded points spent on learning to spend on whatever we want would be a dream come true of course this will never happen a man can dream though a man can dream

alright i was venting a bit i have made several posts in the devblog discussion thread about why the changes are overdone
i dont believe what the devs decide to test on the test server should be open to the senates issue listespecially whenattention the modifications discussed below are all subject to change based on player input and testing experienceis the very first sentence in the devblog i think jade is just going to further embarrass himself when he brings up the subject with ccp and ccps response isattention the modifications discussed below are all subject to change based on player input and testing experience
good thing there is a 110page thread of players input categorically stating do not want then isnt there
no that thread isnt feedback cause most of those posts were posted before the changes went to sisi and against isnt useful feedbackccp will be looking at this thread for usable feedback as they shouldthe speed rebalance has many different things rolled into itship class speed adjustment which is mostly a universal frigate speedmassagility buff and some cruiser and above speed nerfgeneral speedmassagility module nerf to slow down max speeds universallymixing up tactics with the retinkering of webbers scramblers mwds and absif you think for a second that all of this will be scrapped well i think youd be mistakenif you think the csm is going to provide ccp with anything more useful than the info that is already being given by sisi testers then i think you are mistakenjade intends to use the thread he linked as evidence that 00 sov should be fixed before speed is addressed which from what ive seen very few people share that concernfor most eve players things like speed tanks and ddds are much more important than pos shot mechanics especially now with fw more and more players are getting into pvp and fw doesnt even involve the same type of sov but speed tanks and untrackable nanotanking are major concerns
if all that ccpcsm ever comes up with is ship balancing then im going to get bored with this game before next year rolls around tbh if you dont like a ship dont fly it i would love to see much larger ship selections and yes you will have a few that are horribly underpowered and a few that are overpowered but im sure someone will come up with a way to make the underpowered ship usefull underpowered and overpowered is just a matter of individual perception anyway i would love to see being able to choose between 5 hacs or 7 bs and more diversified ship classes maybe throw in some fun stuff like mine layers and interesting stuff like thati think fussing with balance is futile really balance should create itself period its damn near impossible to make all sides happy especially when there are always 4 or more sides to everything i think it was excellently put about the eft warrior part yes your dps number may be higher than my tank number but that doesnt mean that some other factor such as capacitor or even transversal wont play a role on how our fight goes eve never was never has ben a game of my numbers are better it truly is about strategy placement and who shoots first  sometimes even shoots last  constantly rebalancing ships makes it more of a number game and less of a tactic game if it becomes i can beat you because my numbers are better then im quitting because there are so many strategies to avoid this if hac x and hac y are perfectly balanced then tactics are pointless yes they will decide who wins but if hac x is less powerfull than hac y its a lot more fun to pvp in one of those because its more of a challengelike the ferox for instance everyone tells me a horrible ship but i saw one the other day that took on 2 deimos and clearly had them beat just because he tanked hard enough to stay alive just long enough take one of them out of the fight its this kind of pvp that most people crave myself included sorry for my longwinded repeating monolouge
this wouldnt be a problem if csm had sufficient forum tools and control to better organize thingsthis is generally why i suggested the whole tabled  prioritized  scheduled  addressed organization for sure there are bigger fish to fry than the ferox not having enough pg and if you had the organization that you should have you could table the issue give it a very low priority and deal with the bigger issues firstmaking a council for different facets of the game wouldnt be anymore productive than having many csm teams having many more meetings
what do you suggestedit as in what kind of modules creative names maybe you have a really good idea but your op is too vague to get any response
im thinking along the lines of something like defender missiles but a mid slot item tracking disruptors affect all guns correct so maybe something that will affect 50  dunnojust a number  of missiles fired at you and for the drones something that knocks their targeting lock off but is not affected by ships with bonuses to jamming and only affects drones within xxxx meters of you  less than 10000 im horrible with names
problem is that these arent analogous to tracking disruptors td affect an enemy ship while your proposals affect everything hitting your ship i see where youre going now though and these may workballistic counter measures  xx increase in factor of signature radius of missiles fired at this ship  opposite of guided missile precision skill  would be effective against heavy missiles fired at a frigate but really wouldnt have much effect on light missiles hitting bs for example makes missiles sometimes miss the ships they were intended to hit could be chance based for all missiles that hit your ship 100 or 0 effectivedrone disruption burst  similar to ecm burst disables the offensive capabilities of all drones  hostile and freindly  for 20s can still fly around and can be controlled by their owners but cant fire weapons use ewar repair etc
thats exactly what i was thinking about maybe not as long on the drones but other than thatyouve got itthanks for putting it down better than i could
think missles have been nerfed enough
have you know a caracal or moa to be refferd to as a dps ship while the thorax and rupture arethats the advantage you pay for carcals arent useful for anything
the reason for this disbalance is that turrets are racial guns while missiles can be used by three other races too similar with droneshaving missiles and drones same concept as guns would require too long training times to fly the ships to their full potential
ok bumpeven if new proposed changes to warp scrams go trough that isnt a sufficient thing for gallente recons and eas idea of sensor damps is to force enemy ships to close range  where ideally your blasterships eat them alive  problem is that you can hardly push a unboosted bs under 20km  web range new scram range and that optimal plus falloff on damps is insufficient to say bad things to sniper bses in fleet fights ecms have crazy range and will screw you up if they succeed damps cant even compete in long range ewarimho at least optimall plus falloff of damps should be increased and maybe a minor damp strenght boost per recon or eas skill levelif they have to balance it reduce normal tank and gank on these shipsedit damps should get range increase period but while eas and cov op recon could use a damp strenght if balance is in order perhups force recon could keep current damp strenght or stg

the nerf is to harsh and to much of a change to the way pvp works a change as big as this can completely break pvp as we currently know it and that isnt a good thing

i for one am really dissapointed with ccp on this matter i fly a multitude of ships nano being my ship of choice it has taken me and im sure the rest of you a great deal of time to skill in this area we pay good money to play eve and the way i see it this game is geared up for the bears in eve ccp do yourselfs a favor and leave nano alone so yes i am 100 against the nerfone last thing i can see ccp loosing many pilots if this nerf is bought into affect why are you fixing something that is not broken wake up

im disappointed with this kneejerk reaction i find it interesting that when people complain about nanos being overpowered and start telling their hard luck stories of encountering them the last thing they want to hear is constructive suggestions on how to setup or what to do to avoid a repeat they seem to have accepted the party line that nanos are overpowered and need to be changed and wont consider that perhaps they also could adaptthe big blobfests are not fun i fly them when i have to out of a feeling of duty to the team the small fast gangs are fun and dont take such solid massive blocks of time please leave some variety in the game ccp so that small gang pvp is still an option
in its current form im against the nerf and until they sort it out i wont support it and no i dont fly any nano ships because i cant afford them
nano nerf will kill all small scale pvp
nano setups unquestionably need rebalancing its also quite telling to see the section of the player base most vocal in their moral outrage  nano should no longer be the iwin button it is atm but these changes are too much ccp
well i guess this means that we should all start roaming around in slow ass battleships taking 5 minutes to get through a system meaning going 10 jumps there and 10 jumps back will take 2 hrsoh btw i support this thread if you must keep nerfing stuff then please dont do to speedy ships what you did to the pilgrim give the ships that are meant to be fast a boost so they stay fast

wrong the csms just have a way of seeing how many accounts accually voted and not charactersthere is nothing that limits the number of characters you sign in this thread with since there are 3 characters per account it is perfectly feasable for there to only be 13 pages of actual votes against this nerf judging from the ammount of alts ive spotted where 3 people in a row look the exact same or 23 in a row have the same name with different spellings ild say this thread actually only has around 20 somthing pages of actual votes

ohey mr bs ops for life

of course thats going to be exactly the same for the pro nerf thread as well so its something of a null argument
no speed nerf pls
i only voted once their jade though i dont agree with some of the parts of the nerf the dev mentioned i agree a change needs to be made
i am not against a reduction in the effectiveness of nano ships  for the longest time i did my best to make do without a nano ship in small gang pvp and was quickly educated in just how impossible they were to do withoutthere are counters to nano yes  but they are particularly resource intensive in terms of specific skills modules and ships  much more so nanoing  they only lead down the slippery slope towards blobsville which is not a place i want to gowhat is needed isnt a broad nerf of everything nano what is needed is a balanced consideration of what the problems are with the tracking explosion radius system etc as well as the more extreme ends of the nano scale and a proper rebalancingperhaps consider modules like webification fields or remote area webs just as there are remote area ecm modsi support the principle of the thing  ridiculous speeds need to be brought back into line  or weapons need to be properly worked out so that they still have some effect at speeds  but not the scale of the proposed nerfs so i vote against

which bears the question are all players being equally represented by this and the other  thread or is this threads success contributed to the people with the most to lose stomping their feet and throwing a fit in an attempt at retaining a gameplay advantage that is largely considered extremely unbalancedhas there been any proposals to require player voting at login it seems to me like at this point thats a very valid way of determining what everyone thinks not just those that troll the forums from work and those that stand the most to lose

i am for some sort of nano nerf ships exceeding the speed of assault missiles floating out of range after being dualtripple webbed or doing 12000ms is lame and brokenhacs were meant to be tier 2 afs the speed thing just sort of happened as far as i can tell guerilla warfare is important to the fun aspect of eve we cant afford to lose that but guerillas dont come through 20 armed soldiers  ie gate camps  to get there they sneak in the back way using other routes black ops etc hacs should not survive a huge gate camp as someone tried to argue hacs should not move at 12000ms either a dual or tripple webbed hac should not still be outrunning assault missiles that needs to be fixednerfing the hac to the point where a 300mill ship dies to a couple of drakes is wrong however its armortank should be able to get it out before there is much risk of deathin favor of nerf but only if done well

i would like to add my two cents to the proposed changes to manufacturing of t1 items in my opinion the proposed changes would over complicate the game and take the fun out of it i say leave t1 production alone i dont want to feel like im back at work instead of playing a game in my opinion t2 production is overly complicated to the point where i just buy the t2 items off the market just to let you know im really big into mining and i do make some items in the game i dont want to have to train up skills just so that i can make the same item i did before i have so many other things that need to be trained as it is no need to put in skill training time sinks ccp if you make t1 production as nebulous and complicated as you have with t2 production you will have made things too complicated for new players and for some of us nonhardcore industrial players who dont want to spend hours at a time trying to figure out how to build something out of components you will have alienated us as wellthink long and hard how you plan to make industry more interesting i have no qualms with adding a variable into the mix to make modified items but you should not touch the existing method to building items over the course of time the game itself has gone from a simple premise to being overly complicated in some respects that its beginning to force even industrial players to concentrate on just one industrial aspect of the game complicating things to pander to the elite gamers is not a wise decision and could possibly cost you in terms of subscription numbers later on down the road keep the game fun for the most part us casual gamers dont want to need a degree in engineering just to play the game
the introduction of new skills to enable us to use t1 blueprints will unduely limit new players and be a very solid kick in the teeth to existing industrial characters when they suddenly find they cannot use 70 of their bposthis is a very bad ideawhycrafting in eve is already annoyingly complex now you want to introduce more items and techniques into the crafting mechanic to create things that are already in the game have been for years and functioning just fineif its a rig thats attached to a specific ship then its not a rig its just another ship bonus as we already possess unless youre suggesting that this rig is put into the manufacturing process and built into the shipconversely why not have all ships recieve their bonuses as a control module that is manufactured with each ship but can then be removed  the control module has its own db entry  thus removing the bonuses from the ship it can then be plugged into any other ship and transfer the bonsues from the first ship to the secondthese would be the bonuses not basic ship details such as base drone bay size mass inertia or whathaveyou it might give the new ship drone damage or increased velocity or whathaveyou added to the new vessels basic statsnew skills yet more and more new skills i would have to say no please no new skills for existing contentand adding another layer of must build this and that and that and this other thing just to build a shuttle is unduely complex upon a system that is already extremely complicated
envy
setting asside the various arguments about investment or who controls prices you essentially have a class of item that unlink other nerfs kept its advantage for those who already had themthis is an oddly  and to some irritatingly  unique situation for eve normally when something is nerfed or removed it effects players across the board for example the recient change in torpedoes  again setting asside any positive or negative comments about that change  all torps were effected not just newly produced onesnow combine this with past accusations of t2 bpos improperly making into some alliances hands and you have something that really looks like dont take away the advantage of our friendsso why would some path for new t2 bpo creation be beneficial because it gives a path for the up and comers to access content that at the moment is becoming increasingly inaccessible  and thus only open to a few  this is already a problem with null sec resources and other things that are already monopolized by older groups and this is a pr problem so even if the mechanical benefits are low the pr benefits are significantthough perhaps bpos should take datacores as part of thier bill of materials or something to keep balance there  and this would apply to all t2 bpos 
easy competition if we both have to buy the parts i cant compete with the owner of a t2 bpo if i am using invention and the resulting t2 bpcs if the bpo owner never researched the bpo its 00 to my 44 costs me a lot more i spend money on the decrypters  for ships  or time to get the data core to try to invent a bpc i can build 10 he can build a lot more he spends some time and researches the bpo he can get it to xy and make them faster and cheaper still i can never get it past 11now someone will say that bpo may have cost billions of isk sorry it does not wash the bpo cost nothing but time and luck the lottery gave them away free that someone paid billions for the bpo does not mean they got a good deal i can go to some used car dealer and buy a classic car that runs well for a large chunk of cash and get a car that is neither a classic or even running the next day airlines buy fuel on the spot market fuel prices go up they pay more down they pay less or  like southwest  buy the futures and pay the agreed rate when the ticket is due if the price of fuel has gone way up  like now  they look smart had the bottom fallen out they look like fools if you paid a billion isk for a t2 bpo that is only worth 300000 then you are a fool if you paid 300000 for one worth 1 billion you are smartmaking more t2 bpos available via the inventionrd mechanics would make help foster competition
possible but absolutely not from bpcyou want to try to invent a t2 astarte bpo very well put together 3200 gallente starship engineering datacores 3200 mechanical engineering datacores 1 brutix bpo start invention and wait 23 months you will have the standard t2 bc chance of inventing so the inventor would be investing about 1 billion at current prices with a 25 or so chance of success a astarte bpo then would be priced at about 4 billions seem a reasonable system i would prefer a system with higher costs and time requirement but guaranteed results but this can be an acceptable alternative inventing bpo from bpc isnt
i picked up my copy  us bookstores are not carrying it  of jim rossignols book this gaming life travels in three cities today and was reading page 36 where he refers to quake warsUFFFD when it dawned on me that eve is missing something it needsthe hardcore cadre of eve players who live and die in 00 are feeling their needs unmet in a critical area we crave the excitement of massive fleet engagements war on a grand scale however weve learned to be happy with smaller engagements often referred to as roaming ops or just purely roams weve been forced to be happy with these smaller battles because of game mechanics resulting from a hardwaresoftware infrastructure that cannot handle the large scalability requirements necessary for such massive and epic battlesthese are the stuff of legend the war defining battles consisting of thousands of ships on both sides the battles where people say i was there and it was crazy it was insane but more importantly it was fun this is one of the most incredible aspects of eve that we can put so much on the line for what we believe that we can risk so much to have those pure moments of being in the zone swathed in utter gaming fun eve needs these wars just as surely as it needs a miner sitting in solitude sucking veld from the vacuum of deep spacethe epic battles continue because they are now a necessary escalation of the warfare in eve that must be observed by all sides of the battle however they are more work than fun they have become long drawn out monotonies of screen refreshes a patchwork of lagged out clicks usually resulting in an existential departure of your character from their fleeting life as you are either dead and just dont know it yet or rather worse sucked into the wormhole of a node crash rudely sitting at a login screen unable to rejoin the battle consumed by anger knowing that your comrades in arms are dying and you are helpless to gather again and helpyouve  yes you ccp  created this sandbox armed it to the teeth told us to pick up the weapons and openly encouraged this escalation in warfare in eve to the point where we see battles nearly daily and weekly that dwarf the engagements of the past and yet they have become less a valuation of thrilling fun and more a required necessity of being a part of something bigger multiple titans and mothers hundreds of capital ships thousands of battleships and legion of support ships all fighting the primary enemy lag fleetingly they are given the opportunity to fight each other between the servers graces they are now as much loathed and begrudgingly attended as they should conversely be desired and sought after we want to experience these massive fellowships of destruction and redemption to define the destiny of eve and our own pilotsfix this above all else  make massive fleet battles fun again remove the lag remove the limitation of the current game mechanics from being the deciding factor in these most epic of battles let the victor be determined by the skill fortitude sheer luck and decisiveness of those whom wish to engage in this most holy pursuit of the chaos of eve warfaregive us warfare back on a massive scale and make it fun again
 what he said
nobody wants these limitations but im not what the point of this post is i mean youre basically saying hey ccp fix lag and lag generating mechanics which isnt exactly something they havent heard before good post though
i keep wondering why we all assume that ccp aint racking their brains to do just that they do play this game too you know
signed seems everything minmatar is bottom of the pile now
introduce access logging for corporate hangars and ship maintenance arrays now i know that ccp approves thievery but currently finding a thief in a 200 corp is almost impossible a thief can steal without consequences and stay hidden for years there should be some ways to find and punish him access logs will not prevent a theft but they would insure that there are consequences also thieves will be more likely to pull large scale heists instead of milking the corp which is fun to read on the forums

hey im bloody tired of being roaming around 00 and getting spotted in local chat those ratters whoever shouldnt get free intel of my presence by just watching local count currently everyone just warp out of the belts or log off when they are endangered removing local has the equal nerf to pvprs and pvers since both of them would have to relay on scan results and therefore everyone would have to work for the intel not to get it for free
so long as  a  windows are built into the hulls of stations and  b  scans are automated complete with a ping every time a new target entered scan range this would be fine otherwise i see no reason to force players to wear out their mouse buttons by hitting the scan button every two seconds whenever in space
this idea is crap
the result of this idea on the long run is a 00 even more empty that it is right now that wont give you any more targets to shoot at no support from me
the number of targets is not the point but the issue that those potential targets are not reachable currently they can just  off if they have the brain to warp out is that complitely alright with you do you think they earned the intel
dont like the idea but it gave me an idea for a new region where this nonlocal chat could be createda region where no one shows up in local till they talk in there no numbers of members in space are shown systems that cant be owned no stations no pos systems can be placedwhere the belt rats can come in frigs or in dreads   all race type rats  where you can find all the riches in ores good scannable complexes so a region with high risk and reward a real wild wild west region
the only reason you know that the current ship you are about to scan down is actually a player is because you see himthem in local too have you earned that intel if local was not up you might see 1000 ravens all with different players name oh and a force shield if you have that on your scanner so you have to move around yes hit omfg new force fieldby jumping in to a system you get free intel on how many ships there are possibly ratting there and therefore can exclude sertain shipsareas where ships are and find him easier you get the same if not more intel by local scanning would be a nightmare simply because a simple sollution for them to counter your no local plan is to drop 200 frigs in space or shuttles even next to every celestial in space good luck finding anything besides people that doesnt watch local you catch anyway we do it all the time there is a few really smart and quick reacting characters out there and those you will never catch as they rat in such a way that even if you pop up right next to them they get away
issue remove peoples who wants to remove local
well it takes skills to scan for ships in belts or planets what you say about using ejected ships as beacons is already being used by many and the only way you can know wether its a killable target or just a ship at pos is to scan the directions to know if its at belts or not this tactic can be already used and many ratting alliance have set their posses up with assload of ships to make the scanning more difficult but your scanning skills matter to make sure if they are at the pos or not not the count in local the local count helps to make logical assumptions about present ships but as i said it would be hard for the pvers and pvprs both to map the situation of each solar system with out local so i would concider it a fair nerf if you are roaming same systems all over again you would get to know which of the ships in scanner are just beacons and which not at least from my experiences if i run the same route for 3rd time i already know most of the systems pos ships and i dont have to waiste my time trying to figure out if they are piloted or not it takes time to get know new places the habits of the people in the new places and alot of skill in scanning i have been practising scanning for over an year now and i do get the results of a ratting battleship within 1015 seconds most of the time then add the time it takes to warp to the target and all possible lag the final time it takes to arrive to your target is somewhere around 20 seconds minimum up to 45seconds in this time every battleship can warp out and those who didnt look at local will do it next time
genius notionmake local a recent speakers channel instead of an immediate channelthen no one has a clue who is out and about unless they happen to speak which most spies shouldnt be too chatty if they are smart
local as an intel tool is flawed its too easy its too simplified its perfect and cannot be countered and it ruins small unit warfarefights happen at gatecamps or stationcamps because there is no other way to come upon a target without being exceptionally luckylike every other point of the game gathering intel on who is in the system around you should be an active task local and map intelligence though is free and simply too powerfuli know the arguments itll ruin the game but that isnt true and even deep down you know it itll take away a cruicial tool that players are exploiting true but even i wont agree with removing the tool and not giving players some way to replace ita local scanner with ping is perfectly useful maybe powerful enough to scan your grid that way someone can get in system and warp to you and you dont have a couple minutes headstart in warping to your safespot or throwing the cloaki fully support this local is an exploit that we have been required to use for far too long i think its time ccp fixed it
also i dont believe in removing local or statistics from low and highsec systems just 00 give the players modules and anchorable objects to replace it but not nearly as allencompasing i mean why can a corporation see everything thats happening in their enemies systems from twenty jumps away just seems lazy to me
oh jesus here we go again
supported gonna need it with these changes if you actually want a rewardrisk ratio in 00 obviously you will need some sort of tool that shows you numbers in space for an area or on a delay since 00 is mostly emptyinstant free intel for anyone paying attention to a little window is not the way to go though even a 30s delay on local updating would do it
you know theres something called probes duh you can easily see if ships are stashed in a pos even better drop 100 cruisers in system ill probe them out in one scan and just collect  sell scanning  probing system would need some tweaks tho
if you want to play without local then do so simply minimize it let us know how that works out for you
needs sorting more so now speed ships that are about warping quick are going down the tubescan results  only ships with pods in  x it will require you to actually do some work when rattingmining tbh if the are 2 of you one can keep an eye on the gates while the other rats hey might even require the ratters to defend themselves people will work together more ratting in teams etcanyway what its worth i am for the ideahowever think it should be a constilation channel if you have a cycle of 10mins then it makes sense the gates are recording your movements knowing you have entered and left the area recently as well as highlighting your actually in the system due to jumping through the gatethen you could introduce hacking gates knowing your hostile has recently left you can hack gate intel to know if he left via that gate or not
agreed but there needs to be some way to gather intel on star gate usage this
causing an exodus form 00 to empire may not be your goal but thats what will happen with local goneearning the intel isnt what matter tought you might say paying attention to local is earning that intel what matter is what for a ratter refreshing the scanner every 2 seconds is for too tedious to be viableim all for nerfing macrofarmers but it must be done by affecting their cloaks the delog timer or maybe the align time not local you can remove local as an intel tool when its replaced by a passive reliable proximity intel tool
i lub csoh wait nevertheless im looking forward to the day when i dont have to fly around in a freighter
we recently got war decd by a 1 man corporation obviously an alt ceo the main character would remain out of the warring corporation until the moment he had one of us cornered then would immediately log on the ceo accept the app and the guy would instantly be at war with us attack his intended target then immediately dock and leave the corporation once the fight was over in doing so completely evading the aspect of being at war where both sides can engage each other freelyi petitioned it and recieved the answer that joining and leaving the corporation is not against policy i fully understand this i have no issues with people wanting to join in on the action and joining the corporation or getting fed up with war and leaving the corporation one or the other but joining and leaving the corporation specificaly as a tactic against the enemy so that the warring targets were completely unable to engage you except when you wanted i find this to be a exploit this is on the same lines as other tactics already named exploits engaging a player with black ops and jumping out to avoid concord killing someone and managing to survive concord as well as ejecting from a ship while a noncombatant boards resulting in the engager to be concorded all are already exploits and im sure there are more on the same lines i dont know about all these tactics named exploits use the same functions using legitamate game mechanics to avoid other rules and consequences of the game its not illegal to eject or board a ship its not illegal to jump systems its not illegal to dock or cloak yet these same legitamate rules when used in a different way are exploits its not illegal to join or leave a corporation i understand that but when joining and leaving a corporation for the specific intentions of avoiding war targets until your own choosing i find is an exploiting tactic and i ask that it be officialy made a exploit or rules implemented to help prevent or aleviate such tacticslet me reiterate i have no problems with combat war and the likes i would fully support a full war with a person but the tactic of joining and leaving a warring corporation specificaly as a tactic against the enemy corporation i find discraceful and on the lines of a exploit one simple way to help eleviate this would be to include a timer in joining a corporation much like it is if you have roles within a corporation once joined roles or not you would not be able to leave the corporation for 24 hours the standard waiting period for many things to add a further penalty to this a rule could be implemented so that a player leaving a player corporation could not join another player corporation for 24 hours  note moving straight from one player corp to another is not effected except to not be able to leave for 24 hours  although one could simply log off and wait the 24 hours it would remove the ability to instantly join a corp engage the target and instantly leave the corp thereby being no longer at war with the corporation and avoiding the standard rules of being at war to sum things up the current ability to hunt people as a neutral join a warring corporation at your own will engage the target and instantly leave the warring corporation and be instantly nonhostile i feel is a exploiting tactic using common and legitamate rules to navigate around other rules and penalties of the gamei ask that rules are implemented to prevent such tactics from being used and  or this tactic be named a exploit thanks for the time
yep this is just dumb 24h joining or leaving delay could be added to corporationsalliances that are at war call it concord paperwork holdups
totally agree with desert viper warring corporations should have something that prevents the same players hoping back and fourth it seems like it is a way of avoiding combat as well as killing and then avoiding combat this should definatly be looked into and should be called an exploit a timer for players join and leaving corps should be instituted it would make a totally better gaming experiance and prevent players from doing such things also another scenario is that the particular person who is leaving or getting kicked out of the warring corporation gets engaged by the enemy corp in high security space now this person decided to leave the corp that is at war at the exact time he is getting engaged suddenly the enemy corp members are engaging a neutral becuase perhaps he got kicked from the corp or accepted a ready application to another one this means they get concorded now you tell me if thats fairccp needs to look into this
1  cant leave  or even be kicked  a corporation while in space  however a application can currently be accepted while player is in space one of the key parts to this tactic  2  once engaged 15 minute agression timer against those that engaged him edit  i see what your saying michal leaving or being kicked from a corp while in space is not possible but applying to a new corp and having the app accepted while in combat with the warring corp would change the players corporation but then the 15 minute agression timer comes in those that were already engaged could continue to engage until the timer ran out those that were not already engaged i hope they have their concord warnings turned on
i am for the petitionablebannable offense as changing the corp joiningleaving rules can create problems
i totaly agree this problem could be solved so easy just by adding a 24h cooldown on joiningleaving a corpalliance in war
i agree with desert viper
i agree with you desert viper this is a total exploit
not crap i support
that is only for bastards lola 24h time out would be great and i like the name concord paperwork holdup lol
exploit i mean seriously you wait till the last second to get into the wardeccin corp and pop whoever you found on the alt then leavewheres the riskreward therei support a 24 leaveonly penalty
rofl  i find it funny how carebears first opened this tactic up by corp hopping to avoid wars and are now having it used against them for easy ganks  albeit not the same people  if you do remove this please also remove corp hopping to avoid wars thankyou
i support this
i have come across this similar behavior as well i believe this tactic definitely rides the fine line of an exploit as desert viper stateshere is the hypothetical situationplayerscorporation a  1 person corp hq based in high sec space corporation b  hq based in high sec space member amember btactic1  corporation a declares war on corporation b now after the initial 24 hour cooloff period both corporations can attack each other without concord intervention2  corporation b member b is off mining in a belt in high sec space3  corporation a ceo logs on and accepts membership from a player so now the new player to corporation a is member a4  member a proceeds to destroy member b5  corporation b sends a squad to hunt down member a6  member a leaves corporation a so member a is no longer a wardeccd target7  corporation b has no method to retaliate against corporation a8  member a rejoins corporation a and repeats step 48 when convenientissuefrom
i hadnt thought of that before but that is actually rediculous clearly an exploit
24 hrs is too long it prevents the quick recruiting of pilots in a legitimate war what if ushrakhan  minmatar rp alliance  needed to quickly move lots of pilots to their alt corp in factional warfare the problem is not the application process it is the entire war declaration system no support
cant you not join or leave corporations unless youre docked if this has changed then its definitely a problemhowever leaving a corporation at war is a different story entirely i dont think its a tactic thats good for the game but recipients of a war declaration need a better way to defend themselves as obvious by the fact that they use this tactic to begin with i think that two mechanics would help this problem1 allow concord to be bribed by the recipient of the war dec  only one time  to delay the beginning of the war for up to a week at a significant financial cost 24 hours is generally not enough time to prepare a corporation for war unless its expecting one2 create a mechanic that allows a third party to buy in on a wardec allowing mercenaries to participate in a war without paying the declaration fee if they have the blessing of the defending corporationa little carebeary i admit but the fairest solution to the problem i can think of that will effectively discourage corphopping to avoid wars
i am behind desert viper 100000000 
yup sounds good
something really needs to be done about hopping from and within a warring corporation
actualy kazuma saruwatari its worse than that the actual guy that was doing the killing would fly around find his targets and could easily be sitting right next to them nonhostile one minute the alt ceo logs on and instantly that dude thats been sitting next to you for a couple minutes is now a war target shooting you now keep in mind this could very easily happen with any number of players so theoreticaly any dude next to you could instantly become a war target with the blink of an eye using alt scouts in empire to aide in war has always been used but thats not the issue at hand and about the joining  leaving a corporation you can have your application accepted while in space the main factor in this particular tactic is having the application to the warring corporation accepted right when your about to pounce on someone so joining a corporation can happen wether docked or undocked but leaving the corporation currently can only happen while docked even the ceo can not kick a player from a corporation while the player is in space unless hes logged off in space
got it add a step to the application process that forces pilots to be docked up to join a corporation1  pilots applies2  ceo or director accepts application and sends offer3  pilot docks in a station and accepts offer immediately joining corporationi always wondered why this wasnt the process it also allows pilots to send out multiple applications wait a week then pick the corporation they like best
fahtim meidires that used to be the case not too long ago it used to be a 3 step proces to get into a corporation exactly as you said apply accept accept offer they streamlined it not too long ago bringing it down to only two steps apply accepted
what was their rationale other than one less step any reason why it should be reimplemented
that i dont know i personaly am glad they streamlined it makes things easier although reducing steps in one area is bound to open up loopholes in another so its a balancing act one way or another
crack down on this exploit asap
i agree with above  
yar i disliked corphopping already and we in tnt recently experienced a similar incident where a wartarget quit corp on jumping through into our gatecamp hoping to get us concorded by attacking him
this is using game mechanics in a way that is not intendedthis is an exploitsolanthus lightbringerdont get madget even
easy fix make war declaration a perplayer flaga your corp gets wardecced by another corp immediately all members of your corp and theirs are flagged individually as being at warb one of your corpies jumps to escape the war no such luck he still has the war flag for the duration of this war cycle  1 week  no matter where he goes or what corp he joins  this flag does not transfer to the new corp c an unknown joins the corp thats at war with you is flagged as thus and this flag remains with that individual even if they jump corp  as stated with b  for the remaining duration of the current war cyclethis fixes many warfare loopholes
this is a fantastic idea op idea supported and props given to mister xerox for a nice addendum
this issue is such a nobrainer that i am surprised the op had to even ask for support this tactic is practically the textbook example of a clearcut exploit
the sad part is that now that this has been brought to into the light you will see this used like mad until ccp officially announces it as an exploit or resolves the issue
something needs to happen
ah what the hellsigned
its not just the greatest scandal in eve he exposed but quite probably in all western mmos history this may entitle him to some special consideration though not an outright pardon especially considering his further actionshis banning was as best as can be determined carried out before his various untoward actions were he could quite conceivably be reinstated as a token action and then be rebanned for his later actions as it stands his banning is the very worst public element of the t20 debacle ive lost more than one eve friend because they lost faith in ccp and it delayed my return to the game by about 6 months punishing whistleblowers is incredibly foolish it causes immense damage to public and internal trust and there are very good reasons the real world has laws protecting whistleblowerstbh ccp came very close to actual illegal activity defrauding  a deception deliberately practiced in order to secure unfair or unlawful gain  the part of the player base not receiving devfriendhelp by suggesting that everyone was on an equal footing and that in game money or other recourses were required to acquire various items thus gaining ccp money by making those player pay for their accounts longer to acquire the isk to get the itemsthis was not only hidden by ccp passively but actively when people attempted to reveal it and those actions have gone without consequencei support a general appeal system for bans i support the t20 incident receiving renewed attention specifically from the csm with ccp revealing such information as was hiddendeleted from the forums at the time to them if necessary in closed session
in the current incantation of the titan dd especially in conjunction with jump bridges and cyno jammers i do feel a change is needed i do not want the dd removed from game i only want its effect tweakedright now a dd is a solo player capable of whiping an entire fleet off the map with a button yes it is dependent on the fleet not being able to flee yes it is a very costly ship but its been shown that the value of the dd on top of all the other bonuses of a titan is a bit highsolutionchange the dd effect from damage directly to a ship to what would essentially be an astronomic em burst this would affect ship systems and potentially cause overloads in ship modules it would cripple a fleet for a limited time wo single handedly destroying said fleeteffects25000 damage  racial still 47000 base energy neutralized  boostable with skill 10 chance to cause 40 heat damage to ship modules  possibly link this to a skill 20 second warp recalibration for all ships effectedenergy neutralizer reasoning this would give minmitarcaldari a new role in fleet combat and diminish gallente and amarr slightly in fleet warfare it would also criple mwd effects on fleets trying to escape bubbles and would act as a good harsh effect titans could dish out cap ships in siegetriage and immune to ewar should not be affected by this or it should be heavily diminished effect to prevent titan spammingheat reasoning again a fleet crippling measure that could also aid to bring in the age of t3 modules 10 would effectively remove 15 modules average from battleships on the field i do not have issues with this working on cap fleets if it were again diminished effect say maybe 2 chance while in siegetraigewarp recalibration reasoning including the titan this would prevent ships from just instantaneously leaving the field of play if affected giving the friendly fleet a small window to warp in and being the fight at an advantage this would not prevent alignment and would basically create havoc for people trying to mwd up to the titan for a bubble
i kinda like where you are going with this  but what about racial variationalso you would either need role bonuses for certain ships or an alternative method of mitigating the effect so that ships which can currently tank a dd have some increased resistanceneeds much work but an interesting jumpoff point
maybe reduce the actual physical damage of a dd to add the racial element maybe 10k damage basekeep in mind the titans already give a bonus based on their racial element ie amarr and cap caldari and shields
interesting but i think racializing it is a solution too my first inclination is to base them off the recon ships  amarr get neut 100second  caldari get jam 30 points all types  or perhaps bring in scripts  gallente get a bubble and minmatar get a huge web 90 even after the web nerf  make them have a goodsized duration on them measured in minutes  which of course also requires the titans to stick around instead of running  though they should only affect those who were there when the effect started i like the idea of a fleet leading with a titan or 10 ddding and having everything else follow to lead off a fleet fight include some damage maybe but not a whole lot and let titans use siege modules to allow them to actually have the wherewithal to stand and fight and use those gun bonuses instead of being a useless target once the battle actually starts
i love to think outside the box even though i hate that phrase  my little twist to this whole topic thought is what if the titan super weapon was defensive in naturejust a thought
bump can we get an update
i didnt get the chance to fly much of recons till lately ive been putting that off for too long and one day decided it was timebut onto the things that matter i flew both arazu and lachesis they are very similar boats but require a tad different play style because of the different slot layouts when you go about fitting a boat the arazu have to look at spare cpu to fit the cloak while lachesis have to conserve pg for a plate  i fly plated lachesis sue me same goes with curse and pilgrim they are somewhat similar boats but two different play styles are required curse most ppl just throw overdrive injector nanofiber and polycarbon on if they can afford them whizz around the field while neuting the target down for the other nano ships to do the damage while with the pilgrim more adept as solo hunting and shadowing  cloaking in a hostile system to prevent enemy from rattingmining  it cant nano well because of the lack of rangepeople are saying that the pilgrim needs some love is because they cant nano it cant hop in on it go get some kills and get away with itim saying the pilgrim is fine ok well except the tracking disruption partif you want to nano the pilgrim buy corpum atype medium nos and neut  isnt that what the devs implying spend a load of isk to get the same result is imbalance  they got the range of 19km oh and youll be faster than a nanocurse coz of the 5th lowslotleave the pilgrim alone do something about the script
how do you get teh thumbs up
obviously you have never flown the pilgrim you are missing the point completely all other recon ships have similar range bonuses but the pilgrim sure you can spend extra isk to put dead space nos on them but your neuts will wont be able to reach since nos was nerfed your post is probably one of the most stupid posts that i have seen i personally love the idea of having the rangeamt bonus as one if not that then i would love to see something added to the pilgrims tank since it is supposed to fight in web range unlike any other reconstabby mcstabbins
i lol at pilgramsfix em please
pilgrim needs some love for sure
i like the cap bonus idea keeps the pilgrim in the shape it is and not changing the roles it has as a sneek up fighter good call matesigned
my view is that titans are the ultimate expression of power  just look at the shape of them  and should be dangerous ships worthy of fear however the doomsday is silly and has no place in eve when you consider that it ends in a moment what could have been a great battle between many players as mentioned there was an hp boost because people died too quickly which makes the addition of doomsdays a bit perplexingi dont care for the idea of changing titans into mobile stations as i think we have enough poss and stations lying around 00 and it doesnt really inspire anythingsome ideasremove the very broken doomsday device because it does not promote interesting game playreduce the range of jump bridging but preserve its personal jump range i see titans as combat ships not logistics taxisgive titans a special 5minute siege module that allows it to have greater than dreadnought dpstank with the same tracking and movement etc penalties also allow it to be remote repaired maybe with some kind of cap penalty while in siegegive them the ability to use bombs  like stealth bombers  but enable them to be fired to mid rangeno drones no fighters no more lag botsoverpowered underpowered crazy i dont know but it could be fun i want to see these ships on grid holding their own and not dying the second a blob looks at them but without having to fear my ship and fleet will pop in a flash when they warp in
well i wish your comrades would say the same about the nanonerf as nanos are also hard to overcome for tzarailsa it seems too hard maybe you need to help her a little
ooh nanos are bad when youre facing them but titans are perfectly fine when theyre on your team
the critical titan saturation point where they can ddd capitals isnt what people should be worried about the critical point came long ago when it became trivial to field enough titans to destroy fully tanked hics combine that with decloakandddd drivebyddd dddbeforeyouloadgrid dddbeforeafleetdecloaks cynomultipletitanstoonebsandddd the only titans that get killed are the ones that are fielded alone its almost unprecedented to kill a titan if youre fighting more than one of the damn things and the more there are the harder it gets but the more you have the easier it is to get more since theyre a wonderful logistics tool as wellits a horrendous positive feedback loop that creates a downward spiral where 00 warfare gets progressively less and less fun now removing doomsdays entirely is a massive change but what else can halt the spiralgive titans smartbomb range and damage role bonuses then remove ddgetting near a titan and hictackling it would still be damn hard but you dont have the stupidity that you have now where everything subcapital can be made totally redundant by four titans and thats a fairly low number for some alliances to field
nope my corp doesnt have any titans and except getting a ride with steve in ascn once ive never had any benefit from any titanimho titans should not be nerfed in the way the op would like iti would like to see some changesas a titan is a strategic asset ccp should try and skew  for example ccp should put incentives in place not to use titans to triple dd a roaming gang proposed solution firing a dd should cost significant isk  500 mio to 1 bio isk  a number of titan pilots could still do it  for shts and giggles  but it should not be the normal thing to doi like the suggestion of using a script a 100 km radius where a dd does 50000 k damage or a 250 k radius where a dd does 10000 damage something like that alternative 1  could be combined  a rolling dd would be nice you get damaged quicker than 15 secs near the center of the blast  10 sec  but maybe up to 30 secs at the outskirts seeing the blast rolling towards you while you scream your ship to get into warp is coolthis could well be combined with the following the titan needs to launch its dd on a friendly so you have to get the friendly to a location where he can initiate a kind of field to which the titan pilot can release the blast the blast ball expands from the field  in a rolling fashion  the field protects the friendly of course there is a 23 sec delay in which the friendly has to open the field if the friendly gets jammed or killed he cant open the field a game of cat and mouse ensues what i like about this is that in a lagged out environment the use of dds to clean the field gets more difficult if your field captain gets lagged out and thinks he opens the field at the enemy location but in reality didnt make the warp titan could dd his own fleetin short bring some skill and teamwork to the dd weapon make that it isnt used frivously  but can still be for s and giggles against our poor nanonerfed exceed gangs if you want to cough of up the cash to see us suffer   this requires the nerfwand not the nerfhammer
reading comprehension ftw
as far as i have seen most problems occur when 2 or more titans enter the field 1 ddd is survivable 2 in a row are certain death for any ship sub capital thats the reason u wont see them on there own alot so i would agree with the persons earlier titans arent support vessels in my eyes they are the ultimate destroyer of worlds its shoudl stand pround in the frontlines and lead its fleet to glory and not intended for geurilla warfare   aka lets doomsday these guys warp to a safe pos and jump out when we can make it pointless for a fleet to have more then one on the field with removing the abality to set of multiple ddd in sequence to simply kill all in sight and move onwhy not give it command bonuses   it is the flagship isnt it letting it deploy as a stationary object with expanding shields is a great idea but should be considered more of secondary purpose like a safe place away from home without hauling in an entire pos in htat mode let it use up lo just the same as a regular pos and enlarge its shields to 10 km around it
the ability to dock with a titan is probably the most useful ability it could have and fairly feasable to pull off as well docking would work in a similar fashion to storing a ship in a pos array or a carrier hangar but when you dock your view becomes one with the titans ie you get a camera drone and can look around the vessel view the map etc as if you were driving the titan itself jumping would work like a jump portal all docked pilots would transfer with the titan and reemerge on the other side still within the titana market on the titan would be limited to an in station view of all for sale stuff within its mighty hold  yes it would need a seperate hangar but its big enough yes  a window seperate from the actual market perhaps a seperate database for all saleables on the titan and a query for each titan would fix things up a bitone final idea drop the doomsday and give it point defenses manageable only by docked pilots think pos defenses but in large numbers and not quite so powerful these would be special modules for high slots on a titan and each one would represent several such point defensesof course they would vary in size and power smaller for frigate popping med for cruisers etcone big fat thumb all the way up
yeah pointed that out page one
i am wondering lavistaare the changes that are allowed to be processed by the csm only changes that can work on the current game design and mechanics  tech wise because you are trying to say it is the core design of eve that does not allow us these features well buddy think again and think hard before you answer again in an epic style fail like this oneyou would be amazed if youd actually take the time to talk to a design team about features before you reply like this you have no clue what can and cannot be done in a design guess what you only think that it cant be done simply because it goes beyond your comprehensionno this is not a troll it is me saying that you shouldnt be wrecking ones idea just because you have a lack in imagination in and do not know enough about either game design networking and coding
the devs stated that we couldnt scoop pods or transport other players because of session change issues and that was years agounless they have rewritten the core code around that then he is probably rightunless of course you have information to the contrary
i certainly hope that in ccps effort to imporves the game performance that they can begin to offload clients who are not actually on a grid to different servers  so people who are in station are on a different server than those out in space in a system although they can all see the same local chat  if they do that essentially the problem with pods docking up with a titan goes awayessentiallysystem a is where the titan is locatedsystem b is where the titan is going to move to soonsystem a is on server 1system b is on server 2titan dock is on server 3so when someone docks with the titan they session change to server 3 when they undock they session change to whatever server the titan resides in  for clarification obviously servers will be hosting more than just a single system or outpost it would have to be fluid i think ccp is working tword this so they can have multiple servers handle the load of a single system and dynamically add and remove servers to a system in order to gain higher processing power when needed but this is just speculation so if the titan pilot session changes to a different server everyone who is inside the titan does not do a session change at all due to the fact that they are going to be communicating with the same server until they undock the only difference is now when they undock they will load server 2 which is hosting system b personally i want to marginalize the aoe weapon of the titan and change their offensive system into something more fitting with the rest of the games design generally a ship in a game is best suited to go after its own type of ship introducing a titan sized weapon system and changing the doomsday operation skill to titan weapon operation  simple rename  and introduce the new modules into the game then on top of this change them into things that can be deployed as a mobile outpost i think it would be neat to see a titan being used to help battleship pilots to pull out new battleships from a titan to continue fighting although in my honest opinion most of the titan problems can be addressed with pos mechanic fixes and lag handling fixes expanding on the outpost idea titans should be able to deploy  they initiate an emergancy warp and then deploy in a safespot with a pos shield to protect undocking ships on top of this guns deploy out of the titan to target any hostile ships that come on grid this pos shield is run by consuming a new type of fuel which its elements only comes from 00 ice mining when the titan undeploys it keeps its shield up and emergancy warps back to where it came from  cannot be tackled at this point  and then the shield goes offline just as it enters warp when a titan logs out it automatically enters this outpost state if it isnt fueled it loses its outward shield and can be tackled as it undeploys the titans shield can be reinforced in which it burns 4 times the amount of fuel per hour pilots can only undock when the titan is not in warp if the titan is destroyed all assets in it are destroyed as well any clones are moved to the players corperation headquarter station any players logged out inside the titan lose their clones all jump clones in the titan are destroyed as well something along the lines of that would be pretty cool on top of all that when the titan deploys the titan pilot can get into a ship he has stored in the hanger and use it without worrying about someone stealing his titan
load balancing techniques would make the capability to move pilots around trivialit shouldnt be hard anyway pilot docks at titan throw pilot into list titan cynos out tell all pilots on list to session change donei know bane said he thought it probably not feasible  and really just didnt want it to bring in more issues to the discussion  but its not a hard problem for a real mobile station type asset to exist and be valuable as well as presenting some really fun opportunities for roaming around space with a mothership as a base of operations the docking behavior is a requisitenot only insanely cool but also very fun
any fans of the homeworld 2 game might remember the dreadnaught that you get later in the game it had something like a targeted ion beam as its main weapon maybe something along those lines a module that is fit to the high slot of a titan that doesnt use any fuels  edit maybe some kind of ammo should be added   but takes significant cap to operateit should maybe work kinda like the nos does now or maybe have the damage depend on the targets sig radius unless its fair to have the titan able to instakill anything it gets a lock oni dont know exactly how it might work but im deffinintly in agreeance that the titan as it is now needs to changesiggy
simply put terrain effects and weather but on a cosmic scalemagnetic storms solar flares dust clouds and such having an effect on game play your scanner or probes giving crappy readings the magnetic interference from an orbiting dust cloud is your issueneed to sneak up on someone in a system wait for excited solar flare activity to mess with their sensors and you might have a chancefrom hiding nice exploration sites to expanding the dimensions of combat in eve the terrain should finally have an effect tactics system dynamics and various other variables could be added into the game to expand almost all parts of itjust and ideathanks for reading
im all for more space stuff in this space gamewhich is why i suggested storm chasers a while back
i think that tactical environments could provide a lot of opportunity to create more differentiation between size classes of shipsenvironmental effects based on a ships signature radius could be used to create situations where a frigate isnt instantly destroyed by a cruiser for example specifics would take some time to hammer out though
i can imagine a nexus cloud that is only a couple a grid big when a ship comes into this cloud his sensors are limited to about 40km max something could be right in front of him and not only can he not see it on his screen but he cant see it with the overviewstorms that do create sensor copies on the overview or affect tracking clouds where weapons are useless or that act as a naturalized webifier clouds that take you off the local channel but also prevent you from communicatingfrom flares as you have mentioned which are random occurances solar storms that can actually be tracked across systems nebula clouds which can be searched out using probeswant gurilla tactics there you go hit and run droping back into a hidden nebula cloud and effecting what appears to be a logoff system capture points within clouds that make it nearly impossible for large fleets to engage effectively inso many options course the dev team asked us some two years ago to come up with ideas for these types of things seems like all we got in return were clouds that did damage over time sad
you could also link this in with blobs sit 100 ships in the same place for too long and an ion storm will develop emcompassing the entire grid andor solar system due to all of the warp stabilisation fields interfering with each other if the ships dont move the storm just gets worse and worse over time until it starts to instapop smaller shipsit would be great to see some weather effects to be mined or chased for certain minerals or other tasty goodies while having others simply appear in space as annoyanceshere are some thoughts off the top of my headi like it
ill support this some new dynamics would be nice
cool but none of these auto kill clouds unless they move really really slow
does not want more random db calls no support
supportedid like the chance to duck into a stars corona to escape a pursuing ships sensors id further like them to take damage for flying too close to said star  id call that elemental wouldnt you 
allow us to do it without having to jump into them again its annoying and ive got no idea why this was removed apart from to  folk off
not an alt but i like this mans idea
yup why was this ever changed anyways
wholly agreedwhy they ever took this out makes no sense whatsoever and it was never announced in patch notes either a 100 stealth um nerf whatd it nerf anyway it was just a surprise kick in the gonands
are we discussing making mining more interesting or how to solve afk miningto make it more interesting is a good thing to make mining more active could also effect the afk miners though mining is one of the bases of eves economics and changes here could affect the prices very quickly
as has been discussed in gd earlier today members of csm are maybe impotent this is terrible if true if it is true the mental suffering that such a problem can cause would definetly cause a loss of focus on ones csm duties to solve this problem i propose that ccp give all csm delegates and alternates free viagra during their terms i think that this would cause all members of the csm to be better able to focus on the task at handof course i realise that some of our delegates are female on my interwebz  they may elect to take the viagra or not or to pass it on to a significant other i say this cause to date there has been no studies done that prove conclusively one way or the other the effects of viagra on female psychological sexual dysfunctionsps ccp please make sure it is viagra and not cyalis that you provide to the csm since i only own stock in pfizer inc
aha
just because a single thread exists in general discussion it does not immediately mean that the proposed issues are actually real do you have any information other than forum tinfoil to suggest that the csm is actually impotent in any way you dont have that information because it doesnt existfirst of all two of the 9 csm members are female they are less likely to be incapable of bearing children and i believe that infertile would be a more appropriate term for describing their status not that the details would get in the way of forum whiningsecond of all have any developers stated anything regarding this issue due to the prevalence of alts in eve i dont think that normal forum posters are reliable sources regarding the virility of the 7 male csm members i would be willing to seriously consider this issue if someone such as ccp eris discordia or ccp saint were to comment on this issue as they are the only ones who could have reliable personal experience in this matter as far as im aware of no members of the csm are homosexual though the members of goonswarm may be suspect by certain partiesplease use your brain before going on a whinefest in the assembly hall
it took me 5 times to actually post this postbut i think this is a good idea how much does viagra go for on the black market hopefully it can give me enough to buy a fanfest ticket
hmm i knew i should have included the following emoticon at the end of my opp

i know this topic is very popular but still i would like to post my own vision of titan in this game basically i have mixed shaked and mixed again few ideas here and what i got is titan should be mobile outpost  that is good ideatitans dd is overpowered  this is truemy idea is to give titan  full stack of turret high slots  add some sort of siege module  in this state only titan can use guns and dd this siege module would also change titan into so called mobile outpost  higher resistances  higher repair amount per second  fitting  docking etc this siege mode  or outpost mode  would create shield around titan similar to pos shield with similar possibilities what would happen now when titan enters battlefield he must enter siege mode to use his offensive capabilities now you have true behemoth on battlefield  with full rack of powerfull guns  possibility to create dd  possibility for smaller ships to hide behind the shield  but this behemoth is stuck on battlefield for some amount of time  siege mode or outpost mode should be much longer then standard siege mode on dreads for example an hour  what about dd well titan still can use dd but once per outpost mode dd would affect all ships outside titan shield sphere now why because now you have tactics risk vs reward it would be risky to send titan into fight
bull this wont affect looting times in the leastwe can melt t1 loot into minerals and make isk out of them this way in my experience named t1 loot is not worth any more then normal t1 lootretreat to where im not going to waste my time flying around between waypoints or exiting and reentering missions because he got away this isnt wow its not like we have the ability to simply follow our targets if they run awaywhy would i want to pvp against npcs when could pvp against playerscould break all missions like level 5s are brokenno it wont work please try to think about how missions workmissions have awards based on the difficulty of the mission creating a dynamic spawn system would reward people greatly at times when they get an easy spawn and not at all when they get a difficult spawn and without having a clear idea of what the hell is coming you dont have a chance to decline the mission i dont find them soul destroying if anything i find pvp souldestroying perhaps we should change that
if theres less loot then theres less ships to fly between while lootingdepends on meta levelretreat as in theyre not there anymore because pvp loses isk whereas missions give you isklevel 5s arent broken holy  you mean that people wont be able to know exactly what theyre up against seriously how is this badoh and theres nothing wrong with sometimes having an easier spawn and sometimes having a harder spawn exploration is entirely luck based much moreso than mission running ever could beeve is a pvp game static non competitive isk faucets break the spirit of eve
lowend named t1 loot perhaps but highend named loot is often 56 times as profitable or much more than its unnamed t1 counterpart unnamed t1 webfiers and best named webifiers refine into the same minerals but the best named sells for close to 1 million isk you actually miss out on a lot of potential income if you dont look for good lootplease read the entire suggestion before responding once they retreat theyre gone you dont go around chasing them the point is that you are rewarded by preventing them from retreating by obtaining more loot and bounty while alternately you could force them to retreat and complete the mission a bit faster it gives you a decision to make  currently missions have no decisions in which the answer is anything other than obvious kill ships in order of bounty collect loot complete missionthis statement doesnt make much senseits not possible to pvp against npcsthus the player verses player part the differences between reasons for pvp and pve are large enough that you already know themif you have any specific reasons why it could break all missions let me know general statements arent very insightfulagain im not sure you read my entire proposal obviously there would be a limit so you didnt end up fighting 100 frigates or a dozen battleships and knowing exactly what is coming is one of the things that make missions boring i really dont see how this factors into anyones argument you just seem like you oppose this on the grounds that it will make your mission experience less predictable which i could see people opposing if they only ran missions to make isk quickly but i think it would be better for the overall health of the gameif you want we could make missions completely predictable just accept the mission and undock and you explode if you dont meet the minimum tankable dps your reward could just be dependant on your dps and be calculated after you spend half an hour outside the station but i want to actually create isk earning mechanics that require more thought and are more enjoyable
like mining no what you want to do is turn an already working system into some pseudopvp for your own enjoyment rather then trying to improve the missions you want them to be more frustrating and require more people
not really as you will still have the wreck to salvage and the wreck will contain 1 named item instead of 1 named and 3 t1the difference would be select and drag instead of select ctrla and drag so automatically lost
im sure youre the minority in thinking that missions wouldnt be more fun with the proposed changes mindless predictable noncompetitive isk faucets arent in the spirit of eveat least if they net as much as level 4 missionrunning doesfewer wrecks will have loot thoughyes
in spite of what you claim missions are hardly isk faucets and some missions are downright mean not getting the whole salvaging part are you
supported i cant stand missions the only reason i am supporting this is because it might make them more dynamic
nice if these changes were implemented i may actually run missions again without falling asleep on my keyboardsigned
last night i was running a level 3 mission against rogue drones  was going to be my last mission of the day as it was about half past midnight i aggroed the room with my bs and while waiting for the room to fully aggro and come to me for a nicer salvage range i drifted off asleep woke up a few minutes later to find myself sitting in the middle of a pile of scrap metal the rogue drones all smirking at me i had neglected to fully switch on my tank before the sandman cameembarassing to lose a ship capable of soloing 4s to a handful of level 3 rogue drones but perfectly illustrates the point of how dull missions can be   that catnap cost me 60 mil isk after insurance and refit an expensive few minutes of dreaming  i cant really say it was worth it  
mining is a different issue but id love for it to be more interactive as well to be honest what do you mean for my own enjoyment i think that most mission runners would like missions to be more dynamic i can only represent my own opinion to be honest but im not just trying to make things more fun for mewhy would i want to do that i spend a good chunk of my time running missions solo i want to give people options not force people to do anything its against eves general principleoh hell no that would be ridiculous  the only thing youd lose out on is the bounty i want scrambling to be optional and a tactical decision to make not a requirement and npc that is required to kill would not warp off
a lot to do to with playing till you are exhausted very little with missions i know people that have done that while part of a roaming gang i am always doubtful of the people that say i want to make mining more interesting in the science and industry forum there is a guy that with that idea want us to play han solo dodging asteroids with a mining barge mining can be made more interesting and niphur in the past has give some good suggestion beside other people but making it a joystick game of avoid the asteroid is not it i meant the target not the mission it would be interesting if the target was worth something extra  not necessary straight isk could be lp standing or decent modules  in the exchange to requiring special equipment or if it could be followed to capturekill him a change i would like in mission is to make them less farmable through respawn at dt while i see that sometime it can be needed to redo it  accident happens  keeping a mission open a week and farming it after each dt is really a broken mechanism and one of the worst imbalances in my eyes
we have all seen radical altering of the game mechanics before and i applauded ccp for the continuing endeavor to create a better more enjoyable game that being said since this kind of radical change is becoming the norm ccp needs to serve its customer base better and explore a method for characters to alter their past choices without being able to exploit that mechanic like other changes to game mechanics the ability to undo bad choices  or choices that were rendered bad of no control of your own  needs to be part of the evolution of eveccp needs to think about how to compensate players who have spent a lot of time training for a specific effectgame concept only to have them fundamentally altered simply saying just train something else is no longer a reasonable approach  not that it ever was reasonable for just one small example characters who have trained to use a skirmish mindlink trained for specific effects now some of those specific effects may be fundamentally changed im not attempting to discuss the utility of an agility boost vs a speed boost i simply saying that players that trained to get a speed boost did not decide to train for an agility boost khanid ship changes are another example again this has nothing to do with whether the changes make the shipsmods better or worse the point is that players made specific choices based on criteria that were changed but were not offered any recourse to change their choices this amounts to a bait and switch i believe this point can also be applied to concepts like speed tanking etcagain i dont mind an evolving game but i simply feel that if ccp is going to alter the game there needs to be a mechanic to alter your character perhaps you could train for a limited respec or something like that options would have to be explored but they need to be explored and explored in an honest and forthright manner
i dont see how you could possibly do this without either1 leading to abuse on a large scale2 requiring large amounts of manpowerwhat if something involving production was nerfed and i made an argument that all of my productionrelated skills should be changed into something else i have a very high int and memory and a low perception and willpower  by wanting my production skills changed into gunnery skills i would be effectively be unfairly gaining sp because 6 months of training in production skills could equal a year of training in gunnery skills you could have an automated system recalculate this based off of the attributes involved but this still leaves problems with skills that may have been trained before learning skillson the other hand a manual system would require gms to handle each request individually and assuming that only 5 wants to take advantage of this feature an extra twelve thousand petitions would slow things down for the rest of us considerably
i feel like being a production character now but its ok because tomorrow i can fly recons and the next day ill have fleet command vno specialization is final it requires sacrifice and involves the minor risk of changes in game mechanics
yay then i can respec shadow instead of holy for that big raid on black temple this weekendeve is supposed to represent real life to a certain degree and among those reflections is the fact that skills and abilities dont magically appear in your mind and there is no trainer in the capital cities that waves a magic wand and makes them all go away againwhen is the last time you woke up and forgot how to drive your car how to operate the machinery at work or how to tie your shoesskills dont just poof out of your head except during a bad clone copy procedure and even then the effects are random theres no calling the operator and asking for kung fu or how to pilot a titan
he has a valid point if a change is so large that it no longer resembles what it once did the skirmish might not be a good a good example if the skirmish was changed to only affect mwd or ab speed and not base speed or if rorqs bonus was changed to shield instead of mining it might be worth considering something like this  fundamentally different  a change that alters it only slightly i woundt support i also would prefer some idea of how to accomplish this goal before i support
i dont agree the car you drove yesterday operates in still the same way today as it will tomorrowif overnight you need a different skillset due to someone changing the rules of the game you should get the oportunity to get those skills overnight as wellcould be done on a one time change skill option in the charpannel that gets enabled after a major up from ccp some other mmos have this option build in the game so i dont see why ccp couldnt implement something similar skills are only a table in a db and it should not involve manual intervention from anyone
because eve isnt like other mmos and our skill system does not work like that of other games this will never be implemented it is a terrible idea
its the only game i know where in the middle of the party the rules get changed this suxx donkeyballs so if the rules get changed in the middle of the game i think reskilling your char without waisting time to start all over again is a justified request
i completely disagree with the intention in the title of this thread this is eve choices have consequences if you chose something that was overpowered and gets balanced latter you had your fun now figure out what is still broken and keep on traininghowever i am for a buff to the time it takes to train skills though my current plan on evemon is like 10 years long
obviously this is the first time ccp has ever decided to change the game in a way that hurt the fotm nano users should get their skills refunded because there was no precendent for fotm getting nerfednone at allexcept about once a year when a new one gets killedreally you made a choice you get consequences no different then dual mwd myrmidon gallente recon nos etc
funny thing though the game hasnt changed yet this will not be an issue once the speed nerf is adjusted after play test dont worry about respeccing yet the speed nerf will come prebuffed in the test mode before it is implemented on tranquilityrefer to first line of the devblog again
this is not the first major gameplay change  nerf  which has been brought into the game rendering thousands of players months of training near useless or at least completely different from why they were originally trainedstill respeccing is a bad idea for eve though the gameplay does not remain static your skills make your character and give the game that measure of permanence no other mmo really has
its not my intention to evangelize people to my point of view different people always have different opinions i would however like to make a few things about my perspective clear1  this is a proposal given a growing trend not a response to a specific issue ccp has made significant changes to facets of the game before and i doubt it will be the last time i am simply arguing that if this is to become a trend then ccp should consider options to mitigate undesirable side effects for example the khanid ship changes were rather significant and affected characters unevenly some characters were entirely unaffected while others had skilled to fly ships that effectively no longer existed2  i want to make it absolutely clear that i am not suggesting some kind of painless option to totally reset your character i expect that there would be significant but reasonable requirements for altering limited aspects of your character tbh i would be perfectly happy to see a limited option only become available in response to a major game changei really dont want to dictate how skill reclamation system would work that is for ccp to decide ill give an example below just to give some idea of scope i dont expect it to work that way its just an example of what i mean by limited3  i fully realize there would be significant difficulties to implement such a change but i doubt the are insurmountable finding an appropriate mechanic with appropriate restrictions may not be an easy task but neither is creating expanding and balancing an mmo in the first placejust one rhetorical point to some of the comments made eve is a game it should be fun and as fair as possible eve is not some kind of life simulator or replacement for real life achievements i summarily reject any argument that appeals to eve being like real life i could beat this point to death but thats is a separate discussionexampleagain this is just and example to clarify scope im not arguing for this particular method and mechanicyou want to reclaim skirmish warfare specialist  you have level 5  to do so you must train a special reclamation skill and you must reclaim the entire skill ie you cannot just reclaim one level of the skill the time it will take to perform the reclamation training is based on the rank level and primarysecondary attributes of the skill being reclaimed1 the rank of the reclamation training is equal to the skill reclaimed2 the primary attributes for the reclamation skill are the same as the skill reclaimed3 the level time is one level less than the reclaimed skill in this example the total time to reclaim skirmish warfare specialist at level v would be equal to the amount of time your character would need to train a rank 5 skill based on charismawill from level 3 to level 4once you were done you would receive a bank of skill point that could be spent on any skill that had the same primary and secondary attributes dont forget you lose skirmish warfare specialist completely  though it could be retrained latter if you wish obviously you could not undercut prerequisites anyway i only provide the example to show that im not talking about some wildly easy way to just remake your character i am talking about a method that would allow you to shift your characters focus within reason and at the cost of some lost training timefor example this would allow you to trade mechanical engineering v to particle physics v at the cost of some training time but it would not allow you to trade mechanical engineering v for amarr cruiser v in any way shape or form
op no just nolast sunday after having a 26er of rye and a halfbottle of red wine the night before
anyway i see that no one likes my ideaits all good ill live and ill give up on this thread after this postthat being said i have to reply to just one post it has almost nothing to do with the thread but i always get a chuckle from people who appeal to real life to justify some aspect of a game world this guy may be trolling but there are those out there who actually think along these linesso when was the last time you woke up and you car was suddenly a snowmobile the analog has happened in eve eg a turret ship suddenly becomes a missile boatwhen was the last time your body was destroyed but your neural mappings were instantly documented at the moment of your death and transported at faster than light speeds to be deposited in a clonewhen was the last time you flew in a ship with massively sophisticated computers that cant seem to do simple things like automatically lock targets without employing some kind of giant secondary computer system that is modularly interchangeable with a howitzerwhen was the last time you plugged into a skill book that taught you how to fly a space battleshipwhen was the last time you were able to remove or install 1600 millimeters of armor plating on an entire ship in the blink of an eye oh and btw that armor is modularly interchangeable with a target tracking systemwhen is the last time you were able to repair tons of armor in a few seconds using empty space and nano repair botsit is a game and things that defy the logic of real life are accepted all the time because it makes the game experience more enjoyable and fair repeat after me you are not a super cool nigh invincible spaceship pilotyou are some guy  or chick  who plays eve
ok one last posti find it odd that no one bats an eye at characters being bought and sold so players can gain or trade access to new shipsmods but everyone seems to think it is unacceptable for someone to be able alter his or her own character where is the logic in thatalrightseriouslyim done now
first off i do not troll i just vary my input to threads based upon the legitimacy andor the repetition of the topic this respeccing for instance has been talked about numerous times with similar rejection each timei dont think that your car has become a snowmobile however i do think there was an overnight recall on your transmission and now you have an automatic instead of a standard that doesnt mean you get to just erase how to drive a standard those skills will be with you forever now youll just have to relearn how to operate the car with an automatic insteadspaceships fittings repairs thats all game mechanics as you pointed out and given the setting 40000 years in the future entirely plausible besides its the same with any mmo some may have elves wearing armor and carrying shields this one has frigates wearing armor and carrying lasersbtw i am a super cool spaceship pilot
no
alright learning skills as they are suck the skill system in eve is nice because its flexible and youre always training towards something useful personally ill be damn happy a week from now because ill be able to use t2 medium guns i remember the same feeling when i hit electronics upgrades v and could start training for my covops working towards that next desired skill and watching as it changes your gameplay is part of what makes eve so appealingenter learning skills learning skills grind this to a halt the choice for newbies isnt hmm i do want to train to use this awesome new module or get into a destroyer or get myself connections to do level 2 missions there is no choice really theyre told that unless they spend weeks training up learning skills theyll be gimped later on as such it makes the early part of eve well ing boring yeah of course you can stagger the learning skills and not do it all at once but youre still wasting a load of time training some boring skill that only serves as a means to slow them down as they try to get into evelearning skills flat out suck and if i recall correctly ccp doesnt like them either however how do you remove them without making it unfair to vets whove trained all those skills upits pretty simple firstly remove the learning skills from the game refund all points that people have spent into learning skills and put them in a pool that can be distributed instantly to any other skill they want no sp wasted from there add 610 to all attributes for everyone to make up for the lack of learning skills
i support the ideadiscussion currently going on
you really think they are going to count the 34 of the alts voting in your speednerf threadsi really dont think they will especailyl when they actually check how many are a few days old   and if you really want votes to count then they are going to have to do a search on every character to see how old they are and if they are actually viable as a voterjust like real lifeguess your vote will fail at that point
votes are per account not per character and are automatically counted numbnuts
nobody that plays eve has alt accounts
guess what each one of those votes cost 15 usd a month so why does the pronerf have 18 and the antinerf have 40 maybe because the antinerf represents the year playerbase that have dedicated to the game invested billions in ships and implants and second accounts and because the pronerf typically is made of 3month drake and raven pilots that just joined the biggest blob alliance that would let them in ever vote is valid get over yourself
can i just remind you arlenna  that whatever changes ccp make to the game resulting from these proposed changes  the people who fly nano ships now and are engaged in pvp on a daily basis  will still be good pvpers and you will still be fly safeovelve
or maybe it is just because people are more likely to speak out if they have something to lose and find it hard to consider what is best for the game rather than their own selfish interestsi think this nerf is a needed one and i am a beta vet  so your arguement isnt all that strong is it
i think the votes against are only higher because all the nanos double as forum whiners
i see no reason to believe that one side of the debate would be using alts more than the other nanolovers and nanohaters both feel passionately about this issue and i imagine theres about the same ratio of people on both sides who will cast three votes per account instead of one thus even if the raw numbers are misleading thesupport ratios should not be of course ccp needs to fix the voting system in many ways one per account highest among them but the vote is not illegitimate just because the system is imperfect
im pretty sure this is already the case  try and support something with one character and then try and do it with an alt on that account ill try it now actually
i is be alt
well thats a little annoying
adjustments to researchmanufacturing interface at pos csms please bring this to the attention of ccp we need some streamlininghangar  interface changes  simple 
well im gonna send this back to the top
luv ya jade
which one of you support the ninja salvagers im having trouble trying to figure this one out since everyone ive talked to seems to immediately turn carebear on me
i never really got that bit of the argument actually surely carebear would be supporting a game position where people steal other peoples stuff and because its hisec they cant actually do anything about it wasnt i supporting a position where by the carebears in the op  hisec mission runners  could actually shoot at ninja salvagers if they were so inclined and thereby throw down the gauntlet for a pvp confrontation why not ninja salvage some guys wrecks in a combat ship from time to time just to let them know what happens if you get tired of losing your dessy just a thought
nozh is a tool and should be fired so should whoever hired the asshat
this fix is too roughsuch work is impermissible for gamedesigner
in b4 hurr zulubird
yep people moaned they got what they wanted and tbh even though im a nano user i just think its gonna be just as fun to change the way we play the only people who will be affected are those who can only play one way
cant this topic just be locked already its pathetic
why is it pathetic looks more like folks wanting some answers is all  although some could be better written  
your post just shows that you are an ingnorant whiner who doesnt understand the game or doesnt have the skill to combat nano ships i agree some speed mods needed looking into but the nerf is way over the top and is a major blow to the minnie race ive been playing eve for 4 years and i believe ccp are losing touch with what eve was intended to be the last year i have seen some absolutly stupid ideas that ccp have tried to introduce into the game and it seems as if they dont even play the same game as we do surely they must see how this will encourage blobbing and they must already know that the servers cant handle huge fightspos warfare in its current form means masses of players are needed this change will just mean that masses of players will be needing for other aspects of the game aswel people claim that roaming was just as easy before nanos but that was when there was 20k less players on the server jump bridges werent even a twinkle in the eye and cap ships werent dropped on every 5 man inty gang like today if the patch does go live the skill involved in eve will just be dumbed down so much it wont be worth playing ccp need to wake up and get some devs who actualy understand the game to start making the descions
the lot of you whiners have your tinfoil hats so securly welded on that you cant read what has actually been said in the proposed changeshere is a quick recap1 current achivable speed breaks the physics enginethats right the speeds currently obtainable are causing program level damage that means they will get corrected2 gurillia warfare thats the nano fleets or some succesful equivilant will not be removed from the gamein other words you will still be able to raid in 003 there will be a month of playtesting before anything goes liveso get on the test server and proove to ccp that the proposed changes will wreck the game take a quick breather castigate yourself for training the fotm realize that nano isnt being removed or nerfed into the stone age its being balanced a reason to fit afterburners is being added and the webscram will no longer be instant death you nano monkies should be estatic about thatthe mere fact that mwd are nearly required modules shows you the current state of afairs is broken can nano be countered sure absolutly can it be countered with a kill by nonnano only if you have a ddd all other nano counters end in the nano ships leaving unharmed unless their pilots make a critical errorthat state of afairs while livable is not balanced so tuck and roll for gods sakes if you want serious input on the nano changes you wont get them here get on the test server and see for yourselves what they will be like hell you might like itgalan
i logged onto sisi briefly earlier to test out the blaster paradox this patch will createdeimos  t2 blasterswith the mwd change the web change blasterships have no chance
really need to get some of the devs that moved over to work on emovampires back
yep that means extreme speeds though whereas the current singularity build is pretty much halfing the speed of all mwd cruisers what that actually does at the moment is bring everything into killzone for amarrian laser boats and missiles so what weve seen so far is a return to battleships online from year two of the game and an effective nerf on all small ships not just the extreme nano performance that actually did break the game physics engine its worth being informed on these things its one thing to say that its quite another to actually do it and the reality is that the current nerf on speed is pretty much removing guerrilla warfare from the game in 00 sovereignty regions this is the direct impact on removing speedbased evasion possibility before addressing broken sovereignty mechanics and fixing alternatives like black ops and distributed small gang objectives this isnt news to us and its why the csm voted 30 issues to immediate ccp consideration ahead of speed nerfingno you really cant in npc sov raiding will be hot drops of caps burn eden style cloaking gate camps cloaking recons or large rr battleship groups in player sov you can scratch the hot drops  cyno jammers  and largely scratch rr battleship groups since hostile jump bridge networks can instantly drop an entire regions worth of blobbers on your head while dictors hics and bubbles cut off all escape ultimately it leaves us with burn eden style cloak and gank tactics and thats about it  ravens hyenas and sabres with falcon ecm support  guess what the next hot topic will be for extra points well lets just say speed ships arent doing so well on the test server at the moment battleships are instadeath  a blob of battleshipsbc sat on a gate firing at your ship whilst it toodles away at 1500mps really id advise you to go test this for yourself on sisi actually warp a ship  any ship  into the ffa beacon with an active battleship group sat on the beacon and try and get away then imagine this is 00 and as well as the damage they have a hic bubble and a couple of rapiers with multiple webs perhaps you do genuinely feel that 00 sov regions should be impossible to pass if so then fair enough thats your point of view and you are welcome to it but lets not pretend this speednerf will allow roving pvp in 00 it really wontim afraid that is just simple illinformed nonsense
i never suggested it wasnt worth being informed have you heard that they are pleased with the current results and plan to go live with all changes that would be something to get up in arms about if not please keep playtesting and provide that valuable feedback it also helps to post in leiu of that feedback and not with the constant stream of oh noes 111 nano thats been the norm hereso the csm feels a change correcting a broken physics engine is less important than thirty other things how many of them are breaking aspects of the game codeso here is the question will the current status of nano break the intended sov fix if it would then i imagine a nano fix would have to come first again since we dont know what the final fix will be at this point panic is unwarented and that necisitates panic play it out offer meaningful suggestions and quit acting like they are killing your babyim not pretending anything im stating the intended results direct from ccp nozhs devblog ccp has a pretty good track record of achiving balance with broken aspects of combat nos and ecm being prime examplesits interesting that you give roughly half in one example and 1500ms in another since when is half of 75kms 15kms since in your example im jumping into the worst possible senerio alone i submit i ought to die in that senerio with a cloaked pilgrim i might not though heres an equally balanced example for you take any straw man you want and jump into my burning barn if you get out without being incenirated straw is clearly overpowered nerf strawman o really i must have been sleeping the last three years in game tell me then since im such fail how do you kill a nano ship without a nano ship or a ddd unles the nano pilot makes a catastrophic errorim waiting what aside from nano kills nano not runs it off kills itgalan
understandably people are going to be angry if speed is nerfed and people are going to be angry if it isnthowever the above statement argues against one fundamentally strong and powerful point put forth by the devblog and the devblog can be explained by logicships that use nano builds are fast decrease damage through speed and are agilenano builds are fundamentally flawed when combined with modules and rigs that make the ship faster than drones missiles and turret tracking speedsthereforeships that use nano builds are fundamentally flawed because when they are combined with modules and rigs that make the ship faster than drones missiles and turret tracking speeds they markedly decrease damage and are too agilethe problem is in the root many people say the root of this case are nanos and other modules that decrease weight by a percentage the problem is that if you affect the root you affect the entire tree every ship that uses nanosmwd or other modules will be affected yes ccp speed does need to be nerfed a bit the ships that rely on speed need a fix but if the roots are to be looked at one must look at what thatll do to the rest of the treethis proposed patch will probably be one of the biggest in terms of impact as its effects will hinder help and hamper hundreds of thousands in a very big way this time we have to get it right the first timeccp no ubernerf then eventual pump pleaseplayers quit the smacktalk and help out instead of whiningwe need to look at this carefullywe need to look at this with dedicationwe need to look at the future of eves warfareand if all comes crashing down in a conflagration of hatewe need to look at what went wrongthe future gentlemen is in our hands
all ccp need to do is reduce the bonuses ods polycarbs and snake sets give to speed doing what they plan to do doesnt just affect nano ships it will affect nearly every ship in the game its simp and does what they want to be done without screwing over close range boats in the process
maybe instead of a nerf they should introduceboost a mod drone whatever that can effectivly be used against nanoships i mean in real life you wouldntcant make a technology worse you would develop something to counter it balance game but with a forward approachjust an idea
part of the problem is the number of ways that can be used to make a ship faster it gets expensive but the bonus is clearly worth itthis part of the probelm is being solved with large changes to the various totals possible when these methods are combinedif the goal there is to bring all ships to a new maximum potential speed an alternate solution would simply be to set a maximum speed each hull can atain leave the modules and implants and whatnot alone but allow them only to take an individual hull so far the remaining slots no longer useful for nano can be fitted with modules to make the new ship more dangerous so you can get all your speed from implants and then have a tank and dammage mods in your lowsultimately nothing is set in stone and it will be playtested extensivly so if you are worried get on the test serverthe seccond problem is making the ab more useful this is partially accomplished with the 2pt scram  no mwd portion and partially accomplished with the webber nerfboth will add an interesting new adaption to speedtank ships the main complaint is that blaster boats will suddenly be helplessnearly all combat occurs within 20km small blasterboats will need to be speced for speed so they can still run down oponents they will benifit from not losing their speed totally when close to large vesselslarge blaster boats can swap that web mid slot for a targeting computer with a range script it may take more than one module but they will be able to get range if they cant be made to work consistantly then play test again will show this and we may see an adjustment to the blaster falloff rangegalan
totally supporting this would go into detail but op said it all
fw is a stain on the underwear of this game until all factions are included
even if they added all the factions to fw tomorrow the issues being raised would still exist just for more factionscharactersplayers how about you take a chill pill and stop trolling
i agree with may of the ideas here
i support this ideaif it was on the csm agend in iceland what has come of itab
absolutely yes
supported oh yeah
i know the game cannot be balanced as there is no such thing in a game such as this i am only asking that they work to correct items that are clearly broken they have added alot of features and i am suggesting that they take some time to place more emphasis on correcting a few things that are obviously broken do not ask me for exaples just look through this forum features and ideas and other relavent threads they also need to take some time to look over the games core codeing and see if there are any ways they can rewrite it to be faster and more stable
i think this is making mining much to complex changing the asteroid belts to exploration sites would be sufficient and i like the idea of a prospecting ship it would definitely be needed to provide a reliable way to find belts to mine i am not sure whether i like the idea of publishing the location of the asteroid belts as people take time to find them and do not want everyone just leeching off their work but then again it might be harder for newer players to get into mining without any exploration experience here is a post of mine in another thread that i think could provide a nice change to mining
this is why belts should never be completely relegated to exploration sites onlywhen the systems were initially surveyed they placed the beacons to make sure they could get back to the belts easier thats why theyre blantantly obvious on the overviewi dont quite think the solution to mining boredom is complicating the current process i think its adding more content on top of the existing1  mineral rich fast moving comets while it might be more profitable to chew them up with your hulk youll need an abmwd to stay in range meaning the challenge is balancing cargo space and mining efficiency with speed for pursuit2  a modification to constantly having to find belts is the idea of exhausting a location why would a belt wiped clean suddenly appear full the next day or why would a moon never run dry and collapse in on itself heavily mining a particular system could drastically alter the ecology when moons start disappearing and pos have to pick up and move on
id have to agree with this hence why i modified the idea to keep the existing belts in place like you said newbie miners do need somewhere to mine what i would do however is remove the enhanced versions of the ores from the belts and move these to exploration sites so you could go to a current belt and make a small profit off basic ores or you could go hunting for better belts using the exploration system and make a better profit thus rewarding you if youre willing to put in the effort to find these sitessounds like a really good idea more varied content is definately welcomeagreed resource depletion should definately be something that people have to be aware of hence why only a certain proportion of asteroids should respawn at each downtime as opposed to the current system where all of them respawnas to moons setting each moon to have a respawn rate as well as a current quantity for each mineral on that moon would maek things more interestingfor example moon x contains titanium and cobalt both have a maximum quantity of 24000 units and a recharge of 50 units per hour you set up a pos to mine the titanium and succeed in keeping the process running 247 with these figures you extract 100 units per hour and the mineral recharges at 50 units so net depletion of 50 units per hour you can keep this mining going for 480 hours  20 days  before the moon will be depleted of that mineral you then trade over to cobalt for the next 20 days while the titanium rebuilds up to maximumthis gives meaning to the mineral abundance figure most moons have this as a factor of 1 however a moon with a factor of 2 would recharge the mineral at twice the normal rate  100 units instead of 50 units  on one of these moons you could effectively mine indefinately as the depletion rate would match the recharge ratehaving said this this is a seperate idea and probably deserving of a thread of its own
1 learning is a necessary waste of timeit usually takes a person two weeks to complete learning skills in that two weeks said person will have to learn more about eve and game mechanics than he will have to in the next three or four months of his evelife why is this two weeks important its the trial by fire for  allegedly  new players eve is a cold world it mimics too much of the real world because pilots are allowed to scam cheat steal as long as that particular action does not involve an exploit or against the eula about 60 of new players come to eve never make it pass the trial by fire it is a good thing look at the other alternative wow2 whining is human natureyou do it i do it hesheit does it quit whining about me whining3 eve stands for evolution  not the corp ugh pilots in eve evolve everyday from a frigate pilot into a cruiser pilot from a cruiser pilot into a bs pilot or a specialized interdictor pilot its the core of eve that dictate the game sometimes the game reach a period of stagnant evolution slows down and we stuck with massive blob of hundreds of players cold war between two powerhouses alliance after alliance pour their resources in supercapital ships but somewhere in the galaxy in some dark corner of space one pilot come up with a tactic now widely known as nanogotry which involve small number of pilots fitting exclusive for speed for hitandrun operation deep in the enemy territories this cycle of evolution this mutation has spread most pilots adapt to this tactic some stand resilient against it most fail and whine some succeed and hold their heads highsoon nanogotry will no longer be the trendy thing to do this tactic will mutate to something else for better or for worse and the cycle of evolution continues to turnthis aint burger king you cant always have it your way
increasing the roidsizes is more then just adding more ore in them if they were to do that then prices on minerals would drop even more then they already havei have no trouble finding any roids to mine we set up our hq in a system with 12 belts and 1 ice belt and there is always roids to mine even in a hulk altho some times there isnt enough for 1 complete cycle per roid but then i just mine something else that is usefuli think you should get a fast ship equip a survey scanner and do a tour of the nearby systems and you will find plenty of belts to mine no need to go to low or nullsec either
as the title implies im quite intrigued by the timing of this nano rebalancing with the establishment of the csm we have been given the capability to raise issues and put them to the vote in the assembly hallmost people will be aware there are two threads on the nano issue one for people who support the changes and another for those againstits safe to say that those against are presently way ahead in terms of votes but does that mean that ccp will drop their plans or at least take it back to the drawing board due to the obvious opposition to the substance of the recent dev blogi guess the broader question is will the idea of the csm and a more democratic process for taking this game forward prove to have been a charade if ccp choose to ignore the obvious concerns of many players and push on with the changes regardless for the record i voted against the changes not because i dont think nanos need to be looked at but i do think ccp have gone way overboard this time 
i was going to post to this on the subjects of invulnerability and balance but as i dont pvp and my understanding of speed tanking is not even close to 100 i will leave the field to those who know what they are talking about  
yes thats an interesting pointim the first to concede that my understanding of game mechanics is far below that of the devs after all its their job  but im also often impressed by the knowledge of our player base concerning these issues some of whose rebuttals in similar debates read like technical reports from some kind of scientific studywhat interests me more though is whether ccp are going to be true to the democratic principles of the csm and listen to the concerns of many ppl over these changes or not
frankly i dont think this is a situation that calls for democracy the point of the csm system is to bring concerns to the developers not to vote on whether to reject proposed changesit would be pretty ridiculous to run the games development on a series of proposalvetocounterproposal iterations the playerbase needs to come up with solid recommendations and specific changes to what ccp has laid out  thats what the csm was designed for unscientific polling is simply a distractioni have read plenty of great analysis from players who are actually on the test server experimenting with the proposed changes and seeing what works and what doesnt but what we need is a csm counterproposal that specifically collects and outlines the findings of the players in an effective simple and easy to read formatit doesnt matter how many supports an antinerf thread gets  that just isnt constructive and theres nothing ccp can do with that info except assume that its just the standard antinerf whine and tune it out as background noise if we expect the csm to have any impact on this particular issue it must be with highly specific and reasoned arguments not with noise
i agree theres a danger to unscientific polling as you say and im not expecting ccp to throw the whole proposal in the bin just because of the uproar that would be irresponsible im just wondering if they will take the opposition into account otherwise whats the point you cant deny that ccp are attempting to introduce at least a basic democratic principle with the csm and i applaud them for it but i also feel that its over issues like this that the whole thing will stand or fallif its function is simply as you say then the next appropriate meeting of the csm will have to raise this with the developers as a key issue if only due to the sheer number of people lining up on both sides of the argument my point really is will ccp listen to the genuine concerns that people have raised not whether votes in the assembly hall should be the deciding factor on game balancing which would be nuts
but what exactly will they raise to ccp thats more my point  right now we just have these for and against threads that do not accomplish anything by way of generating specific feedback the csm has nothing to bring to ccp at this point except the fact that many people supported an antinerf thread what good is thatthe genuine concerns cant be listened to until they are clearly and concisely expressed and that has not yet been done my point really is that the opposition cannot be taken into account until they present a clear counterproposal at present opposition to the nerf is far too vague to be worth discussing it has to coalesce into something debatable
the developers are obviously the people that will come up with the right solution to the problem of ludicrous speed in the end they are naturally in the best position to do so i wouldnt expect a player to be able to come with a counter proposal that would be as feasible as someone who is paid to do that job  unless they were a developer for another mmo perhaps who happens to play eveand who could blame them  but neither do i think it should be all or nothing where a dev blog is posted and everyone just has to accept it without question of course ccp are well within their rights to do this but i for one dont support those methods especially when a mechanism has been introduced that is supposedly intended to give the player base a real and meaningful input into game developmenti feel that i should clarify that i have no particular vested interest in the nano issue i have benefited from their use and also suffered at its hands even though admittedly i voted against in this particular antinerf thread i simply weighed up the pros and cons of the proposal as i saw them and made my decision thats what does interest me the vision and promise behind the csm i really hope that the council is a success as i believe a sucessful exchange between the player base and its developers which lead to real improvements in this game could act as a positive example for other mmos none of which to my knowledge have a similar institutioni feel the csm represents a unique opportunity for its representatives to raise the concerns of the player base formally to game developers then taking these concerns into account the developers can use their expertise to act on them if the csm is reduced simply to the orbit of bug hunting and proposing minor fixes i fear it will become a hollow process and wont live up to the expectations of many players who have become genuinely engaged in the process
yes but simply saying many players dont like these changes isnt meaningful input and currently that is all the voting threads are saying if the csm is to have a meaningful impact on this particular development issue they and the playerbase need to quickly move beyond supportreject and get into highlighting the specific problems that are solved and created by the proposal based on real analysis and active testing by the playerbasei guess my point is that demanding action from the csm on the basis of the vague polls is not productive we as the playerbase still have not yet provided them with real meat to work with and it is still our responsibility to present something meaningful for them to escalate to ccp a broad disatisfaction with the devblog is not a valid issue for escalation in my opinion
if you read the threads a decent number of the posts are actual argument instead of just a thumb and maybe some swearing aimed at the other side its not all by any means but its enough to sort of understand what the various opinions are on the topic the poll is unscientific yes but its the best weve got and its at least quantitative which is better than the precsm method of conducting similar threads on eve general
i just dont think a poll of players no matter how accurate is a suitable indicator of the justness of a balance issue it is an old saying that what is popular is not always right and what is right is not always popularthe way to impact a design plan like this is through reasoned argument and that can be done without tallying polls at all  and id point out that that is the very purpose of the csm  to act as a filter and pluck good ideas out from the background noise of the forums  the council members ought to be swayed by the strength of the arguments rather than the weight of numbers in a poll thats all im saying and i object to the notion that the nanonerf issue is a test of democracy for all of those reasons
ive been reading and contributing lots of feedback in the test server forum and ive run across several posts from ccp devs stating that suggest they arent looking for approval from the playerbase but that they are instead interested in feedbackbelieve it or not a lot of issues are being raised by players and answered by ccp already in just two daysmany of the issues brought up in the posts of those opposed are already said to being looked intoive been vocal that i do not think it is the csms place to oppose eve developer decisions despite explicitly stating attention the modifications discussed below are all subject to change based on player input and testing experiencethis is a playtester issue atm ccp has asked for and is looking for testers and feedback from the test server at this time and if you look through the most recent dev posts they are clearly quite annoyed by all of the flippant unhelpful repliesno doubt the 100 page of agree is not what ccp is interested in at this time
simplebring in the team of tourney commentators  experts if you will  and leave things in thier hands i would happily trust whatever recommendations they made over any csm member anywayeditand would live with the results without complaining but then againas they actually know something about eve combat operations in totali would rest pretty easy knowing the game wasnt going to be dumbed down furtherill put that in my expanded bio
its really good that youre highlighting this concern lavista if i can make a bold suggestion  the csm should just refuse to discuss ship balancing issues periodtrying to collect all the ship issues into one document is just going to obscure the real problem in a sea of frivolous complaints taking them one at a time and trying to determine which concerns are legit and which ones arent is going to waste the councils timeccp wants you to act as a filter so i suggest simply filtering out all ship balance issues  the worst case scenario is that something legitimately broken with a ship doesnt get raised to ccp but if you try to take up these sorts of issues you run the very real risk of wasting time that could be spent on the true big picture items that ccp wants the csm to be bringing to them
lavista this is a crosspost from warpdriveactivecomi agree with you that the csm in its current form might not be the best place to deal with detailed microlevel game issues like ship balancing i think there are bigger issues for the csm to be concerned with  and they should be the focus of the councilwhen important political issues get raised by citizens in their country they are discussed and widely debated by their political representatives and in the press however this is rarely at the level of detail of an exact amount a particular tax incentive should be set at or the precise amount of money which should be paid as a benefit to one group or another these details are worked out by the civil servants the unbiased subject matter experts who are not part of the political parties the people and their representatives debate the bigger ideasi guess my comparison is pretty obvious in my mind ccp are the civil servants of eve those with the detailed and  crucially  neutral view on the mechanics of a particular detailed aspects of the game  and perhaps with a better understanding of some of the wider issues a small change here or there may makeby comparison the csm should be about discussing the bigger ideas the widerreaching aspirations of the playerbase in evespecifically relating to ship balancing issues i think that the csm could usefully discuss a more streamlined channel as you mentioned in your post  but that you should otherwise have a handsoff approach if you attempted to act as arbitrators between ccp and those on the forums calling for x or y ship to be boosted or nerfed i think that the csm could become perpetually bogged down in those issues and never able to achieve its full potential to look at the bigger picturevm
vestik is right on  well said
very wellwritten post indeedbut here is something that makes me wonder i tend a link to this thread on the csm mailinglist but its only ankh who has actually responded what is up with that
they probably dont think it was worth posting out of lack of support but that was a rhetorical question right
hey how about this identify a thread that has adequate suportcsm does not vote or debate fix of shipssend it to the dev who works on these types of issues exclusivley in a tldr format  another words the guy that works on this crap day in and day out can quickly identify if there is a problem or not and leave it up to him to essculate it csm is still representing the player base and not sending in niggling issues to teh devs that are expecting different content
one obvious question springs to mind if ccp doesnt want to talk about balancing issues with the csm and the csm doesnt want to talk about balancing issues with ccp then why the hell did it get brought up in iceland who put it on the schedule and why was it just miscommunication and if so just address it for next time and if it wasnt discussed for any great length of time then the system seems to be working properly asis i dont want you wasting your time with issues that everybody agrees to be minor or even merely unarguable but banning balance discussions and things like that are really heavyhanded solutions to something that im not convinced is a problem the csm exists to discuss all everelated issues not just the vision stuff dont cut off a large swath of that just because its inconvenient  deemphasize it sure but dont eliminate it entirely

it is clear to me that this is a hot topici was really undecided in this as a rulethere are many ways to counter nanoships that nobody really wants to do because it requires coordination and brains to do itthe arguments on both sides are very compelling but it is clear to me just looking at these 2 threads that the playerbase has spokenlooks to me like the majority is against this nerf so i will support this motion that has no weight anyhow  ccp will do it no matter what is said

its true that nanos need to be nerfed and reworked but ccp has taken it way too far instead of spending time to think up a way of balancing things around the system that already exists they would rather bash everyting with the nerf bat till its totaly unrecognizable and redo the whole thing and basicaly say screw everyoen who has invested time and isk into the current system so against 100

im not particularly likely to create an alt but the thing that puts me off the idea the most is what youve said having to go back and mess with all those shortduration trainingsbut how about a simpler solution letting the chosen skill train continually until it hits level 5thats crude and lacking in sophistication but usually if a skill is worth training from 2 to 3 it is also worth training from 3 to 4
i love this idea
ive made extensive use of the possibility of dark training having been unsubscribed for 4 nonconsecutive months in order to train 4 hardcore skillz from level 4 to level 5 in the 16 months that ive been an eve player so fari believe im pretty much done with dark training now but it has been a great option to have and im sure that many players appreciate it ccp should think twice before they nerf dark training although theres no reason to boost it by allowing skill queues to be utilized while unsubscribed

i actually had a very long conversation with an excorpmate about how i was instinctively against nerfing or any other brand of balancing i went on to say that id be joining him in opposing the speednerf to be honest my resentment stems from the absolute castration of the arazu due to balancing they made it a cloaking cabbage thats only ever used for sitting at the back of the class wearing a dunces hat in recon gangs or scouting the opposition and staying cloaked as they slaughter your gang damps yes im afraid they are sir very damp indeed try a kleenexthe point of mentioning this was that ive always been of the impression that nerfing causes far more issues than it was ever designed to solve and compounds issues of balance its possible to find a use for the arazu you just have to be prepared to look for a while and its possible to beat a gang who are loaded with falcons when you yourself have none you just have to be prepared to think a little and try some offthewall setups to use a wellworn evecliche adapt or diethe problem as so wellstated in the blog  best ive ever read  is that adaptation meant getting nanoed up yourself to the ultimate boredom of all how many times have you seen nomwd  death in setup threads here or on shc aximoatic yep carved in radonspewing granite for us all to read for posterity speed counters speed so were all in inties hacs recons ea frigs and if were really cheap cruisers battleships only for specific engagements in one of my old alliances their use was banned yep battleships were banned for being fatarsed bargesso heres me voting yes for the very wellreasoned changesjust unnerf the arazu while youre at itnoone likes flying a cabbage

yes while the implementation will need balancing and the details ironed out the concept is solid and will provide a lot more ability for tactical fittings with lowerpowered webs larger  turret and hopefully missile  ships will actually require support to take out smaller ships which in my book is definitely a good thing

i would totally eliminate the localintellychat if you want to see people billions miles away you have to scan for it take a recon place some scantower that spread that intellgence infos to your corp or ally but if you roam in the wild you have to riskwhy i cant see rats in belts from the stargate or i cant see complexes without scan for it so i cant see people in system if their ships arent in overviewrange or scan range  if i scan 
a big no for this ideaso now you want to turn this game into who has the most time the most people at the time to enjoy the game
ok here is an idea  which has been stated over and over again  if this is implemented i would expectthe ability to put system scanner modules at poses without sovthat the ship scanner showed only ships that have pilots in them and some kind of iff system where you could ping a ships iff scanner and it would return friend for blue or unknown for neut or hostilelocal beacon counter  ovbiously  because a soverien power over a system with sov controls the gates their members should have an accurate local channel showing everyone since they control the gates and they should know who is in a system anyway
i love this idea i fully support removing local as an intel tool and replacing it with more active means of gathering intelligence ganking someone in your system should be about just watching local for an arrival and keeping an eye on your six should have more involved then popping a cloak every time an unknown pops upmoving the local info into constellation chat is just a step in the right direction as long as im allowed to close both
it is so simple to fix local without getting rid of it completelymake local chat a recent speakers channel instead of an immediate onethen you have a total count but the only faces you see are those that speak you can still gab with all your friends but youll have no idea that some outsider is about unless they choose to start gabbing too
i think nobody should be visible to you in local chat unless they either speak in chat  thereby breaking radio silence  or they are directly in the same grid as you the idea of me knowing whos jumping in and out of the system while im sitting in some belt so many au away is pretty unrealistic
agreed

after reading over everything it looks like people are pretty convinced that custom ships are a good ideaim not saying they arent but how would this change the marketpersonally im not a fan of contracts  and as it is you cant see which rigs are installed in a ship when its contracted to you that said i think that the market will need to be overhauled in order to accomidate the variations of each ship if they are as customizable as some of the posts suggest one dominix could have literally thousands of configurations obviously we dont want to open up our market window to see a listing for each one of these different variations under shipsbattleshipsgallentedominix so how does the market get fixed to handle it
qft i dont think i could have put this more eloquently myself
i want to expand the specialization further by making a char can only have one specialization skill if players want to learn a new spec skill the previous learned spec skill will be removed i hope this will diversify the industry and enhance the niche markettime to consider removed t1 loots and replaced it with resources alloy loot for t1 loot named bpc for named loot and turn everything into players produced market
i lend my support to this initiativei know they are working on it but they need to put more effort into fixing this key problem and less into adding new content that requires more large subsystems to tax the server new content is great necessary even but not at the expense of server performance problems that prevent the grandest of all pursuits in eve fleet warfare
praetor  can i have my thesaurus back now pleaseyou are right in everything you say but like others have said its not like ccp are unaware what does frustrate the hell out of me though is the fact that they  ccp  are working on things like ambulation which can only put more stress on the servers and therefore increase lag even moreif somebody wants to walk around  then let them do so in wow  yes i said it   i prefer my pixels in spaceccp have certainly come up with some good lag reducers and have been flamed for it before people came to appreciate the benefits  we can all live in hope that they have another such ace up their sleeve
ccp if you would like to continue graciously accepting my money every month i want a playable game and when you get into a fight which your game allows and from all appearances is designed for and then you either spend the whole time staring at empty space or disconnect and spend that time staring at a login screen it really seems like im not exactly getting my moneys worth here in my option the situation is clear instead of giving us an update that clogs up the server with empire fighting hows about you spend all that money and time you spent developing that and implementing something more worthwhile to the thousands and thousands of people that live in 00 and fight vastly more meaningful battles now i dont expect lag to go away next update but when you dont even load the field or when fcs dont want to take their fleet against the enemy because the lag would be so bad that it would turn jumpgates in instaloose machines there is clearly more of a problem with the game than ships that can go really fastccp please get the game working to the point where we can actually engage in the types of fights that 00 calls for then add more to the game
fleet battles are partaken in by a minority of the playerbase and lag is basically the most difficult problem there is to fix also fleet battles as they at the moment wouldnt be that much fun even without lag flying around in blobs shooting one target at a timeit would be nice to have no lag for these battles but its not going to happen most likelyboth lag and fun issues would be  will be  see fw  fixed by making the most biggest fleet battles pointless by changing mechanics
reduce lag i want to see fleet fights like this in evenow thats what im talking about
no new content until lag is at least improved doesnt do any good to have piles of new shiny ships that die before your screen even loads
thanks for all the kind and critical words both are absolutely greeted with sincerity and gratitude because this is an issue that affects all of us and drives deep into the core of eves future as the worlds preeminent singleshard mmoit was brought to my attention in another forum that i left out a suggested solution to the lag issue involved with these ever increasing massive fleet battles i deliberately didnt include a suggested fix here to avoid having this thread descend into a debate of what is and is not technically feasible within the constraints of ccps budgeti believe that ccps initial shortsightedness in the early years of eve lead to the current lag fest that occurs on a daily basis although i admit their efforts to correct the situation have resulted in some improvements and are truly herculean however they are bandaids to scale eve to the size it needs to be and what it will become in the future will require totally new thinking about mmo software architecture and hardware deploymenti wrote a plea of emotion to engage us in our passion for what we love  eve online sometimes you need to appeal to people on an emotional level to feed the process of change motivate a mans soul and he will move accordinglythe hardware industry specifically the oems who build the servers eve  and the rest of the world for that matter  uses based on intel andor amd processors have let us down also many providers robust industry applications the world over are lulled into believing that the next thing will fix their performance woes we believe in the almighty predictive powers of moores law to save us from our prior sins of inadequate programming based on flawed assumptions and poor planning for future expansionmoores law doesnt specifically say processing power doubles what gordon moore said was that that the number of transistors that can be inexpensively placed on an integrated circuit is increasing exponentially doubling approximately every two years it is a common mistake to misinterpret moores law and assume it gives us a free ticket to doubled processing power every two years or so as wonderful as that would be however this just isnt the case processing power is also a function of the software doing the processing on the hardware transistorsthis is where i completely agree with how the current status quo came to be ccp definitely planned to be able to forklift upgrade their hardware when new cpus became available and just load the existing eve stackless python implementation on the new servers eve was conceived as a serially threaded application on a scalar processor architecture when at its very conception as a massive singleshard should have been built as as an hpc application with dynamically linked threadlet  microthreads  within a highly parallel stream processor architecture in ccps defense though there are many new concepts and capabilities today that didnt exist when they conceived eve ccp has had to bootstrap their way to success with eve and unfortunately in this business arrangement you cannot build out the best from the very beginning so this current dilemma is completely expected in some waysplanning to do forklift upgrades is an understandable misstep because nobody really wants to rewrite their software all the time its expensive and time consuming however ccp didnt plan perfectly for eves massive growth and the subsequent node scalability necessary for players converging on a single system  node 
at the same time they have subtlety pushed us to higher and higher concentrations of players participating in fleet battles through additional features and functions case in point view the flash graphic at the top of the empyrean age feature page
i like your vision and i imagine that ccp shares it im just rather fatalistic about the whole thing

ive never experienced my drones bumping me out of allignment during warp out good to know about the problem seems like the elimination of collision detection would solve at least four problems1  drone clumping2  ships being bumped by the drones3  computing resource drain by the drones in calculating their individual collision avoidance4  drones navigating around obstacles such as structure and asteroidsnot much to dislike there perhaps its time drones were able to partially phase out of normal space to allow them to pass through things including each other although youd still have to be able to shoot them that would only leave the problem of willful drones going their own way against orderswindjammer
support drones need to work as intened
i fully support thisthe beauty of eve voice is that you do not have to exchange server information cos its liked to the chat channels this is extremely useful when working with allies in factional warfare people who say idiotic statements like ventts  evevoice have obviously never engage in joint operations and therefore cannot speak on the matterhaving fced a number of ops with people outside of corpalliance i know that it is extremely frustrating to spend the majority of your time revealing otherwise sensitive information beyond this it is the worst nightmare of every fc to disconnect and not be able to tell the fleet to continue without them therefore it is essential that an external client should be made especially since the only real reason for integration in the first place was to support the original moneymaking scheme
should have to stay in a corp for atleast 24 hours imo except maybe npc corps
i completely agree i wasnt online for the war but from what ive heard its a total exploit and rediculous
the suggestion of a per player war flag perhaps as kills rights during a war sounds like a pretty good solution to the situation that way you get to streamline the application process allow for quick transfer of players from corp to corp and solve this issue with warring exploits that being said i completely support the cause
i support the op
i agree with desert viper
i also completely agree with desert viper
i agree with desert viper this is an exploit
i agree this is an exploit
i agree total exploit
this is what i would like to see the problem with this exploit is the complete surprise attack that can happen when an application is accepted and the guy next to you can become a war target at the time of his choosinghaving to dock to accept the employment offer would definately fix this
i like these ideas im interested in making the titan a more tactical instrument however id like the value andor impact to continue to justify the large investment requiredi would like to see the doomsday become a defensive aoe effect with reduced or diversified damage the range should be enough to be meaningful i would select 200km  and certainly not full grid  lets change the cooldown to 5 minutes we need to make it a challenge to take one of these downid like the offensive weapons to be tactical in nature my favorite idea at the moment is to create a siege jammer module  only for the titan  while activiated no capital ships on the grid may go into siege or triage mode so the effect is that you can protect your pos from capital blob death at the same time you have to scramble and stay focused to prevent the titan from going down as well these effects might result in more interesting fleet fights i know that we already have blob issues really though i cant think of a suggestion that would eliminate that so if we have blobs lets make them deal with multiple concurrent objectives more tactical options and strategies will add diversity and interest to the fleet engagementscheers m8s
yes a solo player with the work of hundreds to produce and maintain even one titan
actually why not make titans a antibs capital using doomsday becomes like s seige mode gives it massive tracingsig resexp velocity etc bonus making it able to fight bss though hics can go under its gunsjust about everybody wants to see titans in the front line fighting so what about thatotherwise a ew titan is just a capital sized stealth bomber using ew bombs
yes we need moar sheepz not able to hit stuff we dont have that already
i agree that the titan dd in its massive dmg  huge range version and coupled with the tactic of deploying multiple titans is overpoweredi dont disagree with the proposed changes but in order to support the idea i would like to see it more thought through  refinedexpanding on your idea maybe more specialised effects not neccessarily linked to race of titan  as it already gets racial bonus  but maybe link those to titan modules  like siege mods  so that every titan pilot can decide to do these new effects but maybe one titan can do a certain effect  eg your proposed energy neutralization  a little bit better than the other titans this would not only open the possibility of future module balancing  introduction  without entirely changing the ship itself  but also add some options to fitting titans i guess one of those titan modules could very well be a dmg titan mod meaning the dd is kept in a certain way but in future it needs to be focused on one hostile ship  maybe with a limited aoe that could be used vs bs blobs that warp in all together to the same spot nothing to do with your idea but even that the dd is overpowered if it gets removed in its current version the defensive capabilities of a titan need to increase quite a bit in order to not only make them viable to stay on the battlefield and to use whatever new offensive options they get but also to ensure the investment that was needed for all those titans that exist already
youre right it doesnt have to be racial by titan how about making it so any titan can use any one ddd and yeah more than 4 of them isnt a terrible idea either
titans need a massive boost to their guns to where 67 guns would do around 510k dps and be able to track very slow bs then they need their doomsday changed the ideas here are a good start if it was viable to fit guns instead of smartbombs if committing a titan to a battle meant you not only get his bonuses but hes actually useful beyond his dd if hotdropping a titan right outside of a pos shield meant that you were going to lose dreads then the titan would begin to be used how it should like the biggest ugliest mother ship out there one you dread seeing warp in ontop of either your dread fleet or bs fleet not because it could dd which you can sometimes warp out of but because every second that titan is sitting there its doing massive damage to your fleetproblem is this makes the titan vulnerable which encourages huge support fleets which means titans would create bigger blobs as it is now the dd is best for the game because the titan can act as a solopwnmobile and not need 200 support ships to warp in and dd how to solve this im not sure  
like i said giving them access to the good oldfashioned siege module is a good start they have a pile of gun slots and a capital tank if the highs were ddd siege 6 guns and they had cap and fitting to run 2x capital shield booster or 3x capital armour repper theyd be able to tank a good 30k dps or so and dish out better than 10k on top of having a massive amount of ehp a gang bonus like no other and a crazyawesome ewar effect itd be worth leaving them in the fight at that point theyd still be killable of course and probably more killable than they are at present since theyre in combat instead of safed and cloaked  but theyd also be worth bringing to the table for reasons other than killing one support fleet per hour it looks to me like itd be a far healthier state of affairs
the doomsday needs to be replaced with something that ensures the titan is still deployed onto a battlefield and kept there for more time than it takes to align out still has a unique and powerful role but doesnt win a fight solo making the doomsday scriptable would also add a new tactical dimension to a fight it means titans are more flexible and would be used  and therefore destroyed  more often in combathere are the ideas i likeaoe ewara racial ewar effect that requires the titan to stick around to work ideas that have already been mentioned include warp scrambling mwd inhibition webification an ecm pulse and a neutralizing effect that removes a  of cap from every ship in rangeweakened doomsdaylike a hybrid of current doomsdays and smartbombs low damage pulses over a massive range designed to counter drones fighters frigates and finish off capsules a real antiblob weapon that doesnt require a blob to counter itfocused blastthe doomsday acts as a special siege module immobilising the titan for x amount of time but giving it a massive rofdamage modifier to its capital weapons useful to turn the tide in capital battles and actually makes the racial titan weapon bonus usefulthis script will require a cooldown before being used againremote interferencesimilar to the siege module effect above when this script is fired upon a target it does no damage but prevents all remote assistance modules  armour shield and energy transfers  being used on it for as long as the titan keeps the doomsday active now the titan can be used to help kill other supercaps but must be committed to a fight to do sonone of these scripts will wipe out an opposing fleet solo and require the titan to be used alongside a support fleet to be effectiveand as a side note i would also like to see a new hislot repair bay module for motherships and titans this is activated and uses fuel akin to a clone vat bay and allows gang members within range to repair damage to their ships and modulesi did the majority of production for my titan its really not challenging to semiafk haul freighters around via jumpbridges for a few hours
these are awesome
having a siege module for a titan would never work simply because nobody is going to put a 50bn isk ship into siege for 10 minutes when its very commonly known that any titan will die really fast to a gang of nothing more than 15 dreads so either make a new siege module or give a titan a bonus to cycle time and stront amount to where the cycle is 20 or 30 seconds and any titan can fit enough stront for 2 hours of constant sieging make the titan commit to the battle but make it possible to turn of his siege mod and have a chance of getting out if he gets hotdropped this way its still going to take 30 seconds to a minute to be aligned out after he gets hotdropped i think thats a sufficiently gaping vulnerability to balance it however again the titan must be able to function better than any other ship in normal fleet and capital combat
or give the titan another role bonus that says that siege mode doesnt prevent incoming logistics might be overpowered but it seems reasonable to me also means you wouldnt need to change around the capacitor and stuff to allow it to have a bigger native tankactually yeah this is a better version of what i was saying above thumbs up interesting im tempted to just say youd use nanite paste from the corp hangar but something along those lines is reasonable stick up a new thread on the idea
at face level it sounds like a good idea but in reality this is what will happen 1 attacking fleet enjoys the light show2 everyone came fitted with cap boosters and a few 800s in the hold so they all restore cap3 10 of the fleet of 100 ships has a module with 25 heat damage nanites applied4 continue to kill now nuetered titan 5 since there is no reason to warp out the 25 second warp recalibaration is not a problem6 titan goes boom
titan would force a fleet to come prepared with cap boosters nanite paste and other special titan killing stuff in their backpacks leaving less room for ammo and filling up power slotstitan would need a support fleet and could not be deployed on its own or it would get popped because it engaged a hundred ships by itself  makes sense stupid titan pilot oh yeah and we all get a light show how are these bad things
25 heat damage destroys a mod until docked in station and repaired no amount of nanite past can repair a fully damaged mod from my understanding of the mechanicas for the cap boosters trying to rely on those in fleet combat is pretty tough for most standardized fleets when you factor cargo lag and potentially multiple doomsdays youre fleet is going to be very crippled while titans are still more exposed by this point10 chance of losing a mod was added to create both a permanent advantage of a dd weapon in a fight and a bonus to multiple dd while not being overpoweredagain if you time it right and lead a fight with a dd as your fleet is coming outta warp that can be a huge advantagexttz i understand the reason for scripting but im not a huge fan of that particularly being the dd weapon maybe just different mounts capable of going on a titan in general
modules have 40hp the heat damage could be increased so that some modules are untouched some damaged and some incapacitated
when i reactivate yaay later today ill up heat dmg then my mistake
no brainer proposal is no brainer

no  you are destroying another profession call it market trading or whatever you like removing t1 loots only helps on group 00 miners and more lps for mission runners is a joke  nice way to even devalue lps even more and building named items will make the mission runner income even less due more of those items be availablebasic economics with that one supply and demandremove macro  farmers from belts and missions and then you will see mineral prices raise especially the ice marketedit btw what you all are talking is massive revamp of the industry profession it all dominos into each other one thing will change another and so on you cant remove t1 loots without some other massive changes to both industry and mission running
i used to ninja run missions out in 00 a while ago loot was the only was i could build more ammo as most npc 00 areas that arnt hevily occupied have little on the market with no loot the small guy trying to do a few 00 missions will have to find another way to get the bits and bobs for ammoalso im sure the bigger alliances dont need to what with the increase in caps being able to jump ammo out but smaller 00 alliancescorps with limited cap ships use loot to reprosses for more ammo replacment ships ecti dont care either way what happens with loot drops tbh im just throwing some info out there
i like signed
yes but perhaps you should make that reply in a thread where the proposal actually is a nobrainer this ones actually got a lot of possible problems
i still maintain that removal of t1 loot will not do what people want it to do it will not cause miners to make as much isk as mission runners  see this for an explanation of this assertion so the question is whats the purpose for removing t1 loot is it so that the role of miners is clearly separated from the role of mission runners if so thats probably a reasonable goal to most peoplebefore i support this i want to see concrete objectives that are the goals rather than an its broken fix it thing  for example while many dont like the upcoming speed changes the dev blog did state the design goals clearly at the beginning given those goals the changes they propose would be the right direction also im not sure that miners can provide the current mineral demand of the eve population so removal of loot would cause a massive depression as people cant get the resources they need when they want them of course maybe the apparent demand for minerals is mostly due to trading  its hard to tell without more information perhaps the miners are more than up to the taskso the relevant discussion id like to see  in any discussion here in assembly hall not just this one what are the goals of the proposed changecan the eve universe tolerate the changes without reducing the current standard of living for the pilots
that is part of the problem its very easy for them to rack up on standing so they work the level 4s and flood the market with cnrsthe only thing you can do now is probe them out and steal the mission objective which causes them lost standing lp and timethey also get very upset  
while i dont look at the issue as acrimoniously against ccp as many on this thread and i do understand that dedicating employees at ccp to hunting these guys down is expensive as are the possible legal ramifications i still would like more action taken against these peopleyou can dress up whatever is happening to you any way you want but unfortunately the root of the matter is not the vigilantes its you youre getting ganked because youre not paying attention people arent going to have any sympathy the moment you admit youre windowed out of eve and expecting a safe steady income flow i usually dont support gank activity of innocents in eve as a matter of my own temperament but i have to say theyre right in this caseits the same as someone deciding to afk in a supposed safe spot in a 00 system for hours on end while they go do something else  for whatever reason  then coming home and being upset when someone probed him out and popped him or freighter haulers who autopilot afk warp system after system then are surprised that someone scanned their slowboat and suicide ganked it for the goodies it carriedi have a problem with ganking when it occurs to players who are paying attention but are helpless due to game mechanics lag and similar things but you could save those hundreds of millions of isk simply by paying attention to the gameyeah mining is boring and its so easy that you can do it while youre doing something else but that doesnt mean you should

ive an idea to stop isk farmers once a day you get a message that pops up on screen to get your ship into a station theres a 15 minute countdown that flashes to do this and when this over another countdown appears on your screen and in this time no concord action or gate guns are activated this will catch out the isk farmers as this action will be randomised daily and at this time pirates and gankers can have a field day  well 15 minutes  to kill anyone that caught in space with no aggro timer or sec lossok flame away
ok i support much of whats being said in this thread but the comment above is seriously off the deep end how can you justify bringing the law into this in such a way selling virtual items should be illegal thats as asinine as any law proposal ive ever heard fraud is when someone misleads another to purchase an item that they have misrepresented to be something it isnt  at least thats one example of fraud  please tell me how selling a virtual item for real money is fraud by any definition of the word its already against the eula to do rmt and other selling of virtual eve assets thats as far as we need to go eve has all the power they need to suspend accounts and ban players
my 02 isk assume on average 50 of players will not buy isk 25 are farmers and 25 will buy isk what you need to do is get the players who are buying isk onto your side the simplest way to do this is to reward players for turning in rmt characters and reporting sitesex im flying my ship around trading when i get an evemail for a website where i can go to buy iskmaybe i report the mail maybe i just dont care and delete it if i report the mail ccp determines its legit and does something ccp gives me some isk even if they just give me say 1 million isk thats 1 million isk i didnt need to make missioning etc heck give me the equivalent of 1 milion isk in loyalty points with a factional navypolice force for reporting criminal activity all of a sudden everyone reporting these people has an incentive to both make reports and make factual reports  as you only get paid if the gms find something this takes more isk out of the economy than ccp gives me so there is a loss of isk but i get rewarded for caringsecond penalize players less for buying isk off of a site if they report the site this turns the players against the site ex i buy 100 mil isk off of some website then tell ccp that ive done it and give them the details ccp then can go in and say hmm this guy got 100 mil from this website and this character and follow the money back ban all of the characters involved in the money trading scheme and confiscate the iskthey probably do some of this already but now they have player support and a much easier time tracking people down everyone who doesnt report the rmt site is caught and the money is taken along with a warning from concord  or scc  and possibly a security status drop the warning should read something like thisdear player nameas part of an ongoing investigation into illegal isk trading an informant gave us information indicating that you acquired amount confiscated illicitly these funds have been confiscated pending investigation you received these funds on transaction date from other transaction party for his services the informant was given amount of isk andor lps and appropriate faction as part of our informant policy which states that any person reporting the existence of an illicit isk trading scheme will be rewarded if the investigation is successful as part of the investigation concord has lowered your security status by amountthe player  or players  who report the rmters are allowed to keep all of the isk  or some of the isk or a percentage of all of the isk obtained ask the economist which would do the least damage while creating a viable incentive if you just target the people selling the isk all youll do is cause prices to increase because the companies doing this increase their risk maybe youll catch some people but its a drop in the bucket once you turn the player base against the farmers  specifically the player base that uses farmers  youll notice some gains plus you make the players themselves afraid of not turning the isk sellers in  because if they dont someone will i dont buy isk but im a bit poor in eve if ccp would reward me for buying isk and using the transaction logs to turn the farmers in i might buy a little bit and turn the rmters in i wont shell out 20 bucks for ccp to do its job but i wouldnt mind buying cheap isk if itd help ccp catch those responsible i know that a lot of people will argue no we shouldnt have to reward people for doing this they should out of the goodness of their heart id agree with that mostly the problem is that the people buying the isk arent going to report it under the old system i feel like this system encourages people to track down people trading isk illegally rewards people for using ccp to handle the issue instead of taking it into their own hands
ive posted this some months ago in the ships and modules section with limited success please take a quick look on my arguments1  skilltimeactually the time between the covetor and the hulk is less than 2 days  just exhumers iii  this is pointless no one is actually flying a covetor except for pricing reasons i suggest to reduce astrogeology to lvl3 for the covetor or increase exhumers to 4 for the hulk this isnt much just some 5 days2  fittingall barges come with only one med slot obviously to fit a rock scanner as even a 10mn afterburner requires too much powergrid i dont see any reason why this ship is beeing held so limited in its options miners are sitting ducks anyways with a 3 med cov and a 2 med retriever they could at least try to defend themselfes i would be very pleased if the csm would bring this forward in their next meeting
i defer to chribba on a better judgement of the covetors value for mining veld but im fairly certain hell just tell you to get a revelation fit with m2mdcm2sdo the macro miners still fly these death traps
agreed on both pointsfor 1  i think reducing the skill requirements of the covetor  rather than increasing the skill requirements of the hulk  is the solution astrogeology v is one of the big time sinks that go into transitioning from the retriever to the covetorfor 2  i like your suggestions but lets be careful about making barges too capable for balancing purposes it is and should be very dangerous to operate a barge solo in low or nullsec and we shouldnt be making it easier however the ability to fit an ab would be very useful these ships are so painfully slow it takes ages just to travel from one end of an asteroid belt to another when they have to
thanks for your reply tesseract i understand your concerns about 2  but i dont see a big problem in more meds ok you could skip that rock scanner and make an ore overview setup which would leave you then with 2 or 3 meds for pvpwhatever what would one possibly fit 2 is too few for anything you call a tank 3 maybe slightly but without those t2 resist of the hulk you could go with an ecm granted but you can actually do it as well if you dismiss that rockscanner  not checked cpu for this  to be honest the idea for this came when i was high sec mining in my hulk can flippers in frigs and cruisers flying around me and stealing my wrecks looking for a fight fitting a hulk with webberscrambler and see if my t1 hobbies could deal with that frig would be interesting but 100m risk and not satisfactory insurable in a 17m covetor with a scrambler and invu i would have tried

ships held in the ship maintenance bay  smb  of capital ships are unable to hold cargo other than charges originally this was added to force a change over from using hauling carriers to having people use more rorquals and jump freighters its now seven months later and this has happened these ships are commonly available on the market and used to move cargo by those who need to do so mineral compression has been nerfed severely with the size and composition of many items changed so now i have to ask  why is this annoying restriction neededissuesa  while ammo and charges can still be held many ships require other items in their cargo to be used cynofitted ships no longer keep their ozone with them many combat ships often change their fittings in space using the refitting ability of an smasmb they now need to rely on corporate hangar arrays and shared roles with other corp members in order to keep things like this outside a station b  this restriction affects the anchored ship maintenance array at a starbase i cant think of any logical reason for this beyond programming laziness no one is going to pick up an anchored starbase module and move the ships with cargo inside them smas are however very useful for players in remote or unfriendly space to keep their ships this restriction makes it much harder to keep fuel or alternate fittings without relying on shared corporate hangar tabs if ccp wants to encourage pvp in more of 00 space one of the first steps should be to make it easier to live there without a station to dock inc  abandoned ships are much harder to clean up previously if someone left old ships inside a starbase shield a carrier could simply fly by and scoop them up now its a much bigger chore to clear away old ships such as rookie ships left in a starbase with 1 unit of trit in their cargo  every ship much be boarded and moved one at a time this of course also applies to ships left in starbases from long before the cargo nerfthis restriction is no longer needed please remove it
please do this
well stated makes good sense i support this proposal
voting for great justice
do it 
agreed
yes
oops you have a cyno frigate that you want to scoop into your bay too bad its got liquid ozone in its cargooops this ship had alternative shield repping modules to swap for its weapons and did so at your carriers maintenance array cant put that in your smbplease change this please for the love of god its stupid and it makes me hate you just a little more
devs if it really bothers you then just change it to not being able to store a ship with more than 1000m3 in its cargo bayplease
yes
i see the reason for the change but it was hamfisted and im not convinced it was necessary either do something better or just dont do anything at all but ammo only is really not the right answer
trying explain to people what counts as ammo what doesnt that stupid autoload of tritthis change would make life so much easier in dealing with dumb newbiesgoons having to go 2 jump bridge hops to switch from being a priest domi to something with range big pain leaving my fittings in an open access hanger is not a good idea either
yes i totally disagreed with this nerf on rp grounds and on the fact that it just annoys everyone whilst encouraging nothing  jump freighters and rorquals are way more efficient at moving things than carriers used to be so if you need to move lots you will continue to use these ships 
if i ever decide to rp an amarr slave trader and want to have a carrier filled with haulers full of slaves can i guess not signed
completely agree the reason for this change is no longer relevant time to rollback to the way things were its a pain in the neck to load up my exotic dancer booze smokes and my trusty copy of pax amarria onto my pvp boats each time i go outedit for approval
agreed
is there any reason not to allow this ie right click on a scan result from probes create bookmark i dont really know the backstory behind probes but presumably they give your ship coordinates to warp to so why shouldnt we be able to bookmark it the results get cleared when you change session so you cant dock and get another ship to warp to results in the case of exploration this means i either have to warp my expensive cov ops into a potentially dangerous site or i have to leave it at a safespot while i warp in my pod to bookmark in the case of player probing it means you have to warp in the cov ops first which may get decloaked and alert the target when it would be more practical to go straight in with a combat ship
fixing the ghastly ui issues would make me happier than three icelandic girls spending a vacation with mewell ok almostwhy is it not done yet when can we expect it to be doneas far as im concerned the ui bugs are the top of my list of reasons to not login
i have a ui issue that is really more annoying than anythingthe border of a window or dialog will not be where its drawn and you can see that by trying to resize a window or even just close onerestarting the client fixes it but yeah its annoying
ive been saying this for months now look up xaens multiyearold list of ui improvements the vast majority of which still havent been implemented its pathetic
do it
edit this is just a guess i am not an it professional hes rightmy guess as to why it was removed the ship you are piloting is the only ship that can be renamed refitted ammo reloaded etc all other ships are database items and by limiting the actions that can be performed on them streamlines serverclient relationsedit found a good reason for this feature
signedau contraire fahtim its yet one more example of something that got changed for no real benefit youre telling me that renaming an item is going to slow down a database versus having to initiate a session change associated with jumping into each shipas an it professional with over 15 years experience in dealing with databases i find this laughable that it was even changed steathily as it was it not only makes the user work harder but is a pointless necessity that could have been left well enough aloneoh not even counting the amount of times the user has to click only to find scotty tell them to hang on a few more seconds what ridiculous
man i have no idea why they removed this but would be awsome to see it come back
i was just giving a reason as to why ccp did it i never said they were stellar programmers like yourself well i guess they are stellar programmers in the literal sense or is that the figurative trying not to be so postironicchanging my mind however bc im sure this is a pain for the people running our free frigate program didnt think of that earlier
i like this idea too its not a game breaking change or anything just an annoyance that would be nice to get rid of
yep this has been ed since like forever
making mining more interesting to the degree that a human miner is willing to do it while paying attention and is encouraged to do so while paying attention in order to maximise his profits as opposed to the current system where mining is done as a semi afk activity at besti realise that fluctuations on mining activity ripple through the markets in eve given that its one of the primary sources for materials for the majority of items sold on the market  or should be but thats a different issue  supply and demand however dictates that these fluctuations will be ironed out reasonably wellfor example im primarily a mission runner at the moment running right on the edge of low sec occasionally getting missions into low sec itself  surprisingly ive never had pirate trouble since basing myself there despite people telling me that every route into low sec is a multi heavy interdictor gate camp with no chance of getting through  however say the price of tritanium went up to 4 isk per unit well ive got a mining barge on standby to help cover that demand and would happily put missions on the back burner for a time to deal with thatand im sure many others out there would be the same mission runners traders industrialists pvpers pirates etc if the opportunity for profit were there people will take advantage of it
on a general bad idea to make mining more tedious without any advantage for the player doing it running around in a belt to find the 10 of asteroids that arent barren is the worst part want to have that kind of fun form a gang pick a belt tag every asteroid with a number from 1 to 10 and then throw a 10 sided dice mine only the asteroid with the number you generated you will see very fast how fun is running around with your barge to lock the next available asteroid mining with guns is already better in most situations you really want to make it always better
well if you want to mine a clearly marked barren asteroid then thats your business however if you read through my idea youll realise that the asteroids only change to being a barren asteroid once all the ore is depleted out of them when these respawn as fresh asteroids then they show as being mineablewant to be locating easy ore day in day out dont strip the noob belts cleanbesides this only applies to the newbie belts if youre in the position where youve skilled up into a mining barge then you take your mining serious enough to go hunting for more lucrative untouched belts using the exploration systemironically im of the belief that mining with guns should not be as large a source of minerals as it currently is hence why i supported the idea of removing t1 loot drops and the idea of adding t1 components to the gamemining should be the source of mineralsnpc rats should be the source of componentsboth should be needed for production thus making both roles equally important in the production chain
i support the ops idea and the direction its taking but i would also like to add my support for the addendum i quoted above these additions should add extra value for those who choose to make use of them but they shouldnt be mandatory
you are really naive and havent really read my example 1  so long as veldspater stay the basic mineral for tritanium it will be mined by people that need tons of tritanium independently if it is a noob mineral or not it was mined when mining omber and kernite gave x3 or x4 times the isk of veldspater it is mined today that it is the best high sec mineral 2  i got that your not barren asteroid are identifiable at range the point is that they will not be near each other so you will need to move from one to the other  probably you dont know how the tag work so they are visible if you enable the relative column in overview the proposal was to get the feeling of moving from 1 not barren asteroid to the next  with your idea it is almost guaranteed that there will not be a second not barren asteroid within your stripminers range  even less if you are using mining lasers 3  your idea is that 10 of the barren asteroids revert back randomly every day you really think that they will survive much after dtdont strip the noob belts clean and that what would mean go there and run a cycle on each asteroid each day you have already substituted the current system where all asteroid grow in content every a few day with your where 10 of the barren asteroid respawn so the better system to get the highest number of asteroids is exactly the reverse generate as much barren asteroids as possibleas it will increase the number of new spawned full asteroids
i dont believe that i stated anywhere in my idea that this would completely replace the current system for replenishing belts its intended to compliment that systemso basically if you mine an asteroid but leave some of the ore behind then it will replenish slowly as it does at the momenthowever if you fully deplete an asteroid it wont pop like it does at the moment instead itll be represented as a barren asteroid and have a 10 chance each downtime to return as an asteroid with its ore content maxed outso if you want to be guaranteed a steady supply of ore then you never want to mine out an asteroid completely however if you want to be hunting for single asteroids that could keep even a hulk running for multiple cycles then youll want to find the fresh asteroids that have replaced barren asteroids
so we have the even worse situation with a belt full of low content asteroids and some hidden  as they are all not barren  good asteroids and you need to shoot your your scanner  15 km range or a little more at best limited by your barge sensor range  to the asteroid to know the mineral content we are still at the same point i think that making a barge running around to find the right asteroids is bad you seem to like ityou have more than a year experience in game so if you have specced for them you should know how slow are the barges and how nonproductive is to run around dropping 1 can here one there each time your ship is full even worse yout idea will ruin group mining as people will not have the possibility to mine decent asteroids and share a can for easy pick up for the hauler
or you could use a mining frigate in a prospector role to locate the good asteroids before your barge even gets to the belt thus minimising the maneuvering you need to do with the flying housebricks that are mining barges the idea isnt to support a semi afk style of play but to reward those who put in the effort to locate the decent depositsyou seem fixated on the idea of just warping to a belt in a barge and hoovering up anything in range like you can currently now this is still possible with the exploration sites again taking the effort to locate such a site if you personally dont have the skills to locate these sites im sure that there are people in your corporation that can and will for a reasonable share of the profits to cover their expenses and timeif youre a solo miner however then it just means you need to work a little harder to keep up with those using teamwork effectivelyedithaving reread this i apologise if this came across as being a little too harsh this wasnt my intention
i am fixated on the idea that requiring more effort for the same return isnt making mining better is making it worse
i agree that could introduce in costlymaterial reapair system  isk sink  improve economypilots may try to disable ships warpcore or weapons even in missions where someone ask for bosses have to flight the battle pilots may disable bosses ships as a mission itself  say no need to kill everything its annoying to see that a ship with only 1  one  structure hitpoint is 100 combat efficent like a full shieldarmorstructure shipi think this would be a hard revamp of the combat system
this is a good point and a good balancetargeting subsystems would require that they be pronounced enough to lock onto in the first place so i could see the option only appearing for certain classes of ships to begin with a frigate is so small  by comparison  that you could try to aim for the engines and wind up hitting the shield generators instead plus they are easy enough to kill that called shots wouldnt be worth itwhile a titan or even a bs are surely big enough to land shots on specific systems without too much collateral damageperhaps one solution to this dilemma would be adding a stronger sensor module kinda like the ship or cargo scanners sure it takes up an extra slot but so what you get to disable ships rather than just destroy them you can deal with one less slotso you lock onto a bs and fire away or you lock onto the bs and then start scanning now an extra window opens up displaying the sensitive systems onboard you click on one and start to lock on youd be using the same weaponry which means your scan resolution will factor in and the effective signature radius of such a tiny part of the ship could be impossible for one bs to fire upon another bs but those little frigates flitting about could definately get a lock onto the soft underbelly of the opponents titan or momso here we go called shots for ships subsystems you can attempt it in your mega if you like or you can hand the job off to that little enyo someone decided to bring along just in case
i really like the idea of subsystem targeting and i have a way that it might be possible in a preliminary stage without too many balancing headachesthe chance of hitting a ships module is relative to the weapons signature resolution vs the ships signature radiusif the targets shields are up you can hit highslot modulesif their armor remains you can hit highslot and midslot modulesif their armor is gone you can hit all modulesthis also has the side effect of giving a boost to ships that regularly engage larger targetshacs vs battleshipsfrigates vs anythingbattleships vs capitalscapitals vs motherships and titansi think that might work as a first step
how could that possibly be implemented another right click menu of course it would be nice to do that but i assume its ages to early to speak about and there are a lot of other things to do first taramics idea looks much more convertible just like critical hits in other fantasy games
lots of miners are afraid to go into low sec or 00 mining barges are too slow and fragile to survive solosmall gang low sec or 00 mining ops how about adding a new t2 mining cruiser that can mine more than its t1 counterpart but less than a mackinawhulkcovetor if it can mine moreas much as a barge then we would just see them in high sec a lot also it shouldnt use strip miners or mining lasers it should be able to use its kind of mining laser one that can use mining crystals it should also get a bonus to mining range this way it can be far away from the warp to 0 point on a belt and far away from scram range a bonus too cargo capacity and drone damagemining yield also might be a good idea the slot configuration should be dependent on the race but there should be enough low slots to strike a good balance between nano mods and cargo mods this way it can hold ore and also align to warp quickly the ultimate goal of this ship class is to encourage more people to venture from high sec and go into low sec and 00 and to diversify the ships you can fly here is the abridged version t2 mining cruiser custom mining lasers that can use mining crystals bonuss to mining laser range cargo capacity drone damagemining amount slot configuration allows for nano and cargo mods mines less than the good mining barges  covetorhulkmackinaw  encouarges pilots to venture into lowsec00
i approved this ideas prototype thread in sm and i approve this one a more durable cruiser for mining is a nice idea to add some variety to low sec if they mine less than mining barges they wont crowd empire but with increased survivability they may make some miners bold enough to enter low sec should this happen there will most likely be an increase in mining ops and even solo mining thus increasing the population in low sec which is more fun and money for pvpers and miners alikei like to think that these proposed ships are to mining barges as blockade runners are to industrials
i was thinking about that for sometimetotally agree
would this perhaps go along with the request for a visible timer on moduleseveryone has suggested the rotating clock animation to signify how long before your miners or reppers run another cyclecould that get implemented and made sure to appear obvious to satisfy this request for more noticable activity
and if the learning skills would be some sort of boost skill  like drugs  boost that fade away the more they are used until no more sp remains and noone could use again some sort of pool to spend after char creation to speed up your knowledgeto newbies it would be a boost more exiting esperience learning new skills piloting more ships using more weapons to veterans they dont need them more as they already know the how to as my 3m sp in learnig actually are time boost
if a player is only going to play the trial and never beyond that then of course they wouldnt train learning skills theyd ask why do i need those to learn faster i dont plan on sticking around that long anywaysbut the vast majority of players intend on sticking around for a while at least until they get suicide ganked and can flipped a few times and get fed up with the attitude and atmosphere of pvp pirates but i digressplayers use the free playtime during trial periods to get the learning skills out of the way because they are such a necessity to getting anywhere in a reasonable amount of time and despite the repeated attempts no one will ever raise a valid argument that learning skills are still optional only about as optional as drinking water and sleeping sure you can go without it but youd probably regret itmaking isk and buyingreplacing ships those things happen all the time but you cant do any of it until you learn the skills first thats why players reinforce that learning skills may not be the only thing you study but they are a very high priorityi said it before and ill say it again im for getting rid of the learning tree its not something people could do to make themselves better its something people have to do if they want to play the game sometime this yearif getting rid of them means that each and every skill takes days to complete then so be it i dont imagine that ccp would do that to their playerbase since a lot of folks would say this takes too long and leave for other mmosif that means that those skill points just evaporate completely with no form of reimbursement then so be it sure some players might whine about time spent but how would you rationalize spontaneously rearranging memories and training to support the redistribution afterwards you went to sleep one night and forgot how to study faster and woke up the next morning knowing how to pilot a hac instead
i agreed to the need of revamp the mission system really good ideasfor your asking question about how to a player could create a mission if a corp or an alliance wolud create a contractlike post asking we will pay 5 billions isk if you destroybringtoreinforcedmode the corpname pos in systemnamemoonnumber  maybe before datetime or even we will pay 200 millions isk at everyone who partecipate the siege todestroybringtoreinforcedmode the corpname pos in systemnamemoonnumber 
i approve of anything that adds more random elements to the pve gamear
agreed and maybe blinkng or changing colour on the time numbers just to warn
with the current contracting system it is impossible to contract ships that are fitted with faction or t2 crystals as the game seems to think they are a damaged item this is the only type of ammo affected this way and it is incredibly burdensome and annoying if someone using rails wants to give their ship to a corp mate to move in his carrier he simply contracts it over and its done if someone using lasers that happen to have faction or t2 crystals fitted wants to they have to jcfly all the way there wait for the other person to be around and then manualy trade the ship to them which then completely defeats the purpose secondly it means that you cannot even attempt to sell ships stuck in hostile stations via contract if they happen to have faction crystals fitted it is incredibly rediculous that this is still an issue this long after contracts were introduced there has to be some way to redo the system for t2 and faction crystals to distinguish them from damaged modulesshipsdrones etc

weve all had it happen were involved in a battle and manage to dock up with heavy damage for whatever reason we were unable to use our repair modules while out in space and now were deep into armor or hullwere low on isk and the repair centre says itll cost you more than you have my friendyou think thats ok ill just undock and use the repair modules when its safe to do sothe battle rages on outside and ends and youre ready to fly back into safe space to rep up no such luck youre too badly damaged to undock you dont have the isk to repair at the station facilities what do you dowell if youre just sitting in the docking area anyway why not just use those repair modules of yours save yourself the isk of using them and you still have to wait out the repair time rightccp let us use repair modules while docked

while it takes away from the repair shops profits right in front of their faces youd normally just undock and repair right outside their back door while having a smoke

so as we can see i have out did my reputation far by creating such havok with this forum heheh
this is an interesting post imo ingame circumstances have a lot to do with the stances on the very issues we are talking about this is why this csm project is fluff and the reason it will inevitably fail imosince politics is an intrical part of eve you cannot seperate the two the higher levels of this game are all about posturing and using any methods created by ccp including the forums to win  and in some cases metagaming such as buy time cards and other less then desirable means your proposal of dropping politics is essentialy saying ignore that portion of the game since the politics along with the controlling of territory that is entwined with that is the reason many people play the game what you are asking is impossiblegood suggestion goonies as some people are not cut out for the job however since ingame you are my enemy including these forums and all that it pertains  i will not allow you to use the forums the csm or any other body or element of this game to gain any advantage thus in this instance i will disagree with you the sole reason has already been statedyou have two standing members in the csm i reserve the right to change my opinion at any time to include a time when there are no goonies on the afformentioned board or whenif i suddenly become allied with you or your goals coincide with mineif that reason is not cute and fluffy enough for anyone then welcome to eve and either appreciate it or donti dont really caresee my sig for my opinion on other hot topics such as this
i dont mean to distribute nonsense or take part in any dibocals but i do state and here me out i just aquired this character from the forums and was checking out all the post the previous owner had placed so  pleese disregard any old postings of this character for i did not and repeat was not me who partaked in this discussion 
agree
bumpage to get your attention interested in opinions
actually dont give the titan weapons at allallow it to anchor itself where ever and go into this mobile outpost mode and while in that mode it has the cpupowergrid of a medium pos tower while its in siege sentry guns can be anchored around it  or any other pos weapons system  any number of these systems can be anchored at once up to the starbase defense skill of the anchoring playerdrawback it takes 10m to enter siege and 30m to unsiege once it leaves siege mode anything anchored around it goes into storage mode  like an anchored can  and can simply be unanchored just like a canthus a titan can anchor itself at a belt have someone deploy a handful of pos guns to kill the spawns and the belt can safely be reduced to so much rubble before moving on to the next or do the same thing at a chokepoint gate to serve as a defensive bastionif the pilot logs off the titan remains where it is in siege mode just like a pos all logistic modules shut down but sentry systems continue to function
i like the concept hastrabull but i would not make the titan immobile in siege mode that makes it useless as noone will risk a titan under those circumstances i would let it use up strontium and give it capital weapons with say a 1000 damagebonus  compared to 625 for dreads in siege  and without the tracking penalty  so it can also hit battleships  a real monster but killable and not capable of blowing up a whole fleet with a single push of a button
well making it inmobile was one of the main points titan would change into some sort of outpost but with very high resistanceshp and with huge offensive capabilities bonus to damagetrackingin shortinmobile but hard to destroy and with huge firepower  shelter for smaller ships something similar to command ship from nexus  jupiter incident
i think making it immobile in order to use dd  and get decent dps out of its guns  is decent maybe just make it use a standard siege module  or a titan version that is similar  but have it get a higher bonus  like malachon said  of around 1000 or maybe more dont increase the timer over 10 minutes even at 10 minutes most people will never use their dd make it an hour and you will make the module unusable you could then make the dd render the ship completely inactive for say 30 seconds to a couple of minutes or so  all modules deactivate cant move cant warp etc  im not sure how these things would balance it some testing would be required
something like this yes
you all suggest the wrong thing titan should be turned into a mobile outpost with defensive capability not offensivetitan can turn into an immobile outpost with huge gang bonuswith shield friendlies can just stay outside the shield and fight if they take damage move in and dock up to repair
id rather have a titan go offline  unable to move fire or activate modules  for x minutes after firing off a dd
i still like the siege idea into station modeit could anchor anywhere so it doesnt need sovereignty or something  as has been suggested before  and it also doesnt need a nearby moon or planet  also been suggested before  id also say that certain systems should only be available in different modes for instance1  people keep complaining of database errors if a titan has passengers docked and it tries to jump so only allow docking while in station mode if it tries to shift back to ship mode then everyone is ejected or it simply cant shift back until everyone has left on their own this might cause problems if a ship is aboard and the titan really needs to leave in a hurry but its your fault for allowing them inside to begin with 2  different weapons systems should only be available in different modes i think the aoe dd could be reserved for station mode as a defense and a new aimed dd could be used for ship mode then it can either stay still and blast the whole battlefield or it can move about and blast individual targets  like other titans 3  i think that the titan could project its shields around friendlies while in station mode but i wouldnt give it any extra shields during that time either titans already have hundreds of thousands of shield points but it could be an option to protect the fleet while that lasts when the titan is reduced to armor then the fleet hiding under its skirts is vulnerable as well4  one extra tweak i suggest everytime the multiple titans per fleet issue is raised if an aoe dd is used then the area is irradiated and successive dd used in that same area before it is allowed to dissipate will bring detrimental results either the damage suffers stacking penalties or the weapon has a chance of not firing or maybe the weapon delivers the blast back onto the titan either way i think residual energy would be a simple fix to fleets bringing a dozen titans to a fight
if we imagine the local as to the range at wich our own shipradio can hear that system simply hear the space void if noone speak onair you dont hear anything but spacenoise if you speak your voice thorugh the system your words appear but not the list of people only the single phrase you spoke not the list it is stupidso i agree to eliminate localintelmaybe the stargates themselves spread across the system the 11 accessexit ships  not the type nor the pilot  so you may know how many pilots been there  mmm and the jump bridges mmm 
i agree with the issues raised about making missions more interesting by randomizing the outcomes to go along i would like to see two changes made to how belt rats work and how npc loot drops both from rats and missions are determined1  belt rats as it stands now if you are in gallente space for example you will only see serpentis rats if you know the security status of the system you can predict down to the ship name what sort of ship you will see the rare exception is faction ships and even those are predictable why is this do sansha or gurista pirates never travel to essence my proposal is to add a random element to the encounter tables to allow a chance for different types of rats to show up also make it possible for more variety of ship type as well like bc rats in a 5 systemthe value would be more variety and less predictability chances to get different types of loot and salvage and motivation for players to work together to take down tougher opponents with smaller ships2  randomize the loot drops all npc loot drops can also be predicted by type and ship strength one of the fun aspects of any game that includes looting is the surprise in what you are going to get in eve you might get a hgher meta level item or the extremely rare faction or officer drops but 99 of the time loot is dull and predictable so much so that many players dont bother same with salvage my proposal is to expand the loot tables to include items like implants usable boosters bpcs rigs and other items outside the list of modules the value would be added excitement to the pve game and more motivation to loot and salvage not to mention more pirating possibilities  ar
maybe theres an option i havent found yet but itd be great if mails from insurance andor cloning services could be disabled or at very least if something could be put into place to make sure that we dont get insurance expiration mails for ships weve sold or otherwise lost possession ofits obviously not a very important issue just a minor annoyance from time to time
insurance expiry mails for ships you dont own sounds like a bug  bug report it as for the other you should be able to add npcs to the blocked list just like players
ill make this short and sweetcurrently its possible to use alts on the same account to support an issue while ccp  and possibly the csms are capable of seeing how many accounts are behind a specific number of supporting votes this can still be exploited to inflate the number of supporting votes which harms the overall legitimacy of the system and can distort the perspective of players wishing to weigh in on an issue this needs to be fixed as soon as possiblethat is all
im supporting this topic with my main
and now with my alt
supporting this topic again with my main  and only  character
or maybe youre my other alt its become self aware
some where in the nano thread s  insanity over the last couple of days in one of the threads here in the assembly hall i believe lavista or maybe it was jade said that ccp is able to look at the tallys on their end on a per account basis i do think though for us the on washed masses it would be nice to see that same per account vote opposed to 3 votes per account mayhem we have right now
hello i too support this planno i am not the alt of the above posterpromiseps you only get to see the one alt the others portrait is soo ugly small children would cry in fright
ok testing this i thought you could only support with 1 char per account
and now with my alt on the same accounteidt hmm works indeed
agreed it should be 1 vote 1 account and transparent to the forum members as well as the folks around the back to avoid inflated bandwagon effects
that must have been jadebut right now i think this is a limitation of the forum system which seem to work on a percharacter basisbut yes i fully agree this is a major flaw it needs to be worked out for the future of csm if ccp wants to have a body like this it will have to be done right the current way isnt

you mean people actually take the thumbs up icons seriouslyive so often seen people support an idea but forget to check the little box that i wouldnt even rely on them to get the overall proanti mood of a thread let alone anything approaching a meaningful tallyalthough i suppose people will be more careful to support in threads like the nano onesedit because i forgot to support
the nonerf vs pro nerf no nerf is double  the pro nerfim sure that there was padding on either side but however you cut it more people are voicing to stop the changes than to support them as it doesnt just effect nano shipsits a bad idea and you knows it foo
ummmm you realise that this thread hasnt got anything to do with the nanonerf itself right its to do with the proven flaw in the current system where multiple alts on the same account can voice support for any given issue thus padding the perceived support and increasing the amount of noise created in the thread drowning out any reasonable suggestions for how a given idea could be betterthis was proved as being possible with the first three posts on this thread with tarmanic supporting this with both himself and one of his alts on the same account as tarmanic

stangly enough thought your thread popped up as the nano whiners where loosing the voting war tho ehand  make me
my thread popped up as a response to this thread linkagecheck the timestamps on my first post and this threads creationbesides its extremely likely that both sides are using this tactic it doesnt make it any less dishonest
the fact that players assume that their voting will reverse the changes is misleading the fact that this is in the assembly hall is misleading if all this voting power was spent in testing and giving honest only slightlybiased feedback to what the devs are creating on the test server the antinerf and pronerf crowd might actually have some say in how balanced this change isbut the devs have already stated that its not working as they intend it to work  not as how we believe it should work or how we think its fine  and their concept for the changesim beating a dead horse again when i say that game development isnt a democracy your not paying to have a product built to your or even a majority of players specifications your paying to buy the product as ccp decides to release it youve got no creative rights or control over said productgood marketing is completely different but if you did win and cause a change youd sure as hell be pssed off when someone else used popular vote from a small minority of the playerbase that is active on the forusm to change something you didnt like better off wed be if we just left it to the guys who are trained and paid to design it as theyre the ones who takes the blame if it lives or diesso vote or not opinion or not the real flaw with this system is player arrogance and misunderstanding
definatly supporting this all you have to do is look at the nano threads and half the chars you see voting against it are characters with no corps and bs names that mean nothing that are a couple weeks old yeaokccp better be able to tell whos on what account if not this is a serious problem and peoples vote doesnt mean hit
and this whcih is about as honest about the whole thing as you can get
i voted with my 14 characters sorry what was the topic againmetagaming if you cant beat them 1 on many outa meta game them whining for when you cant win in game whine for changes and the only counter to a sucessful whine is lots more whining
agreed an align to for every single celestial object in space not only the fleet version
agreedmaybe not all bosses would escape  they too have clones but some missions that dont require to kill all but to tackle someone or exploring some systems or so  totally agreed on removing t1 loot and halving boring frigs
i agreebut we have to remember the loot problem it really kill economy miners and producers right now on some other thread some nice post ask to eliminate loot for scrapping maybe leaving some named t1 mods insignas and quest items and a tiny up on bounty  not much maybe producing t1 mods will be worth again
i didnt go threw reading it all at work at the moment but i dont think you should remove the quality rating instead make it that once you get to a certain security rating all agents for that empire are equal quality makes something to work for and would still reduce lag spreading out missioners and and still keep the present systemedit  guess this idea was already proposed
i do missions to relax myself i do pvp in nullsec to excite myselfi think its bad to force to go mission runners to lowsec systems where they risk their shipsand it is bad to eliminate missions only because of lag i can ask to eliminate pvp for the same reason dont ino it would be bad to kill missions as it would be bad to kill pvpso aside the omnipresent lag  new hardware will help  the mission hubs will lose lag only if mission runners will find new systemsi totally agree to clean the laggest systemsone suggestion is to let contact my agents from systems far away from the agent homesystem based on standing a pilot could ask for mission in lowsec simply calling that agent from a lowsec system if my standing will be enough i can even ask my agents for mission in null sec and maybe that mission would be more risky and hardso there will be no need for quality but only level and system security no difference between 10 and 05  really no difference  but if im a militian  factional warefare  mission in enemy systems would paycallin agents from away and nullfing the reward difference between 10 and 05 would kill mission hubs and let enough space for future improvements on the missiongamesystem
we are supposed to be drone specialists after all i propose to reevaluate bandwitdh specs on all gallente boats all gallente battleships should have 125mb drone bandwitdh for a start for a dronespecialised race to have battleships that cant even fit 5 heavy drones just doesnt sit right
gallente can be specced for drones blasters and railguns so no not every bs should be able to fit 5 heavies
gallente have a primary turret weapon like every other race and some of their ships favor that weapon the fact that their ships are split between drone and turret users is not uncommon caldari face the same issue only their weapon split of hybrids and missiles all take up the same highslotsif anything id consider yourself lucky that a large portion of your damage potential in a large portion of your ships do not take slots do not require fittings and dont use cap asking for another boost is like spitting in the rest of our faces
and this could probably be better posted in the gameplay discussion or features and ideas sections
kid there is a drone nerf coming as they are now too good to take out smaller ships compared to 99 of turrets  no n in turret 
increase for all ships why should gal ships get that regardless if they are the drone race hell amarr ships only get bonus for cap  basically means the lasers wont drain the cap that fast  and the damage bonus only goes on a few select ships same as resist bonus and rof forgot the abaddon only gets resist and dps bonus apoc gets range and cap use i think i am not a big fan of the bandwidth thing myself but hey  happens and then u adaptwhiner threads
following the same logic caldari can be specced for rails blaster guided missiles and unguided missiles four specializations against 3 not less so for the whining comments
though im a professional drone  i cant support thisdominix  5 hybrid damage per level 10 drone damage per level  6 turrets 5 heavy dronesmegathron  75 tracking per level 5 damage per level  7 turrets 5 heavy droneshyperion  5 damage per level 75 repair per level  8 turrets 4 heavy dronesdps  no skills t1  all skills t1  all skills t2 dominix 224  679  897  tier one two damage bonuses megathron 245  613  809  tier 2 one damage and one tracking bonus hyperion 247  615  816  tier 3 one damage and one repair bonus things look pretty good to me the hyperion has an extra turret but loses a single drone its real damage will be a bit lower than the megas due to tracking but the megathron has 2 offensive bonuses while the hyperion has only one offensive bonus so that seems pretty balanced to me theres no good balance reason why the hyperion should have another drone
nice troll
im a massive gallente specialist and even i think this idea is stupid being the drone race doesnt mean that the noob ship should come with fighters and hyperbole aside two gallente bses have 125 of bandwidth and the hyperion is just fine without it
was inspired by yours if you count blastrers and rails as different specializations i can do the same for guided and unguided missiles
heheheh  i guess you could count the combat and sentry drones as different types nobut more accurate would be to say hybrids and drones and hybrids and missiles the two dont equal out though because in the latter case they both take up high slots
fine caldari  hybrids and missiles gallente  hybrids and drones amarr  lasers and drones minmatar   bastard child who uses everything  mostly projectile and missiles each race has bonuses focusing on 2 types this is eve university 101 the gallente do not suffer from a specialization deficiency
so really drones should be nerfed aaahhh lock thread
maybe not all but some gallente ships really lost out when drone bandwidth was introduced in particular the ishkur went from a nice ninja ratting ship to a useless piece of crap
then maybe the ishkur deserves some lovin but clearly not all of them  only the droneboats that are shown to be underpowered  like your example 
gief the eos back the ability to holddeploy 5 heavies nowwwwwwwwwwww
the eos and myrmidon should have lost turret slots not drone bandwidth and yeah the ishkur got hit although not really as hard as those two
the heart of the matter is that you want a dps increase on all gallente battleshipsyour arbitrary definition of drone affinity as being able to fit 5 of the biggest drones is interesting as well compare caldari and gallente and its obvious which race has more emphasis on drones beyond that gallente isnt entitled to anything
because some original person took the time and effort to specialize a character and the other person is paying money or isk for that effort there is a difference in your first example two characters are involved and neither change they just switch ownership the second involves the actual alteration of a character that should remain static i dont think players should have the freedom to move around their skill points at will like musical chairs you can alter your own character by training something else i think thats enough freedom as every character can do anything theres plenty of logic in denying this op
i cant really support this as much as theres a part of me that would like toeve does not have path system that youre locked into where choosing certain skills makes other skills difficult to learn or impossible to learn nor does it have some softcap to total sps where reaching a certain sum total of sps means that you gain sps at a slower rate afterwards for instance just because i have 1500000 sp in missiles does not mean that if i try and buy gunnery skills later on they now cost twice as much sp to level if eves skill system worked that way id support your postit doesnt thoughwhile i dont support the ops request this isnt a good example in wow youre locked into a certain path depending on your choices in eve you are not  there is no mechanic for diminishing returns in other skills because you chose certain skillsim going to guess you dont play other mmos thenive played most major mmo to have come out and quite a few notsomajor ones like this one of those i played all of them had major changes that totally change some classs aspect while you might not know people who played everquest  if you do ask them how about necromancers in early eq and what happened to them later  try asking someone who plays wow how paladins used to be or how mages used to get an invisiblity and an unlock spell  making rogues pointless people are better off in eve than in those games because theres no classes and youre not locked into a certain skillset
its only a matter of time thoseriously i gotta say i cant approve of this idea you make your choices and thats the end of itjust for balance ill point out that i have skirmish mindlinks recons 5 inties 5 hac 5all stuff thats getting massively changed do i want agility bonuses instead of speed bonuses do i s i trained the skills for the speed increase cos i for one hate snailblobtankwars and i fly with some incredibly talented inty pilotsas far as im concerned there should never be any requirement for this kind of respec option as the changes proposed should never be considered minor tweaks for balance as requiredunfortunately thats not the case sadly it seems to me the loudest portion of the playerbase are the ones who have the least clue about the impact of thier screamingeducate those players teach them that the game can still evolve with only minor adjustments and that whatever fotm is currently killing them can be easily balanced  if it is unbalanced that is  with only minor changes that is going to be a far more valuable and long lasting option than respecing skills
i still want to be able to delete skills
now i dont know if this happens to everyone but it happens to me a lot and its starting to get somewhat irritating most of the time when im getting a storyline mission im looking forward to it till i read the mission details and discover that the mission is about transporting 7500 m3 big cargo or mine buy  10k m3 ores for the faction for war preparation so the faction wont soil itself and die of the humiliation now those missions arent that irritating autopilot something somewhere and get paid for it is easy money aslong as you got the ship for it most of the time im doing commandsecurityanythingthatinvolveskillingothership missions so me having a ship that got a four didgit m3 cargohold number really isnt something i give much attention to what i do give a little attention to however is storyline commandsecurityanythingthatinvolveskillingothership missions but it doesnt seem to me that i get most of those instead i get a boring mission which i need to jump 6 times back and forth 15 times cause the cargohold of my salvaging ship only got enough space for one engineif this is a somehow irritating phenomena that mission runners experience then i believe that storyline missions could be organized in the way that mining missionsers get mining related storyline missions combat missionsers get combat related storyline missions and so onanyways thats just methanks for your attentionady
just so ya know the missions you get are determined by the department that the agent works with so if you want lots of fighting missions work for a command or security agent and now a manufacturing or research agent dont know for sure if the militia agents are broken down this way but i bet they are
the cynical perspective of factional warfare prior to its release was that it would be some sort of pvp lite ive been bopping around the gallente militia for a few days and i dont think this is true what it is is alliance lite the militia is functionally similar to an alliance but without leadership or organizationthere are problems though with an alliance without a head internal issues arise complaints of lootstealing bickering between corporations culminating in intramilitia wardecs and arguments over militiawide strategy and tactics theres no authority to settle internal disputes so the disputes continue and theres no authority either to level punitive measures against players or corporations who persist in causing problems for the militia theres no guarantee beyond an implied agreement that were even all fighting for the same isidei there needs to be some way for the militia to deal with problem members and problem corporations and in less extreme cases to function as the last word in intramilitia disputes authority would also help on an organizational level the ability to designate short term goals and provide some mandate for the activities of militia members would help on several fronts it would give the militia especially new players who arent entirely sure of their direction or purpose something to concentrate on it would also allow the disparate elements of the militia  the pveers who dont really want to get involved in pvp and the pvpers who dont want to do plexes  to cooperate on a more meaningful level if the goal this week is to decontest fliet then the folks wondering what they should be doing know that they should be heading to fliet and doing the complexes there and the folks doing pvp fleets know that the other side will be drawn to that system like flies to honey and will know where to concentrate their effortsorganization will also help another problem which is the lack of fcs the militia channel is always full of people xing up for whatever group will have them but fleet commanders willing to take a group under their wing are significantly less common at most there tends to be one large blobly fleet in the warzone and then usually only when an opposing fleet has already been spotted having goals handed down from onhigh will give people a better idea of what they need to do which will hopefully result in more people being willing to step up to the plate and take command of a fleetso having a system of leadership in the militia would help keep deal with intramilitia squabbling and help give players purpose
heres how i propose to do it  individuals are chosen to fill specific roles in the militia by a vote corporations each get a vote and the militia corporations members all vote individually to determine the militia corporations vote  alternately a corporation is chosen in a similar manner and their ceo becomes something akin to an alliance executor  the militia leader has the power to kick corporations from the militia for a period of time or individuals from the militia corporation he doesnt have to approve applications the militia will remain open to anyone who wants to join booting a member or corp from the militia will require a vote from existing militia corporations the boot will not be permanent  possibly it could simply entail dropping the corporationplayers standings which would necessitate regaining standings to rejoin the militia  if rewards for fw are implemented the militia leader may be able to put players or corporations on a probationary status and dock them a percentage of their rewards the militia leader has the power to designate a system or systems as conquest goals this could be handled in a few different ways either single systems or up to three adjacent systems or up to three nonadjacent systems or single constellations victory points in these systems are gained at a higher rate than in other systems for both sides standing increases for vp gain and kills are also higher in these systems than in others this doesnt function as a tremendous incentive without faction pvp rewards but even without them it gives the militia some focus even simply giving lps to players who score kills in the goaled systems might work  the systems designated by the opponents militia leader as conquest goals become defensive goals with similar mechanisms play since all of the systems have multiple capture points this would help decrease blobbing somewhat simultaneous strikes on multiple points mean that the blob cannot be everywhere at once at present blobbery hasnt been cut down upon because the points are spread across dozens of systems and the prize the fleets chase is the enemy fleet bringing the conflict down to a couple systems at a time might help this and bring fw specific mechanics further into playat present the main problem facing factional warfare is the lack of coherence within militias corporations may be organized but the militias as a whole arent theres a significant power vacancy from the fleet commander level upwards and the militia is really feeling that where it hurts simply sticking someone at the top and giving him basic levels of authority would help this tremendously and might help make factional warfare the interesting variant of pvp it was meant to be
edit op fixed this
should solve that problem and having someone at the helm to make the decision and then having people need to ratify it will work better i think than a straight democracy also it wouldnt be too hard to put in safeguards to prevent bootery enmasseedit hah nevermind then but the democratic vs ratification thing is important enough that im leaving my post here
signed to everything he saidfw has no internal controls over its militia members other than normal corporation management features this is not enoughthere exists a need to handle wardecs standings across all of the faction and fleet management recognizing fcs is one thing but having fleet features where there are designated fleets in place and people can simply sign on without xng all of the time is a welcome idea whose time has comeextend control in the areas that need it and release control for the sore points ccp needs to get in touch with all of the visibly prominent corporations that are trying to organize things across all of these frontsccp or any member of the csm please take heed the playerbase as a whole may not know how to articulate into words what is required or even be 100 consciously aware of the issues at stake but there are a large number of us that do please talk to us
op suggestionsall non corporate militia members 1 collective vote each corporation  independently by the number of players even 1  1 votealliance like politics games to be added to militia play with giving some people the power to ban others from the militia  and it will abused as a tool against specific corporations dictator like militia ceo with the power to set goalsto all the abovenothe militia is not a 00 alliance and should not be ruled as one quoting some little pearl open to exploitation
this can be abused in so many ways just one example would be for an alliance to seed the militia of thier choice with a bunch of alts and members then vote one of thier own into control leaving themselves with thier own little personal militiathe other problem is how do you make sure the vote is fairone vote per person the largest corp in the militia winsone vote per corp the largest corp in the militia still wins all they need to do is have each member start thier own little temporary corp join the militia and vote
there are simple safeguards that can be put in place to keep people from flooding the militia with alt corpplayers for instance weve got a ranking system    why not weigh votes by rank you can flood the militia with a bunch of rank 0 alts but they wont be able to swing an election the need to ratify decrees means that this is not an 00 dictatorship its a cooperative effort but what the effort lacks now is iinitiativei and thats what putting someone at the helm gives us it gives us people actively making decisions that the rest of us can yay or nay to instead of us all sort of sitting around in a mob grumbling about how someone should be doing something second point larger corporations have more power thats how a democracy works the danger of having the people make the decisions is that theres a constant danger of more people who arent you making decisions you dont want either we can have a democracy which apparently we dont want or we can have a dictatorship which we dont want either or we can have anarchy which weve got and is frustrating we can put safeguards in place to prevent corpspawning to prevent altspamming and to prevent an 00 alliance moving in wholesale and shutting the place down if you have better ideas on how to do this feel free to speak up but folks this is exactly the problem weve got with the militia now no ones in charge and a significant minority cant wrap their minds around the idea of being constructive the militia needs leadership and if you dont like my proposal i would ireally reallyi like suggestions about how militia leadership could be better implemented because we need something oh and the other solution is to ask to have ccp put someone in charge but    folks this is eve the whole game is arguably about players governing themselves  is fw really such a joke that we need to carebear up the leadership too
i would like to see a race specific bonus implemented that way any minmatar born clone flying a minmatar ship will have specific racial bonusesexampleminmatar racial bonus can be 10 bonus to ship speedcaldari racial bonus can be 10 missile bonus of some descriptiongallente racial bonus put towards dronesamarr racial bonus to capacitorthese bonuses can be worked out amongst the ccp thinktankscheers chelly
first i think this is more for features and discussions than the assembly hallsecondly one of the prime factors about choosing a race is that it gives you no bonuses were all equal its the skills we train and the ships we decide to flydoes that mean the idea is bad no but theres something counterproductive about being a minmatar for example and not using your speed bonus to stack with your ships speed bonus specialization beats out generalization any dayso i support moving this idea to its proper forum and i dont support adding bonuses to races unless you give amarr a 10 bonus to armor resists then i fully support it j
we already have racial specific bonusesthey are found at character creation in the form of what starting skills and attribute balance you have at intial character creationso no i dont support your idea
if you give bonuses to people based on their character race you will  off a large portion of the player base because the race their character is doesnt have the bonus they want the older the character the more ed they areadd in the bonuses only working if your flying your races ships and you  of everyone who wants to fly ships of multiple racesthis is the kind of change i would leave the game over because it forces me to chose between throwing away a character ive had for a while putting up with the fact that i will never be able to pilot a gallente ship as well as the players who got lucky or leaving eve
you should still be able to get the skill and ship specific bonuses if you choose to fly another races ship what im getting at is this2 ravens shape up for a 1 v 1pilot 1 is amarrpilot 2 is caldarii think pilot 2 should have just the smallest advantage to his raven as he is caldarithere are plenty of nerfs that  pilots offin the end its to make life a little more interesting not easier as easier is often boring
the op is right in a manner of speaking if you look through the data dumps youll see racespecific bonuses not far off what the op suggestshowever eve is all about redemption you have to take yourself very far down one path until youre not able to come back  faction standings  applying a limit to characters at their birth goes way against thissaying that i would like to see more racial difference whether that be racespecific ships or militiaonly reward ships for highranking officers  which are returned if they leave the militia  then its all good
what a terrible idea
this is just a bad idea sadly it sounds good on paper but really the skills you get starting out should cover this but beyond that everyone should be equaloh its great if you happen to play amarr with an amarran character but what happens in the future when the amarr are nerfed or you start out playing caldari because they sound like awesome miltarists then you find out about the truth about missiles and pvpright now one of the big insurance policies in eve is that even if some favorite tactic  races ships  skills are nerfed you can always just learn new skills without being inherently disadvantaged compared to someone else who was just born better who will stay better forever
no eve prides itself on letting everyone do everything equally well as long as they put the same amount of time into it i was completely against chargenonly skills and im most definitely against this
i prefer the existing system anyone can do anything given enough time
it is a terrible idea what makes eve great is its flexibility you are for all intents and purposes a tabula rasa as john locke put it you fill it with whatever you want complete freedomwhats your suggesting creates classes classes  bad
it was stealth nerfed during the expansion release and i bug reported it shortly afterno response yet on the bug report nor a simple database hotfix so theyve seen how effective logis are with remote energy xfer and made it impossible for anyone  other than bpo holders  to produce t2 versionsthe bug report
 you are not authorized to view this bug report 
what seems to be the problem here sir
i agree that some of the nerfs may be a little overboard i dont fly nanoships but ive said it before ill say it again nerfing the crap out of something is the laziest way to fix a perceived problemtbh your ideas along with some buffs to either tracking on some ships or missile explosion velocity and missile velocity on others  or both  would serve the playerbase much better to combat ships that are currently invulnerable due to their high speeds
if your intent on seeing any balance to the nerf get on sisi and test it to death report your findings dont go all opinionated and believe it or not devs will listenprove to them that your taking too much damage from missiles prove to them that your getting locked down too hard but whether your arguing for or against the nerf unless your actually contributing to make the changes the devs have already decided to make balanced all your doing is blowing smokedont try vetos and votes like you think this is some kind of highschool popularity contest test report and test again if you dont do your part to help bring balance youve got no right to yell about ccp not listening
ok veto it keep your 7ks ishtarbut give us the guns to hit you in the face with when your doing max speed
these changes are dispicable repugnant and lack any intellectual direction they are counter to small game combat display a complete lack of understanding by the devs about pvp and are a complete capitualation to the whining drake caracal raven crowd the worst things every forced down the throats of players and could possibly result in the first serious decrease in the viability of eve as an entertainment product

just some place to discuss progression of faction wars
make alliances cheaper to startmaintain as things are many corps cannot get access to 00 space as existing alliances will not recruit allow them access my corp has been trying to get into a 00 alliance but no one will have us we cannot hope to take on an alliance to gain space so what do we do to get into 00 obviously we do not want to join another corp we have the corp we want already ccp wants people to expand into 00 yet makes it almost impossible
yes they are boring maybe its possible to reimburse them fairly howeverno you are not forced to train themno they are not so tedious if you do a little math with marginal returns  see evemon if you cant do the simple economic analysis yourself yes you can replace the attributes but what about reallocating the sp and time spenti think its enough that the tier2 learning skills can be started upon completion of the teir1 at level iv thats very very lenient to begin with learning skills provide a way to customize your character and allow himher to grow intellectually learning skills are a healthy introduction to the patience required in the unique skill system of eve
even ccp refered to them as a boring grind
i already accounted for that in my postthey dont customize your character at all because basically everyone trains them because they are universally necessary yet again it doesnt add anything to the game except force newbies to waste time before training anything usefulwouldnt a better introduction just be letting people see the skill system for themselves rather than a wowesque grind for a load of time before you can do anything useful
it does not force new players to do anything most people who dont understand the system do all their skills to iviii because they are told to it is possible to get you basic skills without bringing your learning up to ridiculous levelsinstead oflearning ilearning iilearning iiibeginner skillsadvanced skillstry thislearning skills ibeginner ilearning iibeginner iiadvanced ilearning iiibeginner iiiadvanced iietcit isnt a grind when done properly and efficiently if eve does one thing well it teaches players the basics of diminishing marginal returns having high learning skills is only worthwhile when training those ivv skills players benefit by learning to prioritizeagain you dont have to grind you can plan it properly so its not such a terrible obstacle if a player chooses all of his attributes at the beginning either one of two things would happen1  ccp would make sure all of the bloodlines are balanced so each has an equal opportunity to specialize in anything as they do now no fun in picking a bloodline2  ccp would keep the bloodlines separate newbie who doesnt understand the game picks the bloodline with all the charisma and realizes since the attributes are at a high level and he cant add any to perception and intelligence he trains slowly for everything important and quitsi had a longer post with more math for this second part let me know if you want to see it
i beg to differ a bit they do customize your character especially for those who are dedicated insane  enoungh to train up 5376000sp in learning skills customized how you may ask customized in the fact that i am able to out skill those fellow eve pilots who started around the same time as me yes it is a long time to pay off learning everything to lvl5 in learning even the advanced ones but i am going to be in this game long enough for it to pay offeve is not about instant gratification eve is about dedication and long term commitment to goals maybe that is why when i was still a nubbin of my first 5m sp 35m sp of it was in learning for some people that may be too slow to get real skills but i used that time to actually learn about the game reading faqs the forums guides and joining a corp where i got to learn a bit about all aspects of evefor the record you dont need to have much sp to be effective you just need to be cunning i only once pirated and it was when i was a week old and in a punisher in low sec i had less than 500k sp at that time but i still got me 10m for ransomalso for the record yes i really am sick and have the aforementioned 5376000sp in learning skillstldr versioneve is not the instant gratification you seek learning skills are worth it if you have the paitencedo not support
i think learning is fineyou either do them or you dont the obligation to do them is all in your headwhat i do want to see is the adv learning skill itself
learning skills are a great aspect to the game learning skills actively encourage newer players to be responsible with their skill training and show how rewarding time management can be
nullthis
go here for the previous thread every aspect of it gets debated to death
the entire vote is bullsht and im not saying that because im in support of the nerf or against i could care less because my perception of balance is completely differentbut when the hell was it the players with no programing experience and no real concept of how the game worked behind the game screen that they see who decided what changes the developers madei mean come the fck on they were taking votes before the test server was up and testing is going on and changes are already coming down taking the testing into accountbut im so amazed at how arrogant players can be your not paying to have this game built to your specifications you know your paying to play the game as the developers choose to deliver it going off on a vote or crying for nerfanti nerf threads on the forums is hopefully completely ignored by the playerbasebecause guess who will never take accountability if a poor decision is made off their own complaints the playersif the servers crashed and could not be repaired because players were pushing the game engine to limits it couldnt handle with a particular mixture of modules boosters rigs implants and skills it damn sure wouldnt be those who used those tactics who would raise their hand and say my faultand the same goes the other way if thousands of players were lost because of a massive nerf of an entire playstyle its not going to be the whiners who claim the blameit all goes onto the developers shoulders let them design their game throw an idea out every now and then but until you are paid to make the code yourself dont assume that you should have any say your power is simple and easy to use pay the monthly fee or dontif you pay you like what ccp does if you leave you donteasy now can we all get over this crap
yay anubis xians sales alt on same account
anubis xians ceo alt on same account
yeah that seems broken to me
hehehe  read the posts ive posted with all my accounts several trial accounts and in both sides with various alts on each of these accountsif that doesnt invalidate those bs up in arms comments ive lost respect for the ccp dev team
one account one votean answer was given in there by inanna zumi that the csmccp could see the number of individual accounts supporting a given issue however this doesnt help when people are blitzing a given issue with all of their alts  in this case the nanonerf both for and against it  and claiming that support as an overwhelming mandate for change given that the general eve population cannot see the account support just the number of thumbs
dont want this to drop off the front page for too long players might forget that they have no say in key development decisions other than their right to pay for the game as it is delivered or notand of course we all know that that would be a horrible world full of forum politics whines and counterwhines and annoying threads like the very one your reading basically forum hell
yet before salvage it wasnt their income since salvage is a relatively recent addition i wonder if the changed probing system came out at the same time as salvagethis would mean that the ability to salvage other peoples missions would have been started at the same time as salvage
personally i dont really care if they take the learning skills out or leave them in though taking them out would cause some major headaches and what not what i would like to see though is the time it takes to train from 4 to 5 reduced 30 days to train a skill is just plain silly knock 2550 off that training time and imo things would go much smoother there would be a lot of gripes and whinging from older players but whatever happens someone is gunna complain
neither evelyn beatrice hall nor voltaire  who she was describing when she said that  were american youre missing the point nobody is asking for special treatment its just that its neither appropriate nor fair to make assumptions or assertions about someone based on some unrelated category they happen to fit into if i call you stupid because of something you did thats one thing  although still rather rude  but if i call you stupid because of where you were born  and thereby call every single other person who was born there stupid by implication  thats beyond the palewere a private community here theres absolutely nothing wrong with expecting certain minimum standards of behavior in the community if you really cant stop yourself from being openly and aggressively racist homophobic misogynistic or whatever nobody is stopping you were just saying dont do it hereif it makes you feel better ill fight to the death for your right to start your own forum and say what you like there
its ok to be bigoted in game right like my caldari character is a racist against minmatar scum
sure
im a newbie i started playing this game last september  or was it october  anyway i played the game for about a month and quickly got bored of it i thought eh all this skill training crap is too boring  thats saying something im normally patient  so about ten months later i had a conversation with a guest  customer i work at target  who plays eve the advice he gave me was to slow down on the learning skills and train in stuff that you think would be fun im glad i talked to him because im having more fun with eve now than i had months ago so just to reinforce what a lot of people are sayingdont take away skills just educate newbies on doing whats fun rather than shoving learning skills down their throats when they are necessary they can always be returned to later
35 pages of do not want thereyou have no idea what you are talking about just stop typing
some thoughtsfirst to ankh on the slap on the wrist players found the issues you brought to ccp to be important some had been asked for or about for a long time with no feedback with the csm we get feedback ccp wanted big things and that is what they got they just did not have the same idea of what was a big thinglavistai am in agreement with you on ship balancing it seems to me that all you will see here is opinions on those ships and their value having the csm spending time on debating if this ship or that needs a reassessment is a down right waste all ship balancing needs to start out with a look at the database  by ccp  to see what warships  those ships that have use in combat  are used or not which are primaried  popped first  would be a good statistic which are ignored and which are left back in a hanger nothing to do with the csm hereone of the above posts said a reply only forum is a good idea dev asks the question why are crows left in the hanger when other interceptors are out fighting  i picked a crow because i can spell it not because its bad  where a ship the database says is not used as it should be or a whole class of ships are left out of the fights filter  delete  all the troll posts and go from there nothing for the csm except perhaps for the nebulous there have been multiple posts aimed at balance issues please let us know what you are doing about itccp wants the csm to look at big issues but like so many things big is a matter of perspective battleships look big if you are in a frigate but very small if you are in a titan
perhaps remand ship balancing issues to other forum sections and let it stand in queue
this is something ive been griping about for quite some time right now i use a destroyer to salvage missions works great until it gets full then i have to dock or pop a can and come back for it in a hauler wasting a lot of time an industrial or barge of some sort would be nice heres my concept  thats my concept

please please please make these kinds of changes to poss i was so disappointed when i saw my first pos pardon my bluntness but the way they are implemented now is just utter and complete crap
cant believe this isnt getting more attentionsignedagain
signedalthough i believe the idea is still raw and needs a lot of refining i think this is a great direction
i think that increasing the bonus that rsd ships give out should be increased to 75 instead of 5 making them more useful

yes ecm ships got the boost now pls do the rest

i dont use two monitors now but if it meant being able to see the game while i marketbrowse i certainly would  
yes yes yes and i think this whould be a new 1st in an mmo if not out of all games so it gets my veto
love it support
just rewrite the ui so we can drag windows like chats fleet market etc outside eves main window something like tool and palette windows in photoshop 1920 or 1680 resolution would be large enough for eve if one could get all those secondary windows outta the way and keep only the overview and ship hud in the main window
yes please
signed
eve absolutely needs native multimonitor support  unless it would cause server lag yes you can already stretch eve over monitors with hardware but to clarify its a function of your video card and its video driver not the eve client  if we could unhinge parts of the ui size the screen to what we want and put ui  read overview market window etc  items where we want while changing the center point  eve would be much more awesome than it already is but fix lag in massive fleet battles first
i was just talking to one of the goon fcs about cap training and when i said i was planning on training minmatar caps he laughed i loved my scimitar and remote repping in hostile situations is fun for me so i figured the nid wouldnt be too bad however my first time trying to make a nag fit in eft my jaw dropped being able to fit the 4 weapons siege mod and one boosterr or repper with little cpu left over is pretty pathetic especially given the fact that their damage output is so low nag pilots would be forced to shield tank so they can fit damage mods to increase their damage the fix i thought to myself was exactly what yorda suggested minus the 33 turretmissile idea  im allfor 3 turrets and no missiles however  changing the nag and the nid to shield tankers would balance the shieldarmor tanker capitals hopefully this issue will be addressed before i have to train for dreads
these slot arrangement needs to be more specialised
i dont think that black ops bs will ever eclipse capitals ever in any category and that right now they are just big expensive toys that need a big boost the sins bonus isnt useful panthers is kinda funny and gimmicky while the redeemer and widow remain most useful  in my opinion  giving the panther a range bonus and the sin a rep amount bonus would make those ships more useful but those are just a few quick ideas i came up with on the spot the most glaring weakness as i see it is that the fuel bay is too small as discussed ships that emerge from being bridged are not cloaked  recons stealth bombers covops are all pretty fragile  and that ships that need to launch a covert cyno need cyno theory 5  which isnt that big of a deal but it is a pain to train edit upon reading waxaus post i like his idea of giving the ships an ew bonus  but not as strong as the recon equivalent maybe 23  and giving them a covops cloak capacity they shouldnt replace recons but they should also fit along their scheme
against in its current formits too extreme too cataclysmic too soe like yes that is a grave insult to ccp to compare a move of theirs to soe id rather see a nerf that affects the high end  cruisers going freaking 10k  but leave reasonable fits alone  say 35k  these changes are going to make reasonable setups cost billions because it seems to be balanced based on people fitting crazy stuff i also disagree vehemently with the webifier nerf wtf nerf the only thing that currently can be used to break nanosthe mwd change is just ed a t2 mwd should be faster than a t1 ditto faction and officer onesalso i disagree with giving warp scrams the ability to also shut off mwds that makes one module way too powerful if you want to add that ability to a scramdisruptor module it should be via script so that you have to load either warp scram or mwd scram scriptwebs also should be scripted one for strength another for longer range at the expense of strength
having the invitation to a marathon race i started training being nearly ready someone told me hey dude they shortened the distance its just 100m now i thought  hell st i need to change my training and get some spikesthen  when the races finally started  the referee came hello sportsmen the organizers of these fine games got the audiences opinion  they better like to see werestling hello ccp adjusting balancing fine tuning ok  but turning the whole thing upside down in betweeni vote no the planned changes

just say no to the nano nerfif we want to go all nerf crazy why not nerf things that reallife technology has already shown to be obsolete we can use lasers to shoot down artillery and missiles so why not let amarr take out incoming arty rounds and missiles silly defender missiles and we can use the super advanced technology of mirrors to deflect incoming laser attacks so why not let everyone fit mirrors over their hull to nullify laser damage just saying

can we have all the posts in this thread not linked to accounts which have logged in to sisi this week removedtried it all again tonight and it is still goodthere were some extensive engagement tests and the nano ships still managed to engage and disengage just fine they just had more reason to disengage at timesthe tests included a bubblecamp  and it did not end up with a bunch of dead nanoships they pretty much all got out

well i have tested it and some parts of the change are ok such as the changes to afs and i dont mind the changes to scrams either but the changes to webs and speed are to muchwith the web changes every gallente blaster boat has to fit mwd scram and web disruptor is no longer an option because you have to be able to deactivate your opponents mwd to be able to stay in range becuase webs dont slow things down enough anymore the problem with that though is if you are going up against a blaster boat all you need is ab scram and web and you can dictate range easily because you cut there mwd and will have more speed than them with the ab and the web wont slow you down enough to keep you in blaster range that longalso with the changes missiles get a massive boost over turrets one situation i noticed was with drones drones when webbed at close range are still quick enough to get under your tracking ive got virtualy max gunnery skills and when flying an astarte i was being attacked my 10 hammerheads t2 seen as they was the only things doing dmg to me i decided to try and kll them but i found even when webbed they still manage to orbit me at close range and make it virtualy impossible to kill them which isnt a problem for missile shipsalso the changes seem to cater towards numbers  skill alliances who can put out large numbers with high skilled pilots will like these changes but smaller alliances who rely on hit and runs and picking off large blobs will suffer missile spam on sisi is the iwin at the min this was evident when i flew into the cruisers ffa and just watched cerbs ripping everything apart from whatever range they wantedvagas seem pathetic on the test server ive soloed 2 in my jag and astarte perhaps part of it was down to bad piloting but there has been other instances where all ship types are ripping vagas apart easily curses are ok 1v1 or if you can dictate range but they are awfuly slow now and cant tank at all and rapiers and huginns were getting ripped apartoverall i think the changes to speed is too much you say they are broken becuase missiles and drones cant hit them but if missiles can hit them doesnt that mean that missiles are the superior weapon choice becuase they can do everything the web changes is way to harsh and realy is a big change in gameplay maybe knock it down 10 but the current change is way to much the scram change offers a new style of play and is another way to counter nanos but becomes almost a must fit module combined with the other changes which is somthing ccp say they dont want speed nerf and web nerfs need throwing out and maybe just reducing speed by alittle is all the is needed and the scram boosts along with the boosts to afs are the only things needed to be introduced
holy batman wall of text u got there
i dont like this plan it is not structured eventhough the objective is really clear and well stated the plan doesnt follow a structured path from the objective to solutions but simply jumps from the objective to solutions it is not focused it seems to me like a bunch of ideas thrown there for the only reason that they can imply some changes to speed indeed the plan affects too many different things nerfing even webifiers that is the natural counter of nanoscome on ccp this is the result of a coffebreak brainstorming i know you can do better than thisim against this specific plan of nerfing nanos while im pro a smart way to avoid reaching too fast speedst

we tried blaster ships a lot and if anything they are better than before so i am not sure where you are comming from on thati was shooting drones no problem either  but if your setup makes that hard use your drones on their dronesi dont understand your claim that some ships cant tank at all eitherthere are some awesome tank fits for some of those ships but people are trying to use them how they used to and then moaning it doesnt workmissiles need adjusting a bit  not much though a small tweak on explosion velocity should do it  i agree however that does not make the changes bad in general

i can see where you got the idea that having t2 frigates for all the hulls would be nice but i dont think remote repping is the way to go t1 repping cruisers like the osprey exequror and augoror would outperform your variants with less training

signedthis change has forced one of my three accounts into expiration i cant play with currency only isk and the isk cost increase has forced me to lose an account as i do not make enough extra isk to cover it
so ccp tells the csm and us the players that a price increase is not within the pervue of the csm i guess that is a little nicer than ccp saying stfu plebs pay it and like it but the end result is the same isnt itwhat i find extremely telling about this issue is ccps unwillingness to talk about it or even allow discussion of the topic to me this translates to they are screwing us they know they are screwing us and they dont even feel obligated to admit it talk about learning in nouncertain terms where you stand with a companyoh for the record i support the op and a full disclosure of this subject by ccp i also fully support and request a return of further options to the gtc ie 30 day 90 day 120 day etc not that we are going to get any of these things after over five years i am fully aware that ccp is not in the business of keeping their customers happy or of being responsible to them in any waysupport

this is the issue that has come the closest to making me leave the gamewar decs keep me from playing when i want to play and doing what i want to do merely because i dont always have the time or resources to make sure id be safe in the location where i would be playingcurrently the only solution for this is for me to eternally stay in a npc corp which is just ed and frustratingwhat id really like is for concord to only allow empire fighting if the war is mutual  as it is now the system is basically the same as if i went up to a police officer and said i hate this person so i am going to kill them and merely because i told the police i wanted to kill someone they respond ok no problem go ahead what the hell  as for war decs being necessary to attack logistics chains this is already not the case as many many people have neutral hauling alts to get around this aspect of it right now the war dec system is just a way to force many people to pay for two accounts

how about remove local in low sec  null sec but leave the same as it is now in high secbest of both worlds  pvp  pirate crowd is happy and the carebear crowd is unaffected
removing local flat out is a bad idea until they improve scanningmake it constellation
it is not so cut and dry i think local is fine
yeah so do i m8 but figured i would find a happy middle of the road i can see how it really plays a part in low sec  null sec

an easy solution is just making ppl not appear in local chat until they vocalize themself with a chat messageelse make it possible to disable local chat so that you cant see it and no one else can see you since you arent in that channel simply not joining the local channel unless you want to
i think your incorrect it is reported to your computer displaying the information is just flipping a flag completely stripping it out would require a much more concerted effort and probably a lot of programming time that could be better used on other aspects of the gamejust like one alliance first hacked and got the standings in the local window and then we all got it because it was an unfair advantage this is pretty much the same thing thats why ccp has never removed it except for that hiccup once upon a time they cant figure out how to do so economically personally many of those calling for removal of local will not find the situation they want if it is removed it would actually make the game harder for both the hunted and the hunter the hunted would most likely retreat to empire if they leave hi sec it will be only to do exploration sites and generally in groups becasue any other activity would just be to dangerous theyll either look to stay in npc corps to avoid war declares or gravitate to that as the hunters become more bored in low and 00 sec and look to empire for targetsthe hunters would become bored because of decreasing targets in both cases ultimately folks would probably leave the game faster than the current averageit would probably lead to a slow decline of the game at best and at worst a very drastic decline of the game as what happened to swg
leaving local chat a recent chat is the best e easy way imho evolving che scan system will be needed of coursei dont think it will become boring we speak about pvp in general not only 1vs1 so you need a fleet and an organization and so eliminating local intellychat would improve cooperations some explore to hunt down some gate camp not simply wait at gates or at belts to kill people camping is not pvp imhoeven now people remain in game corp to not risk a war so changing the local system would not alter their gameplay and a recent chat wouldnt hurt themleave the possibility to drop probe and scan pos would render hunting people fun and easy freighter fleet in null sec doesnt change becouse you have to have a recon ship in fleet to scan gate and system ahead so whats the difference only that you will not have the exact number and name of people in system today noone could stealth himself without a cloacking device from au away this is a mess maybe some powerful ships would emit so much emnoise to speak loud in local chat but what for a ship shutten down whit all systems off the tactical sceniarios would be really vast  
i dont think this is a very good ideayou can want to change this so it doesnt show anyone in local but dont go whining in cp when someone sneaks up on you and pops youdoing this would also make it much more difficult to tell if there are pirates in the areawar targetsalliance and corp membersit would make being in system a terrifying experience for some and a rush for othersleave it be
eh not so sure while it is used as a tactical tool by people the potential victims could easily use it the other way around the pirates use local to see who is in system the victimes can use it to see who is yellow flashy red
the bolded mostly but this entire post in general also states while its not the best idea and since you are here saying how its being used as a tactical tool im assuming your a non pvper and if this was implemented you would go whine on cp very quickly because at least local gives you the opportunity to scout for potential dangers like you most certainly do now but you probably dont realize it and if you dont well you better start i do it without thinking and fate decides to punish me when i dont apparently the caldari have been camping neutral systems  concord interbus  in gallente high sec most of the time i check local make a quick scna down to make sure no reds or war targets pop up  or people i know so i can start a conversation with them  anyway im gonig to my corp and im in my little salvage boat destroyer and i come out of local and see what systems i will be passing through  it was a 12 jump journey  and i didnt check local im in the star map and boom one of the caldari militia is camping the gate im in star map and hear the locking sound and think oh well its a noob who thinks he can kill me or someone did it by accident then the ship starts shooting me and it is then i realize its a wt and i didnt check local and look what happened he shot me to like 50 structure before i got to the gateso start using local to your advantage instead of finding a way around it which you are going to regret anyway
i disagree
support in theory the exact roll out would need a lot of work though
making local a recent speakers channel would also mean it cannot be utilized as a tactical tool
i love this idea this would have covop frigates in higher demand and can let said covops and recons scout without being known having it be in delayed mode would still allow people to talk to each other but their presence would still be hidden until they decide to reveal it
no local so when my mate jumps into a system im in someone whom i may not seen for a whilewho is in a different corp or alliance and we may even be at war with each othermeans we can no longer pass the time of day with plesantries or smack how against the ethos of eve friendships begin and are formed through the local channelno longer being able to exchange a few words with passing pilots is a massive down side to losing local a second is when chasing enemy gangs it will be harder to track them down and follow because not every alliance has the numbers of goonswarm who could in therory place a covert ops pilot on every gate to moniter commings and goingsi believe local is a vital aspect of this game
if you read the thread youd see that people have suggested using constellation chat as autoupdating and you can chat in there
dont have constalation channel active have enougth without it
thats as useful an argument as the other folks who say if you dont like local then turn it offthe point is constellation chat spans too great a distance as far as people are concerned they dont use it because they dont want to juggle all the conversations to look for anyone speaking directly to themlocal covers that area right there so you can gab with whoever you like and if you happen to notice someone threatening then you can take appropriate actionwhat isnt factored in is the ships onboard sensors theres no particular reason why you should know the instant someone jumps into the area i dont think that ships have little beacons that ring the doorbell and cry out honey im homebut thats exactly what were calling a problem when a spy wants to sneak unseen into enemy territory to spy on the gathering fleetill just creep up to this gate hopefully no one is on the other end either way ill cloak as soon as i get there and sneak up to viewing range of their pos just gotta make this jump first honey im homeso taking local away from everyone who is abusing it as a tactical intel tool really shouldnt affect you who are only looking to gab with friends you can just as easily ask anyone around here know where to find a villard wheel without seeing the faces of the people who will want to hurt you for askingand as for knowing if friends or enemies are nearby theres that little button for onboard scanner too
that may be we dont know how ccp would implement it the standings data was always available to anyone by doing a get info on the portrait in local do you see any hacks that give a listing of all ships in system beyond the 13au range of your ships scanner is it because theyre not thereone of the points of this change is to make the game more complex if that means harder for you then thats a subjective assessment
interesting topic nice to see these are being looked at a few things ill comment oncomponent manufacturingread this a few times before and does sound appealing i like the idea of manufacturers being able to specialise in a field of manufacturing if components were required  such as components for afterburners would be completely different to say railguns  of course adding new skills would be needed so long as there arent a huge amount of them or highly ranked as for making higher meta items would be nice being able to possibly create them with some extra bits but as to how  either extra items or buying a bpobpc from lp store etc  would be interesting to seeship variationalso sounds good depending on what variations we have as a guess maybe gallente ships could have things oriented to drones blasters and speed perhaps  or anything even shieldmissile variants  but would it affect the actual amount of rig slots available since we have 3 for t1 ships and 2 for t2 ships might be a toss up between having a boost to your ships inherent bonuses  example a dominix variant could get 20 drone damagehp per bs level with or without penalty to something else  or using normal rigs of course would there be a way of adding more rig slots considering the rig fitting window has about 8 slots maybe variants could have more rig slots as well should be fun either wayt2 bposi wouldnt like to see them seeded on the market at all nor do i want to see the return of the lottery however i would like to see t2 bpos issued from either a rd corps lp shop  specific to race so amarr rd corps would see lasers crystals amarr drones armour repairers and hardeners for example  for a high lp cost  the better the item will obviously cost you more lp  or you exchange your rp for a bpo in that case a nanite engineering agent could offer you an expander ii bpo  and any other bpo that requires nanite engineering  for x amount wouldnt be a mass amount of bpos available but would also put invention in a bit of a pickle a third option would be to have a corp based rp store much like the lp store for corps so if you have 4 rd agents for one particular rd corp it would be counted as a single rp store where your combined rp from all fields would go towards various t2 bpos and their components and limited then by raceon a similar theme maybe its time to take a closer look at science jobs in stations and the general lack of meplcopy slots  from highsec all the way to npc nullsec  and how more people can use them without the need of getting a pos perhaps with standings for that corp you have your own private set of slots and gain more as your standing rises  such as 2 of any slot type for standings around 400 and working up to about 5 or 6 nearing 900 standing  could tie in faction standing to it as well perhaps who knows either way needs to be looked at more especially if all these new si changes will come abouthighsec woesthis in all fairness will probably always be an issue for myself i have no business in lowsec because its not that great compared to what i can do in highsec along with some unnecessary risks that some folks dont want to take i believe many people prefer nullsec  00  over lowsec  i for one do anyway much bigger rewards there but at a risk which im willing to take  how to go about making lowsec more popular i dont really know but perhaps something that can appeal to both our combat and noncombat pilots out there  fw isnt really the answer but at least helped it well thats all should be fun to see what happens to all these and look forward to seeing how these might be applied
i am all for supporting the high sec based players and promoting their fun in the game i do like pvp and i am member of a pvp 00 alliance however i really find carebearing also to be fun for limited amount of time in the office every daythere is no need to add content to high sec aspect of eve what it needs is challenge honestly what this side of the game needs is challenge its not challenging enough to manufacture something you can build a bs in a few weeks after you start your industrial character and in a year or a bit more you can actually produce the t2 equivalent  provided you follow the whole chain youself research getting funds to buy bs bpos invention etc  in two years you can build almost all capital ships the main problem is that you can do that on your own invention was supposed to fill that hole but honestly its just tedious and just promotes the use of science alts that never get played its not challenging per sewhat 00 dwellers seek out there is not so much pvp or fame but the structured environment in which to interact with other players and accomplish a common goal  kick bobs or ncs butt for example believe it or not camping a gate for four hours just to get podded in helllag has its perverse moments of fun  thats where the challenge iswhy not give the same thing to high sec dwellers  make it so difficult to build a single t1 bs that at least 10 people have to work together  by making it so that it needs a hundred different components ten of each cheap to produce but requiring too many slots for a person with just 3 alts  just a crazy idea  to get it done make it so difficult to produce a marauder or a black ops that only a high sec alliance of 100 people can do it maybe do something similar with modulesdont fear that shipmodule production will take a hit it will until high sec rises to meet the challenge but who cares  let us blob in t1 frigs and cruisers in 00 instead of bses and capitals might even make things a bit more interesting for a while and losing a bs might actually mean something win all around for high sec and 00same goes for missioning dont make it more profitable make it more challenging make so that in order to do a lvl4 in high sec  thus no pvp  you need 2 bs 2 cruisers and a logistics ship  maybe even a command and definitely an indy to do the salvaginglooting afterward id love to be able to do a mission for laughs with 3 other guys using eve voice right now there is no need for that yes isk input in eve will take a hit for a while but again who cares  people will adapt to this and there is already too much isk around in wallets to keep people buying until things stabilize
eva  csm ankhesentapemkah  commented that research should also be a lot more dynamic as research is currently too static and predictable she suggested having a more variable outcome as well as unique and special rewards that could be obtained through researching an example was to add tech 2 blue print originals as a very rare outcome of an rd process as well as other new and unique itemsi like the idea but not unless there are heavy skill reqs and the chance to get t2bpo is 1 out of 100otherwise current t2 bpo owners will uproar too much and invention might become useless because of the large amount of t2bposit would be nice to implement a time requirment such as you cant get more then t2 bpos per year via that process combined with the above percent that i posted i think that it would be balanced
the problem lies in the fact the people have combat mains and industry alts because the difference in skills required is very wide for manufacturing in particular it would be nice to need the following manufacturing skills based on their current combat counterpartsspaceship command  industryfrigates and destroyers  small hull constructioncruisers bc  medium hull construction  requires small hull iv bs  large hull construction  requires medium hull iv capital ships  capital hull construction  requires large hull iv t2 ship  advanced racial hull construction  requires industry v ships need this skill plus level v hull other possibilitiesnavigation  propulsion systems constructiongunnerymissile launcher operation  weapons systems constructionelectronicsshield  support systems constructionhull upgradesengineering  internal systems construction
being fatalistic about lag comes from years of sitting on one side of gate or the other dying or being liberated of your ship while you wait for the grid to load ccp has seriously conditioned us into accepting this lag as the status quo and we believe there is nothing that can be done about it hence the apathy displayed by the eve community as a whole to provide pressure on ccp toward improving lag caused by massive fleet engagementswe recently had a titan pilot dd friendlies and allow the enemy to escape partly due to a laggy node this is how influential the issue with the robustness of the eve servers is the strength of the node becomes one of the major deciding factors in the outcome of major fleet battles in eve the skill determination and decisions of our pilots and fleet commanders become secondary and diluted by a faltering nodewe see this happening all the time and just throw up our hands shake our heads and utter thats just the way it is  apathyccp can fix this and they are tentatively showing slow signs that they will in the future at some point apply some effort to improvements to fix server lag however who knows when we just need to pressure them into knowing this is the real and urgent priority to us the pilots of eve not all this other crap they are doing to improve eve when did core playability in mmo games become secondary to cosmetic improvementlaggy massive fleet engagements is a major playability issue to 00 alliance we just dont know it because like pavlovs dog weve been conditioned over many years to ignore it and just live with it
let me just ask you this then  do you really think that theyre unaware of the lag problems remember the devs play this game and theyre disproportionately pvpers the oldtimers among them were suffering lag before the game got out of beta and theyve been suffering it for the 5 years since im sure that they would to a man love to have silkysmooth responsiveness in thousandman fleet ops but they cant neglect game development to do it since thats how they get new subscribers and before you say less lag  more subscribers no it doesnt noobs dont experience lag since they dont play in l4 hubs or fleet blobs and even if they have discovered jita its an occasional thing id love to see ccp rewrite the games code install a brandnew supercomputer and run a fibre optic line from rekjavik to my modem but its not realistic hence fatalism  they want it changed i want it changed and itll change eventually on its own schedule the ten thousandth whine thread on the topic wont change that
i whole heartedly agree but as you hinted on before this is way more than just a server side problem this endresult of their programming methods can be seen in our singlethread clientswhy should your game freeze when you open up the corp history tab on a corp hopperwhy should your game freeze when you accidentally open up your corps sanctionable actionswhy should your game freeze when you open up a hangar with a lot of itemsone of the biggest killers is the fact that even when they modified the client to use directx9 graphics they still maintained a singlethreaded experience
while im not against them putting energy into these fleet issues in theory i kinda feel that way too much energy goes into supporting the massive fleet stuff alreadyit does have marquee value and they can show it off and a few alliances really love them but the bulk of the eve population will never see one of these fights outside the news section and have very little interest in themyet developer resources pour into null sec war mechanics  more ships bigger ships alliance toys etc etc  to a detriment to other play stylesin other words the stuff you are asking for is already the favored child of the development process not some ignored little aspect unfortunately it is also a really hard problem to solve which is why it always looks like so little progress is being made
the amount of time wasted on vanity projects such as the walking expansion suggests more should have been about this by now
this balancing issue must not be forgotten
dont use it probably never will but from the stats i have seen from many fights with arty ships in the ranks i tend to agree something needs to be done for the poor ducttapers

i agree this is an exploitif you choose to join a corp that is in a war you should be made to stay in that corp till war is over period
yes its much easier than changing an entire mechanic or warfare it used to be implemented so just put it back
support as this is an obvious exploit but honestly the whole war mechanic itself needs to be looked at its completely broken and doesnt at all serve any purpose anymore and is basically only used for griefing wars should be between corps andor alliances have a beginning a goal and an end for example if you wardec a 00 alliance you should have to show your face in their space once in awhile if you want to maintain the war instead of sitting in empire like a coward
i also support thisneeds to be an exploit
all though this subject was covered two days earlier
i too agree that this should be considered an exploit and that it needs to be resolved
this fix is way way ezsimply make so u cant be fully accepted until your dockedthe accepting corp could accept your application but it wont go into effect until you dockproblem solved
whichever gm you talked to must have been daftleaving a corp to avoid wardec and rejoining later is a bannable offense and thats clearly what hes doing
i agree with the thread title i didnt read the text even if they can leave the corp but remain a target until the wardec is over i dont see a problem with that
okay guys hate to shoot some things down but here is realityisk farmers make corps now they infiltrate corpsshops use a character that they get into a corp in xyz alliance so that character can fly around and grab loot from the can farms the ratters use to store faction lootthey dont use the character much and anyone that uses this character tends to be an english speaking personeveryone has farmers andor a farmer loot gatherer in their alliance and they dont know it especially 00 space holding alliancesso forcing restrictions on what agents they can use if they are not in a corp would just force them into a corp we cant wardec anyhowyou can never wardec an isk farmer corp they dont have roles and drop the corp when the war is declared and jump into another corp within minutesbenn tried tested and that is how they dodge wardecsno amount of petitions for exploits do any good gms say they can do it all day long and there is nothing to stop thembasically the joke is on you for going after the farmers your lost isk and in the meantime they lost a grand total of 30 seconds  thats how long it takes for them to dock at the end of their mission and drop corp accept an app in the next corp and keep truckingthe game mechanics are all for farmers at this stage they can evade wardecs they can evade pvp by cloakinglogging they can transfer isk via market transactions safely they suicide alts in the ice fields at uptime to prevent ganks they are an immense drain on resourcesi am sure i have missed somethingall of these ideas about kicking them out into corps is all fine and good but dodging a wardec should not be allowedit would work if you could not leave a corp with an active or declared war they were forced into corpsthen macro hunter groups would actually clean them out easily
solution every 10 cycles of mining the person at the computer must do something that would be easy for a person but near impossible for all but the best macro programs internet sites use those crazy picture codes have the person at the computer input the code or do some sort of calculationanything that makes mining more interactive will work hope to see this in the industry patch
u want to stop isk farmers and isk spammers just dont buy isk its pretty easybut i support this thread anyways d

is that why i have reported 10 farmers so far and they have not been banned not even one of themi get the usual  we will investigate the issue further  response and a month later all the farmers are still up and farming isk farming benefits only ccp hence why they arent really doing anything to fight them in the first place ccp
something to keep in mind for everyone who keeps saying isk farmers are easy to spot i can see them why cant ccpccp has a somewhat different burden then playing when it comes to tracking down cheaters they really can not act based off someone looking like a macroer  as opposed to someone with multiple or free accounts sitting and neurotically playing  since they have actual money  and potentially liability  on the line if a player gets it wrong they get a bit of egg on their face and maybe feel bad but probably dont care all that much if ccp gets it wrong their bottom line is effected and they might potentially get into an argument with the credit card company about improper denial of service which will cause a fine from the credit card company and those can really eat into your pocket if you are a moderaly small buisness like ccp
covetors are still used to mine with more often than you may think covetors are often used to mine in low sec and 00 situations where security is lacking or war time conditions exsist less tears are shed over losing a 20m ship vs 100m shipalso for fun fit a 1mn ab or a civilian shield booster in the med slot works nicely too
the training times for the covetor are way too long compared to the next step up it is the only t1 ship besides the iteron 5 that requires 5 in its primary skill
agreed on both points and i would also vote for the astrogeology reduced to level 3 treeloxthats right but it isnt an argument against this whole idea right
no it is not but i dont really see much of a need to lower the requirements the only benifit i see to lowering the requirements is that macrominers could be pushed out into the belts quicker otherwise i see no real need for this change and i honestly believe that i would say that if i was starting over from scratch again
i see nothing wrong with adding more slots to the mid however they will be relatively useless without additional pgcpui see no reason to change the skill requirements
while lowering the requirements would not do much for the hard core focused miners it would do wonders for those who are part time miners right now unless you want to invest some serious time into skilling barges you have the effect of quick into retriever stuck therethe analogy for combat ships would be like having frigates destroyers then nothing till t2 battlecruisers fine for someone who all they are doing is training up for the big nasty combat ships but would kinda screw anyone who was only dipping in and wants a gradual progression
except destroyers dont obsolete frigs cruisers dont obsolete destroyers etcthe covetor certainly obsoletes the retriever
depends on where in the game you are talking in mission running  which is often compared to mining  for instance destroyers do obsolete frigates cruisers obsolete destroyers battlecruisers obsolete cruisers and battleships obsolete battlecruisers
well the descriptions havent been changed yet and the fact of the matter is that igs is full of roleplay where you really dont want to mess things up with fw ooc posters cas is way more dead then a zombie and caod just isnt the place to throw fw discussions in as will be felt by both fw and alliance players as it is now most stuff is posted in general where it doesnt belong eithernothing and i repeat nothing in forum descriptions sections or threads points to info about fw so the person who wants to read about it has to skim through everything to find anything on the boards is where the forum pvp should be happening where the vendettas shud rise where ppl can read at work about what battles with what results are happening and that will keep ppl in the game fafa fw is concerned all you can see now is the stats page and thats it and even there nuthing is happening besides more and more ppl quitting on fwim not even involved in fw heck im not even actively playing i just visit these boards to see if fw is hot enuf to get me back into the game and tbh what i see in terms of facilitating from ccp isnt very encouraging ur doing something halfway n not finishing it off or doing it properly learn from other rvr games where things are indeed kicking not having flamewars is bad coz it only shows there is rivalry and competition which is what fw desperately needs dont be afraid to put some extra forum mod attention on it u shud be stimulating this if fw is to survive as a viable concept at allgiving fw a forum is not putting it away in a ghetto it means facilitating and stimulating it giving it public face and recognition it is stuffed away in a ghetto as it is now heck there isnt even a ghetto at present as it is now theres just nothing giving it a platform  not hiving it away if you cant see that you just never did any rvr
i stand corrected there isnt just nothing no theres a sticky in the eve general discussionand hold your breath theres actually info stickied in the drums game development section now why couldnt i think of that
okay for the sake of clarification im going to elucidate you all on what the matter at hand isthe issue raised by players and ccp and supported by a silent majority is that carriers are becoming the new battleship its a matter of simple mudflation and the progression of scope creep in eve online the issue is not solo carriers but fleets of carriers yes carriers need support but right now the best support for carriers is unquestionably yet more carriers we want carriers to be on the front lines but we do not want carriers to be the front lines themselvesin order for developers to maintain interest among veteran players they increase the marketability of their product by continuously releasing new features with new expansions as time progresses the levels  explicitly or implicitly  achievable by older players moves ahead farther and farther yet newer players  or in many cases simply players who fly ships that require less skillpoints  remain at the same initial starting point this is known as scope creep and it is bad for the game because ccp does not create ships so that they can be discarded after the next expansion they want to see their roles preserved and they want to see time and money spent modeling and coding paying off as an investment overall scope creep leaves many players who do not want to participate in the constant vertical migration out in the cold factional warfare released in the last expansion is an admirable attempt to turn back scope creep and give new players and smaller ship pilots something to do but it does not address the core issues with the most profound instance of scope creep in eve referred to as capital ships online
to substantiate the importance of this topic allow me to show you some samples of developer quotes taken from evetv interviews from the pvp tournament in quarter 1 this year viewable here
carrier change ideasover the past year many suggestions have been raised for how to change carriers some were good some not so good here are a few sample suggestions one from zarch aldain from the establishment one from ernest graefenberg from razor alliance and one from yours trulyzarch aldains idea
admittancemy ideas for how to modify fighter damage to allow a specialized carrier to do significantly more damage than current need some work people want to be able to do more damage with fighters if they occupy all of their highslots with drone damage modules but hardly anyone trains advanced drone interfacing to v  let alone level iv  and 1500 max dps like now is a little lackluster and something like 2500 dps for a carrier  with some lowered ability to hit smaller ships maybe  could be more reasonable i dont exactly have a clear idea for how to fix that though however i think my idea for nerfing spider tanks and incentivizing repairing support and not other capitals is very good and something at least similar to it would be integral to the game behaving as the developers envisioned recommended changes at base carriers can deploy 5 fightersdrones of their own  125mbitsec bandwidth  but can still delegate up to 10  including original 5  to gang members with carrier v a mothership can use 10 fighters on its own  250mbitsec bandwidth  at base but has 20 overall to use at once change dcus so that they give 2 fightersdrones controllable by the carrier instead of 1 and 50mbits bandwidth introduce new highslot module that does something like o disallows fighter delegation to gangmateso enables the carrier to use new bomber fighters that do 5x the damage of fighters but have 1000m signature resolution for their turrets are slower occupy 5000m3  like a normal fighter  but you can only launch five at once o disrupts the warp and jump driveo lasts 510 minutes and consumes fuel  or not  similar to siege modeo problem this makes a carriers max dps similar if not the same as a motherships maybe give motherships an extra damage bonus to bombers so they can do around 3500 dps  4375 for a nyx   consider dividing the drone bay into specific bays one for ordinary drones and one for fighters and bombers make the regular drone bay 10002000m3 just in case the fact that carriers can carry thousands of light medium and heavy combat and logistics drones bothers you  its not really a huge issue for me but i dunno it does kind of rub me the wrong way from time to time   reduce capital remote armor repairer capital shield transporter and capital energy transfer array rep amount and cap use by 13  dont freak out until you get to the end please  vastly reduce cpu requirements for capital energy transfer arrays capital shield transporters and drone control units  increase the cpu need for officer smartbombs many officer and faction items are harder to fit than other meta levels but smartbombs are an exception change triage module to have something like the following bonuses  note that some bonuses are already there currently 1 1000 bonus to sensor resolution  faster locking  2 immunity to electronic warfare3 cannot move warp or jump  probably maybe could negotiate the ability to move on grid 4 2x bonus to capital remote repshieldtransporterenergytransfer amount  more efficient  5 2x bonus to capital armor repairer and capital shield booster amount6 5x bonus to capital armor repairer and capital shield booster duration  more repaired but harder on cap use  7 immunity to capital remote armor repairers capital energy transfer arrays and capital shield transporters  but not large medium or small ones 8 1000x capacitor need for electronic warfare modules9 cannot use its own fighters but can still delegate them to gangmates  probably  10 small boost to capital logistics module range reduce skill prerequisite for tactical logistics reconfiguration to logistics iv instead of logistics v
the idea behind the 5fighter nerf was that it was meant to incentivize carriers repairing the support instead of just other carriers only the support can use the fighters and if the support dies then the fleet has lost their effective total dps to prevent this the carriers have to keep the support alive basically returning them to their original ideal role the problem is not just that carriers and motherships can  at least sometimes  operate without support but that in many cases the best support for carriers is yet more carriers leading to unwanted alphaclassingcarriers arent used to repair support in battles very commonly now because of lots of things both in and out of player control people cant rep their support too effectively because of things like lag where a subcapital ship will be dead by the time the repairer activates making them want to rep other carriers instead in addition carriers always have much higher resistances than subcapitals making it more efficient  in terms of hpsecond  to rep other carriers further carriers are more expensive individually than subcapitals so people want to rep those since it hurts more to lose a carrier than just a bsmaking repairers extra worthwhile in triage mode means that carriers have to use triage to gain the real benefits to support but also means that they cant spider tank their carriers anymore because of the immunity to capital logistics modules this puts an upper limit on the number of carriers or motherships in a fleet where at larger fleet sizes  100200  they are still somewhat useful but i imagine people would find it too risky and would not want to bring them out because they would be afraid of getting primaried by an entire fleet and losing their carrier or mothership to this i would point out that a standard archon has 31 times the effective hitpoints of your standard fleet megathron and the archon in triage can repair itself with one capital repairer that repairs as much as four and has the cap use of just two if a battleship fleet primaries that archon and the archons fleet attacks the enemy battleships the battleships may have destroyed a carrier worth maybe 20 billion isk altogether but the archons fleet has destroyed at least as much in tech 2fitted battleships and almost guaranteed substantially more in the same time frameif you want to repair other carriers you can still triage a carrier and have it repair an attack carrier but if you want to repair a carrier in triage you have to use subcapitals such as logistics cruisers a carrier in triage can transfer energy and repair armor or shield on a handful of logistics cruisers and while that may not be able to keep a carrier alive under a fleets firepower it will still prolong the carriers life at the very least whats more with a repairers power split by three  maybe more its up for debate  a carrier can repair multiple ships with greater efficiency but also adjust which modules to activate to retain cap stability the maximum amount that a carrier could repair remotely has definitely decreased and now there is a weak link in spider tankings chain but overall i think that people could adjust over time and in the end accept the benefits of greater efficiency more ships repairable at once more granular activation of logistics modules  better cap stability  and more still maybe you could consider adding in a script that gives you basically the same triage module that you have now just for fun
it could be the case that they may have to revisit the ewar immunity of motherships retaining their immunity to conventional warp scramblers but removing the immunity to damps ecm and webs since otherwise there is no weak link in the chain to take advantage of but whether or not it is necessary is up for debate other little things to consider buffingfighter cost  theyre a little on the expensive side if they got nerfed maybe itd be safe enough to make them a bit cheaper skill prerequisites  carriers require months of skills exclusive to capital ships that have absolutely no benefit to subcapitals such as advanced spaceship command and advanced drone interfacing ccp has already tried to alleviate this by introducing the black ops battleship but still please consider removing some skill prerequisites such as jump drive operation v advanced spaceship command v and so on this makes the blow a lot lighter for people who were in the middle of training for capitals but feel disappointed that theyre going to be nerfed and the skill training time is boring and causes harmful stratification between newbies and veterans and thats bad enoughmothership buffs  please consider some of the ideas for the remote ecm burst and the clone vat bay published in this thread
how about we fire zulupark and nozh
i would like to see a lot more thought poured into carriers and this is a good start for now signed and i wait with anticipation
bane is a smart and eloquent man
supportedhopefully this stays on topic it was an excellent read i was gonna ask for a tldr but its actually worthwhile because there are good rationales in there
i endorse this messagenote there are no emotes to suggest that i am joking
tldr versionsimply put are you pro or con zuluparks proposal concerning carriers
stop whining and read the whole thing it is much more in depth than zuluparks and youre being rude
bane i have no idea whether i agree with your ideas and those of others that you bring forward  but theyre at least interesting im not wholly opposed to the state of carriers asis but id likely be in favour of a wellconsidered change to how they operate as long as it ultimately made sense carriers being endgame is a problem and while i dont think its as bad as zuluparks dev blog made it out to be its something id like to see addressed capitals are for old rich players who need a big hammer for a specific nail theyre not supposed to be pwnmobiles for the sake of it im not sure any of the specific changes proposed are the right one but i think youre at least barking up the right tree tldr  read the damn post cretin
then why reference zulupark in the subject line if they are more in depth more thought out  than zuluparksi can not be arsed to read anything more than 23 lines long if it contains his name in it im sure you understand why
zuluparks dev blog is the single most prominent example of the discussion bane wants to have regarding the roles of capital ships in the future and he referenced it for that reason and if you cant be arsed to read it then stop being arsed to clutter up the thread whining for a secretary either participate in the thread or stfugtfo
understood and thats fine basically zulu has expressed discontent with capitals online based on that thought and similar discussions bane constructed a solution that seems to lie parallel with the views and concerns of the developers the carrier fixes he proposes attempt to shift it to more of a support role rather than its current role as the quantum unit of fleet engagement
i am always stunned when i hear such sentiments from devs that they didnt expect capital ships to become the next bs ofc they would it only evolution they provided in game everyone one wants bigger badder more pew pew basic human nature and the devs perfectly fed it when they introduced carriers 2ish years agoanyways back to the op i am currently reading it mulling it over might even sleep on it and get back to you all later rome wasnt built in a day you knowps herschel yamamoto change your rag a bit more frequently imopss fahtim meidires at least we kept banes thread in the top 5 while you educated me  
this isnt the first issue that was initially voted down when it was too vague and then reconstructed to specificity and posted in the assembly hall to gain fresh support and force it on the table so it may be thats the goal if it was presented poorly the first time hopefully this suffices
bomber fighterslol so dreads will be usefull only for pos killingalso imo fighter delegation need some nerf because mostly during subcapital ship fights carriers just sitting near poses and delegating fighters
this was all discussed
bumping this jeez
being a carrier pilot myself i have to say they have become the new battleship of eve tbh carriers dont need to be nerfed combat wise tbh they suck at it the only thing they dont suck at combat wise is engaging targets that are smaller than themselves so carriers were meant to support fleets righti tend to use mine in several rolesfirepower  fighters carrying supplies  warp bubbles extra ammo scan probes scan ships cap charges scripts extra drones etc transporting ships to the frontlines generally when we know longerterm engagements are going to go downbut i also use it for logistical purposes such as putting up pos towers keeping them running etc  i dont want a jump freighter and i dont want a rorquoral as much as they would help with this so the only combat duty it has is remote repping and assigning fighters so how aboutremove all ability for them to control their own fighters  it sounds harsh but makes sense  but increase the number of fighters they can control  think this was stated above or something similar to it give fighters the ability to use some kind of stasis webification  but not warp inhibition that would waaaayyy overbalance things make them more of a mobile station and less of a bulldozer  more corp hangar space and maybe even a public hangar space for alliance or blue members now here is my favorite idea give fighters and other drones the ability to engage enemy drones so instead of the carriers fighters bulldozing everything in sight you can maintain a sort of drone superiority and then work on the enemys ships in conjunction with this give fighters better damage against dronesother fighters and then give them 12 ish damage against battleship sized targets for instance or as was stated above create a new class of fighter such as a bomber i personally think this idea is awesome because it could create some epic dogfights in addition to giving carriers a role that makes sensenuff said
see you gotta kinda prove that bit before we go any furtherlist the names of your silent majority  otherwise refrain from making the claimuse the phrase me and my alliance mates
voting for lavista vista to be kicked from the csm councilflaming fellow csm delegates without adding anything constructive to the topic at hand seems like a display of disrespect shortsightedness and plain utter stupidity
bob yet again trying to stunt game balance in favor of ingame vested interests deploy to counter bane inerfedtitans glorious ideas more as this develops
what if  with fixing current bombs  ccp added either new class of torpedo bombers or new weapons for sbs that did sufficient damage to capital ships 99 grid reduction for citadel launchers to prevent them from being used against pos modules instead of dreds they could get very tiny range  so pos guns will always slaughter them 
haters get outvoting to stop capital inflation 08
or maybe i dont think the minority should be able to claim they are speaking for the majority when pushing an agnda which suits their vested interestsyou get that right
supported
i enjoy this one here
good idea
this is really a lot of work between nerfing nano ships and caps wouldnt it just be easier to do a general skillpoint reset along with a 15 million sp cap
just to be clear is this the part that would be escalated there are several different ideas brought up in your writeup but it isnt completely clear which ones would be the ones proposed to ccp if this passes
lots of words that i generally agree with
as i said these ideas are just sample solutions to the problem what ccp decides to do is entirely up to them all three will be included in the submission template for them to read and they will likely give their opinions on their viability escalation in this case is as the topic says a discussion of the issue of carrier spam ccp has no obligation to give a flying fart about my idea specifically
supported at least as far as to have ccp readdress the situation the current solution is less than optimal for numerous reasons not the least of which is the lack of a focus for carriersdreads kill structures and nonnanod capitals  nanotitans are abominations but anyhoo rorquals are mobile mining and hauling beastscarriers  and by extension motherships  and titans dont have very welldefined roles titans at least have a dedicated logisticstactical angle to them with their jumpbridge ability motherships can jump into an area and clonejump in some support though this facility is of limited use aside from raidingcarriers are basically large dominixes that have a large cargohold is it any surprise then that they are becoming the new battleshipgive carriers a role and a defined function
well despite the fact that you already raised this exact issue before and been voted down i still support it in theory although without specific proposals it is impossible to give any support to the thread unless of course you are planning on not presenting the issues without any proposals to ccp in which case i cant support it either as it would be a waste of their time
didnt read the rest of the posts
i think this proposal just needs a clearer mission statement as the initial writeup in the op is vague and then it quickly gets into very detailed specifics and you have to really dig to figure out what exactly the proposal is all about at present simply supporting having a discussion could go in so many ways that it is very hard to lend support to it despite much more concrete sample recommendations appearing later on in the proposala firm statement at the start would really help this out something like the csm should recommend that ccp revisit the idea of changing the carriers role and that that revisiting should involve increasing the level of specialization in any given carrier fit to prevent it from being a jack of all trades on the battlefield and then later get into the specific types of fits youd like to see possible and what their weaknesses and strengths would bebasically something broad enough that people dont reject the concept because of some silly detail but not so vague that people cant tell what theyre signing on to when they support it
then ill be sure to mention this in the meeting this sundaycan i have your thumbs up now
itt goonswarm tries to get capitals nerfed so they have a chance
why is there no thumbs down option because thats what i would pick
ugh ccp has enough problems coming up with sweeping changes on their own it rarely works out as much as it might bore the lead developer small incremental changes are the only way to do things in a game like eve because the only place you can really learn about game balance is on the live server the skewed riskreward on sisi makes it useless as an indicator of how ships will actually be used on tq and ccp has shown a complete inability to predict totally obvious yet potentially abusive game mechanics  cruise missles on kestrals titan fleets etc  the biggest problem is that this post completely sweeps under the rug what your own alliance did over the past two weeks where noncapital fleets were used convincingly breaking spider tanks isnt rocketscience everyone knows how to do it  although it would be nice if damps on bonused ships at least could manage this again  the reality isnt that capital ships are necessarily overpowered but that once you reach a carrier fleet of a certian size its impossible to bring to bear a large enough subcap fleet against them this is a lag issue as much as a capships online issue that said you make a strong point about carriers being able to do too much at once while in combat remoterep  fighter dps  smartbombneutetc means they dont have a lot of weaknesses other than ecm and a large enough carrier blob will be able to survive those 1520 jam chances enough to maintain its spidertank nerfing captial remotereps seems like a pretty simple and straightforward solution  eg cutting their rep amount and cap use in half  that isnt likely to have any major sideeffects  youd need to half the volume of the reps as a result and their mineral cost and make every single cap remoterep into two when the change is implemented but thats all stuff thats been done before 
caps turned this game from intresting and fun into boring pos wars and lagfests
this is a good enough post so thank you i agree that the biggest problem with carriers is the difficulty with breaking spider tanks and how their strength increases in a supralinear fashion as carrier numbers increase ernests idea for carriers might be the most like what youre looking for
no i think youll find that poss did that
we have an absolute load of carriers these days
id support that statement more or less uneditedcalling them jack of all trades sums up the issue nicely the issues with carriers is not that they are strictly speaking overpowered  they die fairly frequently in combat even to subcapitals  but that they have the ability to carry out almost any role one can think of reasonably well with a single generic omnifitting it would be more in keeping with eve if carrier pilots were forced to commit to a particular role like the pilots of every other shiptype are if not at the point of purchase then at least at the fitting screen
i will never support a change that takes fighters out of my own control theyre my fighters not my gangs i trained for them i bought them i want to control them and i think it highly unfair that in order to use my ship im required to have other people around to use it for me thats ridiculous i should always have the option to use my ship as i see fit and not require other people to use it the risk should be higher without support players around me but that would be my choice to use my ship in a risky mannerimagine me telling you that in order to use a battleship you had to be in the gang of a person with wing command 3 in order to use your guns that you can only use 3 of your 6 guns if you arent in a gang w a wing commander 3 leader yeah it makes about as much sense as me not being able to order my own fighters around the issue is spider repping the issue is not fighter control nerf the spider repping the issue with capitals being all powerful will begin to fade its a very simple fix you can only use capital remote reppers if in triage mode this makes carriers a sitting ducki support making dcus more viable a dmg increase sounds nicecapitals should use capitalmodulesonly in high slots give us a capital smartbombneut make sure the fitting requirements are increased restrict non capital mods in highs and youll see less problems mothership tanks need to be improved theyre too easy to take down solo the right gang can do it quickly and without a ton of players involved i expect a ship that i paid 25 billion  incl fittings  and trained 2 freaking years for will last longer than 3 minutes on the battlefield
thats just it thoughthis isnt a battleship and one of the points of this thread is to keep them from being lessmobile harderhitting versions of battleships maybe nerfing the spidertank will be sufficient maybe more of a stick is needed to wedge carriers into a specific roleim in the same boative actually trained several accounts to use carriers and it is entirely possible that when the carrier is repurposed or betterdefined ill be screwed out of the utility i had in mind however a generic doeverything ship is not good for eveone thing im hoping for is a reduction in the capital remote rep modules in terms of fitting and abilityand a reduction to logistics 4 for the triage module i think the original vision of the carrier was for a subcapital support vesselforce multiplier and if that happens to be the defining vision then i hope it gets to be a bit easier to train into that role having to train dozens of skills to 5 as prerequisites to even sit into the carrier and fit the mods  let alone use them well  is very harsh logistics 5 is basically forcing people to train battleship 5 all over again
my example was just used for the principal of the matter i 100 agree that carriers shouldnt be the all around gods of the battlefield but carriers are just that  carriers of fighters the fighter should define the carrier not the mods the carrier pilot decides to equip if carriers want to do better at repping members of their gang withdraw their fighters and put out repping drones so again reduce the effectiveness of the remote reppers remove the ability to equip noncapital modules in high slots  add more of a variety of capital modules with appropriate fitting costs though  and you will see a big difference in the ability of capitals to demolish everything on the battlefield and never die yeah making logistics 4 the prereq for triage wont hurt either there is no need to require delegation of fighters or put other cavioughts  sp  in order for a pilot to even use his ship though in order to obtain a balance of capitals in the game
i think that this is worth pushing forward
even assuming you limit yourself to these proposals thats just it they are proposals in the plural youre still attempting to forward a large number of proposals in one csm vote you need to break it down into individual proposalscongratulations a really big post this is your proposal to the csm for escalation all these changes and ideas from yourself and others whom you give urls for this is nothing more than a goonswarm wish list designed to give them a bigger easier win buttonas you claim to be a recent graduate in business i would have expected a much better presentation than this confusing bulk array of ideas quotes opinion from a player you dont even name  darius  personal opinion expressed as the silent majority and nerf ideas for carriers one of these ideas at base carriers can deploy 5 fightersdrones of their own  125mbitsec bandwidth  but can still delegate up to 10  including original 5  to gang members with carrier v a mothership can use 10 fighters on its own  250mbitsec bandwidth  at base but has 20 overall to use at once is the same one ccp zulupark was unmercifully flamed for when he made it forcing carrier pilots to have what amounts to a copilot s  in order to deploy their own fighterswhat this all boils down to is reduce effectiveness of carriers decrease skill training necessary to pilot carriers force carriers into a support role as opposed to a direct combat role increase the effectiveness of smaller ships against carriers decrease effectiveness of carriers against smaller ships increase the dependence of carriers upon smaller ships even to the point of making the carrier pilot dependent upon smaller ships to deploy the carriers own drones minimization of the effectiveness of skills older players have and maximization of the effectiveness of skills newer players haveand what that boils down to is candyland for a large alliance composed of relatively new players who are too impatient to dedicate the resources to train for and purchase capitals and who prefer to blob with less expensive and easier to fly ships instant gratification has always been the hallmark of goonswarmolder players with more skills and resources that have been developed over years are what is under attack here without carriers and other capital ships these players will be easily overwhelmed by an alliance such as goonswarm representswindjammerps playing the race card is repulsive enough without being vulgar about it besides photographic evidence seems to indicate youre a curly haired white kid needless to say i and others will not be puckering up regardless of the skin color
the idea of carriers having to specialise is an interesting one and one i think would benifit the game as a wholemaybe having to sacrifice the cha andor the sma to achieve maximum dps or repping potential would be usefull as well and incentivising filling highslots with dps or repping modules  ie make 45 dcus or remote reps usable and useful  would make it harder to be a jack of all trades
how have i not signed this
hi i came accross this issue recently when i had been contracted to do a copy job on small nosferatu 1 bpo specifically the order was for 20 max run bpcs imagine my suprise when i found out that this would take a grand total of 625 days to do he job  which given other small module high slot item times seems unreal to be honest so to give a run down of the research copy times per single copy on the vampire family  assuming science five skill  please see belowsmall nosferatu 1  15 minsmedium nosferatu 1  30 minsheavy nosferatu 1  60 minsto give a comparison lets compare this with the nosferatus cousin the energy neutralizer familysmall energy neutralizer 1  1 minsmedium energy neutralizer 1  1 minsheavy energy neutralizer 1  1 minsi have bugreported this issue as i had believed it was a bug and i know that previously the copy times on the nosferatus were a lot lower than what they are now and the responce i have received was as followsso what i am asking is that the csm take up this issue and ask ccp to bring the energy vampire bpos copy times into line with that of the energy neutralizer bpos after all when you consider that they are both part of the same energy subsystems family it seems rather strange that they have such vastly different copy times
interestingly enough the small nos bpo used to have the following copy stats but i am unsure whenwhy this was alteredhopefully csm will take up this issue and get it resolved and bring the research times back to how they used to be and inline with the other mods in the energy subsystems family
not an issue that effects me but with the current wishes of ccp being towards balance i think it is important to balance everything
obviously agree with my own topic
i agree for balance sake this should be addressed
the response to the bug report seemed to say that small nos and small neut have the same copy time but the data you provided indicates that they do not is the gm who responded to you in error is your data in error or am i just reading this wrong
its not a gm response discussing gm responses is not eve allowed the response was from a bughunter and they usually consult with the people in the know about that sort of a thingif you ask me this does not really warant a csm issue its very small and not really breaks anything or causes massive issues for anyone
in essence i would agree but to me it looks like ccp are saying as intended when what has probably happened is they have fecked up the db entries for the nosferatus given the apparent disparity between them and neutralizors i would not actually have taken this path were it not for the fact that i have petitioned and bug reported  and resubmitted bug report as i was not happy with initial one line responce  and basically been left no option forward on it than what the bughunter themselves suggested ie use the csm function
lol good point 1 for reading i am actually going to reopen the bug report because i didnt read properly what the bh said at first re small energy neut 1 will respond back here once i hear more edit blimey bug hunters reply quicklyso yeah guess the previous bher mistyped
this i dont want to disable effects outright and not see important stuff that could actually kill me like dictor bubbles and doomsdays but right now one of the simplest visual issues with eve is looking at a bs fleet that appears to be in a pond kids are throwing stones into
pls
dualboxing one character who flies a falcon and a buzzard and another who flies a thanatos is a total nightmare because of this restriction while it should be just a two click process to switch from one hull to another instead it takes five minutes of shuffling scan probes and lo around just so i can keep my cargohold full of the things i need to go about my businessutterly unacceptable
agreed
carrier pilot posting to say that this is needs to be looked into
please yes
yeah you guys basically need to either start learning how unfun your game is to play or start listening to the players who actually play your game fix this and maybe increase playability for once instead of adding  broken  new features that nobody asked for or wanted
as you have some need to not allow the cha of a carrier to allow it to be used for logistics as some form of meet in the middle not allowing industrials in the cha of carriers could be an option
please for the love of eve devs take notice and act on it
agreed
seriously this change needs to happen
while i dont fly capitals  carriers this sounds like a good argumentsupported
supported
yace
very much agreesigned
snypa
great idea
nice
i approve
do it fffffff
ex to the zee makes an excellent point signed
was a good changeno support
so say we all
voting yes on dis
i think there needs to be more than just ammo allowed but not everything in specific i am talking about cyno fuel etc
nice troll
do it 
to ccpif it aint broke dont fix itit wasnt broke you fixed itunfix itlovingly yoursvakor
yase
this was always a horribly conceived nerf
this
how can i effectively run a group of frigates from a carrier fully fitted and ready to go and extra parts to spare with this nerfi thought the idea of carriers and motherships were to be mobile stations thus why they have clone vat bays etc whats the point of those if people cant effectively use the ship for the very purpose theyre designed forthings need to be changed back to how they were or have less restrictions
please do this there are far better options available for largescale hauling and it makes too many little things annoying
poorly implemented then unnecessary now probably the most hamfisted change ive seen ccp make
i agree if only to allow things like base minerals and trade goods to be held in ship cargo while docked
how about allowing everything but haulers to have stuff in their cargo hold or as someone else stated only allow 1km3 in a cargo hold
signedrostran targo future carrier pilot
make life easier sure why not
please do this  the restriction no longer serves a purpose
signed
makes sense to me ill bring this to the next csm meeting for considerationiz
having just got into carrier use i can vouch for the frustration of trying to swap ships only to realise you have one non0ammo item in your cargohold or trying to scoop some ships left in a pos etc etc
signed
still is a big deal especially for me i abhor having my chatbox moving around when i open the market
i will sign any ui fixing post
ui needs a good long hard look at but some specifics needs to be presented
my main issue is the silly bugs that seemed to crop up recentlytho a complete revamp would not be unwelcome
signed
you have to actually click support to sign thiswe need a multithreaded ui so we dont hang when opening a window and eventually multiprocessor support
fix ui
i agree that titans need to be changed but i also think that doomsdays can be salvaged even if doomsday damage remains the same limiting their range  30km instead of 250 maybe  and adding a drawback that would make them be more of a last ditch resort  cant cloak cant warp 50 rep amount and cant jump for a period of time or something  wouldnt be badi would actually like to see that titans would be used as more of a front line station as well but have their turrets be useful as well instead of their highslots being only neuts smartbombs and cloaks besides jump bridges and doomsdays with some using clone vat bays
not signed if you remove the doomsday outright no one will ever deploy a titan in a vulnerable position  and no one will have the chance to kill them instead give them offensive abilities that work alongside a support fleet rather than making it a fleet in itself
this will create a new and greater dynamic in deep space logistics
i like it its simple easy to implement etc
agreed people shouldnt need to ask which ts channel were on every 2mins
now we can tell people to read the motd every 2min

i support this
agreedbloody pain
i would like to encourage the csm to think about thismultiple windows for the market tab like you could actually view market details and my orders at the same time or compare prices of the same item with different meta lvl  or even different types like ion and neutron blasters  would make it much more comfortable imho
yes my veto is in
pro tip use your wallet window to look at your orders and the market window to look at market details at the same timenow on to your idea i would love to be able to have a few different details open at the same time sadly even if we got support for this idea and csm passed it through i bet the database devs would cry that it would make to many calls on the database slowing down nodes maybe crashing them etc etc etcstill a thumbs up from me
1
tim i dont think veto means what you think it meansanyway this is an excellent idea and would be a huge timesaver definitely supported
hehe yeah i noticed that too but i figured id give him a break since he got all the right letters for the word vote
sounds reasonable  would save me a whole lot of switching back and forth to compare various things
 1  remove eccm modules and make eccm a sensor booster script this makes good sense and addresses the reasonable complaint that eccm is the only ew counter that doesnt do anything else 2  change the signal distort amp to affect all forms of ew damps tds tps if 1620 strength per mod is too much  and it might be considering the nonecm ships have more low slots and ccp seem to want lower ew strength for nonecm ew  then 1012 or 1215 would still be pretty useful imo caldari ships should still have the most powerful overall ew but other races should be allowed the option to use fitting options to increase their power losing low slots is a pretty decent tradeoff for ships which are actually supposed to fight 3  add an ew falloff range rig sensor damps and tds rely heavily on their falloff rangein short im not in favour of an ecm nerf but i do believe that other forms of ew need a little help to be more useful
 1  is interesting and as long as they figured out how to compensate all involved i could go for it  2  makes good sense and  3  does as well
thank you theres probably more that could be done but im trying to keep my proposals deliberately simple and modestif a t2 sensor booster can add 60 sensor strength that will give a very significant boost to the chance of resisting a jam to larger ships 2x t2 would with stack penalties give about 210 this isnt exactly an ecm nerf but i think it would allow a much larger number of people the chance to resist ecm attacks without fitting an otherwise inutile modwith respect to boosting the other ew types the sda change is the simplest way to implement it and its automatically balanced as well the specialised ew ships will be able choose to reach their prenerf abilities  at the cost of gimping their nonew ability the choice will be there i prefer to add options rather than always nerfingthe ew falloff rig is simply filling an obvious gap in the rig lineup i know damps used to be overpowered but not including this rig is simply blatant discrimination against gallante ew which everyone now agrees is much less useful that it ought to bethe changes i propose would overall result in a little less overall power for ecm and a decent increment for nonecm caldari should be about more than ew and the other races should be able to at least play the ew game
what we need is a eccm skill there are skills modules rigs faction officer stuff that improve ecm jamming however there are very few things to improve eccm we need to boost eccm we dont need a nerf on ecm
i thought about that  tds and damps are both countered by skills but i couldnt come up with a solution i liked whats your suggestion
absolutely
seems reasonablefull support and a highfive
noone uses maller its a crap ship most people doesnt even know about my maller thread on the ships and modules section just instantly decayed with only 1 other person replying it this clearly shows that noone flies the maller noone knows how to fit a maller to make it competetive and that noone gives a  about iti propose that we increase mallers armor hp by 200 mass by at least 2000 remove its current boniis and give it a large mwd bonus insteadwith the proposed changes the maller will be usefull as a bumper to knock ships larger than itself around the huge inertia will allow it to keep its speed even if the mwd dies from scrambler  the nanofix patch  and also allow it to even give carriers a pushthis will also solve the crappy whackamole problem with stationhugging battleships and captials the maller will simply push them awaye forgot about that its turret slots should be reduced to 2 so that people doesnt abuse the extra armor and makes uberbuffermallers instead
naturally i supports my own topic
okay the maller sucks i agree but your idea is seriously appallingly bad like nightmarishill give you a thumbs up but jesus im glad youre not the one calling the shots at ccp
after playing on sisi and experiencing the new bss that maneuver and fly like supercaps seeing intys nerfed in speed 40 and looking at skills you trained and stuff you bought wasted and reduced to nothing do you vote for no confidence in the management of the dev team which admitted in the dev blog that they came up with the concept of this massive kick to the balls nerf in a mere 5 hours whilst players have proposed far superior solutions over the last yearimho whomever came up with this stupid plan should not be allowed to plan anything more complex than possibly lunch  that we dont have to eat  ever again this proposal makes as much sense as swatting a fly with a nuclear bomb and will produce the same collateral damage 117kms with nav 5 on a freaking raven stupid
i of course support my own proposal
if they only came up with this nerf in 5 hours then that in itself is questionablejust based on the number of pages in the yes to the nerfno to the nerf motions in this forum i would say that this is a very big deali dont support the nerf because the nerf represents the whining and crying of those that never actually tried to combat nanogangsits actually quite easy
edit thought twice ill avoid bashing the op
i hope they made the nerf in 5 hours  honestly it is a good tactic and hear me out herefirst off we all know that the speed nerf is subject to change the fact that this warning is in big yellow letters tells u that not everything will be included the best way to test a speed nerf is to apply everything at once then look at the pros and cons of each individual changei doubt half of the nerf will make it through but i applaud the devs if they all got drunk and in 5 hours thought of all the things that could balance speed well see in a week or two a completely revamped nerf that will be tested again before the final changes
honestly after hearing player feedback in general im quite convinced that eve is better off if they dont listen to player feedback in general
four devs who have been thinking about speed for a year sitting down and spending five hours hashing out ideas facetoface is a whole hell of a lot more than five hours of forum ing frankly that sounds like a whole lot of time to me  id be unimpressed by 20 people for 5 hours but 4 guys can actually get stuff done i dont really like a lot of the changes but im not going to vote no confidence because of that alone
personally you would have gotten a check from me is you had called for a vote of no confidence in the balance teamafter all i wouldnt be paying to play if i thought all of the devs were doing a terrible job some of them are really cool guys cough greyscale coughthe one thing i will second however is that it does seem at times that all some members of the balance team  cough zulupark cough nozh cough  do 247 is sit around drink beer smoke ganja and dream up as many ways as possible to screw over eve and its playerbasemy two iskcheersps the final insult 117 ms raven 125 ms  max skill  fenrir yep thats right the freighter is faster than the battleship something a little wrong with this picture you think balance team maybe huh just a little
supportin da op my positions are quite clear in the threads ive started and discussed in its a terrible idea
the single biggest problem with nano ships wasnt their combat abilities it was how fast they could move across the map and evade things they shouldnt be able to
like they were too fast
in a manner of speaking ccp has been trying to help keep alliances into a more local focus rather than spanning multiple regions this is why they dropped sov 5 from my proposal when they used it it is also why they made more entrances into 00nerfing nanos to ccp is primarily about traffic control and population management what they are doing is trying not to overdo itbut most players are too selfish to notice anything other than their ships not doing 10kms anymore
nozh mode thank you for pointing this out sylthi we of the dev balance team realize we have made a mistake here and are fully willing to admit thatfreighter sublight and warp speeds will be halved with the next patchnozh mode
adapt or die you bunch of girlie girls
the balance team has no idea what they are doing what they are screwing with and are the epitome of how not to interact with people regarding game play changespretty much a lot of idiots
lol wut the i vote you kill yourself
lol whatyes youre going to vote zomg no confidense in the entire development team oh man burnso what does that actually mean nothing squat it means angry people on the forum have made posts that range from valid to completely asinine regarding a design changeif you want to vote no confidence in the development team do it with your wallet anything else especially something as dumb as this would be pointless
look please quit it with silly no confidence in xyz threads they have no meaning its just spam get on the test server test the changes help the devs and testers see the impact of these changes on the game and make your point in a useful waycan we have this thread locked please
buy a stock majority or stfu
vote with you feet and wallet not with some stupid thread no one gives a  about if you feel that stronglysupporting anyway just in case
crosspost from
i think you are right most people suggesting changes only look at the specific ship and its counterparts and expect the ship to have the same qualities instead all ships are created differently and have their own little quirks that make them interesting to play withlooking at the bigger picture is much more interesting and probably a lot more people care and have ideas about that i think what you csm folks should try and get some discussions going on the different aspects of things that you feel could do with improvement after all you are elected to lead the discussion and interpret the wishes of the community
lavista is the goal to come up with a recommendation on how to handle ship balance issues what response are you looking for from the other csm membersdoes the csm need some formal action from ccp to redirect ship balance concerns through other channels or can that goal be accomplished more informally and immediatelyassuming ship balance issues were somehow collected into one master list and ratified by the csm or the playerbase would that be an appropriate formatitem to present to ccpwould the csm be endorsing specific actions such as powergrid increases and module changesif the csm simply refused to take up ship balance issues the attentions of the community may just be redirected to the bigger picture things in a way it is up to the csm to provide leadership and filtering on this and not just wait for the playerbase to tell them what to do i think its far too slippery a slope to continue entertaining these highly specific issues that ccp is unlikely to respond positively to
yes i think for continuity reasons its important we figure out a good way for handling balancing issues unlike bigger issues balancing issues tends to be fairly simplethus a streamlining for the process as described would be a possible solution but for now lets have a good discussion changing the way a body like the csm shouldnt be taken lightly since we need to represent the community they need to understand how the council works too and they have a say tooim sure if we talk to ccp with a proposal for how we should submit these it will be fineelse we can restructure our internal processes but that is not too good due to continuity yes that would be pretty good in my eyes i suggested a similar way in the opits hard to say the csm would of course have to agree that these suggestions are to be presented to ccp but im not sure about how a vote would work on that etcwe would have to discuss this for implementation at a later timeyes you are completely right i would hate to see that the community think we are filtering balancing issues just because we can it seems elitist the problem is that there is no channel for raising balancing issues from the community to ccp i would like if there was a way but i dont think csm is the best place but sadly its the only place that would force us to do it
ship balancing issues as lavista rightly points out is just one of the smaller issues that takes up a lot of time for the csmship balancing imo can never be 100 perfect for all of the eve players due to the fact that a player can have characters in any of 4 races with secondary racial characteristics this means that ccp gives each race exactly the same set of ships ignoring racial differences which would result in some races getting better bonuses in some areas and others in different areas or it tries  as it has  to take account of the strengths of a race and cater ships towards thosethis means that straight off before skills are taken into affect there is a spectrum of different ships that will each suit different types of players within each class of ship for each race there is further possible variation depending on the skills of the character and modulefittinguse ability rigs etc etcessentially there are many possible types of final ship types depending on a character type and skills etc it then follows that there will be major differences between the ship of a certain race class and that of a different race  of the same class this is all kept continuous ingame via the storyline with different corps producing the types of ships for each race each ship with its strengths and weaknessesthe problem comes when a player designs a ship they think will do well against other ships only to find that another ship has an advantage in an area they have overlookedessentially the shipbalancing calls place the csm  and ccp  in a nowin situation players want an ubership that can hold its own and defeat other ships we dont like it when we overlook something and are made to pay the price on the battlefieldanyone watching tourney battles will quickly come to the conclusion that certain ship types are useful in certain situations there is no one answerits essentially like cars in real life each is made to do or fulfil different functions they all look different and have different attributes they even are made by different designers and manufacturersthe betterness of one type over another depends upon how they are employed and who is using them and the situation they are used withini personally dont think the csm should be used as a portal for ships to be tweaked to make them better or like another ship there is a place for it its called the features and ideas discussion forumedit i dont think balancing is needed unless there is some major area that is not working as intended  eg speed  variety as they say is the spice of lifearithron
ive been on record from the very beginning  see link below sig pic  that i am not inclined to support ship nerflove  always love really  few people ask for ships to be nerfed  unless there is an extremely good case for it this is the game we have and generally we choose to fly the ships we fly if we dont like one particular ship we always have the options  subject to skilling for it  to fly a different make  race  and modelsfaiac the csm should be more concerned with considering how the universe works than how a specific module or ship is engineered iz
i like what ccp did with the sansha faction ships personally and would like to see the same done to angel ships and blood ships in some regard as well
nah
tarminics idea looks exactly like mine only he added limitations to what systems and modules you can target based on what defenses are still in placeas for how to make it worktry using a survey scanner sometime it opens a new menu window just like your overview with little dropdowns for the various ore types then you leaf through the options based on range most often and start miningthis systems scanner could do the same thing you lock onto a ship and activate the scanner it opens an extra menu which wouldnt be too big and obscuring since all itd show is weapons shields armor engines warp cap etc basically all the vital parts of the ship i dont see this system allowing you to very precisely target their large armor repairer ii but it could cause damage to armor repairs which would carry over and if you happen to be caldari then targeting their armor repairs wouldnt do much good now would itlittle menu box with a couple of options score enough hits and they cant fire back or they cant mend damage or they cant run away
now its good dtargeting of subsystems could be implemented in the targeting menu as a dropdown option that falls off the side of the rightclick menu also as a dropdown from the target button in the selected item windowsubsystems should have a specified  very low  percentage of the signature radius of the targeted ship this makes it automatically very hard to hit with anything more than very belowtier weaponrysubsystems should be reparable by remotereppers allowing triage to put a wounded cap back into action etc sig radius just makes them harder to lock here giving logistics and triage more lease in lifesubsystems should have a small slice  not adding up to 100  of shieldarmorstructure of the targeted ship simulating the overwhelming of all local defenses in a very specific location all the way through the structuresubsystem damage should be counted against the total hp of the ship using the regular damage calculations on a simulated slice of the ships hp ie if it takes 16000 shield 12000 armor and 14000 structure to blow up the subsystem that amount of damage should be applied to the ships shield armor and structureaoe weapons do not affect subsystems at all 6000m radius is not pinpoint enough psubsystems should automatically repair their structure over time but require remote or local repping to recover their armorshieldsubsystems should receive repair from ships own tanking mods but with a weighted percent of total damage repair applied to the subsystemi dont know how all this became so clear to me so fast but i can already hear the 11000 carrier pilots cringing and the bomber pilots going nuts synopsis of the implementationsmall ship weapons will hit your subsytems on capital  bs as well  ships if they can blow up the protection and do structure damage to the system before you can get a repcycle in you will start eating subsystem structural damage these systems will regen over time becoming active again upon reaching full structure they will become deactivated again once damaged to 0 structure again a carrier or any logistics can give your subsystems extra protection get rid of small ships to prevent losing access to systemsavailable systems should bepropulsion  jump drive speed and agility cut way back high slotsengineering  large capacitor dropno recharge sensors  easier to jam slower locks lose range yes jump drive you have smartbombs fighters drones ddds and should have support a wing of bombers working effectively can pin a capsupercap big tradeoff of pilots required pilots who could be flying tackling ships which are more general purpose and probably regarded as superior in pvp anyway fair trade in tactics you can still warp but align very slowlyi think hitting tanking mods makes absolutely no sense because itd be more like hitting the module that is the locus of all defenses of the ship there would be so much shieldarmor rep coming from that location that the small weapons that could hit it would be working against the total hp of the ship not just a slicebasically your worst nightmare as a cap pilot becomes getting alphastrikes from bombers that hit in between repcycles anything else probably wont have the alphatrackingexplosion radius to hit the weak point hard enough fast enough i stress that the sig radius should be very small and the hp should be to where a bomber wing can pin a cap fleet bombers are a specialized ship with not so much usage so dont complain that its too much for a small ship because its a specialized ship that will still require good coordinationpos warfare trick of the month is to blow up the engineering on a dread and take it down before its out of siege
i would support this for targeting capital ship systems thus making smaller vessels a danger to them  like that a wing that takes out the executor bridge in return of the jedi on smaller vessels i dont think it would be as good
anyone here played tie fighter loved that game
i still think the tactical sensor module would be easier to implement1  to prevent subsystem damage from a 150km sniper the sensor has a much closer range you have to be pretty up close and personal in order to hit specific locations rather than just the ship in general2  the sensor could open a separate menu to display the weak points and the damage meters for each personally i get irritated with all the rightclick flyout menus if you wiggle your mouse just slightly then they disappear or choose something completely different whereas a separate menu would be easier to navigate in the heat of combat3  i dont think that subsystems should each have shieldsarmorhull thats what the ship has in place so either taking the suggestion earlier and saying you cant lock certain systems until the ships defenses are already down or just making subsystem damage resemble heat each area will have a certain amount of damage it can take before it goes down4  i dont think they should repair on their own nor should remote reppers work but i do think we already have the tool for making repairs on our own nanite paste
ah i was thinking about it recently as well when i found the drawing board section of patch notesi was thinking on how to implement this and i think i came up with a good idea first you would need skills to use it something liketargeting level ivsurgical strike level ivsubsystem targeting level inow what you could do would be like this instead of aiming specifically for specific modules ie a vagabonds mwd for example you could aim for high slots mid slots and low slots and it would be like overloading modules  i cant overload modules yet so correct me if im wrong  but you konw when you overload modules they get damaged and un useable for a certain amount of time well what if you could do something similar in this caselike this screen shot see that half circle under structure and the 2 lines that seperate it into 3 sections you could be able to target high slots mid slots and low slots and if the first bar was gone that rack could be deactivated for i would say 3 minutes  no module damage  you shoot him some more and if the second section was shot down to 0 now the modules are damaged and then deactivated for 5 more minutes  the times could stack on top of each other ie you shoot him straight to 23 down so his modules would be deactivated for 8 minutes  when and if you shoot it down all the way the modules are extremely damaged like 3940 down and the modules are deactivated for 10 minutes regardless if you repair them or dock at a stationbut these modules wouldnt be exactly easy to hit either it would have to be along the lines of trying to hit a small drone going like 500meters per second or something and you cant even web them  the modules  so even if you webbed the ship down to 5 msec the modules would still have to be hard to hit of course it would also have to be easier for smaller ships to hit them since they are smaller and use smaller guns themselvesthis would help alot imho so now pirates could shoot  or try  to shoot modules instead of damaging a shipfor other things  normal ship propulsion  idk i dont think it should be a death sentence because if you think about it soemone shoots your propulsion out you are a sitting duck and dont know what if the pirates are going to just keep you all there and maybe pop you one by one  lmao that would funny though line them up you konw you are next the other ship is itno armor structure boom then you hear the locking sound on your ship lmao  anyway if it was to implemented i think i have a good idea on how that would work as well maybe you could shoot propulsion out and it just damages it quite a bit like they shoot out your sublight it would also have its own little bar of health but instead of it being deactivated its performance should be cut down ie first section is shot out ship can only go 66 its normal speed second section shot out ship can only go 33 its normal speed 33 shot out ship can now only go 1 its normal speed and this would work out still on modules that are based off that ships attribute you have a mwd that allows your ship to go 15kmsec for example they shoot out your propulsion and your ship can only go 1 of 15kmsec now your ship can still go 450msec even with its propulsion shot out due to its mwdsame thing should go for warp engines your warp speed could be messed up yoru ship warps at 3au second now it can only warp like 05au a second for example or maybe it could suck way more capacitor to warp out or maybe a combination of bothbottom line though no amount of module popping should prevent you from escaping completely no matter if your propulsion mwd and warp engines are shot out you could still warp away its just more difficultsame thing with weapons and protection you should still be able to use them it should
sorry about double post but maybe also if you dont target the equipment on the ship just targeting the ship itself there could be a random chance  something like a strikes perfectly wrecking for     shot that it does damage a module along with it and if it does it shoots it straight down to its first level of damage and that module is un useable however if you are aiming for a certain rack  high slot mid slot or low slots  when you miss it doesnt damage the ship eitherjust an afterthought
i agree with the idea presented by soldier of fortune here but would make it substantially harder to train for than he presented something along the lines oftargeting vsurgical strike iv or vtrajectory analysis iv or v
ah thank you i knew there were other targeting skills just wasnt sure which onesand thank you for agreeing with me but im not sure about lvl 5 skills those take a while to train for i would say those skills at lvl 4 would be sufficientagain thanks for agreeing with meif this was implemented it would add another complete tactical tool to the game and would give smaller ships a better role in this world when each side starts taking up mass battleship fleets  like the caldari a few days ago they built a fleet up of about 20 battleships 
sorry but i cant say i like this idea
i could see some extra training to accomplish this but i dont think it requires absolute mastery of targeting skills to achieve unless all level vs means you can shoot the capacitor battery cables off a shuttle in midwarp from 200km awayi think part of the idea is to achieve some of the cinematic action we see in sci fi shows targeting certain systems to incapacitate the ship without destroying it completelyi just dont think the tactical officers on star trek or bsg have all trained so thoroughly into targeting just to make a few extra shots i think they have extra sensitive sensor arrays that allow for it kinda like the tactical sensor i suggested already
as much as it seems like a good idea  i loved homeworld 2 and using bombers to that effect was fun  there are a couple flaws the main one lag generated by only a couple hundred ships shooting one pos lags a system as is with nothing else to speak of going on in system is a problem as it is having the servers have to calculate even more divvied damage would kill performance and nodesit would be awesome if it could work in this game but i fear that current mechanics and software wouldnt be able to support it
i think it would be an interesting change to the game mechanics if supercapitals  and possibly capitals  couldnt be tackled in the same way as current ships instead warp disruptors and webs would increase the time they needed to align for warp or to spool up jump drives during this time attackers could target specific subsystems such as propulsion navigation  targeting  weapons and engineering  selfrepair the idea of a freespacehomeworldstyle system for capital ships appeals to me because it would be interesting to see capital ships as vessels that are tough to destroy outright but possible to incapacitate there is even room for currently underused ship classes such as assault frigates and destroyers to be efficient at damaging capital subsystems
while were all referencing other games so there was this game called empire at war and the absolute greatest damned tricks to pull were either sending in a load of bombers after station shield generators or using hero unit red wing with the lucky shot capability that instantly took out a subsystemon to more serious thingsto address the issue of what to do with the 100k of damage that hits skizzlefists titan while people are aiming for the subsystem do the damage calcs twice once for the subsystem once for the titan subtract the damage that managed to land on the subsystem from the larger number this way a big fleet alpha from bss wont be doing 2k to the subsystem instead of the 100k against the titan like i proposed earlier hits to the subsystem hp should affect the total hp so the total hit to the titan would end up being 100k still with the difference being that a sniper bs fleet would have managed to slide a great deal of it through the keyhole surgically dismantling a capital shipjust make the sensor res small enough and you wont have too many issues with snipers taking out subsystems i wouldnt mind if they did but more in a skizzlefists jump drive is primary alphafleet titannogohome manner in other words the ability to put damage onto subsystems accurately is for small ships but can also be done by small er  ships thus preserving balance in huge carrier fleet vs bs fleet battles hell even cruisers would have anticap value at that point bombers maybe even more so 250 dps like a scalpel is a pretty focused designskizzlefists smartbombs got the hic but not before skizzlefists jump drive was incapd skizzlefist loses supercapid like to see some more entropy from the bottom up we dont need another supercap or cap killer just to increase the options for small ships
damn you skizzlefistthats what i was kinda thinking would be a good focusreason for subsystem targeting to allow the nonbscapital ships a reason to join the fleet when the final killmail against that titan reads assault frigate then i think people will see what we mean
i agree with you 100 but i just dont think that the current game engine can handle such a load if it could be implemented that would be amazing
this is the excuse for every other popular idea that has risen on assembly hall  features and ideas not being implementedmaybe ccp should quit wasting so much time and money making patches that suck for weeks after deployment and fix their game up right and proper firstdatabase errors graphics engine malfunctions get it right for once otherwise this is a 5 year long beta test
as the jammers are the only ew mod that is chance based and racial i think it would be good to remove the racials and add racial scripts to be used on the multies the strength on the multies stays like it is and the script gives it the strength of the racials this way the fitting problems of choice which racials to fit is solved and can be adjusted on the spot like the scripts on the sensor boosters and the scripts on the dampers
err how about no racial jammers are a tradeoff more power in return for maybe getting your selection wrong to make them scriptable would be basically the same as upping the power on multispecs to be the same as racials as an ewar pilot i dont think thats necessary
ok then make the multies as strong as the racials now as jamming in the only form of ew that is chance and racial based make the others forms of ew racial or chance based also or take the racials away
i fly ecm and i hate bringing the wrong jammers however this essentially gives everyone the right jammer all the time every time and since currently ecm is dominating electronic warfare this just makes it betterthis could work but must have a very long recalibration time  like 60s or greater  so its not an instant ha im always ready for anything falcons are even better ha ha an rp reason against this is that the sensors on different races ships are based on completely different technology and would require different mechanical parts and physical hardware thus the different jammerspersonally i think the rp reasons outweigh the convenience provided by your suggestion the versatility of the multies comes at a cost of diminished effectiveness and the reason ecm is chance based is that when it does hit it is 100 effective at taking a ship out of battle  minus fof and sb  rather than reducing its effective abilitiesin short ecm is currently the best form of ewar and would be terribly overpowered with this no support until rsd gets buffed or somethingoh and always use racials
ok i see what prompted your argument the difference between ecm and other ewar and the reasoning behind the balancersd target painting tracking disruption100 chance of hitting the targetxxx of effectively removing the target from battleecmxxx chance of hitting the target100 of effectively removing the target from battle
correct but this mod is instead of a tank and then its a chance based tank and ontop its racial so you need to fill all or as many as with  what you think you going to fight racials to have a chance on a successful jamm if you fail you will lose your ship most of the timeall other ew has 100 chance of success and will add to the total damage that is done indirectly or will lead to causing less damage but all will have a tank and only need to use 1 or 2 ew mods to be successful in their rolethe script idea wont make it to powerful as you cant change scripts when you cloaked and if what is mentioned before a calibration time before you can use this mod will be added the only advantage is that you can change your racial setup without docking
still problem is there is no rp explanation for ecm scripts different jammers are physically different from each other both mechanically and at a hardware level because of the extreme effectiveness and completeness of ecm there needs to be more limiting factors in its chance of working in fact chance is really the only factor either you did or did not fit the best module suited for the job
although this would be a good idea if it wouldnt make the jammers totally op itd be the same but being right all the time about your jammee is too muchout of balance
yes it is currently if you want to be prepared for everything you must fit either multispecs resulting in lower range and strength or one of each racial resulting in less meaningful trials thats why racials are in place  otherwise it would be edit surprise sex i fly ecm this would make me god in a griffin not fair at all
having the right module fitted stays the same only you dont need to dock to change iti dont know how old you are as i played when the jammers were not chance based you had the strength and they added up then   total jamm strength vs ship sensor strength   the only thing was to fit the right racials the basic idea of jamm instead of tank little damage output   scorp vs the other races tier 1 bss   vs good jamming as chance based did not existthis base idea does not add up any more as its old concept and after the invention of sensor script and damper scripts   range and locktimes   this old technology is due for an overhaul and racial script should be invented
speaking as a falcon pilot this really would be op a basic limit on my effectiveness is having to balance my loadout being able to weild 56 racials would be completely imbalanced
fix ecmecm is too powerful for 1 race each race should be able to have their own racial bonus and caldari get bonus to their race and multispecso amarr can use one type of racial ecm but get no bonus to others etc as it currently stands ecm is like having 9000 tracting disrupters and 9000 sensor dampners on youalso i would say ecm scripts 1 script for power and 1 for jamming time so scripts that jam you for 20 seconds have low power but scrits that simply break locks like ecm burst do have higher power
noone will ever use the jamming time script except perhaps against solo targets would are doomed anywayalso only someone whos never flow a jamming ship could say something as illinformed and incorrect as ecm is like having 9000 tracting disrupters and 9000 sensor dampners on you thats just utter nonsenseedit i have made an ew balance proposal
then i see more in a short range more strength or longer range less strength scripts for the multies so that you can use more powerful multie jammers on closer range so the risk also goes up as range does not save you as it does now when a cycle fails
its fine asis and this change would eliminate one of the balancing factors to jam setups not signed
horrible idea
i searched back a month worth of threads in here to try and find this and if i repost an issue i apologizeminmatar large artillery and battleships need a buff in the sniping department compared to similarly fit ships from other races artillery battleships pale in just about every single categoryminmatar large artilleryall weapons in have their proscons1  beam lasers pro never need to reload amazing tracking cons use lots of cap horrible falloff emtherm only damage2  railguns pro long range high capacity fast rate of fire cons bad tracking low damage low volley damage expkin only damage3  artillery pro high volley damage no cap high falloff cons horrible capacity horrible tracking horrible rate of fire horrible dps horrible rangehowever as a sniper gun the only attractive qualities are the high volley damage and no cap usage on the artillery in laggy fleet situations having a whole 10 rounds of ammo per gun on 1400mm autocannons is pretty ridiculous when you have to wait 20 minutes to reload the tracking on artillery wouldnt be too much of an issue either if it had the range to match it having 425mm railguns outperform 1400mm artillery in both categoriesis pretty badwhat i would like seen done would be an increase in the base damage modifier as well as a balance to artillery range and tracking to fit somewhere between beam lasers and railguns also doubling their capacity would be amazing their high volleylow rate of fire attribute is nice and is unique to artillery but the other stats need a boostminmatar battleshipstyphoon for a tier 1 battleship the typhoon can spit out ridiculous amounts of damage and still be able to have a decent tank it has the same midslows as the armor tanking megathrons and apocalypse and 8 weapon slots which no other tier 1 battleship has besides its inability to easily fit large artillery which i believe is intentional and dont think needs to be changed it is an amazing shiptempest the designer of this ship took the jack of all trades tradition a bit too far it has a sick dual projectile turret bonus and is basically an older rupturehurricane in battleship form however it decided to try and become some sort of tanking nightmare as well coupled with the problems with artillery discussed above the tempest has the worst range worst dps worst tracking and worst tank of all sniper battleships which is horrible for fleet fighting its a slingshot made of paper while the megathron rokh and apocalypse outshine it in every categorymaelstrom this ship could be a mean machine with autocannons and a good shield setup this thing will laugh as it melts ships at minmatar battleship 5 it out damages a similarlyfit tempest by only 66 which i guess is made up for by its tank however even with its abilities to fit on 8 tech 2 1400mm artillery with advanced weapon upgrades 5 it still gets overshadowed in fleet combat by the usual suspects when it comes to sniping the increase in price and training to barely outperform a tempest is not worth the costso for fleet setups none of the minmatar are very satisfactory module scripting and large artillery woes have doomed these ships for fleet combat overall a big boost to the tempest would make it a good sniper if artillery was also tweaked as far as a fleet ship is concerned the typhoon has its niche and so does the maelstrom as far as im concerned but the maelstrom might also need a little revision to mass in order to make it shine more in its role and fit inline with other minmatar shipsif you disagree please say so and why i understand that ccp wants to keep ships balanced in both pvp and pve environments and i only have really covered one aspect after seeing the apocalypse range change in february id like to see something similar to a minmatar battleship
i support myself imagine that
you missed this thread
whoops so i have is it still acceptable that my thread covers minmatar battleships and all large artillery the issues are in tandem
ill support this  
heres a radical idea why not instead boost the specifically madefor ships that have a sole class just for miningiow why create new ships to make useless barges even more obsolete when you could instead boost the lower bargesi actually do like your idea but i think it is ridiculous enough right now that battleships can outmine small barges no need for even more nonmining ships
i agree that barges should be upgraded before we start adding new ships to replace themif you dont want to risk taking your rigged hulk into 00 space no one will blame you but you could definately take your covetor instead rather than redesign a cruiser to take its placeyou mean how industrials are t1s and blockade runners are t2s of the same hull kinda like how barges are t1s and exhumers are t2scruisers are for combat if you are worried about combat then dont go mining in 00 alone take along a few friends since eve is a multiplayer game
the only useless barge is the procurer all other ones are utilized often and even though you can mine more with a battleship than a retriever the retriever can be bought insured and fit for under 10 mil adding a t2 mining cruiser would make low sec mining ops more enticing as a cruiser is much more survivable than a mining barge or exhumer there is so much ore in low sec and 00 just waiting to be mined but the risk factor is too great for most people so this might be incentive to push people out of empire
more people to kill in 00 i approve
there has been quite a bit of discussion about barsclubs in ambulation and the fact that players may be able to own them if in fact players can own bars i wanted to bring forth the idea of the owner of the bar being able to stream a real song into the game to be broadcasted throughout the establishment this would add some flavor to the scene as well as allow the owner to add some of his own taste after all if he pays good isk to maintain a bar shouldnt he be allowed some sort of freedom for customization of course there would be problems with explicit songs so perhaps the guests at the bar could vote down a song that came on so that the bartender doesnt blare baby got back all night anyway thats just the cool little thought i had obviously there will be a lot of potential problems with this but if this becomes popular enough im sure kinks could be worked out
the major kink i would see if the copyright issues for ccp so unless ccp find someway around that i cant support even if i would like to see it
please make bpcs have a different icon then bpos a simple transparency that puts a mark in the corner of bpc icons would make my life much easier after accidently grouping together 1000 mixed bpos and bpcs i thought i would die before trying to sort them all out
yes please make them different green   copy   and blue   original  or anything so you can see the difference
yes please  is it too hard to put a c in a corner kinda of like how you mark bps for tech 2
i would love this but its not possible according to lingorm
not without much work truebut if their database cant compete with todays requirements its time to redesign itthe current issue cant remain that way forever its ridiculous
and when they change the database this is one thing id love to see fixed but until they do we get to suffer through having to show info every time
this has been explained hundred of times beforeif its that much of a problem use the science and industry interface it has the the copy  original filter built right in
i often have this issue and end up turning off the module i intended to turn off i also like the suggestion of a cycle indicator for modules

telling people to get learning skills out of the way during the trial so they are ready to play the game when the trial ends is pretty funny considering you know theyll be training skills the entire time they are playing the game also considering that having only trained learning skills they actually wont be ready to play the game if we accept the belief that noobs start with too few skills to do anythinganyone dumb enough to train learning skills so early they dont even have enough basic skills to enjoy the lower levels of the game deserves it im not sure if this is even possible to do anymore with the noob sp boost dont they start a stones throw from t2 frigates these days assuming they combat spec ofcanyone so impatient that they are unwilling to wait a month for an entire set of skills to finish training are going to be very disappointed when they find there are single l5s that take a month or more

yes you should be able do disable this especially since i would hope that it would enable you to disable the devgm spam that occurs sometimes using the same msg window i really hate it when they spam things multiple times like when the pvp tourney is about to be broadcast or some such seriously it was already posted on the forums and the login news screen if i cared i got the info already if i didnt your just annoying me even worse one of these stupid pop dialogs informing me that the live dev blog was about to begin actually caused my ship to pop since it had to be acknowledged clicked  before any other ui commands could be entered
i wholeheartedly agree this should be a feature when a split second can make the difference between a smoking ship and a floating pod these popups can be a killer  yes voice of experience there unfortunately you will never get them to do it i have discussed this very item with a gm live and his response was the time warning screens are a very useful tool in our fight against macros they are unlikely to change any time soon typical ccp bullyes we need the ablity to turn them off but good luck on getting ccp to do itcheers
modal windows are nasty
i understand your point but it does seem good against macros sorry but im split
i hadnt thought about it being good against macros but i would think that if a gmdev targetted an individual with such a pop up window then it should bypass the off toggle or it could be set up that way  for just mass general information spammage though we should be able to turn it off
while asteroid belts were removed from jita over a year ago agents still remain jita contains 7 level 1 agents 7 level 2s and 3 level 3s no one with the faintest spark of intelligence is using them and anyone who is should be kicked in the junk its plenty clear by now what jita is used for so kill the agents same goes for any neighboring systems that would bleed over please
contracting damaged goods should have been an option from the beginning of the contract system and not only for this reason
agreed
signeditd also be nice to consider contraband contracting in 00
nevermind use the dev finder under forums im dumb and didnt know about this tool
definately would be a good thing especially if the issue in question is one that could be resolved with a quick yesnoalready answered in topic  link  answer
do you realise that intentionally devs dont post here in the assembly hall this is the players area so they strive to leave it to the players to control exception being to the posting of the meeting notes of the csm meeting in iceland its multithreaded interlinkage was something that only someone with board adminmod powers could have constructedas to your idea being put in place for other subsections of the forums besides the assembly hall while i think it would be nice to have i think in the long run it would just be a self decepetion to us the player base having 1st response post of every thread created would lead players to think they are entitled to a dev response for every post on every subjectidea world i see this working here on eveo it would just become a mass cluster  id rather see the dev finder feature updated more frequently 12hr turn around would be great i think this coupled with an actually functioning search feature would achieve most of what your after and be more worthwhile in the endtldr  no not worth it in the long run
not appropriate to the forum and if the dev really does want to say something op can just edit the op to link it
off topiclocked
no  it is an isk sink and not a signifigant oneit would be used to make playing dockundock games free and dockundock games are gay
it is an isk sink and the repair bay wont go awayfor one thing its much quicker to pay the fee and fly off than it is to wait for the reppers to work their magicalso reppers dont work on modules or drones so you still have to pay to get those repairedarguing against this topic is pretty silly anyways pilots either fit reppers or carry them onboard they dock long enough to swap them out then float right outside the station and repair for free anyways so theres no difference between allowing it just outside and allowing it inside the repair bay isnt getting your isk either way
people seriously stop with this here here nonsense its hear hear in an era before microphones it was easy for a speaker in parliament to be drowned out for that matter in an era with microphones speakers are still often drowned out  and as such his supporters would often yell hear him hear him or simply hear hear to call attention to his words the short version is far more common today of course but it still nonetheless refers to an action and not a location
theyre merry and lively well if you say so i always thought they were lame and annoying myself i like the original idea though 
this would be very nice
d  b
non constructive and not an issue for the csm its assembly hall spam lock please
bump
this issue has been brought to the csms attention and any required action will be taken thank you for the input
i do agree that launching dds should require them going into some variation of a dreads seige modeindeed id not even mind if a dd were made even more powerful if there was that requirement
they already have their cant warp thing right besides this still doesnt stop them from launching multiple and just sitting there assuming any opposing force has been killedmake ddd like a big sb with a diminishing effect from increased radius set medium range  40km  to take the current amount of damage anything closer is almost guaranteed to die anything further takes less damage 100150km snipers should still get hurt but once we get to 200 only paper airplanes should be getting poppedships shouldnt be able to dock  it will turn into station games give them refit bonuses and jump portal  anything that a pos could do really  give them a few more guns too why not make them just as super awesome but in different less gamebreaking categories
not supported because thisi agree local can stay as it is although it would be nice if ccp wrote a backstory scientific article on this omnipotent system scanner that can determine pilot identity from ship signature  if only for rp reasons  zis would be a fair compromise no just say it i like crepes
x the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because the mission runner owns the wrecks and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic
no you are terrible ebile people
if mission runners ever own the wrecks then ninja salvagers will inevitably own them
by all means please do  that would be a change id be happy to be associated withbecause you see the only change is that the option to defend what you see as yours would now be present as to the rest  that can happen any time under the current system just take one single module from a wreck and youre flagged the choice of aggro or not is entirely up to the salvagerim not worried in the least about all the sky is falling and theyre invading my mission space repercussions those can exist right now at the desire of the salvager the fact that it happens only seldom tells me that it will likely to continue to happen only seldom even if there is a changeso yes i think its a fine change and am happy to stand behind my support for it and any possible repercussions from itwhile you may disagree with that position i hope that at least you can respect that it is honestly held honestly stated and that i will back it up
with a name like that id love to agree with you but i cant i dont mind the 30 day skills i dont even mind the 50 day skills its just such a damn good feeling when you get the skill training completed on one of those monsters personally id rather we bring back the old days when you needed level v in a skill to take the advanced skills which followed or to fly the advanced ships dependent upon it
i dont remember exactly but when the advanced learning skills were introduced didnt you have to close out your basic skill before you could even start the advanced ones and somewhere down the road ccp relaxed the requirements a bit to make it easier
correct
what about the maraudors they were never needed for doing missions but still they implemented a ship which could both do the missions with ease and salavge the whole lot and loot with its awesomly large cargoholdtraveling becomes a pain when you need to move more than one ship around over longer distances for just that one purpose of doing exploration sites having a ship that does both can be awesome without being unbalanced as long as it is not made unbalanced a ship that could do a 1010 complex and also scan its location is not desireable bit for use in low sec and high sec i see it a a good ideaplayers may even want to use a covert ship over a potential new ship because if this kind of ship should be balanced it wouldnt be as effecient as the covert ofc
sounds interesting
of course exploring with a partner who flys something ready to do a little combat on rats really helpsi explore and use a helios i have never minded the swapping shipssince i mostly have a wingperson with me when i scan out sites placement of probes for optimum coverage is easy with a little practice if one also remembers that moons can also be flown tooexploring carries risks and has good rewards it shouldnt be a way to make fast and easy iskies by introducing a explorationcombat shiparithron
and the worst thing is that no one really wanted to destroy speed and nanos they want the ability if they fit for it to counter it without nanoing themselvessuch as by fixing webifiers there needs to be a long range but much lower speed reduction webifierinstead amongst the changes is a 50 nerf to web strength with no increase in rangestupid very stupid did i mention the proposal is stupid
i said this in your other thread eleanor the speed nerf is not final they put alot of changes on the test server to see which ones worked and which ones break the game this will be a multistep process dont  yourself
the csm are showing their worthhopefully theyll continue to do so and ignore the babies whod rather whine and cry than adapt to the games changes
yet people keep bugging us ingame about it i cant count the amount of convoes i have gotten because of it and people are always disappointed in my answer edit and oh very few people actually seemed to actually read the very first line of the devblog
i guess bright yellow wasnt good enough next time they should try red or something maybe a rainbow  that would get peoples attention
nano nerf gets a thumb down from me
well they gotta make their money somehow when people quit the game from a nerdrage at the nanonerf
balancing shouldnt be a csm issue unless its gamebreaking as stated alreadyi would like to see more csm member views on this topic
since i sent out an email to all council members when i posted this post i am not happy eitherso i sent another mail and created a thread over here which will hopefully make them post
ship balancing issues as lavista rightly points out is just one of the smaller issues that takes up a lot of time for the csmship balancing imo can never be 100 perfect for all of the eve players due to the fact that a player can have characters in any of 4 races with secondary racial characteristics this means that ccp gives each race exactly the same set of ships ignoring racial differences which would result in some races getting better bonuses in some areas and others in different areas or it tries  as it has  to take account of the strengths of a race and cater ships towards thosethis means that straight off before skills are taken into affect there is a spectrum of different ships that will each suit different types of players within each class of ship for each race there is further possible variation depending on the skills of the character and modulefittinguse ability rigs etc etcessentially there are many possible types of final ship types depending on a character type and skills etc it then follows that there will be major differences between the ship of a certain race class and that of a different race  of the same class this is all kept continuous ingame via the storyline with different corps producing the types of ships for each race each ship with its strengths and weaknessesthe problem comes when a player designs a ship they think will do well against other ships only to find that another ship has an advantage in an area they have overlookedessentially the shipbalancing calls place the csm  and ccp  in a nowin situation players want an ubership that can hold its own and defeat other ships we dont like it when we overlook something and are made to pay the price on the battlefieldanyone watching tourney battles will quickly come to the conclusion that certain ship types are useful in certain situations there is no one answerits essentially like cars in real life each is made to do or fulfil different functions they all look different and have different attributes they even are made by different designers and manufacturersthe betterness of one type over another depends upon how they are employed and who is using them and the situation they are used withini personally dont think the csm should be used as a portal for ships to be tweaked to make them better or like another ship there is a place for it its called the features and ideas discussion forumedit i dont think balancing is needed unless there is some major area that is not working as intended  eg speed  variety as they say is the spice of lifearithron
