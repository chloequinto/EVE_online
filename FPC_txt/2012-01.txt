nah if a 6 month old toon wants to fly a perfect titan they are just going to go to the character bazaar and buy a toon that can fly one at least it will have the support skills trained i would hope anywaywhat im talking about here are new toons being able to get into battleships and flying horribly fit ravens that have 300dps tanks for pve i have seen a lot of players flying around in battleships with less than 6m sp when they dont have anywhere near the support skills to be flying those ships a new player dumps all the isk they have into one battleship and then loses it for whatever reason because they are in truth unable to fly it then they have no money to buy another ship that is more of a detractor than not training as fast as people youve never seen we need to come up with a better way to teach people to fit their ships either that or a way to bang it into new players heads that they need to train support skills before they get into a bigger ships not after
id very much like to see what you posted about too op i think it would add alot of depthnot firing due to line of sight is ridiculous however most certainly fire  friendly neutral or hostile be damned would add a brand new perspective to the game as destination pointed out though in the event of missiles im sure they are given calculated routes at some point  it would become the same with guns however and there would be a ton more checks involvedimagine primarying a target thats clipped between 20 more ships thats alot of junk for the server to try to sort through and i frankly dont see it as feasible despite how much i love the concept and have thought about it for many years now
why on earth would you not employ a dislike button next to the like or thumbsup buttonfix itedit inappropriate wording removed ccp phantom
because this is a forum for eve players and there are no limits to how many reps you can give conclusion i reckon it would take between 2 and 8 hours for the negrep wars to plateau at peak intensity and stay there forever
i think youre underestimating the abilities of the playerbase
the answer to life the universe and the question how many seconds does it take to abuse the  out of a dislike button is 42
negrep wars would take over from actual ingame pvp
aw you poor thinghes got no friendsgo join a better corporation or something maybe they will let you use gang links so you can finally find your happy place stop the evemail spam
got any killmail links to back that up pcalm down dear your pmt will be over soon
so a while back there was a dev thread about removing npc police in high sec for fw which i honestly think would kill low sec entirely this was my counter proposal but im afraid it got lost in the thread which went long ive thought about it for a while now and i honestly think that it could work and bring a new dimension of war to evenpc standing could really matter related to fw so for example assume i am in amarr fw if you remove the npc intervention you could make it so if i go into a high sec system with a station owned by a minimatar loyal corp boundless creations for example i would automatically be kos for any nonfw player in that system with a standing of higher than some set amount 50 or so to that corp there would no longer be the npc threat but there would be an added player threat there would be a local flag similar to when a pilot is gcc or a wartarget to signal that i was a valid target of course as soon as a nonfw player would agress the fw interloper they would become a valid target for return fire this would provide new pvp opportunity for all players not just fw members including a easy introduction to pvp for the high sec missioner it would also open new and interesting pvp mechanics like hs gate camps to catch potential interlopers missioner baiting as fw members could scan out active missioners and bait them into agressing the flashy red ship that just warped into their mission it would ad an element of surprise and danger as npc corp standings arent readily available so you wouldnt know if that ship next to you was able to shoot you until the bullets start flying this also wouldnt minimize low sec because the mechanics there favor the knowledgeable fw pilot more than the new risky mechanics of enemy high sec it would also address the npcs shouldnt fight battles between players issue in a sandbox game like evethe real advantage of this is that it would make the ongoing struggle between the 4 factions a much larger part of gameplay for all players in empire high or low it would matter to missioners who they grind for as that could influence pvp opportunityplease critique as i am sure there are issues that i have not thought of that could cause problems
ah but its not as stupid as saying its stupid to make stupid posts about something thats stupid that would be beyond stupid and would give stupidity a bad namebut back on topic sorry mods couldnt resist  i do agree that people should think really hard about hitting submit on their latest brain wave and think just how many people it would affect first if its less than 2 ie the proposer only then for the love of god dont submit it
in this case i must agree with zim
moved from features and ideas thread herecould be a cool way to deal with it hire some dust marines via contract to access and disable towers defenses effectively causing it to unanchor or transfer ownership based on the details of the contract zubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub

i have an alternate solution for those that wont concede to the obvious fact of fleet boosters needing to be on gridinstead of requiring fleet boosters to be on grid make them act like triagesiege modules cant activate inside a poss sheilds cannot warp and takes a 5 minute cycle timenow we can do exactly what the idiots are saying and scan for the fleet booster and kill him
fix shield boosting to not suck dilz when warping between grids and i see absolutely no reason not to require the booster to be ongrid
10good idea
for whatever reason 1never really liked killrights anyway and security losses in lowsec seem sort of redundant not to mention they hinder pvpzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
1 for support of the general idea of removing much of the security status hit for dipping into losec for casual pvp  currently its just not worth the security status hit to go get a taste of pvp 
wasnt sure if i would support this one but the more i think about it learning implants are a further punishment for risk takers and a reward for risk adverse pveers which is badalternative solutions would be something along the lines that characters with 4 and 5s forfeit concord protection but would really be much simpler to just remove them
i honestly dont think i agree with your first sentencei dont see eve as a race to get the most sp i really dont care if someone has more sp than i do so long as i can train at a good speed if someone of comparable age to my toon has more sp than me because they sit in 5 implants all day it really doesnt matter to me i personally dont sit in 5s i have a clone with them but i generally only use it when i know im not going to be playing for at least 24 hours that way it doesnt interfere with something critical however i dont see it as a punishment the reason being is that i choose not to sit in them everyone in this game has that choice the same goes for highgrade slave implants and crystals those are far more expensive than 5 learning implants are if you get podded in 00 and lose them your out far more isk than if you lost 5 implants so people generally choose not to fly with them in whilst in 00 from my understanding of your first post and from the proposal spoken of it should be the same thing however no one has made mention that i recall about the removal of such implants why ill tell you why they dont have a 5 training modifier on them the way this game is set up you should be completely fine flying with 5 implants or highgrades while in lowsec 00 is where the problem arises for people which means that many pvpers use both set of implants a fair number i would assume so in truth not all risk takers have to deal with this punishment as you call it there is also the fact that if someone in highsec trains in 5 implants and eventually passes you in sp because your only using 3 implants it really doesnt matter if a pilot who is only interested in pve is in a corp that ends up getting war decd he is going to get massacred if he fights he will have little to no concept of pvp and against a single skilled pilot in a t3 or hac will lose his golempaladin high sp doesnt really mean a whole lot if you dont know how to pvp and fit your ships for it there are plenty of pilots out there that have over 70m sp and still dont have their armor compensation skills trained to level 5 so i dont think its safe to say that not training in 5 implants is a punishment of any kind its about being able to play the game well in the area of expertise you choose to apply yourself

this has probably been proposed in the past and somehow ignoredbut if local is to remain as it is  please allow us to filter the local channel by standing at least pleaseis it ever hard to scroll through a million people in major trading hubsi dont care whos in local i just care about 1 or 2 other people that could be in localif the arguement is as in this thread local is too powerful alread
dont see any harm in treating local like a bit of an overview in a sense1 stop the evemail spam
 wow i didnt think id ever see it a local thread that isnt horrible id actually be completely fine with this 99999 of eve players will still leave it showing everyone but if you want to limit who you can see in local but still show up on local yourself i see no issue with it at all of course i dont know how much need for this there is since most people will leave it showing everyone and there are already private chat channels to use but i see no issues with this idea beyond the possibility of less than optimally used dev time im also interested in the possibility of 00 bots being caught because their owners forgot to set up their local filters properly and they didnt see the hostile come into their system that would be amusing
i suppose you could argue that missiles are guided and they would be able to menuever around obstacles to hit a target but then you may or may not have to account for the distance in that menuever around said object missiles would indeed be a little trickier to change
because no one needs to worry about fratricidefriendly fire in a game where no one really dies and people go through ships like addicts through crack amiritealso remember missiles can maneuver field of trolls if you chum it they will come
as proven by destination skill queat this point they should just remove the like function as you can easily like a whole page at once
yeahthe like button is pretty pointless really the only place that needs it is assembly hall and that should be more of a support button frankly ccp should add the functionality of using polls to the forums it would be a lot easier to tally support for an idea than a like button which is really just another form of epeen
jeeze how did you get elected what youre actually saying is that you have no idea whatsoever obviously you cant go into more detail because you dont know anything or have been bought out by ccp and sworn to secrecy everyone can see right now ccp is busy placating the subscribers with mediocre fis game updates consisting of rebalancing and fixing long overdue various bugs its also generally understood that this new focus will continue for a whilebasically you and the rest of the csm are too scared to ask ccp if they have made any definite plans for or against future wis development summit minutes what a joke thats like asking for the missing watergate tapes
i think this guy has got it right
you have already been sufficiently downvoted on this thread time to give it up
its also a huge disadvantage to mmos  playing with others can be severely overrated yeah i can be antisocial at times  and so can lots of potential ccp customers  ccp has already invested all the money to develop the system  to maximize returns they should cater to as wide a customer base as possibleim not taking either side of the debate as to allowing solo fleet boosts  just pointing out that its a valid point to debate  why shouldnt an fc flying solo get all the same benefits of his own skills first even before fleeting up its never made sense to me that a solo fc wouldnt be able to get his own boosts  just doesnt compute it doesnt break the game or anything sure but just doesnt make any sense from a fluff perspective
it would be a noob baiting paradise i have never seen a flasher not be attacked by some hapless child with dreams of glory except when said flasher was one among many the human brain behaves rather specifically when confronted with red light even more so when the light is flashing  just sayin it is a novel idea and might be worth exploring as part of a major pirate expansion in conjunction with a complete overhaul f the standings system ie brand new code it would not benefit fw in any significant way however as the vast majority of action occurs in the designated areas with only a few incursions into enemy highsec and those are most commonly by largeish gangs thus suicide to engage for the most part

i think the point is that learning implants tend to restrict gameplay one person may only need one clone if all they had were standard hardwirings to worry about and for those that pvp they are at an unfair disadvantage when compared with those that do notoverall learning implants or the requirement for them inhibit gameplay and prevent players from taking risks they might otherwise either you sacrifice training times to do what you want or you sacrifice the ability to do so without podding clones that arent intended for that purposehaving 24 h timers on jump clones is just an extension of this zubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
i agree which is why i think we should also do away with skilling entirely and give everyone level v skills on everything from day one pesky skill training restricts my game playthe world as we know it came about through an anomaly anomou the gospel of philip 15
uneccessary sarcasm also out of contextthis isnt about training skills its about everyone having unrestricted training times andimportantlyalternative options for implants while being able to play whereever they may be without having to worry about clonejumping to jita and flying 40 jumps into 00 just to get in a battlealternative example clonejumping to jita and 212 hours later finding out your corpmates need you in stain to help them fight off an offensive by a rival corp and you in your civiesanother example playing for 6 months as a pirate in delve while running basic hardwirings and having 19 and 20 respectively in your current primary attributes with podaday podding whos going to fit 300 million isk in implantszubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
if your going to 00 then be smart about it dont go flying around in your most expensive clone when you know your going to possibly get podded simplethis post is straying horribly from what is best for new players to what is best for people in 00 who are upset because they choose to be there
this riskreward argument falls apart pretty quick when you realize that 00 has become a desert with so many moving to highsec to pull 100m per hour with incursions something which you cannot do with anoms postnerfso get out of here with that riskreward argument you know its bullshit its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
so youre the arbiter of what is and is not appropriate sarcasm puleeezif you dont want to lose your implants dont use themsimple stop whining there is no need to remove learning implants they add meaningful choice to the game which is a good thingthe world as we know it came about through an anomaly anomou the gospel of philip 15

when you are chasing war targets  or you are at war you really only care about your war targets in local you could care less about the 100s of other people therei understand most people leave it as all in low sec and null sec but i have my corp in my corp tab so i dont need to see them in local and i really only would like to filter out who i need toi am playing against a few eve players at a time not all 1000 of them in jita thats why i would like to filter local scrolling through places like jita just is pointless
nothis is essentially a boost to local chat intel a broken element of eve that many including myself would rather see removed altogether even ccp has in the past said they want to see it go why would they want to improve it unless they changed their minds on the issue they wouldnt

the speed reduction on javelin missiles is an overly harsh penalty for such a mediocre gain in range you only have to look at ammo such as scorch or barrage to realise that no1 past mission golems uses javelinsa full rack of javelins on a sacrelige 5 launchers slashes 300ms off its mwd speeda drake will go 730ms with javs loadedi understand the reluctance to allow for easier coasting but wouldnt it be nice to make use of our beloved cruisers mobilitywould a hurricane use barrage if it lost 20 speed would a slicer use scorch as muchall of this for 10km range javelins never needed this nerf by the end of the speed nerf javs were more or less balanced
i can only agree with this scorch barrage etc do not carry speed penalties so why the javelin missiles carry such a penalty is somewhat of a mystery to me
i could understand if javs were common on minnie ships but some of the slowest ships in the game use missiles as a primary source of damageso yeah this penalty is ridiculous
tend to agree you fit the mods you cycle the mods you dont get benefit from the mods or your own skils for that matter logically you can concludeif thats the caseneither will anybody elsealternatively we can kill 2 birds with one stone and just remove gang links and leaderships skills alltogether id actually consider that a blessing and be happy to reinvest my 65 million spzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
youre not an fc if you dont have an f to c doing this would mean youd have to totally change the way bonuses are applied as you currently need valid squads for them its just not worth the devs time
they give bonuses to fleets not individual ships one player with two accounts is paying twice as much to play as a person with a single account this clearly has benefits
gang links are the worst thing for solo players using their single account to roam around low sec space but not having an alt scout is worse because sometimes the single solo player jumps into gate camps where the player with the scouting alt wouldnt part of the game however i would like fleet boosters to show up on killmails since many times they contribute just as much as the firing ship in getting the kill
if its widely accepted by eves player community that paying more real money should result in big in game advantages perhaps ccp should revisit the nex store and put purchasable game breaking benefits for loads of  no im not actually advocating that but it is the implication from what i hear some posters saying about this issuei dont support the opers suggestion but hes right that there is an issue gang links and especially t3 ships using them off grid needs to be looked at
010 bad troll is bad
having started a hauler alt i feel there may be room for improvement in the courier contract system as it stands now there is little reason for anyone to create a shortdistance low collateral low reward courier contract due to the broker minimum fee of 10000isk as such most contracts tend to be a little pricer with subsuqently higher often times hilariously so collateral requirements id love to see the broker minimum removed if it were approved i would anticipate an influx in courier scams spamming the system to balance that i would suggest changing the broker fee basis to the collateral requirement rather than the reward or maybe make it based on the higher of the two it even makes sense in game since the broker would be safeguarding both the reward money and the collateral scams can still take place but there would be a requirement for more skin in the game from the scammer at the end of the day it also opens the door for lowcollateral lowreward shorthaul contracts thanks in advance sorry it isnt a pewpew suggestionafter review ive updated my proposal below unreasonably high collateral keeps rookie haulers out and absolutely encourages scamming to the point that there isnt really a viable courier contract system the basic suggestion is changing the deposit and brokerage fee basis to the collateral requirement rather than the reward and eliminating the 110th reduction on courier contracts
not supporting for 2 reasons1 the fee is a fraction of a penny as far as worth is concernits nothing2 courier contracts in high sec are a ing joke as a freighter pilot myselfpublic contracts are an insult to common sense and nothing more than a stupid scamcollaterals require you to have a obscene fortune to haul pittiance to overkill in cargo with 1100000th of the value for a rewardtoo easily scammedand few actaully use it legitimatlyand if your doing this for a businessthat implies your already carrying a fortune in your wallet to afford itwhich means your only complaniing about your bottom linenot convincedi may change my mind with enough reasonnigbut this isnt a frequent subject to be surethis kind of industry is a quiet private onewho you knowand not easily found too many people prey and gank for lols and iskies as it is a legit businessbut this change i think accomplishes nearly nothingps i thought there was a skill you can train to lower the fee stop the evemail spam
i agree that 10k is not an insurmountable obstacle but when you just want someone to deliver a 30k50k skill book to you a few jumps away its a significant percentage of the base price i conceed that its a pretty niche occurrence but i guess i just dont see the reason for the minimum in the first place i guess to prevent spamming the contracts systemi think those who are blowing up haulers for the isk are usually doing it for the collateral gain if you base the brokerage fee which the issuer does not get back as a percentage of the collateral maybe even a significant percentage it would probably reduce the likelihood of scamming as some ships will probably get through and make hisec hauling a more serious occupationi believe broker relations can reduce the fee but there is always at least a 10000isk minimum
theres not much to be had in the changes if thats the caseall your focusing on is just the brkoerage fee rightis it really that big of a deal can you give a valid example that its a problem aside from a frsutration or nuscaince stop the evemail spam
not particularly only the niche case of rookie haulers who cant afford unnecessarily inflated collateral charges as i work through it i think there is more benefit to be gained from the second part of the proposal than the first tying the brokerage fee to the collateral amount as the base instead of the reward would probably do a lot more to lower collateral and open the market to rookie haulers than eliminating the minimum brokerage fee
the problem with the bulk of these fedex contracts is the bloody collateralnot the brokerage feejust tossing it in as the base price would only make it go upnot encourage it to go downperhaps knowing what your shipping would allow you to set that collateral at whatever you wantbut if you wish to surpress and hide contentsyoud be capped out at a certain ammount collateral wisewild idea off the cuffbut dont think its gonna do much  stop the evemail spam
damn forum ate my post my modified proposal is this base the deposit and brokerage fees on the collateral requirement rather than the reward heres an actual contract in gallente space at the momentreward 15000 iskcollateral 15000000 iskunder the current system i think the percentages are correct but i could be wrong the player issuing the contract provided the following10000 isk deposit minimum refunded if courier fails10000 isk brokerage fee minimum nonrefundable15000 reward refunded if the courier failsif the contract is not picked up and expires the issuer is out 20000 isk deposit and brokerage feeif the contract is accepted and completed the issuer is out 25000 isk brokerage fee and rewardif the contract is accepted and failed the issuer gains 14990000 collateral less brokerage feeunder a system where the collateral is used to set the deposit and brokerage fee and eliminating the 110th rule that currently exists for courier contracts the player issuing the contract would provide the following150000 isk deposit 15000000  10 refunded if courier fails60000 isk brokerage fee 15000000  04 nonrefundable15000 reward refunded if the courier failsif the contract is not picked up and expires the issuer is out 210000 isk deposit and brokerage feeif the contract is accepted and completed the issuer is out 75000 isk brokerage fee and rewardif the contract is accepted and failed the issuer gains 14940000 collateral less brokerage feethe reward for the scam is still in place but the barrier to entry is much higher and there is a much greater loss if the garbage contracts arent accepted 10 times in this casei dont think it solves the problem in its entirety but i think it would help to lower collateral requirements and bring rookie haulers into the mix
not a bad idea 1 i wonder if it could be extended to all systems and to nonfw as well if youre on grid at a station you have low standings with then you are fair game to all other players while you are on grid the guy manning the station guns conveniently forgets to fire them because you have consistently picked on his corp mates apply the same concept to gate guns in low sec
protip merely being able to see a target isnt in and of itself a massive or unfair advantage however being able to prevent people even looking at you via mechanics that make cloaking a pointless ineffective part of the game is a fairly nice advantage  to players who already have a lot of options and advantages in their avoid pvp at all costs  arsenal
i didnt say that being able to run around and choose a juicy target a massive or unfair advantage i said fairly nice advantage if you remove cloaks from local cloaking becomes a massive or unfair advantage and adding probes to that mix would still not take it all the way back to a fairly nice advantage but at least it wouldnt be as massive a cockstab just to shoot some rats as just the no cloaked ships in local idea is

greetings capsuleers i wanted to inform you of a recent presentation thread on new industrial class ships in the features  ideas forummobile manufacturingthe bare bones summary of this thread is the introduction of two sets of new types of ships  mobile manufacturing ships and mobile reprocessing shipsmobile manufacturing ships mss these ships contain manufacturing lanes that enable production in space the purpose of the ships is multiple but the most important advantage is the ability to produce inspace and thus not need station lane manufacturing the details of how these ships behave and are balanced are in the thread there are three variants one standard industrial and then two capitalindustrials that mimic the same ideology behind the orca and rorqualmobile reprocessing ships mrs these ships are advanced industrial ships that enable modules compounds ore ice etc to be reprocessed in space the ships are not as efficient as stations with standings but enable reprocessing to take place in the field there are two ships tech i and tech ii the tech ii having improved refining efficiency and slightly more cargo spacewhy these ships are designed to enable a total manufacturing loop in space  in other words for the first time ever a truly nomadic playstyle is possible for a corporation as of now the only way to manufacture goods is through pos or stations  the same applies to reprocessing to gain minerals these ships have many other inherent trade values and will benefit highsec all the way to wspace and everything in between please view the thread for more information and  as asked there  give your feedback or ideas i will occasionally bump this thread to garner more interest but i will not be replying to questions directly please take your discussions to the actual thread thank you i ask that csm members interested in the industry field and especially those knowledgable of worm holes and nullsec please read this thread and give their input i feel strongly these ships could play an important and desired role in the future of new eden and open up many new tactical options for all players
thread lockedplease keep the discussion to this one thread in features  ideas
i dont think this is a good idea first it would clog up jita and centralize markets even more second there is no real need to have a mobile manufacturing ship a pos does the job just fine as for mobile reprocessing i have no opinion on that but it doesnt really seem needed either you need a base of operations read pos even for nomadic playstyle
this looks amazing 1000devs we know you are out there and some feedback or thoughts on this would be great or at least an acknowledgement that you have seen and read this
also a great idea want to boost get in combat man not hide in pos or safe spot
i like this idea a lot
afaik this is already the case you can shoot 5 to 10 in hi sec as well as low sec without any form of concord retaliation ships in hi sec sentry guns in low secas for the rest mehsounds like putting rainbows and unicorns in low secwe
negative means less than zero not less than five so under my proposal people with status in the 0 to 2 range would be free targets in lowsec but still able to go to highsec freelyi dont see the unicorns maybe you could elaboratewhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp

i disagree with generating a killmail simply on the fact that in order to do so you will have to give credit to someone who didnt actually kill anything the ship self destructed what i would agree to is increasing the time it takes to self destruct and prevent the self destructing ship from being able to target anything and from using modules to avoid abusing that maybe make the self destruct timer based on the ships size the whole point to self destruct is to deny your enemy the satisfaction of a kill there is no other point in eve for self destruct other than that right now 5 minutes or so on self destruct for capitals as they are really the only issue here sounds about reasonablei do agree that self destructing ships should not pay out insurance
 insurance rather then reprocessing the ship for materials during times when the mineral basket has fallen below platinum insurance level but im not overly attached to selfdestructing ships getting or not getting insurance as you could just duel so

meh i like the idea of being able to sort local to see hostiles at the top of the list theres no logical reason for someone to be surprised by a wt just because they couldnt see the red star as they scrolled through jita localffs were flying spaceships faster than light and our computers cant sort a list for us

i am with drake and floppie hereif local is going to be there then there is no reason a sort feature shouldnt exist if your argument is that local should be removed then i agreebut we dont see that happening soon no reason to make it a pain in the ass while it is there
as for removing local im against that idea i feel like it would strip out any notion of community in the game as it stands now when i land in a system with friends i strike up a conversation with them you get to know people because you run into them frequently new players would encounter significantly quieter less friendly local channels as people would have a lot more reasons to not talk most of them would eventually stop even paying attention to local because it would so rarely be of any use the worst part is how badly they would be victimized by more experienced players in high sec neutral scouts would become even more valuable and newer players at war wouldnt know theyd been spotted and followed by a neutral scout not knowing there might be wartargets immediately upon undocking from a station is a bad thing
i think the overall consensus to removing local is to do it only in nullsec frankly i could care less either way as i would simply adapt but removing local in nullsec would alleviate the issue of afk cloakers entirely leave it to constellation chat you are correct that local should be kept for highsec at the very least except maybe in jita since all it is there for is the constant spam of ads and scams
i think the removal of local is limited to nullsecbut not lowsechighsec empire spaceand honestlylocal is nothing more than troubleaside from intel gatherits smack talkspammnigjust a total waste of timemost socializing i do is in allinacecorp chats or private convos but thats just my personal opinion stop the evemail spam

csm vote time comes around when you login vote screen comes up you must vote may or may not include a donkey vote  havent thought about that much yet im interested to hear what people thinkthis way everyone gets a voice70 of the players are empire dwellers but the csm is obviously run by 00 alliance headswhy has ccp not implemented this already i wonder it would stop a lot of the rage that is currently taking over many topics of debate because the majority of people arent really being catered for by the csmedit please keep in mind only 15 of people voted in the past election  awful
mandatory voting on something that 80 of the playerbase doesnt know anything about just leads to people clicking for whoever happens to be the first name they see on the voting screenso either you randomise the order of candidates which means the mandatory uninformed votes are distributed equally and so have no bearing on the result or you dont which means the first name on the list gets to be chair regardless of affiliation ability or campaign
so youre saying a random selection would be worse than having what will probably be an all 00 csm from now on 
nothing is stopping empire candidates from organising a csm campaign of their own except their lack of competence and effortand as highseccers are so fond of telling us 80 of players live in highsec and have no interest in 00 matters at all so taking the chair position on some sort of empire first platform should be like candy from a baby right
i am all for this but only if i get to write the software
i cant get an organized campaign because im a stupid worthless pubbie so they should change everything in our favor even though 00 will still control the csmthere is no reason to force every last player to vote especially when the bulk are mission grinders and miners who literally do not care about the direction of the game its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
forcing players to vote is a horrendous mistake it makes a farce of the entire thing as 70 of players will just choose randomlyhaving the ballot paper pop up upon login is a great idea imo as long as there is a giant x in the corner so that people who dont want to vote dont have to upon clicking the canceldont vote button the ballot paper should not pop up upon login again for that election but should be avaliable for people who later change their mind  perhaps as a link on the character selection screen or something similaryou could easily provide space for or a link to a short minimanifesto which allows players who have not been following the election campaign have some idea what each candidate stands for this should help curb random selection votingjust my thoughts
i am all for this as wellhowever as stated in the second post of this thread it will lead to a bunch of people with no clue whats actually going on voting for random people since this is how it works in real life anywayi dont see too much of a problem here in other wordsdont change anything because then goonswarm cant control the csm and keep the mittani in his seat
yes because forcing players to vote will fix everythingare you people really that dense stop the evemail spam
i am not really sure it matters much either way even the people today that vote either dont know what the hell they are voting for or get outvoted by the powerblock the only thing this proposal would do is grant a slim possibility that the powerblock lose i guess whether that is a good or bad thing depends on the powerblock that is winning
wrongforcing every player to vote means every account that signs in must votethats a guarenteed landslide victory for powerblocsthis proposal was  the moment it was posted and the motivation behind it is nothing short of a pitiful crybaby seeking retirbution for something that the op has no idea what hes talking aboutthis changes absolutelynothingps the population of the high sec crowd peolpe tend to presume is just a bunch of carebearswhat they dont think about is the number of alts of major alliances and everything elsestats are just numbers on paperworknothing guarenteed there stop the evemail spam
they are major contributors in many kills they should get some credit
you wanna get credit for a kill as a fleet booster participate in the fight and actually shoot stuff
well i was looking at it from both sides a loss to a guy with a fleet booster shouldnt count for as many points as a loss from a guy without a fleet booster the battleclinic rating the l33t solo players with fleet boosters would plummet
do people really pay attention to that
logi should certainly show up too by that logic so should probers scouts and spies how exactly would you implement it also ccp doesnt control the kbs the scoring system on whatever kb you use is an issue between you and a company other than ccpi for one hate all the major kbs isk efficiency and kd ratios not one of them is accurate an accurate isk efficiency and kd ratio would count 100 dudes killing 1 guy as 001 kill per player involved not one which is 100 kills when totaled up across everyone involved same rule needs to apply to isk values and points battleclinic used to divide points like that but never the actual kills or isk value
implementation if the fleet booster is active when the kill is made it gets put on the killmailextension to others logi others if beneficial effect is applied to you by some other ship when you are on a killmail that ship is also on kmdone
it makes more sense to credit logis especially now that they inherit aggressiongive logis killmail credit and give them aggression timers so they cant dockjump for 30 secondsedit you know who never gets credit for kills scouts ive set up so many warpins that resulted in fleets being wipedyet i never fired a shot those kills wouldnt have happened without me but i get no lovethen there was that fight where i decided to just tank the bejesus out of a gang while my own guys melted all their support ships i docked up due to lack of aggression repaired and undocked to finally join the fight i only got on one of the kills but my action turned what would have been a close fight into a slaughterafter a while you get used to not getting the killmails the dudes you fly with know what you did and thats what matters
a couple of years ago the gang system was a bit buggy big surprise however what the bug did was to let you create 1man gangs where your gang mods and gang bonuses were applied to your own ship it was actually a really nice feature to have the year it lastednow solo pvp  main  cloaking t3 booster alt so if anything this would add some more variety back to the game
currently when a person joins a corp they get a generic autoresponder saying theyve been accepted into the corpfixed to allow the ceo or a director should have permission to create their own custom autoresponder message to be sent to new corp membersthe same should allow an alliance executor to create a custom autoresponder to new corps who joinpretty simple request which would give ceos more flexibility in the corp communications departmenthigh five yeah cest la eve 
im sorryeither its because im approaching the end of a very long day at me jobor this just doesnt seem to add upi get what your tring to accomplishbut the key factor as far as im concerned is not the broker feebut collateralthis will not stop people from charging outragous collateraland  poor rewardswrapping the brokerage fee into the collateral does not change thatyour presuming its going to lower itor make people put smaller ammounts ini say it will not change one thingand even at the numbers your indicatingits still very small pittianceperhaps an another big time hauler would care to offer an 2nd opinion stop the evemail spam
thanks for your input in any event drake i think we both agree that the outrageous collateral requirements on so many contracts is detrimental to the system i just think the population would be more open to changing what the fees are based on rather than direct regulation of collateral requirements
ive been thinking for a very long time that change would be good for fedex contractsbut ive failed multiple times to come up with something feasible for iti think half the time people do not cnosider the true message they give in making such thingsi can recall countless times whered i smack talk the living crap out of someone in rens for making a 200mil collateral contract to ship 3 jumps in high sec for 2 milllion isk rewardseriouslyoh and the cargo amount is freighter sized no lessmaybe the reward should be at least 5075 of the collateral value of your cargolets be serious hereif its that valuable to youthen you better be effing serious about getting it shipped there stop the evemail spam
people only put such low rewards on contracts because other people will accept the contracts its the market that sets the price and it should never be dictated by a hard limit sure i know that 500k isk is not nearly enough of a reward to move 1b worth of stuff halfway across known space  but if i also know that if i put it up somoene will move it within the next 24 hours why should i waste any more isk
very poor assumptionive seen contracts rot on the market with such settingsim sure someone or some filthy rich with way too much time on his hands pilot will move itbut the incentive for new hualers is very poor in other words the bar for starting in that marketand i used to be one of these ocd pilotsis way to bloody high some of us dont have that kind of time or the money to spend on plexs to cash in for isk to start capital up to haul crap with insane collaterals and emphasis  poor rewardsand furthermorethose in alliances like ours  o o7 why hire when you can get your m8s to do it for you with 0 collateral and a bit of isk to line pocketsor a nuet hauler stop the evemail spam
i sincerely and honestly do not understand this proposal the overwhelming number of scam courier contracts are based on the inability to deliver not on ganking for collateral im still clueless as to what the desired effect of the proposed change is
i had this idea for long time however i never got time to put it on paper idea is not originally mine it is taken for my old beloved and never forgotten game shadowbane shadowbane had resource mine

i have a version of this idea for moons using pi networks located here
i did not see your proposal before but after reading it i should first congratulate you for such extensive and elaborate work it certainly took time to put it all down together people who enjoy pi would certainly enjoy it even more that wayhowever what our proposals have in common is only verb planetary in topic titlemy idea is to provide more internet spaceships pew pew anything related to pi does just the opposite people spend their time in eve in cloaky ships configuring sim city networks only place where i can see them is after stargatejump before they cloak
thank you yes it took almost a year or more to get to that pointbut getting back to your ideai had hoped that my pdf would illustrate to you areas where pvp will be introduced with that proposal namely pvp in orbit atmospheres and above star ports on city networks for a duration of multiple days per planetmooni do fear however that with regards to your proposals goals the only one that will be met will be the fostering of small scale pvp while at the same time decreasing the overall level of pvp and large scale engagementsi expect this to happen for 2 reasons1 your facility capture mechanism its a rehash of the fw button mechanic which in itself is extremely wanting its just an anom with some rats that expects a single player to fly around the button for 3 minutes in order to capture it once this happens the facilities timers are reset and i presume your shield if its offline for 2 hours over x amounts of days while being captured will just reset and give the attackers 2 days to rally a defense fleet why would you bring a 1000 man pew pew fleet to grab a moongoo operation if you only need 1 ship for 3 minutes every 2 dayssure you could bring 50 ships and try to take down the shields of a structure that has no defenses but why bother if you can just sit and wait for the shields to drop in the first place2 moongoo right now the only reason we even have a good old pos bash is 2 fold to wipe the moon mining tower off the grid to enable us to place our own once we take your system and to prevent the proliferation of super caps and safe spots for corps and alliances out in soviet mordor and whs by moving moongoo extraction operations from a pos which is a very good idea to a similar structure around orbit which is not a good idea you are merely moving the location the fight will take place in it will in no way increase the amount of people involved in this fight see reason 1 nor will it provide any actual challenge or fun beyond the same old pos bash method so we will no longer see dread fleets taking out towers with large support fleets when we can afford to risk a single frigate to do the same job in a fraction of the time in fact this could even lead to gate campers and ghetto pirate roaming gangs taking on moongoo operations this in itself will increase small scale engagements but as you could imagine this would decrease the large scale engagements all together thus lowering the average amount of pew pewnow if you were to move moongoo to a mechanism such as pi which you could make vulnerable to spaceship pew pew by sub caps in the atmosphere of moons and planets  dust mercs who would want more sub cap and capital ship support in their fights for it and capitals in orbit that would require sub cap support to prevent ambushes and embarrassing roflstomp capital kms in a way similar to my pi suggestion then you would force both the worlds of dust and eve to collide at gun point in the pursuit of moongoo and easy isk naturally sacking cities as laid out in my proposal will be a process that spans multiple days vs your 3 minutes on the fw button mechanic thats a significant window of pew pew opportunity in a world where the more ships are involved the better the outcome and we all know a target rich environment is not a single frigate but a blob of sub caps with a whale or two in betweendont you think
nope facility remains vulnerable for full hour once that hour pass facility is claimed for corp of last person who claimed it and becomes invulnerable again until next window of opportunity in two days if you come with only one ship to defend your facility i am pretty sure you will get killed and it will be lost to some other corp who will be last standing on the battlefieldit will right now majority of eve population remains in high sec this will encourage them to go to lowsec and fight for italso big alliances will not be able to come with blobs since they will have to defend multiple facilities at same time window of opportunity time is set on alliance level and once you get it you and your corp mates must fleet up and defened all of those you gold every two days for one hour
if the defending corp is in lowsec odds are they do not have the numbers to be online 247 with the average corp size numbering around 23 odd people and if youve spent time in the fw scene youl know that fleets very rarely exceed 50 if they do somebody brings a capital or two along and we read about the tears in the news the next dayso you will be looking at instances where 5 or less pilots will be engaging these facilities sometimes without opposition and as i stated this will lead to the 1 frigate doing the work of 3 digit fleets in mere minutes before the vulnerability hour is upin 00 your looking at a different story alliances with thousands of players who can afford to be on standby 247 incase things go down but isnt that the same place we are now with 1 pos mining moongoo behind the lines of thousands of shipsthere might be instances where your prediction comes to pass granted but 80 of the time itl be a situation of team a roflstomps team bs facilities because team b are offline or docked up for safety or dont have the numbersi can promise you the majority of hisec dwellers are not in hisec for the moons nor do they care for the uber valuable low sec moons they will not leave hisec to capture anything in the ghetto or 00 this will not encourage them to leave hisec at all yes it might lure some people out but it will not change the demographics in the bigger pictureyour also forgetting the golden rule of 00 warfare if it can fly and fit guns blob it for win i have yet to see a single 00 alliance that does not blob for kms sov or lolzthe alliances will blob it if they own 1 system or 100 systems even at alliance level there is nothing to stop them from only holding 1 system and making it impossible to dislodge them from 1 or 2 odd moons if an alliance with 3k pilots owned 10 systems with 10 moons each that translates into a 30 man gang on each moon across 10 systems id like to shake the hand of a low sec 20 man corp that can effectively seize and hold thati dont mean to be critical or take a dump on your batteryi firmly believe your idea has merit provided we separate this orbital structure thing from moongoo and opt to have those facilities provide bonuses to sov holders or ghetto dwellers instead
hey something has always bugged me about some of the npc regions in the game although most of them are fine with plenty of stations in constellations such as stain or curseregions such as great wildlands  venal i know it has tonnes of tech that makes it great for entities that can hold it and outer ring has good potential to make the space decent enough so that the smaller alliances might venture there or even live there it seems such a waste to have space that could be a home for smaller alliances im not sure if theres a deliberate reason why these arent developed a bit more but it seams like a  thing for the game i cant really see a downsideit would be nice to see some constellations get a station or 2 and also even in the more developed regions it would be nice if more stations got cloning servicessince god damn having to have your clone about 20 jumps from the place you live sucks maybe have at least 1 station a constellation have cloning servicesso ye tldr some more stations  cloning services in npc space that needs thembenefit from them would be niceanyone think of any other changes or if this has been discussed i searched and found nothing also if any downsides please post id like to know what other people feel about the crappier npc regionsta o
we are after all fighting for an npc faction i mean it can never be entirely player driven unless you want to buy into the politics of null sec but the npcs should share information with its own militia about when important military complexes are being attacked by allowing this it really can be an advantage and not a drawback the whole idea here is to have fw offer something new specifically it should offer frequent quality small scale pvp this proposal would go a long way toward that fw would be too fast paced and dynamic for the slow blobs to form and be effective if the mechanics just end up giving us more of the same blob up send alt scouts out and gank what you find mechanics then it doesnt offer anything new for subscribers make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
hmmm good points made here i do not think sd should generate a killmail  love those nullbear tears  nice to deny mods cargo  killmails to a ganker every gank should not be a guaranteed reward if the pilot can survive long enough to sd ganker should lose out  boo hoo go ahead and cry about it i agree no insurance payout for sd sd pilot must lose something for that choice also
pretty much what ive been saying for a long timeas for killmails currently when someone goes gcc and concord attacks them the system will generate a killmail for the player who did the most damage to them before concord did the killing this makes more sense and is more consistent than giving it to the last person to take a shot
i dont get the km hate in this thread its a good feature in the game that allows players to review combat situations check fits it is useful in recruitment selection and of course the lolmails for amusement if people want to inflate their epeen through kms let them its their choice to have their killboard as their homepage and to hit refresh every time they press f1 in combat so that they can feel good about themselvesif you dont like kms dont post them dont look at them add fukung as your homepage we 1 to the ops proposal
epic arc 3 monthscosmos 6 months seems reasonable
supporting this a horrible waste of dev time and pve content to allow you to do them only once the 6 months timer seems like a reasonable limit and should address any farming concerns not that the loot you can get is good enough to bother farming it anyway
op i noticed you like rp and i can understand that you try to combine and appoint a real happening with rp speechone fatal fault of your side was to do that without advertising either that it is a full rp given text or that you are mashing up ooc 
margin trading should be removed dont got the cash dont trade there are too much 001 isking going on we should weed out the bums who do nothing but stay docked all day updating far more orders than they can afford

in other wordsabloobloobloo i am mad because somebody i dont like got voted into csm a bloo bloo bloo
most players ingame dont know what the csm is nor visit the forums to force these players to vote on something they dont know anything about could be disastrous we could get another trebor ankh or mazz as a result of an uninformed yet forced voting systemsummary of eves last four expansions
yes it would indisputably be worsewhy should people be forced to vote if theyre not interested in the csm and if theyre not interested in the csm why are you getting outraged on their behalfof course i know full well why youre outraged on their behalf actually you dont give a crap about whether theyre represented as evidenced by your open indifference to whether candidates that people actually want get elected its because the people who do care about the csm have had the insolence to vote for people you have decided you dont like
its not who gets the votes that counts its who counts the votes  stalinside note stalin introduced mandatory voting too
why dont you just cut to the chase and propose that ccp reserve 4 or 5 csm seats for people that you nominate
because modern politicsdemocracy has never been about inclusion but the legitimisation of condensing power onto smallish entities corporate parties individuals etctake a hard look at the voting system in whichever country you hail from and ask yourself if anyoneeveryone has the same chance of getting in and if everyone has the same ease of voting the only contemporary system that has any right to even bear the title democracy is the swiss in my opinion i would move there in a heartbeat if it wasnt for the odd cuisine they have hahahahaha
then again the mittani does enjoy using a stalinist gimmick its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
this would lead to better selection of csms than the joke we have now
so because you dont like the current csm the next one should be voted for by the uninformed drooling masses through mandatory voting in hopes that it will accomplish absolutely nothing what an idea its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
csm 6 has been the most effective csm to date in bringing solid tangible improvements to every single section of the eve playerbase factsorry that youre so rageblinded about your hulks getting ganked or something
exactly im not really a fan of kms in general i do keep track of it as a record of what ive done but they dont come anywhere near telling a full story really i like bf3s method best you get a statistics page with winloss ratio how many guys you revived and so on actual kd ratio is pretty much just a foot note at the bottom of the page and of course its included in bf3 its not third party id like to see eve move to that type of model the current system is clunky incomplete and ultimately misleading
honestlyeve went from about 50k peak concurrent users to maybe 35k when incarna was released coincidencethe vast majority of players are not interested in wis there are several other gamesplaygrounds for that eve is a game about spaceships and ccp focusing on spaceships is good for all i care they can remove the captains quarters completely and throw all wis completely out together with emo teen girl mmo game they were working on vampiresmost of us are into eve due to spaceships not wis so ccp focusing on the core demographic isnt bad its good if you cant stand that maybe eve isnt for you
youre delusional in many ways that have been adressed too many times to bother againeve is gonna die without wis fis content can only be developed so far before jumping the shark and breaking the core game so you need something else to do and that something else is wis
or they add a few thousand more nullsec andor wspace systems and we keep shooting at each other as intended
the figures you quote you incorrectly attribute sorely to incarna when anyone who has been following the trend knows that the decrease has been happening for a whilenoone has provided any evidence that the vast majority of players dont want incarna evidence has been provided that some dont but then again some players dont want faction warfare pvp planetary interaction or their favourite ship to be rebalanced different players have different preferred ways of experiencing evewhereas to provide support for my claim that a significant portion of players do want walking in stations i can provide you with fanfest videos a 100 page thread on the forums that is largely in support of incarna except for a handfull of trolls threads in the features and ideas forums on how incarna can be used csm minutes that show that the csm is in support of wis as long as it has a meaningful connection to fis and doesnt detract from the rest of evewhat do you have poor reasoning and goon rhetoric

the courier contracty system is completely flawed what ccp should do id love to say they need to but thats laughable is set restrictions on the range of variance between the collateral required to accept a courier contract and the reward for completing it as it stands now the only person who really benefits from the contract agreement is the person who created the contracta contract is set w a collateral rate of say 200 billion w a reward rate of 25000 thousand i could kill rats in 5 for more payout than that reward and one of two things happens 1  the contract never gets picked up because most players floating around in high sec expecting trolls to come out and start some  here dont have the amount that people ask for in collateral 2 those that do have the funds to buy a contract yes i said buy because that is really exactly what is happening youre paying the contract owner to wait at a gate to come shoot you down and take your collateral and whatever loot may survive the mechanics of this system are so completely flawed that it goes largely and mostly unused and there is no profit to be had for anyone but the rare few who catch a sucker by some force of luck
after giving it some much needed thought i believe your rightit will close down the funding mechanisms for new players but it will definitely close down the all the loopholes for magic isk for spi banking corpsalliances
not to mention it would keep people from creating alts moving the isk elsewhere say to another alt or their main then biomassing their alt
agreed these changes wont really change the problems with sentry guns though instead of being at a disadvantage for being flashybeing at an advantage for being not flashy youll be at a disadvantage for having negative secbe at an advantage for having positive sec so that particular issue will still persist also no loss of sec status in cases where your sec is above 2 obviously cannot be part of not having repercussions for shooting any negative sec pilot or else the mechanics arent gonna work
not seeing it why should the law allow for rampant drivebys in the suburbssounds like you want to play with the big boys in ls ie the fun pew but keep your bunk at the highsec hostel you call homeput forward proposals to increase population in ls rather than merely making it into a tourist attractionhunting reserve and we can discuss specifics but this is just too silly killing anything within the sphere of civilization read here be cops should cost one dearly
this thread has now become the jack dant for csm thread jack is really the only scoundrel scoundrel enough to represent low sec while at the same time maintaining meticulous spreadsheets and proper smugness and the class of a true gentleman down on his luckwith proper sard caid funding this will happen also vote ron paul in 2012 while your at it
100 to this idea and i also support jack dant to low sec csm positiontetrahydroc
rl comparisons dont really work for example irl the law would try to intervene if two criminals were shooting each other but in lowsec the sentries just stand aside if two flashies fight but can you imagine a situation where police ignores violence between gangs in the suburbs but arrest any gang member that sets foot outside themanything can be explained or discarded on pseduorp terms the important thing is is it good game design will it hurt the game or improve itand thats bad why why should people be punished for pvping in lowsec but in any case personally i havent lived in highsec in two years and i have the alts and resources to easily supply my outlaw lowsec main but others dont they are the newer players the single account players why should they be punished this is the point increasing the pvp population and increase pvp engagements not the carebearing population never going to happen i want to build on the strong points of lowsec not trying to turn it into some parody of highsec or sov 00what happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
thank you for your kind words titus but i hereby deny any intention to run for csm now or in the future i will however lend my full support to the dirty protagonist for csm campaign what happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
ill be running on the drunken disorderly pirate platform
best suggestion ive ever read regarding lowsec and possibly eve fully supported
i think this is a great ideai also like the idea of nullsec npc kills not giving sec status and only having lowsechighsec rats give sec status
1i like it we are looking at encouraging more pvprs into ls not bears  although they are always welcome as they are delicious and refreshinga cap at sec status penalties will encourage those who want to pvp to come in and will still be able to go bac
seeing as jack graciously turned down the possibility to run for csm i therefore change my support to warlord protagonist who has humbly accepted to run also i fully indorse and support mr dps platform of drunken disorderly piratetetrahydroc
you sir are like a godthis would make eve 100 million and ten times betterregards
as a person thats lived both the nonoutlaw and outlaw paths for several years in lowsec i like this change1 youre not removing sentry penalty and therefore nonpvpers or pvpers who put the effort to grind their security status will have sentries on their side this as you mentioned previously removes the potential of lightly tanked support ships acting with impunity on gates except against those who choose to make themselves vulnerable this is a feature to lowsec that that id like seen preserved2 your suggestion allows pilots to easily conduct logistics and access to the greater market hubs rens jita amarr rather than limited to local hubs with typical item markups logistics is perhaps the greatest challenge to dedicated lowsec pvpers without access to outside help hauling alts etc3 pilots who chose to aggress neutral targets will still be penalized by being kos in lowsec but wont be faced with a massive security status grind unless they chose to kill capsules given that capsule kills are more of a cherry on top for pvp than anything else youve effectively catered to the 100 pirate element of eve while giving casual pvpers the ability to engage in a very similar environment4 highsec ganking remains taxing in terms of security status loss which i feel is balanced to the rewards seen in the activity losing easy access to highsec markets and logistics is as stated above a significant blow to solo small scale or casual gamersvery elegant suggestion i support this change

personally id recommend lemon partycenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
agree with thiswhy should you get a km if you didnt actually kill the ship
actually the problem with self destruct is that its done for one out of two reasons my precious killdeath ratio or oh  my fit is so moronic i have to hide itif killmails are given to the highest nonnpc damage dealer even if someone self destructs then maybe theyll go down fighting instead of being an absolute coward and initiating a fleetwide selfdestruct of all dreads or whatever literally the only thing theyre accomplishing apart from their kd ratio is making their defeat quicker and less costly for the attacker its dumb as rocks

let me guess the proof of that is unfortunately heavily ndad so we will just have to take your word for it csm6 got that badge because ccp failed on such an epic scale if ccp had not the course correction would never have taken place and csm6 would have gone down in history as the spacebarbie csmit does however seem like csm6 may help make more frequent direct contact to ccp the norm by their abuse of skype or whatever open comms they are using which is a very good thing especially since ccp employee real game time appears to have diminished over the years judging by the disconnect that happened between ccp reality and actual reality
the proof is plain for everyone to see since 6 was the first csm to actually get anything meaningful done csm 15s main achievements were in generating a massive backlog of outstanding issues without ever getting ccp to look at implementing any of them generating layers of petty drama and csm bureaucracy to smother any attempts at useful work in throwing spoons at each other resigning in protest at some pet issue or other which again made no impact whatsoever with ccp and breaking ndas for personal gain
i dont know look at crucible and see for yourself why are you so dumb its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
everyone seems to forget that csm5 did achieve 2 major thingsnerfing anoms and jbs to a mere fraction of what they used to be thereby severely diminishing any reason to bother with sov in other words creating an incentive for entities like pl who dont hold sov yet wield the might in the 00 landscape that should be mainly in the hands of sov holders
youre serious arent you the anom nerf has turned 00 into a desert its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
let me try to put in another way csm6s biggest achievement so far has been to be the csm in place at the time of ccp incarnanex failscade they had close to nothing to do with the course correction unsubsmedia spam was driver and all the things they are getting done are mainly taken from the very backlogs that the previous csms were instrumental in getting madeclaiming that csm6 are all that you claim is like when bush tried taking credit for the bullish economy left by clinton or democrats dumping all blame for later meltdown on bushsee abovein short being in the right place at the right time does not make one better at anything just means one is lucky
thats the point the only thing any previous csm has achieved of any note was to virtually destroy a large segment of the game specifically the segment that they use to sell them game for the most part
ahahaha you are so dumb its almost painful its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
lets assume for arguments sake that your csm were not merely lucky as i claim that would mean that they used social engineering to intentionally cause the failscade aka incite the riot and are directly responsible for the sacking of 100 people and goddess knows what other fallout has yet to be identifiedare my precious sanctums and the virtual currency grind important enough to wreck 100 lives even if temporarilyso which is it lucky as hell or evil possibly guilty of breaking several laws
nonsense devolves into paranoid ramblings and a false dilemmayou pubbies are amazing its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
its not your csm its the csmfun fact theres been goonswarmgoonswarm federation members on every single csm to datewithout the summer of rage we saw last year shaking some sense into ccp theres a good chance they would have had to let go 100 of their staff rather than 20but please go on and tell us more about how csm6 are literally real life criminals
solution 33333 of csm members from 00 sec33333 of csm members from low sec33333 of csm members from high sec
response mittens is on for 00 vile rats high sec alt is on for highsec andskis pirate corp alt is in for lowsechow do you define the groups since nullsec players actually live in all 3 zones plus the wormholes you chose to ignore lowsec players have at the very least highsec alts and alot of us move around based on what we are doing at the momentyour proposal is not actually enforceable
so hilmars told you exactly what it was that caused it has heso it was clintons fault bush left the country with a massive deficit war everywhere etc etc etc 8 years later
ok so i havent played this game that long but i have good and bad experience of the politics of mmorpgspersonally i think the csms shouldnt be elected having elected csms seems to favour one type of player or play style having csms nominated instead allows for a much broad range of csms from the player base it would allow ccp to choose players who represent the player base better ie rpers mission runners industrialist and pvpers
you see the problem hereits that you are kind of hard of thinking
i too claim credit for aur protest fallout
i too claim the aur protests were what caused ccp to change their minds
ccp can check client ips for main and alts
quit while your ahead kiddo youve been pwn3dtime to surrender stop the evemail spam
i think its reasonable to say that they were a contributory factor the playerbase unsubs the protests the csm and the threadnaughts all played a part imopersonally i think the csm were highly useful in that they provided a calm detailed 2way discussion of what the real issues were  extremely useful at a time when ccp had lost touch with their customers  and had considerable input in pointing the new direction the right way saying that the csm were useless is flying in the face of the facts including ccps own statementsthat said csm5 werent by any means useless either much of the groundwork for the successes of csm6 were laid by csm5 csm6 is the most successful csm yet but csm5 were the most successful csm to date as well
please dont bring any of these facts to the mix there is no place for them only delusional paranoid ramblings its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i realise my mistake and i apologise unreservedly
of course the aur protests etc were part of the reason but maggots like whomeverthefuck here seems to want to be about as good at talking about facts as en24 is
which means if it involves goons or the clusterfuck either ignore it wholeheartedly or just cover whatever they didnt do
im giving this a like with the exception dont put it on the log in screen and make it required to log in put it in a separate box on the char selection screen so it is still optional but easily accessible to the player base
there being a 100 page thread means very littlei remember several threads longer than that about poses sov mechanics and moongoo which was ignored im not disputing that there are people who want wis however it is a fact that pcu are down since incarna came along it might be a trend from before but i remember there being around 4550k players online at all times when i logged on before incarna and after my 6 month hiatus it hovers around 35k sure the reason might be something else than the lack of wis it could be crucible and that we had 4550k players until it was released i dont know but given that ccp has publicly apologized for incarna and publicly revealed they will focus on spaceships im fairly certain they can read statisticslike it or not ccp has faced a significant drop in active accounts due to not focusing on spaceships regardless of support for the idea of wis im nearly 100 certain that all in the csm agree with that spaceships are the basis of the game and always need to come before wis if any of them say otherwise please point at itso wis will come when ccp has gotten eve back on track with growth and pcu up what more do you need to know this is also what ccp basically said in their communications with the playerbase they still want wis but will focus on fis
an increasing number of eve players who got into eve for spaceships want more than just spaceships eve has that potential to add more to its core game play beyond spaceships without forcing you to leave your spaceship way of gaming it can even allow players to forget about spaceships and do things differently all together without effecting your game at allif you cant stand that maybe eve wont be for you much longer
im delusional hmm perhaps but what does sharks have to do with anythingwhy do people need something else to do it is a game about spaceships well subs in oil really but anyways from what ive seen and read the core demographic isnt interested in wis at least not enough for it to be the focus of the game there are other dressup games around second life i think is still aroundim not saying they shouldnt eventually get wis if they can do so without taking resources from the core game which is and always should be spaceships since quite frankly most who are interested in wis or similar to the degree they play a game with that kind of gameplay would not be interested in eve thinking that they will come is foolishwis had the majority of ccp development assets for what 115 years and the result was disastrous for the core game but sure ccp could always again tell you that it is on the back burner but their vision is for it to come eventually

hate to give him 1 but hes absoltuely rightthis is the only industrial ship id support adding if not a gas strip miner stop the evemail spam
good idea added to the other mining stuff
check my employment history you should find im exfcon so i do have an idea on what living in null sec is like i have also lived in wspace and it would be a great support ship for c13 wh where rorqs cant pass in and out of also i will concede the point on mass it may have to be bumped up instead of straight up knocking the idea why not contribute to refining it
just because you where in the alliance im in doesnt indicate anything no one who are even above my expertise would ever suggest the ship you outlinedthat you can count onyou assume so because tis so awesomeawesome is not the point hereits balancewe have prefectly good mining equipment at our disposalwe do not need to buff iti stand by my wordsthere are no improvements needed because the orca is a mighty fnie shipand we can use a rorqual out hereyou can even build one in whshigh sec however does not need this shipit will break ecnomy if not severely harm itits bad enough with the bots and crapdont add to it stop the evemail spam
c1  c3 has grav sites and pos have refineries and you can buy a bpc pack for a rorqual for about 500m give or take i havent bothered looking in a year or sosure youre going to burn a lot of time and minerals in doing this  but if you want a rorq in wspace then theres nothing stopping you from getting it and putting a rorq inside gets you even more bonuses than an orca would anywayas it stands you can drag in nearly 2900 m3minute with a maxxed hulk and orca pilot hisec doesnt need any more buffsif you want a rorq without the time commitments of null or wspace  theres always lowsec
thisore compression in whs is a mighty fine solution to the painful torture sessions of refineries at possrorqual becomes a immoveable structure in whs c1  c3but then again if your that seriouswell the rest is obvious stop the evemail spam
i dont support this either  how aboutincrease the maintenance bay by 25remove the corp hanger entirelyreduce the cargo hold by 50increase the ore hold by 50 and make the size increase with skill leveladd an extra high slotincrease its agility and accelerationincrease its shield and armour resists by 15basically make a t2 equivalent which mirrors the t1t2 haulerblockade runner
yeah but if youre refining the ore so you can build the rorq then youre not really compressing much for a while but once you can compress the ore itll pay for itself pretty quick since you can get more ore out to the world in your haulers

thisi couldpossibly get behindmaybe a 1 to warp stab and make it a low sec orca or something nothing extravigantbut then one would argue a rorqual fits that bill in lowsecand orca is hard enough to kill in high secim hard pressed to make any changes on it honestlyperhaps a rig to modify cargo space alottments or somethingbut that doesnt make sense either because your still getting the same total cargo space overalland nuking the corp hanger isnt going to workits the perefct antigank toolanything in a cargo bay outside the main cargo bayis toast if the ship does get ganked yes i understand your making ore hold biggerbut the corp hanger helps when your delaing with large operations for various corporations who pay out differently stop the evemail spam

this is one of the more bizarre threads ive seen in this subforum from what i can piece together op wants to discourage baitscam courier contracts by requiring an extra deposit the supposition if i read it correctly is that few people will want to put up the extra money it doesnt seem to factor in several things namely that most suicide ganks dont use bait contracts most gankersscammers are not isk poor and if gankerscammer is going to get the isk back anyway why would they care could someone please tell me what the 110th rule is
3 contract gets picked up and succesfully deliveredat the peak of my business i used to issue about a dozen freightersized couriers every week with the reward being about 01 of the collateral every single one got picked up and delivered within three days a majority in less than a dayjust because its not a sufficient enough reward for you doesnt mean that i should be forced to pay more if there are people for whom it is or do you think that there should be a mandatory minimal sell price of minerals too because there is no profit to be had for anyone in highsec miningi am able to afford it because there are people willing to pick it up at that price
the brokerage fees and deposits for courier contracts are 110th item contracts under taxes and depsits herethe main point of the proposal is that the system currently does not require enough of a potential loss to prevent junk contracts if the fees were higher since i think it seems a little heavy handed to hard cap the collateral its going to hurt more when their junk contracts dont get picked up right now theyre out 10000 isk unless the contract reward is astronomical eve players frequently talk about risk vs reward in this situation there isnt nearly enough risk for the issuer
100
well new players who are legitimately new players and not purposecreated alts can gain access to funding soon enough once they subscribe that said there should be absolutely no magic isk faucets in the proposal the system should be a gamemechanically formalized means of transferring isk between players not a way to abuse the system to game isk from nothing say by taking out loans with unusued alts giving the isk back to their mains then having the loan expire putting them into negative balance then forgetting about the alt forever or even biomassing them i think itd be fine if unpaid loans could show up on your profile in the same way as failed contracts would if some alliance is free enough with their cash that players can use the loan system to make off with money they cant or dont intend to pay back thats the fault of the alliance in question and not something ccp should be reimbursing as per the negative isk thing

plex for remap can only remap once a year using a plexorgive us remaps every 6 months instead of a yeareveryone is happy

i am a rookie but i am not mentally challenged i am fully aware of the implications of my remap i am aware of what the length of a year is and i sought advice both from corpmates the forum through lurking and trawling through old posts and evelopedia before making my choice if i do suddenly do a u turn and completely rethink what direction i want my pilot to go in i would be far more interested in relocating my skill points than another remap  although on a personal level i object to that as well as i believe the choices you make should actually matter if i do realise that my remap has been a big mistake i still have another one remap gathering dust thats why newbs have two remaps so they can muck one up and be able to redeem their pilotbeing able to trade plex for this is an advancement of real money trading something eve needs to avoid at all costs ive seen what that leads to when four of the top ten players spend a combined total of 6000 per month on a game  there is no way 98 of the players can compete with that end result  the game is dying fast one of the reasons i have taken up eve is the lack of noticeable advantage that can be gained with real money trading only a small amount of space barbie faggottry is currently present any move to expand the advantage gained with real money needs to be stamped on asap  once you open the pandoras box of real money trading for ingame advantage the game is dead it may stagger on for months maybe even a year or two but trust me  real money for ingame advantage will be the end of evebut full credit to the op for writing up the proposal so well id much rather read a shocking idea eloquently written than a good idea full of butthurt

this doesnt make any sense the only reason to selfdestruct in combat is because you know that youre going to die this means that you have decided that your death is inevitable meaning that activating sd is effectively crediting your opponents with an inevitable kill so its entirely appropriate that sd should generate a killmail if other parties were involved presumably measured by an active aggression timerthe purpose of sd is to deny your opponent loot and arguably ship fitting information both of these should remain the latter simply by generating a killmail and lossmail containing no module information and with an extra message stating that the ship selfdestructed
okay first i readily admit i am no master of eve game play i would like to propose as a possible middle ground position in this get a killmail for not actually killing anything argument this compromise if any aggressed ship chooses to sd the ship having done the most damage shall receive a killmail now the offer in kind is that any ship that is concorded after aggressing any other ship shall also generate a killmail for the owner of the ship he attacked and was concorded for in essence sd will generate a killmail for the attacking pilot gank will generate a killmail for the attacked pilot if the attacker is destroyed by concord sometimes you have to give to get thus i am suggesting some give on both sides for some get on both sides without implying that both are of equal value all thoughts thumbs up or down are appreciated

my first thought forced voting wtfrequiring people to vote before they can log into eve is damaging what do you hope to get out of this a scramble of eve patrons to the forums in some mad dash attempt to figure out wtf is going on and try to maybe figure out what they should dofact is yes 80 of the population lives in empire many of them are also alts of various 00 allaince members probably more than 20random mathif the current population of the game is 350k the 00 population is 10 of that number and each 00 population meber has a mission running empire alt while 30 of the 00 population has 2 empire production toons and another half of the 00 population maintains empire trade alts in jita what is the percentage of 00 alliance members in the population and current number of subscribers based on a population of 350kalso i brought up ingame voting propaganda last year before csm and it was promptly tromped on as immersion breaking this despite csm being a council of stellar management which is rather in line with current game structure and mechanics i thought it was relatively feasible and easy to meld into game dynamics myself but apparently the majority believe otherwise not a bad thing but id still like to see more people vote and take part in forum discussions the fact that i recognize nearly every poster today from last year and previous years is a profound statement of the state of the forums and relative stagnation of discussion heresome things have changed as have some people which is nice to seezubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
you dont see any problem with ccp staff handpicking the people they want to use for consultation and advicesilly question no of course you dont see the problem
technically they can do that now by rigging the voting system we have to trust tat they dont

this depends entirely on your definition of kill when a selfdestruct is involved you could argue that you did not lay the final blow to the sded ship but since the ship is destroyed and your were involved in its destruction  you indeed committed a kill
no insurance for selfdestruct otherwise i dont careit just doesnt make sense someone pays you for destroying your own ship its dumbwormhole guys can still exploit insurance bullshit by shooting their corp mates rorquals
except these are two completely different issues and so as invaluable as im sure your support is i dont feel particularly obliged to trade you anything for it if you wish to propose kms given to the victims of concorded ships do so in another threadthis thread is not about suicide ganking hell it isnt even about high sec since very few ships big enough to sd in a normal fight are allowed to fly in high seccenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
if someone getting suicided wants killmails all they have to do is aggress the guy downside to that is however that they lose their killright vov
i know there are a few other pi suggestion threads doing the rounds so apologies if this has already been suggestedthere have been some good improvements to pi since iteration 1 however it is still a repetitive click fest one of the ways this is frustrating is when having to move a set up on a planet to make use of resources in another location in these cases the new structure layout is often identical to the one you just destroyedthis could be made considerably quicker by the use of templates a template could be as simple as putting down a set number and type of structures in one go right up to the structures tubes schematics and routes indeed everything but the placement of heads could be done with the placement of a presaved templatethis would seem like a very simple way of saving lots of time
1 speed penalty is just ridiculous
as stated by subjectccp once stated they werent looking into it because bpcs can have varying stats runs me pe in practice however the people that have the most bpcs are the ones making copies which usually have identical stats and would thus be very stackable the benefits are less cluttered hangars which would make players and ccps db guys happy
this is technically very difficult to do bpcs like used bpos are a singleton put simply they are unique items and so cannot have a quantity value other than 1 far from making the db guys happy any attempt to work around this would likely make them miserablewhile it may be possible to have some clientside filter than makes them appear as a single stack this could be very resourceintensive as soon as you start dealing with large numbers of prints a much simpler solution is to just keep similar prints in a can or hangar division perhaps ccp could allow use of blueprints out of cans insteadapparently we cant use url tags anymore 
ok you want to go technicali know that with the update to differentiated bpos and bpcs ccp merged the semantics of the singleton and quantity column into a single column where quantity  1 equals singleton that change is basically a crutch to get the easy differentiation client side done that now hinders further improvements to bps the better solution would have been to give bpos and bpcs a different type id further the singleton design is not really needed in the cases where you want to set a foreign key to a singleton bp you could just as well use the auto stack splitting that is used in many other parts of the game and set the fk to that newly created 1 unit stack in fact the solution i propose requires the singleton concept to be abolished as the bp stats come from another table that are joined to the actual inventory row the only slightly trickier part is to avoid stacking bps with different stats or which are part of a pseudo singleton fk for instance bpos in research
6 months sounds pretty reasonableive been playing this game for years but i havent bothered to do cosmos yet since ive been waiting for perfect time to do them since you can do them only oncealso it seems pretty lame that if you want to grind cosmos you need to recycle characters to do them and cosmos is only source of some items so obviously someone is doing this
the current drone navigation computer module is ridiculous no one ever trades a midslot for an increase in drone mwd speed if you have a spare mid slot that can only fit this module then youve fit your ship wrongconversely drone ships frequently have spare high slots i can use a high slot to increase the range of my drones but thats pretty much useless since 5 heavies are going to take over a minute to actually get to their targets and start shooting theyre vulnerable while mwding and more importantly you dont use them like this on a pvp ship anywaypunchline who needs a medslot dnc no one make it a high slot module like the drone link augmentor and make ratting in a drone ship stop losing dps to slow as hell heavies getting to kiting rats
if drones had more potential dps youd probably see it in use really the mwd speed of drones is mostly irrelevent as heavies are more commonly used for pve than pvp they tend to be too big of targets in pvp and awful slow neuting domi drone boat maybe but mostly not i thinkcouldnt say a 100 as ive only actually ever run across drone flinging bsishtar a bare few times anywhere mediums and smalls tend to be the thing from what ive seen thoughif you actually had a drone boat capable of slinging 500600 dps on just drones would you fit a dns in your mids 700800op i know given each is a seperate target in addition to yourself solo pwn mobile reallyi tried fitting an ishtar with one once to see how practical it would be but didnt think the benefit was worth it myself if it was high i think it would be used much more as you suggested main problem i found with the ishtar was it functions better in many respects as a shield tank kind of rules out the mids for that use even as a dedicated drone boat and i was using the high for acsreally doesnt leave much unless you happen to be looking at a possible use for a hyperion havent looked at one in awhile faction bs no idea as a mid i cant immediately think of a usewait typhoon that might do itedittyphoon dns checkdamage control iienergized adaptive nano membrane iienergized adaptive nano membrane iilarge armor repairer iigyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer iigyrostabilizer ii100mn afterburner iiwarp disruptor iistasis webifier iidrone navigation computer idual 650mm repeating artillery ii republic fleet emp ldual 650mm repeating artillery ii republic fleet emp ldual 650mm repeating artillery ii republic fleet emp ldual 650mm repeating artillery ii republic fleet emp ldual 650mm repeating artillery ii republic fleet emp lheavy nosferatu iiheavy nosferatu iimedium graviton smartbomb iilarge antithermic pump ilarge auxiliary nano pump ilarge auxiliary nano pump iogre ii x5valkyrie ii x5not a bad fit i think of course its completely untested as far as i knowzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
excellent planby forcing the csm to include less capable highsec players through positive discrimination rather than allowing the election to only choose the best candidates it means that theyll be more susceptible to manipulation by the more knowledgeable and politically adept 00 and lowsec memberswell have jita made into a 04 and halve the ehp of mining barges within a matter of months
thanks for clearing up the confusion over the goons agenda
actually it makes sense from both sides for this to be implemented effectively server logs all fleet members of involved parties in system and active modules at time of kill with no more than modifications to the current query a secondary query might extend to neutral assistance like logis who have become involved in the fight and inherited aggression timersall logis get in on the kill as do the gang boosters this makes sense as the fight may have gone very differently if it were not for those contributing factorsgang boosting and logi support counts for a lot in any battleon the other side everyone gets to see what was really used to accomplish the kill neutral and gang boosting alts get exposed and the measure of the battle is more evidentpoints system can be reworked to accomodateside note battleclinic and other scoring systems seem to be weighed a bit poorly when you account for things like what king rothgar mentioned using decimals might helpsure you end up with a lot of 0 dps additions to the killboard but you also get far more depth for potential battle analysis that helps everybodyedit calculating logi repair per second as a counter to dps on both sides might also be interesting and would be far more informative adding link bonus might be useful too or at least some measure of the gang boosters skillzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
force fleet boosters on same grid like they should be so they must participate in fight and actually get killmails
reiterated that same invalid point isnt going to strengthen the argument a fleet booster does participate in a fight even off grid not saying they shouldnt be required to be on grid in at least some cases but being required to shoot the target isnt neccessary for them to swing the balance of the fightpretty much the same with logiszubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub

im glad fis is being focused on but anyone who says wis has no place in the eve universe need to take a look at any space scifi material thats out there none of its confined in ships even the eve chronicles emphasize on this aspect of the lore heck if eve had swtor gameplay mixed in it would be the only thing youd need for a space scifi fix but thats asking too much ive ended my subscriptions in the past not because of a feature i didnt want to see but because i simply got bored with the game really got burned out with flying all the time im one of those who would like to see a different aspect to the game i can fall back on without having to switch games or hobbies though that may be healthy
yeah its really stupid most players are wanting clarification on where wis stands now noone is asking that fis is abandoned in favour of wis the haters cant seem to fathom this
it seems everyone wants to make this ship a general purpose hauler which was not my intent with the ship design i would like to see a better definition between miners and industrialist miners being the people who get the ore and industrialist being the people who build stuff personally i think the orca is too easy to get into so obviously this ship would have many many more skills required second the only thing this does the same as a rorq is compress ore it does not give better bonuses or offer jump capability or give people jump clones all it really does is offer a way to move more ore and it does it slower than the orca which is by designso lets get off the t2 orca now and hear what people have to say about t3 mining ships to help differentiate miners form indy players

currently running an advanced search specific to a forum with only a keyword entry results in all instances of that keyword from all threadsfor example advanced search  cloak  features  ideas forum try itwhat id liked to see is the limitation for all results returned from the same thread to be collated down to one result pointing at the specific threadjust a checkbox added to the advanced search it might take slightly longer for results to return but it beats wading through results for the same 23 most recent threads in which it was mentioned anyone who did that search will understand what i mean granted the engine may accomodate cloak  sb returns but that will likely return all instances in which word and acronym were mentioned as well as those for both the latter might be filtered to the top of course as that is i believe standard for search enginesit will still return a plethora of unwelcome results however and it would be nice to just have the option of seeing results that indicate specific threads with possibly the addition of number of instanceszubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
actually all the devs would have to do is make it so you are always a valid squadseperated from fleet  valid squad  invalid fleetsolo  valid squad  no fleetin fleet formation on grid  valid squad  valid fleetand for the fix so many of you wantin fleet off grid sperated from fleet formation and squad  valid squad  invalid fleet ie if youre the gang booster you dont boostreally though there has to be a level where it is system wide and where it is on grid for example a cap ship with gang links should boost system wide as a fleet commander but not as wing commander or a squad commanderconversely a battle cruiser acting as a squad commander wing commander or fleet commander should only boost on grid while being unable to boost system wide due to limited onboard hardware and the like much smaller ship  limited projectionmight be nice if they worked some of this into reworking fleet mechanics such as they mentioned they were eventually going to do some time agoedit technically speaking a sniper is always a valid squad whether he is entirely alone or with a spotter he is still a valid squadzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
would be nice i thought of that some time ago and made a workaround where players got a welcome mail when they joined a list not quite the same thing though as they have to join corp then you have to tell them to join the list and give them the info for it so you can give more info in the list welcomeso yes good idea 1zubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub

its a good idea to examine any new proposal for exploitation potential but my response to the griefing concern you have raised can be summed up in the old clichedont do the crime if you cant do the timere your other query if anyone or everyone can take the bounty then its too easy to burn it off with fullly insured t1 ships although the perp doesnt gain anything actually he will take a small loss he can make the person who placed the bounty lose his money without getting revenge it would cost the perp maybe 510 of what the person who placed the bounty spent to nullify the effect being able to get rid of a 500m bounty by spending perhaps 2550m isnt something that should be achievable without some clever gameplay like infiltrating a bounty corp or corrupting one of their members

yet you dont have the option to show fleet members only right now you can only make so you see all players on grid not only fleet membersurl

in the olden days it wasnt possible unless you assigned standingwhen you remove for example neutral standing all them randoms that are in your fleet are removed so youd need to set all your fleet members to excellent standing or something the same difficulties arise when you want to display only your corpalliance unless your ceodirector is on the ball with setting standingspersonally think it should be a logic structure where you can add a number of different rules of who to display or not displayexampleshow neutral standing or good standing or excellent standing and fleet member
you can they have prioritieschange the order in the filter list higher priority rules take precedence just gonna understand the rulesgood luck figuring them out
and its the same now in order for it to work you need to assign standings to fleet members and revoke them if they leaveurl
youre confusing states with appearance states has no priorities and no way of altering the order of it you can make fleet members show up yellow in background even if they have a mediocre sec status even if in fleet or you can have the purple override all but they will still suffer from the exclusive list of statesif the states tab was inclusive we wouldnt have this issue but arguably others the method mr frost suggests would be a very effective way of solving it all and allow for best customizability but arguably also the highest entry barrier on the other hand why have a broken but seemingly intuitive system

there should be a way to fight cloaked ships other then waiting all day long for it to uncloak cloaking totally spoils the game the way it is as it is often used to evade fights and grief also it is really boring to hunt one of them since they can only be killed if the cloaked pilot is inexperienced and have a bad timingproposal cloaked ships should be detected by some sort of combat scanner probes this way there would be a real possibility to uncloak it and there would be more real pvp and less griefersobs there should be a warning for the cloaked ship every time it gets detected by a prober  like a scanner probe has locked xxx on your position warning or some graphical thingthis way the game should be fair  cloak should make invisible not invincibleeditcoming sooni will definitly fly one of those new pos system new sov system

you spoil the game with your ideawhat do you suggest we do about it stop the evemail spam
obvious trolling thread his opinion is the exact opposite as indicated herewhy do people do thiszubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
yes please looking for the one i want i have to click on every damn one do they want i us staring at the market more then usual
i personally have no issues with the iskhr given by incursions what i dont like is that there is an unlimited number of sites that players can farm to their hearts content at all timesyou can do incursions for an infinite number of sites per day the sites are always the same with little variation or diversity making them easy to and quick to dono other pve gets that nullsec lowsec wormholes all have sites that can be done only once before they disappear leaving you the rest of the day to do nothing incursions can be run all day long never ending until the incursion runners decide to kill the mom site which requires a significant fleet to do what i propose is that there should be a limit of the number of sites given per daymake incursions so that there is only one incursion for each security level of space1 each for highsec lowsec and nullsec make it so that incursions only of have a certain number of each type of sites if there are no more vanguards then the players must do hqs and assaults in order to make money
so what you propose is the massive overcrowding of incursion site not sites in each security zone and imply they are run soloyou really dont think these things through do youvery poor troll with very poor common sense910 stop the evemail spam
noand sanctums and moon goo should be moved to highsec
nerf high sec incursions somehowsome changes are needed
no nerf you instead some changes are needed for you not mesee thats what its all about
if i remember correctly multiple fleets can go in the same incursion site and whichever fleet is the most effective wins the reward yes it would be crowded in highsec but you could still get a fleet up and run an incursion normally you just wouldnt be guaranteed that it would always pay out all of the timei have seen a lot of lets move carebears into lowsec threads and i think incursions are a perfect way to do that reduce highsec to one incursion region every once in a while and make lowsec the place where there are two to three constant incursions up at a timei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
then make sure theres at least 1 incursion in each empirelimiting it to 1 in high sec is just plain stupidincraesing them as they head out towards low sec to 00 however is reasonableeven perhaps making them low sec00 onlywont happen howeverkinda breaks the whole point of an incursionbut thats not gonna change my stance on this thread stop the evemail spam
i support this if ccp completely reworks cosmos including the stats of storylinemodules besides standing and some nice imps there arent many reasons to do these missions at all
boho you loser if you fell for a scam its your fault that is something people do in this game to make money and if you loss you isk or whatever you lost its on your head if you lost a mill stop complaining and go run a incursion i lost all my isk once and had to hammer missions daily to get back to the top this was way before incursions i didnt quit i bit the bullet and got my isk back now im doing great plus a law suit your a huge loser now stop whining and go make some isk
im not sure but as far as chatrooms the way to activate a chatroom is to click the icon and enter the room name or perhaps bookmark it in the chatroom menu page thingy what about a quickbar which would hold chatrooms just like the market quick bar does its whatever
you should consider the combination of heavy drones  target painter then add in a couple of dns and a dts and your ogres will eat even frigates alive which makes the combo of a fast tackling target painting minnie ship in combination with a hard hitting gallente drone boat all the scarier
makes sense a module that increases drones speed should take the same slot that increases drones range supported
swap the target painter to high slot too d
no make drone control units fittable on subcap instead
ban npc forum alts from csm forums
cant open the image but the idea is freakin epic make it real and i would pay cash
this also means your vote counts for 35th only just like you know
and how can they not move when getting a bit of air from an open jacket
this would make me at least 100 more likely to get involved in lowsec pvp outside fw definitely supported
fantastic idea i approveedit please make sure that sec penalties from remote support logistics are also included in this proposal theres more to sec loss than just blowing stuff up after all
i cant think of any drawbacks to thissupported
prpbably solution is crerate a online report system for tiefs so to say ceo or corp director reports thieves and puts bounty on his headany way corp ceos reporting them so way not keep online data base of thos chars and work with thos contracts wat was proposaled beforthis not include scamers
eperor is a thief
bump
just a little bump to bring this topic back up for other readers and new ideaswrath
you know if you were a computer game character im afraid i would remove you too for your infuriating insistence on spelling ridiculous rediculoushaving said that though i will support your proposal 
frankly ive always thought all the penalties were a waste of time i almost never use t2 ammunition as a result because it just handicaps the ship too much it might be okay in very specific controllable circumstances but overall its a penalty that is completely out of scope with the benefits never made sense to mewhy would you severely incapacitate an entire ship for a little bit of range or a bit more damage sure the rage torpedoes dps nicely but they suffer from other penalties already as far as i know all t2 ammo doesexamplestandard torpedomax velocity 1500 msflight time 6 sdamage 450explosion velocity 71 msexplosion radius 450mrage torpedomax velocity 1250 msflight time 64sdamage 576explosion velocity 61 msexplosion radius 650mwhy would you need to penalize the ship when youve already balanced the missilespecial reference  caldari faction torpedomax velocity 1500 msflight time 6sdamage 517explosion velocity 71 msexplosion radius 450mthe cn torpedo boosts damage with no adjustment to compensate for that increase  because its faction and limited supplyincreased costthe boost is 67 points with 59 points between it and the t2 rage the rage loses in explosion velocity explosion radius and speed and ultimately range base range is 1 km less than standard and faction torpedoeswhy penalize the ship it doesnt make any sense youve already killed its effectiveness against smaller ships and dedicated it towards attacking larger targets im pretty sure this covers the major portion of t2 ammunition to similar effect every one ive checked out was that way as far as i can recallso yeah 1 on this and denerfing t2 ammo in general the penalties arent worth it 98 of the timeedit and if that argument isnt enough for you the current penalties just give one more reason to blob this is just one more reason not to fly solo or in small gangszubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
i cant support this sorry  i like the fact that they all have names that are at least in some of the cases hint at what they do for example the ice mining implant sets are called yeti it adds a little bit of mystique not much though admittedlywould you like the typhoon to be renamed battleship  split weapon system  needs a lot of training to use effectively or the falcon to be renamed force recon  ecm  will cause a lot of tears or even the rifter frigate  autocannons  i win butannice idea though
no but i would not like to have my ships namedroden enforcer zx420and neither would you
i think the simple solution would be to remove the first part including the corporation name and move that to description unquote the name and adjust it to be more suitable to the implant and retain the last partmk 2 always reminds me of star trek this is not star trekso it would be more like this arc zmf 1000  replacing zainou deadeye zmc 1000  missile flight time bonus arc zmv 1100  replacing zainou deadeye zml 1100  missile max velocity bonus arc zha 750  replacing zainou snapshot zme 750  heavey assault missile damage bonus arc zhm 1000  replacing zainou snapshot zmh 1000  heavy missile damage bonussomething like that anyway my issue with selecting implants isnt so much the name as it is ignoring the broad spectrum tags like snapshot and sometimes indecipherable acronymswhat does zmc stand for for example first part is easy zainou missile  the c i dont getthe second issue i have is the length of the name and quotes as it makes for too much clutter which results in poor readabilityzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
its an engineering term
youre just mad because youre probably a big incursion carebear the problem with highsec vanguard incursions are that it trivializes the much more dangerous ways of making isk in lownullwh space highsec incursions are simply unbeatable when it comes to iskhr to the risk involvedlogis disconnect well what your logi disconnects in a wh site what if your mission ship disconnects while taking heavy fire this is an invalid excuse for riskgankers griefers in nonhighsec areas there is no concord therefore you can be killed and griefed with much greater ease than highsec there are griefers and gankers in all space this excuse is therefore invalidwhich means that there is virtually no risk in highsec incursions for the fairly high iskhrtherefore highsec vanguard incursions should be limited or made more dangerous
then nerf low sec and 00 moneymakers is it unfair that those groups get moon goo and sanctums and ice mining and incursions and etcetera etcetera etcetera if its unfair for people to get money in high sec then its unfair for low sec and 00 to get everything they getstop trolling with stupid ludicrous and whiny posts about how its unfair that ccp paid attention to its high sec memberspeople who live in 00 get tons of toys and all of ccps attention to the point that mittani ran a boycott that got ccp to release an entire expansion complete with ships and nerfs and buffs galore all for the gratisfaction of 00 dwellers seriously a small group gets all of the attention and love from ccp and yet they have the nerve to complain that the realistic isk generator in highsec needs to be nerfed htfu and stop complaining you dont hear incursionists bitching and griping about how the csm ignores high sec or about how only low sec and 00 get moon mining and abc ores or mercoxit
aaaannd alliances nap it up in 00 space and lock down their systems excluding the occasional afk cloaker and run mining sites and sanctums with drumroll no freaking risk shut up youre an idiot of most epic proportions
couldnt you just make it so that once you get the mothership site to spawn the number of site spawns will slowly dwindle down to a low minimum or even finally end basicly just change it from a large inifinite farmable resource for the duration of the incursion to a much more limited resource as more farming is done it makes farmin incursions a nonissue and is much better for incentivizing competition since every site done by others is a resource not available to you and the supply is now much more limited after the incursion has passed a certain point it also creates a strong incentive to attack the mothership and end the incursion since a dwindled down incursion cant possibly supply enough sites to keep every farmer busy

nice solutionif implemented it would require some sort of visible aggro timer on the client the length of your timer depends on other people and you cant rely on a simple stopwatch anymorewhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
well itd be as simple as updating the timer on your client to whatever the timer is on the person youre assisting pretty simple really if your timer is longer than that of the person youre assisting then obviously no action is necessary
if ccp can pass partial timers this would be perfect it would even allow those timers to be chained through logi without creating an infinite loopeven if it does take some substantial coding it needs to be done logi shouldnt be exempt from aggression rules

try harder flying logi you kinda need to know how to do things like this i know my logi overview only shows fleet membersno matter what their standings so i am inclined to think the fact that yours doesnt is a pebcak error no matter how many of you fail to learn to configure itits not intuitive to make it work right if you think it is that might be your core problem right there
if so then please post your settings since i tried pretty much everything and also the wiki  eve uni tells the same thing i have trouble withurl
gonna take some time just got a new ssd raid setup and am having to reinstall everything as soon as i get a functional client going from my backups ill post a link to my overview fileprepare to laugh tho it mostly fails 
sorry if i misunderstand something but the state filterpilot is in your fleet does not satisfy your needs make a fleet tab and uncheck all the other states and you will only see your fleet members
it does not work since if you uncheck everything but pilots in your fleet then it will remove people from overview if they are in your alliance but also in your fleet etc issue is that you cannot set priority or chose logical gates like other people in this thread postedi want to have only fleet members in one tab called fleet is that to much to ask foralso please read the eve uni overview guide  overview guidenote that this preset will show all pilots in space not just fleetmatesurl
ok i see now it has not been designed to accommodate fleets of mixed pilots from various corps or alliances with neutral standings yeah this should be like the colours tab if you could set their order it would work

from this thread a lot of support has been given to the idea of upgrading the current npcs you see when flying around at the moment outside of missions plexs and anomalies the only npc ships you see are the concord faction ships at gates and a few haulers flying out of random stations and slow boating off grid this really shows how little npc activity goes on in eve its like pod pilots are the only ones flying around which is not the case there are trillions of people in the galaxy there should be more npc trafficwhat started as a cosmetic change just seeing more ships flying back and forth has become more practical after suggestions from others a whole bunch of player activities set to challenge a pilot have been suggested my proposal is that ccp take some time from their development cycle for summer to add new scripts for npcs to move about the galaxy some ideas thrown about in the thread werehaulers travelling from station to station or system to system delivering goods which can be dropped if the npc is destroyedhaulers travelling to low sec and null sec with an armed escourt with smart ai incursion level that low sec players can attack for loot or protect for faction rewards like a dynamic mission source other rare ship types like luxury yachts cruising around planetsnocti roaming battlefield complexes providing salvaging missions factional fleets fighting pitched battles in fw highsec low sec and null sec which players can join on either side for rewards the full realisation of this concept can be done in stages the first iteration can be improving to original caravan script so that ships go station to station or system to system and add more ship types before adding more opportunities to the npc environment the npc activity could be scalable to server load to avoid performance issues also i think a more dynamic npc environment is better for the players than waiting for certain identical instances to spawn be that in missions anoms or incursions a bit of variety would challenge players more increasing fun what say you
i say yay because a richer enviroment is better for everyone especuly piwates

while i find the prospect of being able to design my own monster ship appealing  the biggest concern i have regarding this is how to ensure balance currently with the right skills trained and using good fittactics most ships in each class are more or less balanced  some lend themselves better to certain roles than others this allows players of different races etc to compete on a fair if not completely level playing field and ensures not only that there is a role for different ship classes and players of different skill levels but that there is a counter for just about any tactic you can come up withthe tacticalstragigic nature of combat in eve relies on developing a knowledge of possible tactics and countertactics and trying to predict what you are going to face this is only possible if you have a defined types of assets on the playing field UFFFD in this way it is similar to chess a defined range of pieces with rules for how they can interact which are known to all players of sufficient skillUFFFD but try playing chess with the rules changing every few moves or a new superqueen suddenly appearing on the board mid gameccp takes great pains to ensure this balance and the fact that they need to periodically rebalance ships is a testiment to the difficult of predicting how ships will be fit and used on tq as new expansions or an unexpected tactic unfairly favours one ship type over anotherand players will be strongly motivated to find the most unbalanced ships possiblethis proposal is likely to result in either a small group of win ships or a horrible mess in which there is such a range of shipsships changing so fast ity is no longer possible to play in a stratigic manner either of which are likely to fundamentally break the gameand if that occurs it will be far more difficult for ccp to intervene and rebalance player designed ships than ccp designed one  imagine having a ship you have spent huge amounts of isk and time designing being nerfed and also this would have a massive effect on the marketensuring balance in advance for any system that would allow changes in ship specs significant enough to be meaningful would be almost impossible in addition the design of player created ships would need to be factored in in the design of new content potentially making it impossible to predict the effects of new contentccp should not put themselves in the position where it is likely they will have to intervene post hoc and on a regular basis to change the result of player actions anyone remember the kick off following the removal of test alliances sov structureswhile initial attract this proposal would be likely to lead to chaos and the breaking of eve if implemented
dont forget precision missiles they have speed penalty and half flight times too
currently if you attack a pos of any worth that is regions away from the owners hq all they simply do is log on a strontium alt and set the timer to come out at their optimal time or if you anchor a sbu or attack station services owners are immediately notified and are able to mobilize and repel potential invaders with ease due to under attackcontested mails this is incredibly powerful for empires that are mostly afk stretch well beyond their actual inhabited space and use this system to abuse not actually patrolling the areafirst let me say i am not saying to remove low on fuel mails or anything like that just the under attackcontested mails from sbus if an invader actually does attacksbu space that is actually inhabited the defenders will know what they are up to almost as fast as the current mail system the difference will be when an empire decides to hold a moonspace far away from where they actually live then we will see things change dramatically if such empires still want to control stuff far from home they will need to patrol such assetsspace regularlyyes i know some of you are raging already that patrolling is  work and you wont do it that sounds fine to me im not going to make youwhat is everyones thoughts
i too would like to remove fights
fights oh you mean where both sides size each other up before a timer is done and if one side decides they dont have enough guys they just choose not to botherseriously that will still be done if anything this will cause more fights to happen and on a smaller scale as large blobs spread out to cover their territory if they want to keep it that is
are there ever any fights over the initial reinforcement ehp grind wouldnt remove all of them but if structure has a reinforcement cycle ahead then no alert goes outnote this means that pos mods including jammersbridges can be knocked out without an owner being automatically toldhave to keep tabs on what the hell goes on in ones space either by scouting employing spies or you know actually being in the space one claims as ones ownwe have timers to ensure that reinforcements ends at a less disadvantageous hour so scrambling a defensive fleet when an actual alert goes out should not be a problem if it is then perhaps the defender is trying to hold more than he can and deserves having some fat cut from his bloated carcass
youre just mad because you are getting too many riches off the wndot campaign
all these buttmad people fail to realize that in one thread ccp has already stated that hi sec incursions are under review because they generate too much iskcant wait for that patch the rage will be worse than the anom nerf over the summer
let them farm to their hearts content just drop the payouts to around 25 of theit curent amount in hisecmake lowsec and nullsec incursions the place wheer the money is risk should always  more isk and hisec incursions are no risk
make 00 guys more tears
mad why would i be mad about that stop the evemailUFFFDspam
i would hazard a guess its because they are focusing on open gl and carbon io as well they may not have the resources or programmers that specialize in that sort of thing just a guess thoughreally if its partialy or entirely the latter i would say find someone that is specialized in it really 2 guys is all theyd probably need to bring it up to directx11 by the end of the year i would think anywayreally im not the least bit experienced with it but given that it is such a small part of software development it shouldnt require a lot of manpower figure a game like swtor can be developed in 4 years and released with all that goes into that it stands to reason that the percentage of development put into directx is small in comparisonlike i said though i dont know im just making a marginally educated guessi do think a lot of it depends on the 3d artists and related programming obviously the development period for software intended for directx 11 is benefiting from 3d artists and the like who are focused towards that goal makes things easier when everything is designed for it right from the startthere may be a lot of issues with updating to directx 11 for a game devloped on directx 9 and earlierheres hoping that its not a whole lot of work and ccp can get it updated by the end of the year if they deside to start or have started focusing resources on that goalzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
well they do still have those dx10 models they have still done nothing with after showing them to us what the hell happened there
isnt that just hdrzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
first no thats not just hdr they updated shaders on the trinity expansion and gave the engine a big push also they are updating the shading on each ship with the project v3 that will give better look and options for the ships like skins corp logos etc second where do you get that they focus on opengl that would be awesome and mean that eve would one day be playable on a tablet like androidthird dirextx is nothing you just update  there is allot of testing needed and allot of rework of the engine to support a newer version then they need to test it for several versions each time they release it also the wine and cedega project will have issues adopting the direct 1011 support so just dropping dirextx9 is not an valid option since that will be like showing the finger for non windows usersurl
well i wont go in detail trough all of ideas for now i ll post general thoughts eve sports in the link bellow its explained a bit better
 my reaction as i readyour point with this thread is
did you just suggestachievementsget outedit riddles that you have to solve theyd all be solved and searchable on google within a day of release you underestimate the tenacity of eve players and the speed with which we spread information
sorry to sayi agreepartially not entirely agiainst acheivements but stillgotta say not supporting stop the evemail spam
im completely against achievements i think theyve wrecked gaming look at batman arkham asylum you spend maybe 10 hours actually playing out the storyline and another 4050 trying to complete the achievements theyre an easy way out of good game designthis is especially bad in multiplayer games where people you are depending on suddenly drop what theyre doing because they have a shot at some hardtoget achievementyou want achievements in eve certifications level 5 skills wallet balance goals flying any paritcular ship you couldnt fly last week winning pvp against the odds you shouldnt need some arbitrary reward system to tell you how youre progressing or give you new goals not in eve
i think achievements add a bit of humorif not some sort of kudos to ones selfeve is a daunting game and has tendecy to crush ones heart and spirit in one fell swoop upon the squish noise of your pod being blown to atomsachievments are not the devil you make them to bethey are simply thatachievementshell floppiekillmails are worse than achievemnts most people parade them around like some stupid falic prize to be pushed in peolpes facesim just sayingits not that badit wont break the game or mess up mechanicsas for the rest of this proposali agree with your sentiments stop the evemail spam
oke good good finally some discussion well my point was exactly to bring up a discussion about these ideas because i think those are some nice proposals that can add smth good to this game i didnt go trough em in details so i wanted to see what other ppl think so we could shape them up togethersport and tactical objective is actually what is my main focus and think that can be introduced quite easily and would give some more depth to this gameabout achievements i never ment smth like in other hello kitty games when u do it u get some shinny pop ups hell no its more like a personal satisfaction of solving riddles or being stubborn goin trough google and doing em as much as u can the real achievement would be the items relic u get it would add more content for ppl that get bored looking at the spin counter why not in future those relics not be viable to show off in establishments and yes some will get trough google looking up the solutions but some believe me will actually try do em by emselves it just adds some more content for everyone doesnt need much skilllz u d need to scan em and kill some  inside some of those actually d be difficult and u d need a minor fleet to defeat it solo collector could pay mercenarries for helpand would add even more depth to the market collectors would bargain for em and some would even kill for certain relicsrelics wldnt be the only thing u get from those kind of missions ppl would get some useful items too so it would be another and let say quite interesting way to earn iskabout capital balance well it is just an issue that bothers me as most of eve population i think so just wanted to know what people think of what i proposed and maybe tweak it a bit
its on sisii just wished that there was a much bigger indicator that hte module is overheating like the entire cicrlce is popping out and the black areas between sections pulses into a fire red and blackdust 514s cpm 1 iron wolf saber eve mail me about dust 514 issues
i suggested something in reference to this idea before it was fully fleshed out in features and ideas to test the waters and get ideassupport for the idea before making the proposal herethe original posting can be found here
just make it a freighterno slotsno rigsjust a big fat hanger bay with the limitations you gotfreighters including jump freighters can do fine with a modest fleet for defense or common senseand you get my votejump drive capble not sureill let others debate thatps only reason im open to the ideaorcas are just not the best thing for 00 transportation and carriers are not the best either for mass transport of equipmentand the staggering number of battleships we field are insane would be nice to summon up a fat assed freighter with fitted ships all the same slots would make it too powerfuljump drive or lack thereofremains to be seenbut even jump drive ships have dangers stop the evemail spam
i only suggested it have mid and low slots due to the fact that it wouldnt just be utilized for mass movement in fleet operations it would also be utilized for moving across long stretches of space and if cut off from a fleet it would at least be able to defend itself long enough for fleet support to arrive two to three midlow slots with no rig slots wouldnt be gamebreaking for this type of shipand the purpose of it being tier 2 is to round out the role a little more and create more immersionwith above listed slots it wouldnt allow for a massive tank to be fit to it or a large amount of ewar to be fitted to it with the limitations to powergrid and cpu that would definitely be in placeas for jump capable i would go ahead and say no to that one unless a tech 2 variant of said ship was eventually createdi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
as a space trucker i support this idea as i did in features  ideas discussion although drake draconis brings up a good point i propose the followingmaximum locked targets 5 so no number of signal amps would be able to allow them to lock a target even on the 5low slot variantwhen i thought about these ships and proposed their perlevel bonuses i did so with the idea in mind that they would have these mid and low slots which is why i think they should be keptalso the support tug perlevel bonus of 06 warp stability per level was intended as part of the tech 2 variant and would of course either have to be dropped or reimplemented as a freighter perlevel bonus if the 06 warp strength were to be implemented i would definitely take a significant amount out of their agility
i am a little confused as to why another transport ship of any kind is needed right nowbutwhatevermore diversity cant hurt1
i absolutely love this ideait would be kinda like a non combat high sec carrieran orca can not hold even a single battleshipcurrently at best using courier contracts with max skills you can put two fitted battleships in a freighter most rigged fitted battleships when put in a courier package are over 400000m3 to have a new freighter style ship big enough to hold 34 fitted battleships but in a ships only bay that can not hold normal cargoit is a pain when moving across the galaxy to have to fly all the battleships with rigs that you do not want to lose true you can always sell them and rebuy or take packaged ones with you but having a ship that could carry multiple battleships through high sec would be really great
the orca is an industrial ship its designed to carry a pair of mining vessels and was never intended as a transport ship its prerequisites are absurd for someone who just needs to move some fitted shipsid like to see a specialized freighter that could carry 1 million m3 of fitted ships this would allow for a pair of battleships or one battleship and a small fleet of support ships it should not be able to eject ships but could place them into ship maintenance arrays or unload them in stations
i spent hours last night moving ships around because my battleships were all over highsec in weird places i still need to go get one more if i could train my orca alt to fly a freighter like this i probably never would have left them out there when i changed out for whatever cruiser i left the system in
and this is the way all ideas should be done features to assembly hall1
im liking the positive feedback that this idea is getting and would like to seek more supporti would also hope to get the attention of the csm and devs with this onei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i blame the magic strapless super tight and supportive bra
signedbcargo pilots unite
i like the idea of the contract system however not necessarily as replacement for the current bounty mechanicsas you pointed out current mechanics work like in the old wild west where death was obviously meaningfull in eve it is not why should you get the full bounty payout for killing someone in an empty clone the bad guy does not care at all  he lost nothing i would rather like to fix this first make the bounty system evelike contracts could be added on top of that  would be a really nice additionsee my signature for a fixed evelike bounty system
your idea for the bounty payout is essentially the same as mine but its open to the following simple exploityou put a 500m bounty on mei buy 12 drakes and platinuminsure themi kill me in those unfitted drakes with my alt or corpy who consequently receives 60 of the value of each drake as rewardi receive the full insurance value of each drakei make a moderate profit and remove the 500m bounty on my head in about 15 minutesyou have completely wasted your money given me a small profit and done no more than briefly inconvience memy killboard looks like ass now but whateverbeing able to specify who can collect a bounty is absolutely essential to stop friendsalts of the criminal essentially negating the bounty in this way additionally contracting a killright means that i cant hide in hisec and benefit from concord protection
alternatively you cap the payout for a kill at 60 of the ships nominal price less the platinum insurance value and leave it at thatsince when did wanted dead or alive posters specify that only certain people were allowed to collect
im reminded of the opening scenes of the good the bad and the ugly where clint eastwood and eli wallach are running a bounty scam
this is actually a negative number for t1 shipsthis is the problem if you make the bounty high enough to be worth collected then its worth collecting with an alt for bounties to have any meaning you have to close the altfriend loophole and restrict who can receive them
this is already covered in the details section 
no restrictions are neededthe single mandatory requirement isdamage done  insurance  payout
but thats simply incorrect if i can scrape off a 500m bounty for the cost of only a few mill to myself then why wouldnt i that would be like sacrificing a sabre to herotackle a tech 3 cruiser which any pvper would do in a heartbeati can cheaply and easily free myself from any real risk and i have the satisfaction of wasting a large sum of your money who would be stupid enough to bother putting a bounty on me on those terms only those ignorant of how the bounty system works  just like nowedit i am strongly opposed to having bounty payments deducted from insurance bounty payments should be a purely player transaction
when i talk about the plexxing im talking about occupancy plexxing not missionsmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
this seems good to me and a definitely an improved and interesting way to provide new pve content but i would like to have such initiative to be function and gameplay driven basicly keep the npc ships which serve neither of those purposes to a minimum some fluff is fine to improve immersion but the main drive the project should be to add to the actual gameplay and improve the pve aspects of the gameadditional idea for attacking convoyshaulers would be to allow ransoming them instead of killing them and looting them that option should be available only after all the escorts have been killed you would get cash instead of the loot drop if you choose to ransom if you want to get fancy allow dishonoring the ransom with reprecussions one such thing might be losing the ability to ransom after a few times or other fitting sanctions alternatively you can just despawn the hauler make it invulnerable and have it warp away and disappear if it was ransomed and not allow people to break the deal at all
me likey those ideas

is this also in favor of making eve more difficult all around as well1
1 fantastic idea
as the topic says this is my idea to fix miningfirst off asteroid belts shouldnt be little crescents that a couple of hulks and an orca can sit in the middle and macro mine it should be a bit wider so miners have to navigate the field with the lesser value rocks on the outside not all the rocks should be good to mine either insert a few ores from mining missions in there as well as some of the rocks that you cant mine from other mission sites also asteroids should have various valued ore not based off its name an example of this would be that 2 rocks of veldspar are being mined one will yield 20 units of regular veldspar as well as 2 units of concentrated veldspar and 13 units of dense veldspar the other will yield 3 units of regular veldspar 10 units of concentrated veldspar and 40 units of dense veldspar but without a survey scanner the miner couldnt tell which rock was betterthis does a couple of things1 it puts miners in the middle of the field and more difficult to warp out if in danger but increased risk for increased reward the safer areas are filled with lesser valued ore 2 possibly the use of jet canning mining with more agile cruisers with orca support tractoring the cans in3 increases asteroid scanner use to find the better rocks to mine or for higher fleet efficiency a scout scan and tag rocksplanetary rings should became mineable with maybe 4 belts to mine in around them depending on the size of the planet they should also generally be smaller rocks with the larger rock formations in place of the normal asteroid beltsi think this will help make mining more tactical and overall funner to do pilots can still mine the old way but they dont get the increased reward from doing a bit more workcuss and discuss
if rocks didnt pop so quickly i would be all for this but if i have t2 mining lazers and rocks are popping ever 2 to 3 cycles on my 6 hulk accounts i am going to kill a baby seal this is why ice mining is really nice they dont pop nearly as often so by focus firing on a couple of ice roids i wont have to constantly fly around to get to them after i pop a couple in a small area
plenty of windows such as editing members  titles  even your bookmarks people and places screensall these windows have data to the right but no horizontal scroll bar and you have to keep making the window bigger to get to the dataplease add horizontal scroll bars
shouldnt be a terribly hard feature to add to carbonui if it isnt already there then its just a matter of making the ui designers use it

just want to toss in thisjust like a cyno can not be activated in a pos shield self destruct should not be allowed to be activated and when entering will be cancelled in a pos force fieldthe main reason for this is unknown space invaders successfully defeat an inhabitant only to watch as one of the main reasons for the attack is just self destructed over and over leaving nothing to be looted a change like i said above would encourage more reasons to pew pew in unknown space
signedi was of the view loot should drop but reading on the matter and further thought has lead me to believe self destruct should destroy loot  but also insurance should be voided if i called my insurance company and said id blown up my car they would tell me too  offas for killmails these should defiantly be generated sd is used to prevent loss mails and this is flawed

can you give an example please
im presuming he means when you move out and cannot take your ships with you this could be overcome by destroying it with an alt and not posting the kms but its boringno insurance payout for self destructing ships if they have aggression would seem to solve that issuecenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
cloak means cloaknot probe me to find me
how is doing nothing griefing
funny i never noticed that bit even using cloakig to gather intel and spy doesnt qualify as griefing its just proper use of game mechanicszubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
the fact is that ccp loses allot of subscriptions because of thatit doesnt matter you take a system and have the sov of it some ships can enter it and stays cloaked for days while you are unable to do anything  fighting back mining rating anything  while this is happening all industrial players stop playing they wont put their hulks in the field to get ganked so the game become boring for them and as this happens frequently and there is nothing that can be done they stop playing the price of minerals rise the price of all ships and modules rise it get more difficult to replace a ship and then we get less pew pew this way cooling down the game reducing its effective funabout the sand box im not a carebeer i lived on whspace i took down some pos and territories i mined on hisec nullsec and lowsec i did all forms of pi exploration wh hisec processing nullsec low sec i already participated on roamings on lowsec also cloaked roaming also i can fly all sorts of cloaked ships including industrial and t3 also i usually do recon operations and scout operations probing the way for known space navigation and wormhole navigation also i had produced for t1 t2 t3 and capital market so everyone have a different experience playing eve and my fun in this game is to explore all aspects of the game what i can say is that the game is not only pvp it needs an industrial base and everyone have its role this is a sandboxso im just saying a way to fight cloaked ships is good not to me nor to you but to the game new pos system new sov system
how is sitting cloaked in a system full of people to kill griefingit seems like a good way to shut down a alliance to me to hamper your efforts and isk making timeits your own fault that they are there in the first place with your failed system security and if your too scared to go about your normal buiss while they are there then whos fault is thatno no buff to nullsec carebears
afk cloaking and hot drops give so little risk to the attacker for how effective it is it needs a nerfi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
fixd stop the evemail spam
there is no point in cloaked ships if they can be scanned downeither advocate for the removal of cloaks entirely or stop whining
ccp will lose a lot of subscriptions as well as credibility if they implement any of your horrible ideas on cloaking
1 i absolutely agree with the direction this conversation is taking i am completely in favor of more ships and i agree ccp didnt model every possible variation of every t3 ship they just made the handful of componentsone of the things that i think s
i hesitate to suggest all penalties are bad without a rebalance of hmls they are already too powerfull imojavelin hams and rockets are simply not used would be nice for closerange missiles to get some nice longrange to compete better with hmls and other wepon systems

if anything is to be added in terms of more systems for wh space i would say high class more difficult whs c7 c8 and c9maybe even c10 moongoo should stay in 0 sec in my opinion if moongoo were to exist in whs it would make them to money richmoreso then they are now if moongoo is to come it should be the low value stuff if we are to make sleeper sites more difficult i would say remove this idiotic spawn based on what ship is killed and put it on a random timer add more shipsmake it require more people make escalations more random in terms of numbers and what shows up ccp invented pve dreads by creating escalationspvp mechanics dont need an overhaul in wh space but wh games are irritatingbouncing in and out of whs to avoid deathannoyingice should come to wh space no reason for it not to at this point argue all you want about it making it too easy to live permanantly in wh spaceit already is and isnt going to change
1 i cant really say2 pos mechanics are seriously broken anyway but thats partly a topic for part 33 yes the original pos mechanics were never meant for corpsalliances to share towers but that is a necessary part of wh life staging towers joint ops etal4 no thatd provide too much incentive for 00 sovholders to invade wspace en masse5 no the problem is that most corps and alliances refuse to farm their wspace statics for sites beats me as to why one idea would be to give c1s and c3s a second static always wspace in the same vein as c2 space6 were doing quite nicely right now have you looked at nanoribbon prices lately one thing thatd be nice is to have some other consumer of sleeper salvage than t3 ship production7 if wh pvp mechanics were to be adjusted itd be hs holes thatd get the changes as you mentioned wspace  non hs is fine8 no wh warfare is the last place where small gangs still matter keep the largescale warfare in kspace please9 c2s and up are not bad but c1 wormholes are too difficult to close safely without the hic trick they also take a while to pop which is rather aggravating especially considering that they still pose a significant security threat with the rise of t3logi doctrines also hulkscovetors dont fit into c1s but thats a problem with the covetor hull not c1 whs11 weve already done all our interbuspopping and it is a bit of a pain but better than offline tower disposal besides this is the only time we ever have to do it
1 is there enough wh systems if not what class needs moreare they under or overpopulatedmost systems seem to have poss in them but are generally low on player activity there needs to be more incentive for people to log their wormhole chars aside from the daily pi rounds maybe have c4  c6 sites spawn a small number of easier anomalies in addition to their regular more difficult ones 2 are pos mechanics enabling to many people to just clean out weak systems and not bother with harder targetsdont understand the question3 should access and roles be reworked doubttfull i will be alone on that onehell yes4 should moons be mineable for goowaits for the hate from thatno i like my wh to be nullsec powerbloc free5 should sleeper sites and other sites spawn rates be raised to foster larger corpalliance growthid love it but i dont see a real reason to as u can just cycle your static wh6 should site iskrewards be lowered or raisedno we need more t3 hulls subsystems requiring differnent materials so sleeper salvage prices go up7 do wh pvp mechanics need an overhaul many things come to mind here need to pop those carebears that jump back to hsi like it the way it is8it was stated by ccp long ago that whs were not meant for long term habitation since they lost that bet should they now look at making them more viable for larger numbers to encourage larger scale wh system warfare and not just the russians taking out weak systems for funi live in wspace for the small scale encounters c5s and c6s already allow for larger scale fights i dont really see a need for anything bigger 9 are wh masses and spawn times what they should beseem fine to me i would like more random wormholes to occur  right now u see nonstatic wormholes occur every so often but always the same type it would add some dynamics if nonstatics could end up anywhere instead of what u see occuring now10 do you think i am pissing in the wind here to think ccp cares about wh dwellers and our corpsalliancesccp cares as much for us as any other paying subscriber the problem is we make up only 5 of the playerbase this needs to improve11 how are the pi changes affecting your corp are you too small that it is taking weeks just to blow up interbus should they just remove interbus in whs all togetherwe got rid of them within a week it was a pain in the arse and hella boring but 0 tax is nice
would be nice for us small scale alliances to be able to carve out a piece of 00 without having to suck up to the power blocks funny thing is who knows when some would come around to find they dont have a pos in a certain system anymore because they were too lazy to watch iti really would like this change
yeah and when they do find that which will likley be whenever a logistics guy comes to empty a silo or something youll get 50 titans dropped on you and lose everythingwell that or when dotlan says sov has dropped either way youll be stamped out in no time at all
that is kind of the entire point of there being a timergoing off on a tangent here id love it if the pos timers worked the same way as outposts or pocos so you wouldnt have to deal with all the alt nonsense at all
stop posting its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
could you he more specific to the topic or is this one of those im a goon so look at me posts
allow meyour idea is bad dont post any more
and the tears of those who rely on automated systems flow alreadyare you going to give a real reply or continue to herp derp it
as it exists currently the role of dreadnoughts is to hammer stationary targets and capital ships into oblivion the heavy guns and launchers that fit on dreadnoughts along with the siege modules have solidified their intended use as pos bashers i respect this role however i do find it artificially restrictive i would like to see these vessels useful for more than just as a 15 billion isk battering rami would like to propose a few changes be made to make dreadnoughts viable for fleet engagements and pveadd high slots to the dreadnoughts right now dreads have at the most 5 high slots despite their size and cost they cannot fit as many high slot modules as battleships or destroyers 8 dreads should have at least 8 slots and i would argue moreraise number of turret and launcher hardpoints currently the most any dreadnought can fit is 4 weapon modules the amarr and gallente dreads can only fit 3 this restriction is in place to keep the number of very big weapons that can be equipped under control but i suggest that this is the wrong way of achieving that end control over how many ultra heavy weapons can be fitted should come from the cpu and powergrid usage see below not from arbitrationraise the cpu demand of extra large turrets and citadel missile launchers as stated above the cpu requirements on extra large weapon systems is quite low up to this point cpu usage has been a formality when it comes to dreadnoughts as none of them is capable of fitting more guns than the cpu can handle raising the cpu demand for these modules will give ccp a more organic way to control how many can be fitted at a given time proportional boost to the dreadnoughts cpu as ive stated in the two previous bullet points the true bottleneck of the ships capabilities is the cpu dreads have a massive powergrid but have in some cases less cpu than battleships raising the cpu of dreadnoughts will allow the cpu demand of the extra large weapons to grow this would maintain the destructive potential of siege fitted dreads while allowing for alternative fitting schemesboost the scan resolution this is almost a side issue but i would like to submit this suggestion nonetheless there is no reason why a 15 billion isk ship capable of holding 7 different targets simultaneously should have a sub par sensor systemthese changes would achieve the following more high slots would give a dread pilot the option of equipping more logistical modules remote repair energy transfer arrays energy destabilizers scan probe launchers tractor beams etc right now there is only one viable way to use the high slots in any of the dreads maximum number of extra large weapons  siege module more hardpoints would give the flexibility to load batteries of smaller weapon modules instead of a few gigantic ones changes in the cpu demand of extra large weapon systems would maintain the current power balance and prevent too many of them being loaded on without significant tradeoffs being made the boost to the ships cpu will be proportional to the increase in demand which means that none of the dreadnoughts in the game currently will need to change their fits the added versatility would cause an increase in dreadnoughts deployed in fleet operations and consequently an increase in dread kills they would become lumbering strategic elements and would define the theater and the fleets they were in currently the carrier is the only capital class fleet combat vessel changing the dreadnoughts in the ways ive suggested will make them an alternative capital class ship for fleet operationsi am eager to hear your feedback
you are aware that ccp took away the ability for dreadnoughts to field drones in a bid to limit their versatility and force them to rely on smaller ships for support right
that is exactly what their intended role was supposed to be however supercarriers and titans are still simply superior in every aspect at this role dreads would be much more useful and used if they had some unique ability which couldnt be replaced by supercaps
and there was teh important word in there pve dreadnaughts what a terribad thought
they should only make them better at what theyre supposed to do killing pos stuff and other caps
alas the dreadnaught is changing away from what youre looking for so i doubt it will reverse course nowperhaps another capital class ship might emerge that would fill a role very different from the orbitalbombarding dreadnaughts  qolde
i think dreads not need  weapon slot just need  damage bonus in siege modeand maybe other solution against scs  1 high slot and  one bonus in siege mode increase energy pulse weapon range smartbomb 15 or 20dread lvl
dreads were introduced as structure bashing ships there is no good reason to change that its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
id like to see the dreadnaughts tracking and accuracy go up a little so that it would be a viable tactic to jump them into a fight and let them shoot at battleshipsi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
ccp wont do that because they dont want to create pve dreads thats was why they nerfed moros drone damages
this thread has changed to addressing possible solutions to the issue the prevalence of tracking titans in the game which in itself is only a symptom of several root causes mainly the proliferation of massive numbers of sub capital fleets for the most part sub capitals in this discussion pertain to battleship dps the unwillingness of alliances to risk supercaps for whatever reason  the lack of skilled supercap pilots compared to capital ready pilots the lack of dynamic and diverse ship types and tactics or ability to add a rock to the rockpaperscissors philosophythe changes in crucible were a good start however the changes reinforced the limited use of specific ships for specific reasons1 dreads do not have the trackingexp velocity in order to hit moving capital ships effectively and do not have a significant tank to counter supercarriers effectively2 carriers have shifted to a complete logistical role and are glorified haulers3 the futility of capitals against supers has led to the use of subcapital fleets where even a capital fleet would be more effectiveso as a result of supercapital fleets once again taking the stage supercapital alliances have adapted to engage these with highly effective tracking titanshow do we stop this without nerfing that which has already been nerfed the ship itself is not a problem nor are the mods its not imbalanced but it still has that sort of effectso to fix this there needs to be a way to make tracking titans unwise to field under capital dps a tracking titan will fall much faster as a lot of its tank is used to hit smaller targets how can we use this problem to encourage capital warfarefor the purpose of discussion the following classes are representedsupcapitals battleships or battleship heavy fleet composition with typical logistic and light supportcapitals dreads and battletriage fitted carrierssupercapitals titans supercarriersoriginal postso it should at least be addressed on here and not in passing comments the concept of tracking titans for those that dont know sacrificing tank for tracking mods to the point in which the titan can essentially alpha any subcapital shipthis became much more common once the dd was nerfed to affect only capitals proposal as such do not completely prevent the ability to hit subcaps as that only blocks the symptom and not the problem but to nerf the effectiveness either in the radsec value or in its ability to hit objects with a subcap size sig radiusexampleslink 1firsthand account dictor falls to titanoh look a videomael killi could point out more and more examples frigates ceptors dictors all able to be blapped by titansthere are several issues regarding this1 yaays analysis and there are good responses regarding tracking itself 2 it is now not uncommon to see 50 60 even 70 titans dropped on a fleet it is no secret that the proliferation of supercapitals has outgrown what ccp projected it may be time to consider mass limitations for cyno beacons or even mobile cyno beacon jammers i understand it opens up many other issues but its worth looking ati feel this is an urgent issue ccp is already discussing destructible stations what would be the point of owning a station if a fleet of supers can drop it in a matter of minutes
what really needs to be done is make them easier to kill and harder to keep alive my original suggestion still stands on thistitans do not warp away on log out the titan stays on the field wherever it was when the pilot logged out of the game plain as dayeasy target if not protected by a pos this makes the locations of every titan in the game obvious other alliances then can form up and destroy them wars will be started solely for this reason if you want a titan then your alliance or corp will need to help you defend it and keep it alive even when you arent online titans would be used less often and probably used more for defense in the deepest parts of alliance territory
i used to think this however it opens all sorts of problemswith the new aggro mechanics though logging out isnt as great a tactic but it shouldnt be so easy to log out with no aggression but that brings in issues about dcs etc its a tricksy problemhow about make the tracking on xl guns slightly better but make them so that tracking enhancerscomuters and remote tracking enhancers just dont work on them this should potentially mean a titan can shoot a subcap that is stopped a very slow moving bs or a fast for caps moving capitalpossibly make their scan res worse so it takes a loooong time to lock a subcap toono one wants supers nerfed out of use but no amount of titans on the field should be able to beat a lrag efleet of subcaps unless they have a good support fleet
the issue with tracking titans is in numbers actually a single tracking titan as you described is actually not a threat to a subcapital ship as pulling sufficient angular for sigres to kick in and reduce the titans volley to a manageable level is not hard the problem occurs when you have dozens of them on the field which means somebody is going to have 0 or near0 angular to you and is going to be able to blap you increasing the sigres or decreasing the tracking of capital turrets isnt going to fix this by the way
quoterico minalihow about make the tracking on xl guns slightly better but make them so that tracking enhancerscomuters and remote tracking enhancers just dont work on them this should potentially mean a titan can shoot a subcap that is stopped a very slow moving bs or a fast for caps moving capitalquoteremote tracking was removed with cruciblei have not tested this but i believe tds as part of ewar will not work against titans either due ti their ew immunitythe issue isnt the titan youre orbiting it cant track you usually the problem is the other titan 50km away can
ill tell you the fix for proliferation of supers make them ridiculously immensely expensive to manufacture
that was ccps original prediction that they would be so expensive that there would only be 34 of them in the gameoops
exactly there are only two ways that i see of tackling this issue reengineer the turret damage formula so that signature resolution is applied separately from tracking this would be an extremely invasive change to core eve combat mechanics and would require a full expansion cycle or more to test on singularity before going live fix the proliferation of supercaps somehow that way people wouldnt be dropping bunches of titans on your head
posting in a hobo driven nerf the super rich thread
this guys idea is awesome and spot on
glad at least someone thinks it isoh wai
i would love to be able to repeat the cosmos missions i only farmed them for the faction boost but some of the rewards were pretty good especially the level 4 onesi would like to see a change to the storyline modules though the specs are nice as they favor lower fitting requiremnts rather than higher stats but most of them are bpcs which require rare components to make the modules are just not good enough to justify the added cost of those rare components either remove the rare components from the manufacturing requirments or just give the components as a reward rather than bpcs some of those components i would definitely keep and use if i got them or would build them if they just needed normal minerals but they are not worth the effort to hunt down the extra components and manufacture them they are just not that good maybe if the bpcs could make 810 runs so i could sell the modules and make a little extra profit
honestly i dont care if it gets any new shinies by going to dx 10 or 11 i just want it so i can use my amd dual graphics which doesnt work on dx9
what sli and crossfire works in dx9 if you are wonderingurl
correct but amd dual graphics which is part of the a series apus does not

well it has nothing to do like the achievements u mentioned so i deleted the word achievement from the main post because i see people dont get it i already mentioned u dont get any popus or any kind of certificates that shows that u did it on a certain date so u can link it around what i ment about achievement its more of a personal satisfaction and about the item relic u got which u can collect or sell those relics i could compare it like a drop of a rare officer module that module u can also show off or sell these exploration missions appart from relics would yield some useful module too why not drop also officer modules would be lot longer farm but let say some officer modules d be guaranteedin other words its exploration missions or treasure huntingso i ll just delte the word achievement but its the same thing i am speaking about from now on let just call it exploration missionand about capital balance i do understand few things here and there dont u worry dddanother thing i noticed is that there is no slaping for my first 2 proposals sports and strategical targets i want to see what are people thinking about it
you forgot first solo t2 ship kill

eve sports this made me lol if you want to run big frig brawls just do it theres no need for ccp to be involved at allstrategic targets this would do nothing but make the strong alliances stronger thats it its definitely not something neededexploration missions these are called expeditions all youre suggesting is to add in a worthless treasure that doesnt do anything meaning itd be worth about 100 isk and would mean nothing at allcapital balance as drake said dont try to comment on stuff when you really know nothing whatsoever about the topic
sounds awesomewould be even more awesome if the ships in the bay had a chance to fall out as loot when the transport explodes
i personally have no qualms with this idea imagine the chaos that would ensue
that was part of my original concept for it and i dont see why it shouldnt carry on to the proposal here not just the chaos domu imagine the tearsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
pretty good idea really no downsides if they make the bay unejectable no slots are needed really just make it a brother of the freighter
this is a great idea as long as  you cannot eject ships1
seems a sensible well thought out idea god knows those are rare enough here so ill support it 1
youd think with forcefield bras we could show more with the same level of support even so there would still be movement
sadly i would have to demand that only gallente toons get see through bras being keen on showing skin as opposed to amarr who believe it a sincaldari would be the only race that would have pimps as they could afford itminmatar just have plain sex slavesamarr chicks would just have to cover up or repent
i like where this is goingforce field brasnicewont happenbut one can dream

well again you cant exploit it this way to exploit it you will use empty platinum insured t1 ships since the insurance is subtracted from the payout you wont be able to reduce your bounty significantly you will loose lots of money to get rid of the bounty if you do it its fine actually it still hurts the bad guy at the end of the day if you dont exploit normal case insurance subtraction does not matter at all since your ship fitting is in the calculation it is so insignificant that it doesnt matter and as soon you go expensive those are the interesting scenarious for bounty hunters platinium payouts decrease even more faction ships t2 t3someone added samples to the discussion take a look at those
thanks for the support so far
scan sites eliminate 100 of belt rat botsalso force mining bots to reset  rescan all the timeits a winwin imho1
1this really needs a look at what are we still doing with a game mechanic that should have been changed when capitals was introducedif some ideas are needed make a new emp module that fries the circuits of the ship and cancels the self destruct modu
which runs into the problem of  you get aggressed in a shippod away from a gate the attacker decides to just hold you there in place for an hour or two selfdestruction is a legitimate way of saying screw you im not going to play your game now if you want to make it that you cant self destruct if you have an active outbound 15minute aggression timer then maybe but i would put the timer at more like 5minutes before you can start the selfdestruct timer with the larger ships having timers up to 57 minutes long which would definitively end combat at most 1012 minutes after the victim decides to check out
than make the pod an exception so yea if you are in a ship they can hold you until you eject or shot you but in pod you can self destruct as normal problem solved
personally id rather not just be held in space until i eject from my ship because my wouldbekiller wants a new t3 extending timers to a sensible length fine getting rid of them completely is just asking for it to be abused although i do want a new t3centeri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
if youre self destructing and youre aggressed produce killmail if the self destruct mechanism is activated when your ship goes pop be it through the self destruct timer or the other guy shooting you dead no insurance payoutfight it out like a man or get pussywhipped like the pussy you are
ship marooned without probes due to crashing accident or enemy trickery comes to mindnot sure that kind of situation represents a very real effect compared to the much more common use of this mechanic in wormspace  ie torching ones own hardware to keep ones lossboard clean when one is losing a battle generation of mails only for sd while under 15min combat timer seems reasonable to me
im sorry but holding someone in place would amount to harassment this is against the eula and therefore although irritating whilst occurring would result in a possible banthis should be enough to stop people from holding people for ever
lol pl calling it griefself destruct is intended to deny you loot and km if youre mad its working as intended
oh really
goose99 repeating himself over and over since 2010please for the love of chribba try coming up with a coherent argument for or against this proposal then post it then apply this strategy to every single other thread you ever post incenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
the idea of probing a cloaked ship kind of defeats the purpose of a cloak i do think there needs to be a counter to the cloaked system setters but i dont think ccp should break it like that maybe something to the effect of while active the cloaked ship wont regenerate cap and the cloak it self takes 2 of your max cap every 60 seconds this will give 50 minutes of cloaked time if you cloak with 100 cap 50 minutes is more then enough time to find a noob in a hulk and stop the annoyance of people that cloak warp to a safe align to nothing and go to bed to the whole loosing players thing theres 500 systems in this game and 1000s of ways to play get the f over it
noread the 5 million threads before this one as to why not
im going to copypaste this from the previous threadheres whatll happenthe cloakers will whine about how nullsec is safe and how afk cloaking is a counter to thatthen wormholers will come in and whine about how it breaks wormholesthen theyll suggest either no local delayed local or removing cloaked ships from localthen ill point out how that completely breaks the riskreward ratio of current nullsecthen some arguing back and forthll ensue with lots of namecallingthen nothing will come of itthere i just saved you maggots 15 pages of drivel
this is where you go wrongwhat kind of risk involved is there now virtually none that is why we have an alt and bot infestation well above any past proportions its also why we have less actors in 00 politics and more useless fronts whole corporations or alliances devoted to seed spies hold iskalts and usurp newer or more casual players for tax than ever its the ease of controlling it thanks to poor mechanics  and with this thread the op suggest we give that passive afkempire gameplay more tools i understand its a paradox that afkcloakers counteract afkempires but thats how the cookie crumbles the best way to deal with afkcloakers is to nerf afkempires and encourage griefingwhen was the last time you took a loss in an anomaly or static from invading skirmishers that has never happened you say do you think the reason for that is that you are truly so awesome or because there is simply such little risk involveddont presume that 00 lack rewards just because the vast majority of those rewards go toward rmt or stockpiling supers instead of grunt populace
ok in regards to the post by profundus fossurai think that you need to clarify on your positiondo you feel that it is not possible for ccp to create such a system that is in balance with the existing ship balancesor do you have something against the idea in its current formatbecause basically after reading your post several times i can only come to the idea that you are one of those guys who fears change or opportunitybalance has been my sticking point from the beginning of this post so any system must have a balance mechanic to it so that the more you make a ship excel in a certain area there are negative elements that crop up in counter to itthings like making a ship really fast would make it more fragile strengthening targeting systems would increase signature and reduce cap recharge stuff like thatmy biggest point is that i would like any system to be on even footing with existing ships so you can create ships which are compairable to existing ships by no means do i support any system ment to allow super shipsi think that so long as the contracting shows the base stats of the ship being contracted it should be alright to use the existing contractsbut as far as the scamming thing i cant imagine that many scammers would be willing to invest billions of isk to create a ship to try and sell for the sole purpose of scamming peopleas far as the market implications i would say that leaving it tangled would be ok because it basically means people would have to figure out how and where to market their shipsyou might be able to make a unique ship but then you have to market it and distribute it this further makes the existing ships possibly more attractive because they are much more readily availablein regards to the market things should be stacked in the favor of the existing established shipson top of that if ccp sees a ship design that they like they can make minor changes and have one of the existing npc corps either purchase the design from the creator or even pirate said design into future released ships
i agree that the javelin rockets hams and torps need their ship velocity penalties removed with turret based long range ammo such as scorch and barrage you sacrifice tracking for increased range which generally this tracking penalty is offset because of the nature of turrets being able to track better the farther away the target is so not much of a penalty there given the nature of the close range missile launchers they have poor explosion velocityradius they fixed rocketsafter how many years of people asking and dont even benefit from one of the skills to increase one of these i can load scorch and offset my tracking penalty with my level 5 tracking skill and use range to get better hits whilst close range missiles dont even have these two options to migitate any penalties
confirming that a navy baddon would be epic1are you saying that the faction navy doesnt use  have tier 3 ships come on this makes sense and you know itthey should introduce navy tier 1  2 bc before the tier 3 though as the balancing issue still needs to be addressed

are there enough wh systems i really could not say i certianly have seen an awful lot of populated systems in my sphere of experience i wonder if that means that there needs to be more if pressed for an answer i would say that there should be more wspace systemsshould moons be mineable for goo im torn i want the logic to be consistent but i also want to keep big alliances and corporations out of wspace if moon goo means i can expect a flood of russians every few days ill gladly passsleeper sites and other site spawn rates seems about right one idea would be to have the occasional site spawn from the adjacent class for instance if you live in a c2 wh you could get a c3 plex every now and then and visa versa this would give the occasional big challenge or slaughter if you get a spawn from a lower class the rate seems about okay site iskrewards be lowered or raised im happy with things the way they are it seems about right i proposed that sleeper structures drop things some time ago and i think this could be a way to milk a little more juice out of a site but for the most part i think it is a balanceit was stated by ccp long ago that whs were not meant for long term habitation i do not care what they intended they should get used to us living hereare wh masses and spawn times what they should be i never thought too much about this until you askbut i did think that the occasional super wormhole could open up with an immense mass allowance that would be an occasional wild card that could be funhow are the pi changes affecting your corp i totally stopped doing any pi whatsoever which is sad because i enjoyed managing it before their changes
only twice and you have to plan it ahead to not end up on the wrong side of wh  so no  its not bad mechanic its actually beeter than normal gates in many waysi guess since they plan on making null more selfsufficent they could make wh too but they will not probably  as they ccp said long ago  wh are not for long time living in them1 yes its enough2 needs total overhaul3 same as for pos4 yes and no  i dont want normal moon goo in wh i would like to see some new type of material from it that would require player interaction something in terms of pi and destructible by small sized gang  material in turn could be used to produce new types of t3s5 would love to get more sites in our system but that works against main idea of wh still im all for it6 if more sites than should be lowered7 no8 if they finally decided that whs are used like the players wanted them and started working on making them more habitable im all in9  yes and yes10 i hope not 11 its okread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
some solid responses so far and keep em coming most people seem to be fairly happy but with wanting minor changesa few changes i would like to see are site spawn rates dependent on your inhabiting numbers so if your a small corp of a few in a c1 you wont have unlimited sites to farm but if you have a a medium size in a c2 or 3 you will have a constant spawn enough to farm or am i wrong and should the spawn rates be the same to thus force people to farm and explore staticssomeone made the suggestion that you should get random anomalies from other class whs a great idea to test people with a bit harder contentperhaps your right moon goo may be going to far and then forcing major blobs into habitation of holes that i think are already over populated with 520man corps i also like the idea that the other salvage becomes useful as at current only blue loot and ribbons matteri guess i made this post because i do feel there is not enough holes definitely not enough empty holes to entice more people to search for new homes and i see a lot of silent habitation from people that only do pi and leave all else to waste and i wondered why many more people are not interested in living in them and the barriers that do stop them for taking that leap
there are definitely enough wormhole systems many many wormhole systems lie empty and the vast majority of settled systems are occupied by only a handful of pilots there is room to spare currently and more people should move in wormspace economics currently work well to support both casual iskmaking and hardcore carebear lifestyles for dwellers therein moons should not be minable for goo  currently to make isk in wormspace one must venture outside the pos and risk getting shot moongoo mining would eliminate thatpos mechanics are dreadfully in need of an overhaul especially in the area of roles granularity not sure if thats what you meant by pos mechanics

just ran some cosmos agents a few weeks ago and it was awfuli have a notebook page full of notes and scribbles of who ive seen and finished and whose end item goes to the next agent ecti can only imagine what a pain it would be for the new players going through the same thing1
i would like to propose a few ideas for new types of wormhole for those that could benefit from it here is a quick explanation of the terms im using max stable time the maximum amount of time a wormhole will stay open max stable mass the maximum amount of mass a wormhole can transit before collapsing mass regeneration the amount of mass a wormhole regenerates per cycle 24 hours maximum jump mass the maximum amount of mass that can transit a wormhole in one go proposal 1 narrow and deep max stable time 12 hours max stable mass unlimited mass regeneration 0 maximum jump mass 15000000 kgthe narrow and deep wormhole would be too small for battleships battlecruisers cruisers destroyers shuttles industrials frigates etc the mass allowance will let the lighter of each races transport ships through but not the heavier versions impel bustard occator or mastadon the limiting factor here is time not mass proposal 2 fat and shallow max stable time 24 hours max stable mass 800000000 kg mass regeneration 0 maximum jump mass unlimitedthe fat and shallow wormhole allows gigantic ships to move about but will collapse after relatively small amount of mass goes through it with this hole a ship of literally any mass can travel through to the other side a capital class ship likely collapsing the wormhole as it goes any capital class ship will collapse this hole on the first jumpthere are no doubt other variants that we could imagine ill leave at these two to start off with if there is interest we could come up with more
noyou are obviously trying to introduce a class of wormholes that would allow supercapitals into wormhole space would make it far too easy to make anybodys home system into an impenetrable fortress
well think about that how do you imagine that would work exactlyi think it would be rare for that to happen but i see your point what about a limit at 12 billion kg with that limit only ships that could feasibly be built in the wormhole already would be let in or out does that address the concern
i think i just tossed my cookies reading this ideatldr   no stop the evemail spam
a 12 billion limit would remove the ability for supercaps but it would also counter the entire idea for that wormhole this workaround makes it sound like youre trying to get capitals into your c14 without having to build them inside as for rarity even at a slow rate it wouldnt be difficult for a larger c56 corp to slowly fill their systems with supercaps whilst any potential invaders will be forced to line their capitals up for the slaughterthe only thing i can suggest is to scrap the idea youre trying to fix something that isnt broken
i wonder what it is about wh space that makes people come up with the most terrible ideas imaginable
supercap wormhole shenanigans aside i also worry about that other oneelimination of the total mass stat on that narrow and deep hole would suck most of the fun out of a wormhole one of the best things about wormspace is if one does not like the level of content one is getting from ones neighboring systems one can quickly rectify that with a battleship or three and roll some new possibilities having control over system connectivity is the bread and butter of wormspace that most distinguishes it from regular nullsec yes even more than the lack of local imo
i assure you this proposal is not being submitted for my personal benefit as far as holes big enough for capitals to fit in i would just point out that c140s c248s c391s d792s and like 13 other wormholes have a billion kg or above max jump mass by my count there are 14 wormhole types that have a greater max jump mass than what i propose do you object to these if not whyis there a class you take on how to talk but contribute nothing or is it just the way you live your lifeit would be a wild card no doubt i cant say that i really relish the idea of one of these things opening up to my hole to be honest not being able to stop the flow of cruisers into your system could really turn out to be a total mess but i thought it was a new variation on existing wormholes but besides occasionally removing some control from wh settlers where does it break down
why exactly is such a change needed i am all for variety but i see no reason to do this other than for variety i dont see any reason why not to allow supercaps into wh spacethey will only be used for ratting ultimately anywayperhaps a little defense but how often does that happenif you let supercaps in then make the escalations caused by super caps rediculously hard 24 battleships warp in when the subcap arrivesawesome
oh this is totally for variety there is no real problem im trying to fix i was just throwing the idea out there to see what the feedback was
they could just make them untargetable or undamageable there were a number of missions i used to run in hisec where some structures could be destroyed while others simply took no damage from anything it is doable
are you going to tell me why you want scouts to kill themselves checking every pos in a region is not fun by anyones standards
if you actually live in the area this wont be an issue
making poss and holding sov more of an onerous chore  another amazing revitalizer to nullsecalso ban npc forum alts from csm forums
define actually live for me pleasei live in 00 i dont make a point of flying to every pos in every system every day why would anyone do that
if your in the areasystems that has such structures you and your alliancecorp will be aware of nonfriendly activities by you actually being there you will know if an sbu is dropped because you will physically see the timer if your several regions away and only holding some space no where near you then no you will not see the timer because you dont live there people who operateare around a pos will know if something is being attacked because they will physically be in the same system and know bad guys are up to somethingit is not terrible at all if in fact you actually reside in the area of the space your thinking from the perspective of someone that cant possible run all over the place checking things to make sure everything is good i can understand that either get more people to actually reside in those places that are too fartoo much work for just you or shed some of that extra fatagain if you actually live inaround a system your worried about you wont have an issue because you will know if a pos is being attacked or your space is contested do you really think entities should be holding onto space they dont live in own a pos they only visit once a month to empty a silo that is five regions away

i dont like the idea of intended anything in eve in the case of the dreadnought why have any slots at all why not just say that it comes prefitted with the weapons and modules and rigs that they intend you to use on it they dont do that because they know it would be a giant middle finger to those of us who like to tweak and customize and play in the sandbox yet they make the ship so unusable in any other capacity that they might as well have had them standardized ive said it before and i never mean it to sound as harsh as it comes off but i dont care what their intent was i have no interest in fitting into ccps little box in my estimation they do best to just let the pieces fall where they may and let emergence take over appeal to tradition doesnt hold water for me youre right though if i want a combat ship i should bypass the dreadnought and go for the carrier like everyone else my proposal was to make combat on the capital class level less funneled by adding in more options is a pve dreadnought any more offensive than a pve carrier if yes why the siege module actually i can imagine that being broken in a pve situation come to think of it
destroyers were not introduced as salvage ships yet they fulfill that role excellently would you agree if rules were put in place to change thatthe game designers have an intent when they create a module or a ship but once the player base gets a hold of it i think it is fair game to be used however we see fit if the thing is overpowered then fine change it but doing so just because people arent doing what you want is micromanagement
hadnt thought of thatwell the tracking boost could take effect while only in siege mode anyone who goes into siege while ratting just deserves to get jumped by a random roam i cant count how many ratting carriers we have caught because they align slower than our scout can scan down and warp to the sanctum in the system imagine if you caught some random dread halfway through a siege cycle in a haven with 230 left before they could warp offi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
ive been thinking of a way to try and tempt people into fielding dreads in a fight and i really like the idea of them having more gunsmore guns  more dps  better chance at killing something before it diesi also dont mind a few more hp scan res and the other things youve listed but really the primary thing i think would pick up their use is if they actually had 8 weapon points in their high slots so they become a huge bs or maybe 7 and the siege module but they really need something to make them stand out and be desirable because right now even with the siege mod buff theyre just not desirable at all
the concern i hear about pve ratting really seems to be a nonissue to me for the reason you just stated a dread is a big slow target for pvpers yes exactly what i was thinking
i think 8 slots is a hardcoded limitation its not only in fitting but part of the whole ui itselfso what can we have tier one dread 1 weapon missile or turret 1 highslot for each one can fit siege no drones its a cannontier 2 dread the capital battleship juggernaught 8 highslots cannot siege limited drone bay 5 sentries caldari  5 torp flight time and 5 explosion velocity bonus per level86308 turretsbaysgallente  5 hybrid tracking and 5 damage bonus per level84580 turretsbaysminmatar  5 to falloff and 5 tracking per level hey look all turret no missile85480 turretsbaysamarr  5 to range and 5 reduced capicitor use of turrets per level83680 turretsbayscombine this with capital ewar able to affect even supers and buffed scan res and i believe these will be viable and used with carrier logistic support
such a horrible idea you obviously know nothing about capitals youve suggested multiple completely rediculous ideas learn about things before you try and propose changes
i cant tell if youre trolling or just stupid
much like your so called expertise on whsgood motivesbut your reasoning for dreadnaughts are fruaght with inmaturity and utter horrorleave this to the experts pleaseim in favor of improving dreadnaughtsbut your lack of forthought in many areas leaves me very unsetteledthe pve comment alone made me facepalm so hard i broke my glassesruns to nex store to get new pair of shades stop the evemail spam
was thinking the same about you
1 for you good siri am however in favor of adding a second dread per xtovers recommendations that would be more sensible for actual pvp combat granted the old dread will probably no longer get any use as the creating a more expensive version didnt wo
was thinking the same about your toons faceheed not the trolls of cap haters for they are space poor hobos that deserve to die in the cold i say expand the capital hulls give us t2 dreads that swallow supers whole and t1 cap guns or t1 hulls that chew through sub cap blobsbalance between supers and sub caps will not be obtained by nerfing the bigger ships we must instead nerf the smaller ones while expanding the larger ones
i wouldnt go so far to say nerfing sub caps is necessary i think instead caps just need to be adjusted calling for both nerfs and buffs on various points sub caps seem to have everything balanced nicelyas the old adage goes if it aint broke dont fix it
you know i just figured out something obvious that i should have seen all along instead of trying to take the dread and make a bunch of changes to it why not just add new extra large weapons for the launchers this would be gigantic heavy missile arrays that fire streams of missiles the damage could be the same as 2 or 3 heavy missile launchers and there could even be a variant for assault missiles or maybe even rocketsfor guns there could be point defense artillery of a few varieties batteries of large or medium gunsthis would essentially accomplish the same goal as adding more slots but it would be a lot easier to get implemented
supercaps should be useless vs subcaps
said this many timesadd the same tracking and explosion velocity penalty dreads receive while in siege mode just add the following to the long list of bonuses titans gettracking speed bonus 50 explosion velocity bonus 60 do that and see how things go for a month or two
totally ok with this on the condition that sub caps are useless against supercapsfair is fair right my titan cant hit you but you are no more of a problem to my titan than a dust motethis argument is cyclical and stupid you want your sub caps able to destroy supers yet not be hurt by them where as the super pilots are totally ok with being able to be killed by you as long as they can kill you toothey even sacrafice their whole tank to do so a tanked titan cant hit anything at all sometimes they even miss supercarriers their tracking is so badbut the whiney crew wants it all one way they want to be able to kill a super and never face any actual danger from it themselves they want everybody to play the game their way and field massive support fleets to do anything in the game at all this is called a one sided argumentif you want to kill my titan i dont mind you trying but every asset you put on the field against it should be able to be killed by it as that is fair and balancedits also hilariously funny that aaa sat on the undock of 46dp for 2 weeks with tracking titans using them to great effect against ra and their vassals and yet the second the strategy is employed against them they have threads going up to cry about it
the problem is that it leads to numbers escalation and it doesnt compare as the hp jump is exponentially more than from a lower ship class to anotherfor example its hard for bs guns to take out an inty yet an inty alone cant break the tank of a bs however 10 ceptors can easily take out a bshow many to take out 1 tracking titan how much hp oh you have it tackled it can two shot the hic lastly grath if you take a moment to see i even used aaa as an example of this problem lets try to keep politics out of this
it occurs to me that a minmaxed tracking titan fleet would be very vulnerable to a properly tanked super fleet i believe that you can however refit your ship off of carriers if things get risky i understand however there is a limited number of hostiles who can be around to prevent you reship but i understand the number increases depending on the number of friendly carriers to the point where a properly supported super fleet can dynamically refit in combat no matter how many hostiles are realistically around perhaps if this was tweaked flying supers would be more risky as you would risk being caught with your pants down in a blap fit i may be wrong or ignorant however however if they could not refit while aggressed or something similar then exposing them untanked would be more risky knowing a enemy fleet is misfit to fight you is going to only increase the supercap deterrent of the enemy older more experience alliances are naturally going to have more of these super weapons which kind of sucks for me however every little helpsthe flipside is how tracking mechanics work with sig radius which can potentially be reworked obviously that would be a massive rebalance and would be a major change to mechanics but could be interesting if effort was put into itobviously with how titans bump each other when going through a cyno is both a blessing and a curse in that one can be bumped away from their fleet quite easily at random but it also always means that they are sufficiently spread out they can blap thingswe tend to be very cautious to welp things in eve as it is though and the repeated nerfs arent exactly going to cause more titans to be lost because the people who fly them are lead by people who tend to be good at eve and know exactly their limits when using their titans most of that time that means not using them however as the risk is too high and the rewards are relatively low compared to the relative losses
how does one properly tank against clouds of holy handgrenades aka ddd spam youd need to outblob the titan blob significantly to have any hope of pulling that one offccp has lost its way when it comes to supercapitals partly due to the other misguided decision of making everything null an ehp grind  they managed to railroad themselves into making supers massive dps boats instead of the fleet support ships they were at the time of launchquoting self from test server forumthat will serve until ccp finds their mojomarbles and start innovating again they need to cook up a null system that does not simulate quarry work with players spending hours chipping away at great big rocks  after that both supers can be made into proper terrors of the sky again as any opness will be balanced by the areas in which they will be of use
fully tanked titans have died to less than 40 bsits the willingness to engage them that is lacking a tracking fit titan has less hp than most supercarriers if another group were to actually commit their supers to a cloud of tracking titans theyd all be dead but people are so incredibly risk averse theyd rather see the offending ship nerfed than put their own assets put on the line to help curb the issueif you have a problem with tracking fit titans in your area and you start dropping fully tanked super groups on them you wont have that problem for long but therein lies the problem its on you to fix it whereas most of you would rather see the game changed so you didnt have to risk your own assetsthe idea that one type of ship should be able to hurt space ships but another type shouldnt is just laughably absurdif pls tracking titans or ras tracking titans or raidens trackign titans or the 60 cfc tracking titans are bothering you you can stop them at any time you want because weather you believe it or not morale is a huge factor in eve and when you start killing off titans their pilots who are their friends stop logging in for fear of their assets or they refit to tank fitsagain im all for sub caps being immune to supercaps in warfare but as a trade supercaps should be totally immune to anything sub caps can do in warfare including bubbles guns bombs drones what have you the only thing that should be able to fight titans under the utopian ideals presented in this thread are1 dreads2 carriers3 supercarriers4 titansif you want your maelstroms and your abbadons safe from the titans then i want your maelstrom to be like a pebble on the road to my 18 wheelermaybe you should start asking ccp for more weapons to kill titans with instead of asking for another nerf more things blowing up is better than less
actually i think the problem has more to do with how incredibly overpowering supers and titans are compared to other cap shipsbasically every cta i have seen where we know we are going up against titans someone asks hey should we bring our dreads or carriers to shoot at the titans to which the answer is usually no because they have a gun that can one shot your regular capitol ships even if we outnumber them 5 to 1 they can still wipe out 20 of our alliances cap assets in 2 mouse clicks per titan pilot and this is in the first 10 seconds before the fight really gets started and then they have so many hit points that well probably only take out one of them before they chew through our fleetso then your side decides not to bring in their caps and you have to go in subcaps only and get wiped by a swam of carriers supers and titanshonestly i think supers and titans should just be moderately beefier and more expensive versions of their regular capitol scale counterparts and i know thats kind of unfair to the people who have already paid bazillions of isk to get in their supers and titansi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
and herein lies the problemfear of losing prevents them from bringing an asset that would actually amount to a dead titan and at the same time they tell their own members lies to hide their cowardiceeach titan can only dd once every 10 minutes and turrent guns arent any more or less damaging really than sieged dread guns are so they wouldnt lose 20 of their fleet unless they jumped in 30 dreads against 30 titans the outcome would actually be very bad for the titan itselfthe base level problem is that the decision makers for most alliances are literally cowards and the idea of losing internet space ships bothers themget over that and youll start to see titans dying to alliances besides mine
my 2 isk supers should be logistical beastsa titan should have the same impact on the battlefield that fighting on a station does pretty much the exact same impact give them station guns and the doomsday and let people dock to themclone to themhave personal hangars in themsuper carriers should go back to being motherships with clone bays and a huge sma so that they can deploy a full fleet replacing titan bridges for deployment of fleets give them alot more hp than they had before bigger fighter bays and a reasonable drone baynot endless clouds of sentries and ogres make fbs only able to target structures and supers so they retain their antistruture role in sov warfare but reduce their overall footprint in an ongoing battle by reducing their ability to endlessly functionbefore they were nerfed
my alliance alone has over 100 titans in it how would you sort this out we just suddenly ended up with 100 mobile stations
everybody who advocated the principle of rock paper scissors is overlooking 1 important elementin terms of the current sub caps online advantage over supers  caps the game is actually rock  paper only there is no middle ground between caps and supers vs sub capscapitals need to be boosted and expanded in terms of hulls and roles to give more value to the mid sized ships between subs and supers 1 capitals should be usefull against both supers and sub caps alike  structures 2 supers should be useful against supers and caps and structures useless against sub caps3 sub caps should be useful against subcaps caps and structures useless against supersnerfing supers into wtf defense only paper tank mobiles with no tracking or dps vs sub caps is not the solutionthe problem with sub caps online at present regarding hulls is as follows1 sub caps currently have 18 odd t1 hulls with t2 and t3 variants per faction not counting faction hulls2 caps only has 2 t1 hulls per faction with no t2t3 or faction variants3 supers only have 2 t1 hulls with no t2t3 or variants with 1 super faction variant in existenceso your looking at a situation where sub caps as of this post have72 t1 subcap hulls46 t2 sub cap hulls4 t3 sub cap hulls faction variant t1 hulls for sub cap ships across the boardcapital hulls have8 t1 hulls0 t2 hulls0 t3 hulls0 faction vairantssuper caps have8 t1 hulls0 t2 hulls0 t3 hulls1 sc faction hullso solve this easily by clearly defining the roles in terms of ship size category as indicated earlier and expand on the capital hulls the more deadlier caps are against supers and sub caps and the more useless sub caps become vs supers without supers being able to kill sub caps the better for all of us
and this is totally acceptable only the sub cap guys dont want this they want to kill the supers with absolute immunity from themi hope ccp read this because this is exactly how it should ideally flow
indeedsub cap hobos demand the ability to spamblob supers with really cheap small ships and expect to gank them without hassle or risk because they are space poor and space manythen they demand that supers cannot save themselves with logoffskies which in the bigger picture should be fine but then sub caps like say cyno alts who loggofski should suffer the same fatethen they cry when supers and cap pilots do the blobbing thing because they are space rich and demand an end be put to that which is not fine imoand then ccp listens to them when mittens and his pets throw a big enough tantrumsad
grath can correct me if im wrong but the majority of titansuperkills kills due to pandemic legion in the last year has not been to straight up super fights but catching them while moving ratting or doing other dumb things you need to understand that when you are fighting anything unless completely outnumbered that you are going to have casualties unfortunately the stakes are so high for supers it is always going to be really hard to know what you can handle and what will essentially destroy your alliance the very presence of supers logging in will send most alliances running my alliance has been on the short end of the stick in the last few weeks being blocked by the raiden titan blob in their time zone from a enemy with many times our numbers of titans grath probably has accurate numbers psyduck which isnt really surprising this is why eve has diplomacy and a unironic tendency to gang up on giant empires the fall of the nc for example however it would also be fair to say that just over a year ago my alliance was bumbling around in lowsec with a membership who were literally little more then rifters today we are essentially the lords of fountain which has been very good to us we still have obligations to our allies and need them so much but it hasnt prevented us having space in fact most sov in eve is owned by alliances like mine and even if we dont suckle on tech like the super powers it hasnt exactly stopped us a titan can withstand massive quantities of dds its barely a scratch for them it is a big problem for normal capitals however but you should be fielding your own supers if you are trying to fight a field of supers if you lose a bunch of dreads and carriers but kill a single titan you are still going to be ahead what i would like to see would be a lot more granularity to capitals currently you have dps in dreads logi in carriers and dps in supercaps and titans which if you compare to subcaps is pathetic eve at its most basic mechanics simply encourages blobbing and large decisive battles it essentially comes down to who has the correctly tanked fleet comp with the correctly set up bonuses and the correct numbers as well as enough logistics to keep them alive and enough support to keep them tackled and your own capitals clear the nc lost one of these battles losing 7 titans and a couple of supercaps to manage to kill 2 titans and a couple of supers itd be fair to say that super fits dont vary much outside of some very simply fitting decisions and the confidence of the alliance fielding them i would personally love to see things like capital ewar capital tackle and etc of course there arent enough large fights for this to be a big issue in that while the mechanics for all of them are the same they are insanely rare fielding a titan is straight up too much risk unless you can be confident that noone will mess with you
even an untanked tracking titan has more than enough ehp to tank 40 bs long enough to refit to a traditional tanking fit i never called for a nerf i would rather see an effective counter i posted this thread to bring the topic up for discussion perhaps giving an infinipoint to supercarriers might be a start maybe a blood carrier with a bonus to neuts there are other options than just swinging a nerfbat even in the extremely unlikely scenario of a pair of unsupported tracking titans how many hics would one have to burn through before those 40 bs could take one out 10 15 meanwhile those 40 bs are being 2 shotted the titans with a skilled pilot rigs and implants has a good enough tank to be able to hold out long enough for either reinforcements or a refit theres a reason for this unwillingness in that not every alliance has any sort of significant supercap fleet to counter this if you segregated capitalnoncapital engagements it would create two different classes of warfare and destroy a good part of the game i think its a terrible idea a titan should have the ability to scratch a subcapital the amount of damage that it scratches for is up for debate i love the thought of capital escalation on a personal level nothing irritates me more when its denied but out of my hands most of the time but the downside is that there is an inevitable snowball effect unless the capital ship classes become more diverse
i wouldnt overgeneralize this too muchonly the sub cap guys dont want thisthats a logical fallacy and i personally believe that many would be against this there are some issues about it though dreads dont have enough ehp to stand up to supercarrierstaking subcaps out of the equation a fleet of 5 titans and 5 supercarriers can easily hold against 20 dreads with 10 support one might think hey thats fine its the difference between being a super capital and a regular capital well at this point you lose option 1 that you agree toremove rr capibility from supercarriers add in infinipoint diversify capital fittings allow capital ewar to affect supers the t2 siege and triage are a great start just as you desire to see a supercapital engagement there are thousands of capital pilots looking to dust off thier dreads to fit their carriers for something other than hauling rigged shipseditwhat i am trying to say is that when you have 3 classes of shipssubcapitalcapitalsupercapitalwhat is the accepted force multiplier
so funny you should mention thisi was moving my titan and i got caught literally in vol in curse but a dictor now at range i can hit a dictor no big deal when tracking fit but if they know what theyre doing i have no hope at alli had to sit there while this frickin pair of dictors held me tackled and wait while another guy burned the 14 jumps to save me the whole time these 2 guys were screaming in local about the titan they had tackledif the pilot actually knows how to fly his dictor and i dont catch him out at range i literally have no hope of killing him with the removal of our drone baysthe same goes generally for battleships you cant just sit there like a deer in the headlights blasting away at a titan youll get killed you have to manage things like transversional and range properly on the titanwill you lose some sure but the whole idea of combat in eve without losses is absurd and thats what people want they want a clean kill on a titan where nobody dies because they dont like their kb efficiency trashed or they dont think losses are worth itwe lost about 20 billion in ships in a fight the other day we achieved our objectives but it was bloody as hell and it was amazingly fun losses happen alliances need to accept this and plan around taking losses
no not really i only lose it if you refuse to face the loss of some of your subcaps but your goal in the dreads shouldnt ever be a clean kill because the dreads are insurable the supers arentbut your example is bad its suicide why would you expect to engage 10 supers with 30 lesser ships would you engage 10 cruisers with 30 frigatesi doubt it because it would be suicidenow if you had i had 5 titans and 5 supers and i had 30 dreads and 10 support yes i would go for that my goal is to simply kill a super my dreads are all insured so im going to bridge in or jump in next to what i think im most likely to kill bubble it siege green and ride it till the wheels fall off and yes on jump in im going to lose 5 dreads ill probably lose a 6th dread in about 1 minute a 7th a minute after that to turrent titans assuming i havent bumped them all out of range on jump in but in that one minute im going to put enough hurt on a super to kill it and then start moving to another by the end the supers would need to leave the field but theyd be short one maybe 2 supers and the next time their fc calls a form up with morale lower theyre probably not going to get as many memberswhat you want is a bloodless victory you wont ever get that nor should you a fight should leave scarsedit looking at the numbers 20 dreads on jump in losing 5 to the titans and after 1 minute the first to the supers youd still actually easily kill a nyx so i might actually try that jihad move to kill one
i missed that fight and im still kicking myself for iti already said this a dictor pilot can orbit and hold a titan as long as he has bubbles throw in a second titan and it completely changesyou can mantain transversal with a close orbit and easily beat the tracking of a titan however when you have two in a pair you will not only lose transversal simply put twice in relation to the other titans guns but will have 0 angular velocity at those points too you will get away with it maybe once or twice until those guns hit just right  kb efficiency many i know obsess over it but this is a game i fly dictors a lot the sabre is a blast to fly the most fun i think i can have in a ship and i die quite a bit but when i burn to a kiting fleet and catch them going down in a blaze of glory as they die trapped in my bubble i have more fun than any lackey mashing f1 but that being said losses are fine as long as the outcome wasnt an exercise in futility
for a clean triple post i guess superstitans are only a problem if losses are unacceptable and your ability to fight them is limited to how aggressive youre willing to be about killinghunting them during opsif you want to kill them you absolutely can but you will absolutely get a bloody nose while knocking them down and to me thats how things should bepls current fondest wish is a huge supercap brawl as weve demonstrated over and over again by shamis constantly jumping us into meat grinders in our supers we save all our tech money for the eventual fight we know is coming where well suffer some pretty severe losseswe want this fight like the losses and all and eventually well get it likely at the end of a russian gun barrel since they literally have no fear but weve planned this fight with the idea that well suffer catastrophic losses during the fight this is how you should always plan things plan for the worst work for the best
well let me tell you about the gypsy dictors that held 30 pl titans trapped for 30 minutes forcing us to constantly bring our tengu fleet in for another thrashing to try and clear tacklea good dictor pilot hics are dumb is literally the most terrifying thing to a tracking titan
im at work so i cant and  math anyway do the figuring on this but would 20 dreads even have enough dps to not only kill a supercarrier but be able to overcome the tank of 4 crars on the primary target 15 if you take out the dd ones then at least 2 dreads per minute due to titan guns and fbs
thats a problem between leadership and the gruntsmany itch to use thier capssupers but are told not to and after a while they get tired of pos spinning and leave the alliances to end up in pl its a sad catch22 i just sold my super instead i got tired of looking at it in a force field
yea pretty easy a sieged moros can currently do about 11kdps so you would decimate a nyx with that much dps cap reps be damned
i agree with this sentiment except for the removal of sc rr that is yet more fail as it would result in a role nerf it would be like removing guns from battleships i would have no reservations of having a t2 super carrier geared towards dps or tank without rr but the t1 scs should stay as they arebut thank you for starting to see the other side of this issuenow if we just take it a little further as they are now t1 capitals are pretty useless against supers this is why i would like to see ccp introduce t2 dreads and t2 carriers geared up towards providing enough ehp and dps to stand up against supers on their own i even think capital ewar should be introduced as the only means of holding down supers while sub cap ewar could hold down capsintroduce new weapon modules for t1 dreads and new fighter drones for t1 carriers that would make them sub cap killers or at least more effective vs subcap ships than they are nowin so doing we could start seeing subcapcapsuper ratios along the lines of 531 instead of the current 20000520 situation srsly show me an image of a rl carrier escort group that has 20 battleships 15 battlecruisers 10 cruisers 5 destroyers and a few frigates guarding a single carrier at most carriers are escorted by 14 sub capital shipstoo much rr on carriers spam falconstoo much dps on dreads in siege damp em
i dont understand this fear of losing ships especially capitals they are t1 shipsinsure them hell i just barely got into dreadshavent even flown mine yet but i cant wait to take it out and sooner or later lose it i will keep it insured even if it takes me 2 years to lose itwhy because with that insurance i can pretty much turn around and buy another i lost my first carrier a month ago in a wh engagementit was  awesome it was also uninsureddid i cry hell noi am in wh spaceill make that money for another in no time point ispeople shouldnt be afraid to lose ships this is why i respect pandemic legion for what they are they go full boar  you in the face with their fleets and arent afraid to risk losing ships to win the fight if everybody fought like this eve would be a better place
introducing a capital energy neut web damp painter disruptor infinipoint would change the capital game quite a bit being able to td and damp a tracking titan would encourage more supers and other caps on the fieldthink of a blood carrier instead requires amarr and minmatar carrier to iii not t2 but takes a lot of skilling and give it a webneut bonus i would fly one no matter the cost it might even make the levi worth flying again
indeedand it would drive up the prices of minerals more capitalsuper cap losses under the right circumstances mind you will result in a higher demand for more minerals to replace them
why do people assume its a fear of losing shipsit has nothing to do with losing ships although that was an aspect grath was talking about but mostly unrelated to the topic i take that back as its an alliances desire not to risk shiny ships theres a difference between not wanting to lose your fleet bs and losing your super i can understand the fear of losing a super if someone is dirt poor then again the adage dont fly what you cant afford to lose has been lost somewhereim rambling but my point is that this topic isnt about omg tracking titans cause too many losses and we dont want to drop them with supers tracking titans is just the surface of a lack of fleshing out when it comes to capitals and maybe some needed buffsnew modules
this is actually a pretty boss idea and id like to highlight it faction caps that had ewar bonuses that only effected supercapsso a gurista caps that could jamdark blood caps that got webserpentis that got damp bonusesangels that got tp bonusessanshas that got td bonuses and all of those would work on supers
the point im trying to make is that non tracking fit titans are much less of a threat to sub caps and if people are willing to engage titans they wont be tracking fit theyll be tank fit for fear of dying so if you give people more tools to use against supers you dont need to nerf things you need to add other thingsbuff things so that people want to engage titans then the tracking problem works itself out
grath i am curious to hear your opinion on suggestions for spool up timers on cynos and mass limitations
i completely agree
mass limitations im not a fan of but spool up timers im a 100 behind  i think they would add a dynamic to the game thats missing from cap ship combatits far to easy to move as it is right now the fact that a pl fleet can cross all of eve in under 9 minutes is pretty sick and it also makes jumping into and out of combat ridiculously easy spool up timers would make commitment much more of a done deal when engaging in caps and supers and it would make running a much harder prospect
cyno spooling is fail imo its the exact same mechanic as limiting the amount of sub caps that can jump on a gate and there are many a ghetto baiting corp with gangs who would rage quit if we even entertained that ideainfact i say allow supers to jump without cynos introduce a new skill like jumpdrive pinpointing and add a new super cap only module for low or mid slots that would allow fitted supers to jump without cynosbut im probably amongst the 5 of big ship pilots amogst the 95 of small ship eve players who would love to see thatmass limitations should stay where they were introduced with whs
trying to apply the psychology of fleet warfare to super capitals is good and all but it still doesnt change the fact that titans are a flawed ship that where added into the game because ccp though it would be kewllike other people have said there are different ways of going about it the most up front way of dealing with them is just to nerf their damage ability not the most elegant way of going about it but it would get the job done like it or notadding in capital ewar mods or giving the eaf the ability to get around the supercaps ewar immunity overall is one of the more fascinating ideas and is something that should be looked intooverall though i do believe even if you could use ewar against supercaps an up front nerf would still be needed against the titan either some kind of tracking locking or ehp nerf
holy mother of god you just made half of pl get wood this would be so awesome but would compound the problem so much you would need to introduce this with jump spooling or it would be so over powered that your worst nightmares cant possibly come close to what the reality would bei do like the idea with spooling though it would be pretty sweet actually but how you figured where you land in system would be pretty odd i thinkdude their hp literally just got nerfed by 20 thats pretty damn heavy the constant nerfing is getting old expand the game instead of contracting it for once
grath if you ever come down to the dc area im buying you a drinkupdating the initial posttitle to reflect whats been brought up so far bear with me a sec
i live in baltimore we have a pl meet in the general area once a year
one of you guys brought it uplol
if nonpl are welcome i hope to come
yea we had a black legion guy there last year well just call you spy all night while we get plastered
so far ideas that have come across did i miss any1 capital ewar modules that work against capitals and supercapitals possibly not against subcapitals nos neut td damp web scram equiv to focused2 faction capitals with specific ewar bonuses guristas jam blood neut andor web serpentis damp angel tp give the revanant a td bonus3 cyno spool timer or mass limits4 removing cynos and allowing unfocused jumps what drawback5 either adding a tier 2 dread with the ability to track out of siege or boosting a current dreads tracking6 possible boost to dread ehpall of these seem to encourage capital use at least in my eyes i really would like to see fleets of dreads and carriers returning and throwing themselves at supers even if you lost 10 dreads or carriers to a single super it is still an even battle
it pains me to say this but what needs to be reviewed is the tracking formula in general sig radius should play a far larger role in it like it does in the missile formulathat not only balances tracking titans think about it you never see rigor leviathans do you but lots of other situations involving smaller shipswhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
theres another thread about boosting the combat effectiveness of dreads i suggest in that one that we add more turrents to dreads to up their dps considerably more than doubling the current outputi think that would go a long way to helping dreads back onto the field of battlemy suggestion was either 8 and a siege mod making them have the most high slots in eve or 7 weapon points and a siegelet me show you my 7 torp launching phoenix or my 7 blaster morosactually you might be shocked at what a rigor fit levi is capable of we went over this when deciding what to do with our levis who now carry both torp and cruise launchers cruise to deal with support ships torps to deal actual damage to structurescapssupersi mean the cdfe rigs arent really that needed since you have the strongest tank of the titans already edit also rigor fit levis can fit a full tank they have no need to drop tank for damage and while their damage isnt quite as strong against sub caps the power of the boosted cruise against a webbedpainted target is staggering
id like to see thread as bumping the number of weapons on a dread would drastically improve its desirability 3 launchers out of siege just isnt enoughdid the range of citadel torps get bumped i remember switching to cruise back in apoc and never looked back because torps couldnt reach large towers
no clue but they can definitely hit towers now pretty easy in fact having daddy doos levi on the field makes doing pos shoots so much easierdread thread
you are right they are surprisingly effective on paper at least but id say they are far more balanced than gun titans they have no way to lower transversal so they can never apply more than 3050 of their paper dpswhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
reading now there is a good argument against pve dreadsthen again from my perspective that just means jucier targets in anoms
exactly carriers already pve and you dont see people bitching about that so instead now pilots have a choice with the pve caps v0vi am also a fan of the boosting the dread or coming out with a t2 variant that would be able to do far more damage to supers out of siege instead of relying on siege the problem still remains that unless you specifically tank it a capital can not survive a titan dd which is what discourages a lot of pilots from fly caps against titans i am one of the few with the mindset that is willing to go and sacrifice 20 dreads or so to go up against a titan fleet i would be interested to get over on sisi to figure out how many dreads it would take to kill a tracking titan vs a tank titan and how quickly the titan can kill a dread both in and how of siege remote rep carriers when out of siege just hope that ccp can take a look at thisand i am with grath where if you could jump without cyno that would be absolutely dirty and most cap pilots would love it but we would then be back around to cyno spool times and what not i feel cyno spool up times are valid as it would require a support fleet to be on the field before supers jump in keep the cyno ship alive as it stands right now i do not think anyone is fast enough to kill a cyno ship before 3 to 4 supers jump through at which point unless you have a massive fleet on the other side they wouldnt have jumped unless they are crazy i like the ideas though so far and yes i have super pilotseditop i am interested to hear what your ideas are for a mobile cyno jammer however module ship ect ect
even with dd and even with 10 titans 40 dreads still  1 titanso if you can have 30 gunboat dreads and they all die 40 before initial dd it was an even fightstrange but thats isk war vov
fully support however untargetted with limited range 20km or soalso need to make sure that its not carried on every grunts utility highslot
so you would still allow a cyno to warp 100km off you and cyno in the enemy fleet just trying to understand what your intentions are for the moduleand the titan math makes sense to me but that still assuming 40 dreads can punch through a titans armor without all being blown up also this is assuming there are no remote repsagain i would like to try it on sisi as you can crunch all the numbers you want it still could have a change on the battlefield
triagedsieged capitals indeed cannot survive a titan dd without some real bizarre fitting mojo however a pantheon archon can achieve the necessary ehp without any fitting changes just heat the correct specific hardener with slaves you may even be able to tank a dd on armor alonemy question why are alliances still so seemingly reliant on archaic capital doctrine when fielding fullscale cap fleets are pantheon techniques really considered that exotic by the nullsec world is there some giant flashing red sign that says only train 1 races carrier is it that everyone and their dog wants a nyx and a station hangar full of thanatoses youd expect to be hearing stories of largescale pantheon archon fleets on a routine basis considering their scalable rrcaptransfer ability would make them ideal as far as carriers go for keeping supers on the field and would save sc high slots for things like smartbombs and neuts too

i have trained both caldari and amarr for dreads and carriersobviously not maxed outlots of work to do still point being is to be prepared for either the need for shield or armor but heyyou cant force it down a persons throat
because if theyre 100km out they can also be off grid makes no difference however it does prevent any random hotdrop ganks it can prevent planned escalation throwing a wrench into any plan leads to fun and can maybe protect your ass one daymaybe give it a 99 reduction for black ops ships
this is false in the case of sieged dreads even a lightly tanked dread can easily survive a single dd
i would rather see it applied to grid or a larger range then 20km you would not cyno tracking titans right on top of the enemy fleet so you would still be at the mercy of the as they could cyno at their optimal and still cause problems granted that is just my opinion and either way would still be a cool concept at only 20km though i dont see it working that well
im no more than a neoliberal super cap hoe i am to pleasewith regards to mobile cyno jammingi proposed a t2 dread a while ago a spin on star wars interdiction class star destroyersa capital interdictor would have a party piece hislot module that would create a drag bubble for jump drives 12 ly across from the system the ship is located in if the module is activated all ships jumping over or within range of this gravity well would get pulled into the interdictors system and spawn within 14km or so from the ship as if jumping through a star gateanother side effect would be a visible bubble 1 or 2 au across that would prevent cynos from being activatedthis ship would not prevent normal warping at all leaving pointing down to sub cap interdictors but it would completely kill jump drive or hot dropping capabilitygod do i wish for a world where the surprise capital hotdrop sex gangs ends up jumping into a prison sex gang bang they were not expecting or jumping to at all

hi guys ive just taken over our corp as ceo but dont have ceos access or control of anything is there a kooldown before your can do anything or is it a bug
why make 4 different racial versions of basically the same shipjust make it an ore ship1
because it is designed as a tier 2 freighteri am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
there are multiple reason you would not have a single ore ship rp reason of the nonempire factions the ore is the least likely to be using one of these for hauling entire ships around  they already have a ship for that this task would likely fall to the interbus interbus maintains careful neutrality and would not be caught dead ferrying anything that could be considered militaristic ie warships this is what makes imperial shipment cbd corporation transstellar shipping and freedom extension stay in business practical rp reason an ore variant of the ship would have the highest amount of hp in shields amarr and gallente would make their own versions that would be more suited for being supported by oneires guardians thanates or archons practical reason many pilots have already trained one racial industrial to v for the use of blockade runners deep space transports or freighters this ship is designed to be useful not only from the perspective of industrial pilots but also from the point of combat pilots that are changing base
thats one ship i would definitively like to see

supported but i seem to think that ccp has this thing about well i dont want to say wasting players time but more so towards extending play time to allow as few things as possible to happen in a certain period of timeitd be awesome to have a template manager similar but enhanced to the current fittings section have your layout stored locally only  doesnt need to be server stored allow importexport for either external application use or just backup purposeswith the two toons i have doing pi most of the planets are made exactly the same as i just buy the p0 items and have the planets grind the mats for a couple of days each gobut since this whole poco thing itd probably just be cheaper now to go and just buy what i want and give up on pi honestly i havent extracted anything from a planet since pocos were introduced
i can see where profundus is coming from and he has a valid point even if balanced youre not going to be able to look at say a nightwraith on dscan and have any idea of what the heck it is youre facing player intelligencegathering tools would need to be enhanced somewhat in advance of an implentation of this idea so people can actually have ways of figuring out just what that scarylooking nightwraith is going to do also puts a lot more burden on fcs with enough wildcards floating around to strongly dilute the value of intelligence in general its not an unworkable idea by any means but it would fundamentally alter the nature of the metagame after enough time every ship you face will essentially be custombuilt to a specific niche and you wont see much if any or the interesting sort of unusual and surprising ship fittingusage thing that makes up so much of eve lore thats a pretty big tradeoff a big chunk of the metagame will be lost forever the versatility and appear of a vast array of customizable playerdesigned ships is a major plus but may or may not be worth the cost
1 speed penalties on missiles is too gimping sig or cap reduction i can understand but turning some of the most sluggish ships in the game in to even bigger slow boats is a little much

you know i actually disagree with you here to start off with im not exactly sure how you measure the inhabiting numbers to be used as a variable in calculating spawn rates do you calculate alts if so could people with multiple accounts inflate the inhabitant size and get more sites for their small corpadd into this that in my opinion wormholes arent for big corps theyre for gangs and squads and small groups once you get to a population size where the plexes get run too fast and the isk split is pretty meager it is time to consider pulling up stakes and moving into a higher class wormhole sure its not easy but if you have the firepower and the numbers it is the next logical stepi think its easier to keep the spawn rate based off of the wormhole class and let the rest sort itself out if the pond gets too small its because youre a big fish

overall 08 for this proposaljust my thoughts i only skimmed if ccp were to give another itemid as mentioned for the bpc then allow for merging bpc runs together so long they have the same mepe values would pretty much solve the problem this would save having several t2 bpcs kicking around since most of them never have a range outside of 44 to 44the only trick for ccp would be to have a sql transaction happen thatd look for a currently defined bpc create a new itemid with the old bpc settings then delete the old bpc i know there are millions of bpcs out there and doing something like this would be seriously io intensive the other thing that could be done is instead of doing bulk transactions like this would be to not make any more bpcs the existing way just create the items the new way it might cause some ui grief as to why two seemingly similar bpcs wont merge but thatd be just a small thing until all the old bpcs are consumed
limit all ter3 bc to use short range turrets only  at this point they are undefeatable at sniping at 150k and moving at 2500ms no cruiser can ever get near them in one piecealso is becoming the only ship to use in fleets and we all left the bs docked in stationthe ter3 bc is suppose to be a bs killer dog fighter bc with good tracing and speed and signature radius for defense
your doing it wrong kidquote from some random movie or other stop the evemailUFFFDspam
probes are hard its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
to be fair probes dont do jack if the target is moving 2ks best case scenario puts you at 20km range which is pretty much uselessthey are bcs they currently sport bs lock range  adjust their lock range to bc levels and some harsher sacrifices will have to be made for them to function at the extreme ranges allowed by their guns
this is my favorite gatecamping shipthat screams fitting sacrifices does it not its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
they have no tank cant you just snipe them right back
i have been doing the killing with them tre3UFFFDs by the time the bsUFFFDs lock a target we already kill 2 of the bs i only like to express my concern that very soon you only see ter3 bc on fleets and station campingUFFFDs and gates and no need for warp disruptors also 
and thus tornados will be ac fitted and short range winmatar wins
are pulses with scorch considered short range too heh its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
epic troll is epic or terrible idea is terribleand while were at it lets just make sleeper sites respawn instantly in the same system and allow sov
it temporarily disables one of the core attractions of wormspaceim also not in favor of a new special wormhole that turns on local chat for 24 hours or a new special wormhole that turns sleepers into regular kspace rats for 24 hours this new special wormhole that generates a stargate for 24 hours would be in the same categoryits not a new feature its a removal of an existing feature
certianty i can hardly make any proposals about wormholes without a cluster of comments about how wormholes are supposed to be unpredictable and mysterious in a lot of ways i agree with the notion that wormholes are the lawless frontier where the unexpected is the norm although i live in one so i have a vested interest in them not being total chaosi understand the impulse to keep a handle on ideas like this so that the mysterious doesnt make wspace unlivable i think you and i share that motivation but keep in mind that wormhole settlers arent farmers were pioneers neither am i which is why im not suggesting either of these ideas
not a bad idea and the proposed line of thinking saves ammunition on shooting things that dont drop i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
ill support this as a low priority idea as written since from both an rp and player perspective it is useful if not ideal from a developer point of view
imagine taking 4x 425mm prototype gauss guns welding them together along with independent internal tracking computers and housing that in an extra large turret casing with high speed tracking servos the powergrid and cpu demands for this module would be on par with other extra large modulesas youd expect i used the 425mm prototype gauss gun as a benchmark for brevity ill use 425pgg instead of writing it all out ill explain my thinkingthe capacity ammo is huge with 10 m3 it can hold 100 large hybrid rounds they are 01 m3 each the size of this ammo bay is the same as other extra large turrets it just uses smaller roundsthe volume is identical to the volume of the other extra large hybrid turretsthe mass is identical to the volume of the other extra large hybrid turrets mass for some of these modules dont make any sense when you really look at them so this is just a throwaway numberthe reload time is 10 seconds this is considerably longer than any of the other extra large turrets they reload in 5 seconds i figured that it is appropriate for the number of rounds it holds at 10 seconds it takes as long to reload this as it would to reload a scan probe launcherthe activation cost is 50 gj per cycle each cycle represents 1 of the 4 guns in the battery discharging while it shoots the equivalent of a 425pgg round it uses almost 3 times as much capacitor as a single 425pgg does this is because the module maintains a sustained ignition charge rather than the spikes that 425pggs use the activation cost works out to be slightly more than the other extra large guns per secondthe structure hitpoints are identical to the structure hitpoints of the other extra large hybrid turretsthe accuracy falloff is identical to the 425pggthe tracking speed is 0005 radssec slower than a 425pgg i justify this by considering most of the considerable bulk of this module is comprised of actuators and alignment drives the combined volume of 4x 425pggs is 80 m3 which leaves 3920 m3 of additional targeting computers motors and fire control the slightly lower tracking speed is a modest disadvantage over 4 individual 425pggsthe rate of fire is 3 seconds i got this value by looking at the rate of fire of a single 425pgg dividing it by 4 2375 seconds and then rounding up this battery fires one of the 4x 425pggs every 3 seconds cycling back through to the first in 12 seconds this rate of fire is actually 20 slower than 4 single 425pggsthe damage modifier is identical to the damage modifier of a 425pggthe optimal range is identical to the optimal range of a 425pggthe signature resolution is identical to the signature resolution of 425pggsconsidering the high slot restrictions that ive been proposing workarounds for in this thread modules of this type would solve all of the problems without necessitating elaborate changes these modules would only be fittable onto dreadnoughts and dont even begin to compare with the destructive capabilities of their extra large siege weapons they would trade raw damage for tracking speed and would allow dreadnoughts the ability to engage cruiser and battleship sized craft

a moros had before drone nerf 1500 dps with 5 ogre2over 1000 dps with sentry drones thats why ccp nerfed i know because i have dread 5 and i did missions with a navy apoc  a dread moros assist with sentry drones in low sec6 blocade mission with these ships was completed within 48 minutes that was over 150mhour iskmaybe do you talking about second dread drone nerf when they lost their all drones
eve combat on the funscale read smallscale has evolved into a tracking competition with just about all participants able to operate effectively in the 25km bracket which was the pulse lasers only redeeming featurenow is the perfect time to introduce the third pulses which have been missing for as long as i can remember and bring laser selection up to par with hybrids and projectilesadd gatling variants to medium and large weapon categories
me ive found a lot of the unbroken salvage from exploration sites
i stand corrected then just ran the calculations for a fairly average rev fit23mil against explosive to 285mil against emon the other hand its not the dreads that are the major issue theyre just dps albeit quite a bit of it losing carriers is a bigger issue due to the loss of the rr and cap transfer they supply to the rest of the fleet and your typical triage archon is far squishier ehpwise than the rev above despite having quite a bit more active tank to work with this is where pantheon carriers need to step in and fill the gap and willing pilots who dont get all butthurt over carrier lossmails too although it seems that those are hard to come by although pantheon carriers do seem to blow up less often than their triage counterparts i wonder why
i like people in the past have claimed that courier contracts are the solution to shipping rigged ships via freighter that argument is flawed as you cannot issue a contract to yourself
disallowing ejection is a good move but make sure theres a way for the ships to be deposited at a poswhat price point would you see for this ship between orca and freighter on par with orca
to be honest i see it as just over the cost of a freighter its intended i believe at the moment to be a tier 2 freighter same ratio as the dominix vs the megathron etc and would be priced as such
and yes it would be able to change out the contents of its hold at a posdomu you are correct in your line of thinking in reference to it being a tier 2 freighter so yes it should be just above the price of the existing freightersi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
over the past few days ive been getting inspiration for a proposal for sovereignty 20 from all the ideas ive put into this onemight start penning it down
i would implement name changes like this name changes cost 10000000 isk or some appropriate fee name changes can only be done once every 12 months like an attributes remap history of name changes remains in player info like corporation history a players name history can be searched by other players for 10000000 isk via the current ingame search agents commentsbenefitsthis is a simple solution and it provides a nice balance a player who changes his name has a level of privacy but if someone wants to do a thorough search then the full history will be revealed players cant escape their past its all there if somebody does a searchname changes would act as a nice little isk sink tooyou can change your name on your ebay account where real life scams occur but not your character name in eve im sure its not a high priority now but i cant see a valid reason not to allow name changes

last i checked this was already in the game i spent a while collecting trade goods like this in a kestrel one time
nopethats funny so theres no such thing as awoxers never anyone getting ganked because they didnt pay attention for a few minutes or seconds etc i can undock and go afk for hours upon hours and expect to come back to a ship instead of a pod in a stationrightthe last time i took a loss while ratting was when i was in delve incidentally that was also one of the last times i ratted because its much more profitableless stressful to do a vast majority of things in hisec rather than in nullsecwhos presuming
i just think that effect on the ship rather than the missile are unnecessary t2 gun ammo got these taken away as they were too gimping i think its time unguided missiles got the same
fw lp shop doesnt encourage lowsec involvement it encourages flying of sbs and the art of risk aversion
balance existing hulls first kthxbyeto elaborate there is no room in the lineups for a navy bc as they would get 50ehp slots damage drones etc they would effectively be in between the tier1 and 2 bs in power only difference being weapons range with all other characteristics much better one could add a bc support craft of some sort but would be kind of boring and probably overlap with t2 cruisers something fiercenavy tier3 bs has room but what is the point all it would accomplish is introduce a highend ship for the isk rich to make up for their flaccid epeens  it wouldnt add anything of real value other than another ship no matter how you style itcould see them introduced as minidreads which are asked for elsewhere give them a miniaturized siege module 13rd all numbers or so and then make the same module available for fitting on t2 bs sometime later  private sector using military tech after the fact

i would just like to point out that 99 of everybody here would like to see the bo boosted in terms of pvpfrom a making isk  logistical perspective these ships work wonderfully as they are sneaking into enemy lines with transports and recon gangs scanning down sites jewing lewt and jump out with boat loads of the stuffyes i would like to see these ships get some love but when will we stop demanding that love only effect those aspects of eve that allow you to kill and destroywe need some more non killing game play focused ships
they are usefull not need changes
you are alone with that point of viewa 700ish mil battleship that is useful for almost nothing and can bridge like 3 systems at best
ive made billions of isk with that useless ship grinding sigs in soviet mordor with some alts in recons and transiesive even hotdropped with those ships and on a regular occasion bridge transport fleets for minor hauling ops through low sec and 00so no i share his viewwhat you want is a 700 mil titan wannabe wtfownmobile that only works in pvp
suggestion is to use the contract system to define the parameters of a combat which then becomes legal in hisec out of corp 1vs1 duels dont really happen because of the opportunity for cheatingscamming scamming isnt necessarily bad so long as it doesnt limit the game by becoming too pervasive arena areas or simulators have been suggested in the past i believe that using the contract system is preferable as it uses the existing game environment and because the fight would be public others can observe enriching the game experience of everyoneunder the contract system a 4th type of contract would be added to the existing list duel contract structure is most similar to existing courier contractson the first page the publicprivate options would say if you want the fight to be open to all comers or is a challenge to a specific piloton the second page which is similar to courier you define the system the fight will take place in the ship class to be used eg frigatefrigate afaf cruisercruiser etc nominate whether pilots are permitted to have implants or if they must be free of skill hardwiring implantson the third page again similar to courier you define reward ie how much you pay if your opponent wins collateral probably a better term here ie how much you receive if your opponent wins expiration ie how long the contract is open for before it expires days to complete ie how long the two pilots have to engage without concord intervention while in the nominated system description ie any commentary or non binding additional details such as defining eve time and proposed location within system such as at a certain planet or stationon the fourth page you confirm the details are correctother issues fight complete when a ship is destroyed collateral only lost if fight takes place to prevent scams duel is lost if a pilot uses boosterslogisticsfleet bonusesillegal implants  code must check this before contract is completed and reward payed out contract doesnt grant mutual war status or equivalent to prevent scams concord still intervenes if ship classes dont match or if outside the nominated system there should be an easy way for pilots to see another pilots duel contract record which could lead to league tables no consequences to either pilot if fight doesnt take place to prevent scams and in recognition of rl no pod killing system encourages pvp fits  warp scramblers effectively necessary to prevent a pilot who is loosing fleeing to either leave system or change to different ship of the same classwhile the contract concept is designed to limit the potential for scamscheating it doesnt prevent pilots doing research into what ships and modules an opponent might use which might even involve preemptive ship scanning flying dummy fits until ready to fightcould be good for the game as a whole  mailing lists of duel devotees could be created pilots could gain reputation as capable duelists provides a spectator sport if contract details published potentially gives the news team something to reportim not a programmer so dont know how difficult this would be to implement  interface with the other aspects of standings  defining when combat is legal however the code already has a mechanism for noting when you have kill rights on someone and if kill rights are ever turned into tradeable bounty contracts as has been suggested this duel contract concept might be incorporated at the same timebestaleena
so you want to add restrictions to combat in a sandbox game not supported at alla better solution would be for someone to set up a database of people known to break 1v1s and have people check against that before fighting them that would be in keeping with the sandbox nature of the game and it wouldnt require any effort on ccps part meaning they can keep working on features that could actually be usedalso such a system would be massively complicated and there would still be holes in the system that people would exploit to get an advantage at which point the parties that were cheated would be railing against ccp because the system didnt protect them
if you want a duel drop a can we dont need ccp spending time dealing with thousands of whine petitions when their honourable 1v1 rifter duel goes wrong
contracts add restrictions to sandboxhow about we trade by the honor system you give me all your stuff first then ill hand you the isk no well we obviously cant have restrictionshint restriction does not apply to something thats optional feel free to give someone your stuff
i actiually like the idea its the closest i could agree to implement pvp arena in everead and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
cosmos missions sites i think is some of the best pve content in the game it has been known to be buggy in the past and has some serious issues such as only being able to complete content once and being locked out of the content if you get things wrnng and fail missions in my opinion this content was better than the epic arcs more communal and more involvedi fully support expanding on this content create a journal create more missions and allow it to be repeated every year or so
calculating to see whether a shot can be taken is rather easy  do and remember the calculation of distances between you and all ships  
from what i understand the problem with renting the slots out is that you have to be part of an alliance if youre in a corp and not in an alliance youre being fubarred on the efficiencieshowever our pos is usually maxed for cpu anyways so not that huge of an ordeal for us
thumbs up from me  there is not a lot of choice atm with rigged ship transportation and this would fill the gap nicely
yesyes it willonce offgrid fleet boosters are nerfed all pvp will be completely pointless and eve will die
dont see the problem this nerf would hurt our miners too
best low sec proposition ive heard
i support this proposal 1
something about this idea feels fishy but i cant reason my way to it must be fear of change lol1
aggressive nutmeg wrotei would implement name changes like this name changes cost 10000000 isk or some appropriate fee name changes can only be done once every 12 months like an attributes remap history of name changes remains in player info like corporation history a players name history can be searched by other players for 10000000 isk via the current ingame search agents players applying to a corporation would be asked to give the corporation 10 mil isk for the background check that wouldnt be good for the gamethe rest is reasonable some extra isk sinks as small as they may be are good
theyve actually reduced the differential between npcs in different plexes lately caldari npc do not jam in many plexes and in reality they are a nuisance to the properly sized ships in a given plex there are also numerous ways to avoid them altogether 1 dont fight inside plex 2 dont go near button to activate them so ccp is listening and making alterations that are clear to anybody wishing to actually run plexesthe proposal for telling militias where the plexes are spawning is a decent one and it will help when two likeminded gangs are itching for a fight good stuff it can easily be gamed which is fine example you have a minimum number of guys enter a plex and the rest stay out response fleet arrives to find opponent has 3x the number the intel map says they do example 2 plexing fleet spams intel by opening large number of plexes in far off area and then bails when response fleet arriveshowever if you are fighting for your militia and are more interested in occupancy than fights your side will blob a plex and discourage even fights when you can you want to win occupancy not get good fights so there you have it in a nutshell nothing ccp implements can encourage one side to suicide into another side and lose all of its ships everybody who engages in plexing warfare has this figured out and its not a big deal fight when you can avoid fight when you cant
im glad your warming to the proposali often go in plexes and do not go near the button because the minmatar npcs will start spamming missiles at me it is one of the best ways i know to get a decent fight in this game but when i do this i cant say i am running plexes or in anyway helping my militia in the occupancy war since i am not really running the plex yes there will be situations where people will open plexes and then camp the acceleration gate or even the gate into the system but those ships that are sitting outside the plex camping could potentially be running plexes different themselves so while they are playing it safe they are not helping their militia as much as they could if they split up and all started running timers the militia that has the courage to split up and run many timers at once will be rewarded with more plexes captured that will be the main reason why blobs will be split up ccp will need to tweak with the number of plexes that spawn there cant be too many such that both sides can all plex and never have to fight over the same plex but there cant be too few that the side with larger numbers can easilly camp them i would err on the side of having too many at first i think allot of people  like myself would just go looking for plexes that the enemy started in order to fight for those if i saw a wt opened a minor plex in a t1 frigate within 7 jumps i would likely be there before they could finish the plex of course all minors will now be fought over with nnothing but destroyers but that is another issue i really think if they did this people who are looking for pvp would find their killboard blowing up with kills and losses in great fights make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
great idea eve really needs to become more lively1
the npc haulers do not travel station to station they undock and slow boat off grid
why not as long as itsa limited to a little things makeover not a large project  eve is primarily playerdriven the npcs should never be a major focusb kept out of nullsec we dont need any more lag from irrelevant things happening around fleet fights

good idea make the sites with the common ores veld through omber and pyro able to be scanned to 100 with 1 probe and astrometrics 1 at 16 au that should take care of the new player argument
while i like the idea in principle this would absolutely murder the activity of ratting especially when grinding sec which is bad enough as is
i have a friend who has great sec rating and he almost never kills belt rats there are other ways to raise sec standing
just out of interest how ive always done it by the old one bs each system null roams a more boring approach would be awesome though also good point on this killing ratting i would say just have this for the high value ores but then it wouldnt really fix botting although it might make it less profitablecenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
the only other effective method i am aware of is tagging multiple lvl 4 missions through a few systems however this isnt too viable without either having decent sec to begin with or a lot of blues in teh areahowever i would be wiling to lose rats if i could purchase my way to good sec
i had this idea when i was part of the csm afaik things were pretty balanced on like vs dislike i wrote a whole proposal for this concept as part of my redesign of the pos system available hereto fix the scanning problem i was thinking that barges only should be able to use the onboard scanner to find grav sites and extend all sites in 08 or lower to grav only in 10 and 09 systems where schools are located and such keep the sites static and visible without scanning but maybe accessed by an acceleration gate that only allows frigates
1 is there enough wh systems if not what class needs moreare they under or overpopulatedi would endorse an increase of wsystems2 are pos mechanics enabling to many people to just clean out weak systems and not bother with harder targetsdont really think so3 should access and roles be reworked doubttfull i will be alone on that onecorp access yes how you get into the wspace no4 should moons be mineable for goowaits for the hate from thatyes but for stuff completely different from 00 that way both keep their unique properties this could possibly mean new materials for ships5 should sleeper sites and other sites spawn rates be raised to foster larger corpalliance growthmaybe only in c5 and c66 should site iskrewards be lowered or raised upped a little but not much7 do wh pvp mechanics need an overhaul many things come to mind here need to pop those carebears that jump back to hs only thing i would like to see added is a comms relay for poss this item would allow people to be seen in local but would eat a good piece of resources8it was stated by ccp long ago that whs were not meant for long term habitation since they lost that bet should they now look at making them more viable for larger numbers to encourage larger scale wh system warfare and not just the russians taking out weak systems for fun yes9 are wh masses and spawn times what they should be masses need adjusting i think they are ok for c1 and c2 but i would like to see c3 allow freighters through but not dreadnoughts and above so maybe just a restrition that only indy command and freighters capital class ships can pass through 10 do you think i am pissing in the wind here to think ccp cares about wh dwellers and our corpsalliancesyes but if we dont try they wont even look at wspace for an overhaul
also i wonder how many of those folks just sit there in their home wh all day and never get out and shoot sleepers gas  in connected wspace systems a dualstatic c2 can house a very good sized corporation 100 easy without getting stuffy wrt the iskies if youre good at farming your static
1 i see a lot of empty systems so yes2 i dont see a problem but im not sure i understand the question3 yes but not too drastically id rather see this done in increments to make sure they get it right one papercut at a time ccp hasnt shown a great track record for making sweeping allinone changes4 no moongoo is for nullsec t3 salvage is for wspace5 as i understand it people have reported an observable drop in spawns if a wormhole is too regularly farmed if that truly is systematic and not subjective then that needs to be removed there shouldnt be a penalty for high levels of activity other than that i wouldnt change much except maybe to slightly increase the overall number of sites so that there are one or two more per system on average6 wormhole rewards are almost entirely market driven leave them alone7 hell no dont touch wh pvp8 if anything make a few new classes of wormholes that serve as longterm connections between two wspace systems maybe remove their mass limits and have them open for a fixed 48 hours allowing significant traffic between systems and enabling some serious warfare to go down before the hole closes
i for one partly agrees with the op on this one but only if those options remain optionsin that way the op and the likes could anchor their mail ip and maybe even mac if theyre more concerned about account security than mobilty and flexibility and the rest could just dont give a damn about those options except for the extra work of implementing those options what downsides are there

hopefully i can pique the interest of all of the longhaul space truckers out there to get this proposal supported so maybe one day it could be found in gamei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i support this
oh no the miners think of the miners
i agree with this i would however leave mining bonuss off the tableorcas and rorqs cost waaaay too much with minimal defenses to force them to be sitting in an asteroid belt in 00 spaceotherwise 1
absolutely support this lowsec pirates have to claw and scrape for hours to get anything even resembling a decent fight and as far as im concerned good fights are the only reason to play eve more people in lowsec especially more people in lowsec looking for fights can only be a good thing 1
agree learning implants is the main reason why i dont want to leave highsec
no your risk aversion is the main reason you dont leave highsec btw nice monocle
your risk aversion is the main reason you post with an alt laffeaux its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
maybe the best idea iv read so far here
this wouldnt fix the problem with afk botting seeing as the programs can use the on board scanner the better answer would be to add an extra high slot that can only be fitted with a scan probe launcher and make the site scanable to 100 with 1 probe and astrometrics 1 at 816 au anyone then could find them if there was an active player manning the controls
the only losers to this change are botters and lazy players i dont like either of them so 1
maybe but there are someone that ends up hearing us and thinking about iti will definitly fly one of those new pos system new sov system
ive been playing eve since 2007 and when i first joined i found solo extremely satisfying i also enjoy small gang warfare with friends but tend to avoid the big fights as i dont find these enjoyable i like flying where its a bit harder and skillexperienced based on situations rather than following fc orders this been said i will be specifically talking about nullsec nano solo as this is all i knowthat been said i believe the quality of solo pvp has declined over the past 3 or 4 years yes this is a mmo and designed as a multiplayer game but that doesnt always mean gang vs gang that can mean solo vs solo solo vs gang solo vs oh my god run to me that means many people playing the same game having fun and interacting as they do so whether that interaction is corp chat or been shot atmy opinion on the main changes that have declined solo pvp are as follows1 the great nano nerffor those of you that werent around when this happened basically all of the ships base speed stats were reduced this obviously effected the quicker ship than the slower ones now dont get me wrong i do believe this was needed as 8kms vagabonds were just ridiculous but heres the thing they were ridiculously fun fast annoying and stupid they caused drama less organised fleets with no webs or ships to deal with them could succumb to a single skilled solo pilot solo pilots could make a name for themselves yes the nerf was needed but i think it went a little too far to the extent that overloaded battlecruisers can achieve the same standard speeds2 introduction of anomaliesanomalies brought wealth and quality to owning sovereignty in null sec this part is all well and good however with this they also brought a big decline to nullsec solo pvp most solo roams start by choosing a destination and seeing what you can find on the way there before anomalies people would be ratting in belts to make isk even in their shiney ships this opened up a whole lot of opportunities to catch people quickly if you knew the systems you were visiting or got lucky it also allowed you to use these ships as catalysts to great fights however now with anomalies most people are at these yes you can scan them down within 4 seconds but then you need to locate which one they are in by ship spinning the directional scanner and working out where they are if they havent already started warp out in the 4 seconds it takes to scan they most definitely have before youve had a chance to locate it with the directional scanner yes probes can be used but this is beside the point of the belt ratting3 warp scrambler changethe warp scrambler change disabled the target ships microwarpdrive now i really like this change myself it means frigates can tackle much more effectively and you have a better chance of catching nano ships however i think to myself why couldnt this have been introduced before the nano nerf maybe this would have brought the tackle needed to catch the insanely fast ships but also leave the skill and quality of solo pvp intact also i believe with the mod now been able to disable a targeted ships mwd it should also use more capacitor to do soin conclusioni propose the following changes to some extent increased incentives to belt rat maybe increase the officerfaction spawn rate increased speed for cruiser and below hulls allowing races other than minmatar better speed capability increased cap usage of the warp scrambler new improved tackle should cost more capacitor if you maths types out there want to put some figures together please do so thanks for you time
wanted to point out that i know plenty of pilot who belt rat in shiny shipsbest odds of getting that officer spawn in belts and hence great riches 
thats fair tallian but do you also know people who do anomalies point been theyd have been in the belts too
i do anoms mostly better guaranteed cash i also spent a short time in stain before anoms and i know what you mean much as i like having targets for small gang roamsnot a soloist myself i also like making isk without dying to every hostile that comes through and belt ratting didnt support as many people so im torn on a personal levelobjectively tho your right there arent enough targets for small gangs all we do is force people to dock up and wait for us to leave mildly disrupting their isk making unless you wanna go afk

no its notif it were the case keylogger wouldnt existno its not he didnt say it was ccps fault
what he meant was that it is your responsibility to secure your own networks and computers not that of ccp if your system is compromised ccp are not under any obligation to help you with thatthe fact that they try to do their best without threatening the eve market or opening themselves up to keylogger based scams from rmters is really really nice and doesnt deserve a giant whine thread along the lines of as far as i can tell the only reason is that ccp does not want to do the work of fixing these problemsanyway quit necroing this horrible horrible threadcenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
the one thing that a authenticator would do is provide a major obstacle against botters and rmt sellersat the moment you can create a 100 untraceable account in evei know of no other game where this is possiblebefore people say how1 create a false email account using many of the free email services available2 sign up with a vm hosting company in order to hide your true ip address3 run a simple script which configures your machine to use a free proxy service 4 create eve account using false email account and run eve via vm hosting company5 use plex to activate account6 untraceable accounthaving read the december csm meeting minutes all i can surmise is that ccp screegs loves rmt
except that the rmtersbotters would simply decline to use authentication or if youre trying to force everyone to use authentication anyone who cares at all about their personal privacy will simply refuse to use it and many will likely stop playing the gameccp is not and should not be responsible for leaks from the user side if someone was capturing passwords when they were being sent or had hacked the authentication servers that would be ccps fault but ccp is no more responsible for someone getting keylogged than they would be if you wrote down your login information and handed it to someone as you were walking down the street its the users fault for having poor security regardless of if they were aware of it

faction navy frigs are commonly known as police frigs so it saddens me that the ships have no method of turning on a siren or strobe light of some sort to fulfill their law enforcement roles all faction frigs should be redesigned to have a light such as the one on the comet and furthermore should have a included module that simply starts making the light flash 23 colors rapidly this way i can role play out my police officer fantasies

nicely thought out and a good idea i fully support this
this sounds like a pretty cool idea to me
i like this one supported
lets get some more support spread the word and maybe we can get the csm and devs to take a look at itwe want new shiny shipsi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
sounds like a usefull ship to me though i would make it a regular freighter without any slots aka a freighter that has a big ship carrying bay wether or not to allow ejecting them in space is a bad idea or not ill not comment oneither way make it 2 of them a regular one and a jump capable tech 2 onealso imho 3 battleships isnt all that much make it 4 or 5 with proper skilling  ie freighter 5

agreed 1
10
1 just say no to easy cap and blob mechanics
agreed i may not hang out in wspace often but its current basic mechanics must remain untouched they are perfect as is i dont think anyone can reasonably argue against more site anomsig variety or adding more systems
i agree though i do think that longer lasting wormholes would be nice to improve quality of wh life especially for small scale activities with whs lasting two days instead of one it would save you rescanning if yesterdays wormhole system chain still has targets or resources to harvest unless of course you or someone else exhausted the massim hardly a wh veteran but dont see how longer wormhole durations would benefit an invasion force the limiting factor is mass not duration
all depends on what kind of forces are needed to kill enemywhile attacking heavy bunkered capital forces require large ships so yes mass if a deciding factor but when atacking c4 for example you can move 40 tengusbc tier 3command shipshacs  clean up in two days and get back while all this time having a way out if  hits the fan or get home do some pve while waiting for reinforcment timer to end than move there again and than get back home  thats still less than needed for wh to enter criticall mass if i remember corectlyread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
still failing to see how that would be an advantage to invasion forces a convenience yes a real advantage nogoing back home and relinquish control of your entry wormhole your enemy will close it in a few minutes if you want to come back youll need to have a character in the invasion system to find you a new entry or cycle holes hoping to get luckythere is always a way out and back home if you cant go back where you came from you scan a new hole down finding an exit from the invasion system should be trivial if youre really carrying lots of loot youll need to consume multiple holes anyway
im not gona argue about it you are righthaving wh open for longer than 24 hours is not as bad as my first assumption  but the question is should it be player driven way of expending lifetime of connection or just random wh having longer than usual lifespanedit weird part of my post got truncated so here is the resti prefer the second approach that is part of what i proposed in more variety of opening whsread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
whs as they currently are is the closest any part of eve comes to perfectany wh stabilizer would be disastrous beyond words
as an aside how many people have to nayyay something before someone at ccp considers it
spent four hours in a frig looking for a fight last night and not in a backwater region either i simply cannot imagine any game which could be marketed on the basis of do really boring stuff for four hours and you might get 52 seconds of fun and thats not including logistics grind if it werent for my love of space ships id not play this horrible horrible gamesupported though i think eve needs much much more to promote combat
this1
ccp has altered plex spawning and has also erred on the side of too many plexes a minor medium and l3 major are available 30 minutes after one closes its easy to kill off the spawns in these plexes as well
i agree that the changes ccp made are welcome but they are not enough they brought the number of dedicated plexers from what 30 to 100 thats still pretty sad for an mmo with about 300k accounts as far as the npcs i can only speak for amarr fighting the minmatar rats it can be easy to kill the spawns if you start the plex and keep killing them but even then if fly a passive tanked pvp fit you likely have to warp out ot repair your tank if a enemy comes if the plex was started earlier by somone else then you will definitely not have an easy time clearing it and fighting a wt you will need to warp off plexing is still primarilly a pve activity by that i mean i will do 5 plexes before anyone even bothers to come in for a fight then if my tank is already demolished which it usually is by the npcs i need to warp out anywaymake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
your risk aversion is the main reason youre in a 5000 strong nbsi alliance
im just going to assume that youre some scrublord highsec incursion runner and lawl its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
perhaps they are used by people whove had goon gank squads sent after them for daring to disagree with the high and mighty goons on the forumsbut you are the one who is quite wrong your logic is fail 11 2 regardless of whether i stand behind it on my main or quote it with an alt that statement is correct no matter how many people call the person making it dumb this applies to more complex arguments as well such as the one at hand
youve foiled my planrolling a forum alt essentially makes you able to shitpost all over the eve forums short of caod if its npc and if you start to gain a reputation as a terrible poster you simply biomass and roll a new forum alt if you roll a forum alt it is either for this reason or because youre dumb enough to believe that somebody will wardec you or send goon einsatzgruppen after you its tinfoil bullshit and you know it its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i count 2  and 1 dumb in the above at this rate you are well on your way to cementing your reputation as a terrible poster you will do better by acknowledging a good argument and offering a better counter argument instead of cursing and insulting other postersyou could try to offer a counterargument to mine by explaining exactly why a correct statement becomes invalid depending on who makes it but you cannot do this because you are wrong and you know it
tell me more about how an npc corp alts worthless opinion is correct or otherwise its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i mean really by your alliance tag i can tell that you are a primarily based out of nullsec b understand the logistics involved in living in nullsec and c have to deal with jump clones if you were posting with an npc corp alt those observations would not be immediately obvious and id assume youre just part of the crowd of aspies who truly and honestly believe that nullsec is a land of honey with zero risk where people mine abc lol in cynojammed systems with 300km of bubbles on every inbound gate its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
didnt read every single post in here but op doesnt suggest the removal of all implants only the attribute enhancers so that you would still have a death penalty when you lose other implantsand i agree attributes add no fun to the game and only make people worry about them as far as i am concerned attributes can be entirely remove including said implants and remapsgive every skill the same sphour rateedit  oh and set jc timers to 1 hour or 2 this is also an unneeded annoyance
your observations about me are correct i live and fight in null this is a factthe observation that the removal of learning implants would eliminate most of the cost of dying for low sp null secers who fly without hardwiring is also correct all that remains is the cost to upgrade the clone this is also a factadding slot 15 hardwiring implants to the game would not contribute to the cost of dying for pilots who arent going to use them look up mathematical proof of 000 this is also a factit doesnt matter who makes the above statements they are not opinions and so whether i or some nameless faceless forum alt makes them they are still correct statements the matter of opinion here is whether or not removal of learning implants is good for the game i agree its good for low sp t1fit pvpers who fly without hardwiring its not inherently bad for pilots who use a lot of hardwiring im not convinced it is good for the game because it does remove most of the of riskreward for losingkeeping a pod i have yet to hear a good argument that this will result in many more players for eve or significantly more pvp the way time dilation is working in its current implementation i can predict a lot less fleet pvp in null but thats another issuewill eve really have a lot more pvp if learning implants are removed i doubt it if you map a training plan correctly you make 2610 sphour with 2 4 implants vs 2700 sphouronly 333 faster with 2 5s most t2 fit battlecruisers cost more than 2 4s and a t2 fit bc really is a baseline for what is needed for competent nullsec pvp so if a 40 million isk implant loss scares people from pvping in null it should they obviously cant afford itpvping cheaply in lowsec and highsec and learning how to save your pod with the warpoff trick as you hit structure eliminates 90 of pod losses people who cannot manage simple stuff like that are not going to succeed in epic fleet pvp just because the cost of losing implants has been removed they will just welp and die and lose as much or more isk pvping that way mastery of game mechanics is what makes eve cheap if i can grind 200 mill iskhour im not going to sweat a 100 mill clone loss i will make that during a quick downtime between ops or roams someone who has trouble making 20 millhour is going to be hurt more by implant loss and they should
i like it
i agree 100 that the rings around the planets should actually be asteroid belts right now they are just rings but literally thats what those rings are supposed to be sometimes theyre gas and sometimes theyre rock we should definitely be able to mine thesei would also like to see mining get a bit more interesting right now its such a grind asteroid belts should be fricken scary rocks should be close together difficult to navigate maybe a little foggy crap should be moving all around you i like the idea of changing the composition of rocks depending on ease of access by all rights you should have to scout for the good rocks asteroid belts should be massive especially if theyre encircling a planet in turn the yields would have to be worth the extra work somehow like you said
read the guys post above yoursno decent miner will even bother scouting or scanning roids they will mine them all regardless thats why they are there after allit would be nice to see a dynamic belts as opposed to the static ones we have now but again in hi sec its not going to make a great deal of difference it will still be a grind no matter what you do
any fix to the current mining system needs to address bot miners this is a cosmetic thing more than anything and possibly a pvpers way to get easier hulk kills
late reply sorry subtracting an insurance reward from a bounty payout only works if its the hunted mans own alt doing the killing if its a legitimate bounty hunter its effectively an exploit where the hunted man denies payout to the hunter for minimal investmentreducing the ship explosion payout to 25 means that full plat insurance cannot benefit a selfkiller and in any case the payout to a legitimate hunter is unaffected by insurance or lack thereof
nice and short the idea is that if a source of ecm has a very low chance of jamming say less than 1 in 10 it should have a 0 chance insteadthe logic for this is pretty simple it makes sense that specialised ecm eafsrecons would be able to jam incredibly effectivelycurrently a cruiser with decent sensor strength say a sacrilege with an eccm module overheated and eccm implants has a decent chance to get jammed by a flight of lightmedium ecm drones in the time it takes to kill the drones or another cruiser if the opponent is say recalling and redeploying the dronesbasically 110115 seems to make sense as t1 frigates should be jammable by small ecm dronest1 and t2 frigates with eccm or eccm implants should noteafs should not etc this seems to work up to larger ship sizes too all the way up to a recon with 3 overheated eccms and eccm implants should be falcon immuneas it stands the counter does not workedit one more thing i wanted to add i think this is probably the most significant change to improve solo pvp at the moment in anything bigger than a frigate fight theres a good chance the opponent will just ecm drone you if you start to winhaving just one more pilot to hold tackle means that this cannot happen this is really quite unfair to soloists
i have a better idea why dont ccp just give you free kmsecm working as intended no changes needed
hes not asking for a bugfix hes asking for a change of intention
i actually think ecm should just break lock not stop you from taking any other action for 20 seconds the relock time should be all the penalty that ecm grantswhy even bother with any other forms of ewar ecm  all other ewar as it stands atm
the intention of ecm is to jam you the intention of guns is to shoot you you dont change others intentions htfu
read the csm minutes that were postedccp is looking at a dedicated ship that will be able to find cloaky ships now wont that be fun
yes and that has unleashed a flurry of remove local posts
this one ccp will not hear there is already a zone called whspace for this although all thoses that complains about afk cloakers will have to find an other thing to complain about   new pos system new sov system
edit if you dont know what im taliking about read sumit minutes  theyre is a possibility they will add limited sp respecialisation mechanism in evethe csm reiterated its desire for ccp to implement a partial skill respec especially in the aftermath of major changes to ship classes such as the removal of drones from supercarrierssp respec i mean really sp respec in my evei think someone got hit in the head with something heavywhen titans lost ability to shoot dd trough portal and later lost aoe effect  no one refunded them their energy weapons vwhen sb lost cruise bonus no one gave us cruise specialisation back as spwhen there was nano nerf no one gave us back skills from navigation and minmatar hac 5when you nerfed pi no one gave us back pi skiilswhen you nerfed carriers removed large cargohold no one refunded us capital skillsso why the hell when sc nerf hits we suddenly hear about giving back skills for drones or more even sp respec mechanismeve is all about action and consequences of said actions as oposed to games like wow where there is limit of what i can learn there is no situation when i hit imaginery wall and can not train furtherin eve when i no longer need some skills want to check something new i just start training them i remap and 5 needed skills and start trainig for new stuffthis will actually hit new players very hard  imagine that we have 100m sp bittervet and 5m sp nolongernoob fresh player imagine now that ccp introduced new type of ships  something in range of new player that dont require tons of skills to flywhat new payer can do well he have no skills to abandon just like that so he have to train for it what about bittervet well he just drop his titan 5 and gets all needed skill to lvl 5 in minutesthis in turn will cause even larger gap between veterans and new players right now when something new is introduced pi for example all payers are on equal footing  everyone have to train to use new stuff ofc veterans have more isk  can use 5 possible have remaps for such occasion stored so they can get there slightly faster  but they still have to train to itso all in all  dont respec or we will loose all respect by we i mean i and everyone thinking alikeread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
i agree no respec in my eve
no respec ever

hi goose99 good we have professional troll in here this thread was definetly to much onesided until now read and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
posting in a bitter vet afraid of change thread
youve got some serious issues man stop the evemail spam
yea
no to any sp respec what so everwhoever dreamed this up should be taken out back and shotsurvivors should be shot again
depends on what the limited part of the sp respec means 1 because i think some respec is needed if not just to get rid of useless starter skills not to mention it wont hurt anything at all and this entire thread is one huge overreaction to nothing at all
and once again you miss the point stop the evemail spam
i can see why the op posted this thoughccp will always change things and it would be pretty unfair to allow a respec for carriers when they havent done this for say sbs or other ships that they have nerfed over the yearsits not game breaking granted but it does seem pretty unfair
exactly and tomorrow they will implement nerf for x and day after for y and what fotm without consequenceread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
respec is for pussies and for games such as wow the only respec that i find even remotely acceptable is if skills are completely removed from the game otherwise hell noedit surprised that pussies didnt censor
do we know more than thisthe csm reiterated its desire for ccp to implement a partial skill respec especially in the aftermath of major changes to ship classes such as the removal of drones from supercarriersthat could mean lots of things if its just sc and drone skills that get respecable then i agree that ccp should not give a getoutofjailfreecard to such a small number of players especially in light of other people skilling up for stuff that later got changedif it means that we can respec say 110m skillpoints yearly well thats something i think is pretty cool i have some more or less wasted skillpoints i wouldnt mind putting elsewhereedit op why didnt you give us that quote i have posted bad op bad go to your box
my take on the sc losing drones and whining about sps  oh you poor little babyget the  over yourselfdrone skills are very useful across many subcaptial classes of shipsjust because you lost the ability to use them on a specific ship class doesnt mean you hqave to go ape crazy like some damned babythe answer is and should remain nothe only times ill accept an sp is for reimbursement due to skill deletion or server crash that disupts play time for like say a week or somethingperiodps if what im seeing is the truthsounds like this proposal is a drama panic attack based on what csm is pushingnot what ccp is saying that is a major difference i would think stop the evemail spam
yes you read right the council of serious internet spaceships has outlived its usefulness the only things left on their agendas are those that benefit the csm leaders super alliances mostthey cannot claim to represent the majority of the playerbase and on their agenda is only about their personal benefit and for this crap they let themselves be carried to iceland a few times a year adding even more cost to ccpit is time to end the experiment and disband the csm
only if you are permanently bannedotherwise not supporting stop the evemail spam

no as the csm create oceans of tears and that alone is enough for me
obviously the op doesnt read the csm minutes of the meetings in icelandif you did you would realise very quickly that the csm is not doing out of their self interest but for the interests of all eve playersas i said before on one of these threads ccp would never allow the csm dictate how they ran their business it just would never happen and you are living on another planet if you think otherwisenot supported
i suggest reading the csm minutes all there looks pretty reasonable to me in fact its utterly uncontroversialedit exception is the idea of some sort of wh stabilizer but it was merely something discussed i didnt get the impression it had wide support
the csm doesnt ask me what i want or what is in my interests they run out to ccp land with a short list of items that are populist in nature or what serves their own alliance  power block agendas by nature of having the sheer support of thousands of sheep that fear for their membership and pretend that their interests are my interestsand when i bother telling the csm what my interests are they tell me to get lost that game designers do wonders or wont care about my interests or suggestions most importantly all they ever do is waste my time with bullpoop politicsccp is starting to take an active interest in the player bases wants and desires as evident by the wis team actively engaging with players regarding the future of wis they talk to us which as i understand it is what the csm was designed to facilitate in the first place communication between players and the powers that be now that the powers that be have woken up and started paying attention this csm thing can go die in a fire1
that basically describes how a democracy workswhy is it every election nobody asks me personally what i want but instead delivers stuff the vast majority of people wantalso have you read the latest csm minutes its pretty awesome stuffi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
nobody asked me what you wantted eitherand i sure as hell dont want it stop the evemail spam

im going to keep it short and sweet this is about incursions in highsec by the waythe good side of incursions is that its an organized group activity where you can make new friends highsec was sorely lacking this type of opportunity a mmo should always promote group activities like incursions over solo play by tying it to better rewardsthe problem is not the 100 mil per hour its the fact that you can get 100 mil per hour for hours every day for as long as you can stomach ita proper nerf would include one of the following1 reducing the rate at which incursions appear in highsec and limiting their duration there should not always be a highsec incursion available but when they are up let the pilots flock to them for the isk and lp limiting their duration means that at a certain point only the mothership site would remain to be completed2 letting incursion rewards decrease on an individual basis the more missions are completed youve done 50 missions in the last three days you only get half rewards or something like that3 a variation of the above allow full rewards only for a fixed number of sites per daytldr incursions should remain good isk per hour to preserve their attractiveness but only for limited amounts of time to prevent them from overshadowing other isk making activities completely
waaa mummy people in hsec are making is and i dont like it waaaa muuuummmmmy a video of the op isnt the wittle baby cutebut seriously if you want to nerf 100m in hsec we must also nerf the 100m in nullsec as its pretty much completely risk free money with your blue space and intel channels
captain the butt hurt meter is off the charts on this one what shall we do ignore it scottyon a more serious note ive done incursions for a while as well and honestly most people expect a nerf from what i gathered during casual discussions
nerf high sec incursion rewards
why does everyone want hi sec nerfedit always seems to be a form of jealousy when i read these threads if they are making good isk from doing incursions their way then good luck to them if you want the same go join them in hi sec for some risk free isknull is just as bad to be honest you can run plexes all day every day without ever seeing a hostile wheres the risk there
nerf moon goo
this then remove local in nullsec no local  no free intel  less reliable intel channels  more risk for your 100mh rewards
because you can make more isk with out any risk in a highsec incursion than you could running sanctums out in null which is far more dangerousi say no isk without riski honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
buff nullsec nerf highsec into the ground its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i null bear stay in the deep end of blue sov null ass where isk flows free and you dont see hostiles for weeks on endin highsec every grey lurking around the corner can gank you
you fail to mention all the greys and there multiple ways of griefing a fleet and multiple was of ganging a fleet anyone ever here of a 10 man blackbird fleet wiping out a 10 man 50 billion isk fleet there are plenty of risks running incursions in high sec while in 00 someone enters local you dock someone leave local you go back to making 150 million plus isk an hourjust because someone besides you is making isk doesnt mean it op and unfair get over yourselves ccp will not nerf high sec incursions
ahahaha where did you hear this 150m iskhr nonsense thats hilariously difficult to break especially with only one accountyou also assume that every blue is friendly because youre a slackjaw who has never heard of awoxers its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar

im one who thinks wormholes are one of the most balanced systems in eve and id like them to stay that way quickly regarding your questionsis there enough wh systems if not what class needs moreare they under or overpopulateda marginal increase to the number of wormhole systems sometime in the more distant future wouldnt hurt not now thoughare pos mechanics enabling to many people to just clean out weak systems and not bother with harder targetspos mechanics are pos mechanics despite recent changes they still need more work i favour modular pos myself though not specifically as it is described here on the forums i am not in favour of ccp following the neverending thread to the letter or modeling the structure after the designs thereinshould access and roles be reworked doubttfull i will be alone on that onecorp access and roles are also seperate from wh mechanics though they affect gameplay in them the whole corp structure could use some reworking with more or less granularity in certain areasshould moons be mineable for goowaits for the hate from thatgoo is a pretty loosely defined term here and applies to pretty much any drop that results in a manufacturable material yes i think that moons in whs should produce some sort of material for manufacturing it doesnt have to be the same as nullsec and probably shouldnt be id favour goo for producing additional tech 3 products in a limited fashion specifically it should produce only a marginal quantity of goo that makes up only a portion of new t3 production requirements and serves only to fill something missing from the t3 equationshould sleeper sites and other sites spawn rates be raised to foster larger corpalliance growthi think spawn rates are fine there is no drastic observable decline in sleeper site spawns in my opinion what people are seeing is a manifestation of the randomization algorithm used to make sleeper sites spawn in an apparently random fashion would be my best guess and i have experienced it it could perhaps use a little tweaking as it can be severely detrimental to wh activities for weeks at a time though cycling statics can help to reduce the effect on the corpalliance as a wholethere is also some degree of speculation that suggests sites that spawn in other wormholes count as spawned and without despawning there cannot appear elsewhere evidence would suggest that this is also to some degree true and impacts this equationshould site iskrewards be lowered or raised upped a little but not muchtheyre fine as they are as previously mentioned increases and decreases in tech 3 production requirements will affect and change the value of the salvage retrieved from these sitesdo wh pvp mechanics need an overhaul many things come to mind here need to pop those carebears that jump back to hspvp mechanics in whs are fine no need to change them at all once youve learned the basics of wh navigation and understand wh mechanics the rest is just pvp with whatever considerations are required for the type and class of whit was stated by ccp long ago that whs were not meant for long term habitation since they lost that bet should they now look at making them more viable for larger numbers to encourage larger scale wh system warfare and not just the russians taking out weak systems for funi dont think there was any bet involved more that it was unexpected that many players would go for longterm habitation in them they designed c5 and c6 whs right from the start of course and allowed pos to function in whs so it stands to reason they believed and possibly hoped there might be some players daring enough to try the venturec5 and c6 are already viable for larger numbers c6 in particular though there are limitations to that i dont think you should be able to have and support 1000 man alliances and corps in one wh if thats what you mean 100 is fineare wh masses and spawn times what they should be working as intended i think ive never had a problem with them really beyond initial assessment of logistical problems once you get past that part the rest is pretty easy and those issues actually make whs more secure in many ways given the nature of wh space that is important as increases to those masses and spawn timers would make it far easier for very large fleets to invade whs this can be donewith a little workas it is provided the fleet has no problem with being stuck in there with you they can move in a very large force in short orderdo you think i am pissing in the wind here to think ccp cares about wh dwellers and our corpsalliances i think all game content is relevent to the bottom line for ccp provided it has a subscriber based focused on it whs do and thus they are important they dont however need a lot of if any workhow are the pi changes affecting your corp are you too small that it is taking weeks just to blow up interbus should they just remove interbus in whs all togetherim sure my old corp is doing just fine with the pi changes theyre an industrious lot who dont mind a bit of grind where its necessary i cant speak for the changes myself as ive never seen themnothing is ever as short as you intend it to be at least

as an avided eve online player i would like to bring somthing to your attention that has me very troubled the us congress is currently considering passing two bills into law that would effectively censor the internet in the us makeing it possible to block sites via there domain names without trial or even telling the owners of the website that theyre being blocked or as to why this is supposedly to combat piracy witch id potentially be in favor of if the methodology actually worked but pirates can easily get around such measures you may be asking your self how dose the pertain to me well just a few infringing links would be enough to block a site full of legal material and sites become liable for userposted content so say someone posts a infringing link onto your fourm this would be more then enough to block all of the offending site to the us we cant let this happen we need to stop this bill at all costs but we cant do it alone we need your helpplease i beg of you to help spread the word and stop this bill form passing not in the us petition the state department the us state department constantly speaks out against internet censorship in other countries pressure them to speak out against americaUFFFDs new domestic censorship system  to petition the state department use this link
fewer americans online would improve the lag situation when they all login to uk servers i would support sopa just for that alone seriously though censorship of any kind or description should be fought at all costscome on my american cousins lobby your politicians to defeat these laws

well then fix the alpha damage problemdont introduce another ship to fit a role that already exists with about 5 other ships
your responses are completely bizarre you do realize of course that most people have no control over their systems security dont you downloading or installing a retail internet security program finding independent antimalware and installing that and configuring your router to prevent incoming requests all do absolutely squat to prevent someone getting in that wants to get inyou may have some exceptional knowledge that makes you think its childs play but that really just puts you in the realm of those who do it how else could you know unless you were a it security professional which i have to assume you arethe rest of us only really have one last resort limiting our internet activities so as not to attract attention or getting a better firewall the best defense is being invisible and the only way to achieve that is not to go anywhereim not sure how at fault or not at fault the op is but i dont think its your place to judge him for not having enough security on his system when you have people out there hacking banks government institutions and military installations how can you honestly expect a home user to be safemaybe you just think youre safe and the reality is you have two or three pieces of spyware and 4 keyloggers on your system all they have to do is bypass the network and security programs to get in and stay hidden and i know from experience that is quite possible uninstall f secure install panda oh look spywarezubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
erm not too sure where you are going with this to be honestmy issue is to do with with stopping people from botting and rmtthe fact you are able to create untraceable accounts means that you have zero ways of stopping people organisationsyou cant ban accounts you cant ban email addresses you cant ban via ip address therefore you can not stop themhow does this have anything to do with personal responsibilityas for having your account being hacked yes you can take measures to stop this from happening however since nobody is perfect and eve is a big target due to the fact that out of all the mmos it is the easiest to make rl money from it can also ask as a deterrent i suggest you apply our comment to yourself in the future in order to stop yourself from looking like a fool

agreed as a wormhole inhabitant i would not like these changes
csm are really proposing wh stabilizers urgh how stupid have they actually been in wspace proposal to remove clueless csm from proposing changes to aspects of gameplay they know nothing about
supporting this no wh stabilizers wormholes are actually fun as they are now for smaller gangs
i think it was mittens trying to monopolize c6 farming by kicking out all wspace corps and static linking those c6s to his evil nullsec empire

wormhole stabilizers i have never heard of such a moronic idea this goes against the very meaning of what wormhole space needs to be and it goes against ccps idea of making wormholes more difficult to inhabitnullsec csm members probably never lived in a wormhole or been in one for very long remember these guys are in it for themselvesnullsec csm members wanted highend ores to be removed from wormholes a few months ago
yeah nullbears dont do whs well if at all

its quiet simple ccp either wants players with money  to buy more accounts done they get a pvp account and a t3 boosting account now the ones without the  get screwed cause they cant compete in a 1v1 or have to have 25 more numbers to fight and the booster fleet runs and complains they blobed em mean while the ones without the  thus rage quit sooooo the solution is make the boosts on grid only the only people who dont support it are ones with boosters who very style of pvp is the booster alt totaly fine they are defending their style of game play but mine is better so deal
what if ganglink boosts appeared on the killmail
the way the watchlist works makes me think that there already is some sort of check whether stuff is on grid with you or not the watchlist is also more dataintensive than simply seeing if something is there or notwatchlist only shows hp of stuff that is ongrid with you right
you are correct i am sure this would be a simple fixit is a matter of whether or not this is intentional and working correctly or if ccp just doesnt want to make the change
bump for an excellent idea
freaking bump
this seems like a very viable option i agree 100damn fine planing on your part
i want to see a devs opinion on this because i honestly dont see why this shouldnt be implemented
btw this is not my idea it has been the idea since people realized what a pve farce fw plexing can behere is the post that clearly established fw plexing can be efficiently done soley pve styleas predicted it took less than a week to achieve the maximum faction warfare rank divine commodore for the amarr empire in this case111 faction warfare complexes were captured in the process i did not kill anyone in the process although i have fired on some people to scare them off your new divine commodore is a moral objectionist ankhesentapemkah 6182008and here is tommy reslins response 6192008second off allow an agent in the area controlled by faction name here inform everyone that solar system such and such is under attack this way people will come to fight them so everytime you attempt to capture something the enemies will know where you are this will bring in some more fightsthis still hasnt been done so doing plexes against no one but npcs is still the best way to go 35 years later this proposal of tommy reslin still needs to be implemented make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i thought i had already liked this so here is my likefor the record i am still in favour of a more graphical interface but the principal is there
i find the above quote to be of the most interesting read on this threadnoughtalthough i support learning boosters they would have to be seeded ofc
this is so far from a threadnaught its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
i was reading the csm minutes and i found an interesting paragraph at page 20im glad that there was a discussion regarding learning implants at the summit i doubt that it will lead to their outright removal not that id lose any sleep over it  they are an established part of the game its good to see attention focused on the topic regardless its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
wheres that dislike buttonto be honest i understand learning skills being removed they took a fair amount of time to train and did discourage new players the implants however do not have that same effect on new players your argument is for experienced older players these players know that going into a wormhole or nullsec is a risk its the risk vs reward deal that eve stands for by removing implants youre just removing part of that risk without removing part of that rewardyour proposal is stupid present a balanced argument instead of demanding the game be made the way you want it
part of what reward its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
oh come on dont pretend to be that thickheaded the reward is implants which allow a higher rate of skill training the risk is losing them in a pod death dont make me go back to the 112 and 000 stuff
and i presented a balanced argument so i dont know what hes on about vov its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
changed stance to supported1 stop the evemail spam
supported
yes that is a good idea
more risk and more reward sounds good to me
what if half of what you mined what unusable rock it would make it worth your time to scan rocks to see which are worth mining and which arent the outside of a belt would have more polluted rocks 100 units of veldspar 100 units of slag rock but the rocks in the middle that are hard to get to would be more pure and more valuable to mine 180 units of veldspar 20 units of slag rockhighsec would have more debris in it while lowsec would have nicer purer belts and nulsec would have the purest beltsbots not being able to navigate the belt without getting caught would have to stay on the outside of a belt mining the lowest valued ores making them much less profitable it doesnt remove bots but it makes them half as effective giving real players the advantage over them i did mention that to keep the inner belts hard to get to there is alot more junk unmineable in them so a hulks mining lasers cant reach them with out bumping into rocks making it hard to get in and out edit so macros cant strip mine a whole belt and get the good stuff without getting lots of slag and still bumping into rocks holding them up
there should be an afk button in fleet window as well as an afk notification in fleetwhat am i trying to saywhen you are in fleet you should be able to hit an afk button and you should then be marked gray in fleet instead of purple or some other color also in addition to that every pilot that hasnt moved or done any activity in like 5 minutes should automatically go to afk like he pressed the afk button it could be implemented like a broadcasts are also player going afk without pressing a button should get a message he is going to be set in afk modefeedback
why what is the point
yay more butthurt about afk cloakers grow a pair
ban npc forum alts from csm forumsexhibit a
who said anything about cloaked shipsthis proposal is to make fcs job easier so you can see if somebody is not here instead of waiting for x up in fleet and then counting them to see who is ready with this you more or less know what you have as an fc and who is ready to move now without any delay to fleet
would be handy for fcs and pilots not having to ask folks to x up in fleet chat 20 times over
beautiful thats the only way i can think to describe this why isnt this already so
yeah  nerf stealth nerf rogues 11 oh wait different game same whining

as we all know active tanking doesnUFFFDt work in a largescale pvp setting there is no effective method of making it so a single ship is able to tank a large gang of enemy ships without making its tanking ability extremely overpowered but on the other side of the coin a number of ships have active tanking bonuses where they are only able to fully maximize their potential when in a active tanking fit the problem with armor repair bonuses is that the resistance bonus on similar ships is nearly or as effective in the same active tanking role so what do we do do we boost these active tanking bonuses while increasing the chance of making them overpowered in order to be more effective in that specific role than the resistance bonuses but still leave the ships still relatively unseen in larger fleets or do we just scrap the active tanking bonuses in preference of the resists and start seeing higher occurrences of new ships participating in gang warfare and potentially new fleet compositions while at the same time still have the same participation of ships in pve and smallscale pvp iUFFFDm pretty sure everyone can agree that the latter is the better alternative let us then increase the scale further to take a look at capitals specifically triage carriers and dreadnaughts both shipsUFFFD siege modules give bonus to local repair amount prevent remote repair or energy transfer and lock them in place for a fiveminute cycle on the smallscale they currently work moderately well as they are able to tank towers and small gangs until capacitor neutralization starts to occur however on the largescale both of these ships fail catastrophically dreads can only be fielded in the initial engagement of a tower and only stay on the field for a minimal amount of cycles without risking massive losses as soon as an enemy fleet shows up that is greater numbers than your subcap fleet can handle your dreads become next to useless in turning the tide of battle and are going to die if they get tackled or left in siege similarly numerous killmails from the recent wncfc conflict demonstrate that triage carriers are unable to function in largescale fleet engagements as high alpha will simple melt the carriers between rep cycles so again what do we do the first step to fixing these two capitals is to again move away from the active repair bonus on the siegetriage module in favor of a resistance bonus leave to duration bonus alone but switch the amount bonus to a comparable resistance increase that doesnUFFFDt stack similar to a damage control but what does this mean by adding resistances you are essentially increasing the amount of time a given amount of opponents need to burn through your tank you will no longer see a carrier or dread repping back their entire shield or armor in a single cycle but you are much less likely to see these same ships getting volleyed between reps an additional bonus of this change is that you are still getting a bonus from the triage module and the fuel used even before you turn on your repair mods and when you are no longer able to use them ie capped out a second step if the first proves insufficient in proving a place from these ships in large fleet engagements especially with the massive numbers of supers currently being fielded is to potentially allow remote repair on sieged dreads iUFFFDm not entirely sure if this would be the best idea for carriers these are committed assets and will live or die based on the success or failure of the fleet which is more than can be said for supercapitals in their current form even though you may have a massive fleet of capitals these ships still come down to each man against the entire enemy fleet all you can do is sit helplessly and hope that your fleet can kill more enemies than they can kill of yours the current system is a step away from the idea of group helping each individual become more than what they could be separately by making this change it shifts the dynamics of capital engagements from who has more to who has better tactics and provides a method in which smaller entities could potentially engage larger capital fleets and with superior tactics have the potential of winningtldr change active repair bonuses on ships and siege modules to resistance bonuses and potentially allow rr on sieged dreads in order to provide a larger selection of viable ships for gang warfare
disagree the active tanking bonus should remain but should also effect remote repair receivedrun the numbers it works perfectly resist bonus ships end up with better buffers but active bonus ships get slightly better defense efficiency under remote repair same should apply to both armor and shield
its an interesting concept but by changing this would not put a lot of ship with nothing but the same bonuses and there by eliminate the diversity a good example of what you are talking about is the megahypeabad comparison with all level 5 skillsa properly fit active mega can tank about 150 more dps then a hype and because of bonuses has better tracking then the hype with only a slight drop in over all damage dealt made up for ofc by the tracking bonuses you can compensate for the dps put out by the mega by replacing the faction antimatter with void and still have better tracking then the hypean abad can active tank about 100 less dps then a hype can however gains the tremendous advantage of being able to also buffer tank with extreme successso why ever use a hyperion that problem does need to be addressed other ships have similar problems in their respective counter parts tend vastly outclass themon this same line of discussion maybe some one could shed some light to me on why some ships get stupid bonuses that make no sense for the race ie gallente getting a falloff bonus or a minmatar getting an optimal should it not be considered that bonuses like these are 99 of the time worthless to the ship and there by making it unused in favor a ship that has bonuses that can all be used for its maximum effect
i ran the numbers for several different ships and it works out to at most an increase in 100 hps per guardian difference in rr when including the repair received bonus this still leaves the situation where the ship is lacking a bonus in any situation where it is not actively receiving reps from logi the benefit of the resists is that it is constant it decreases the chance that an enemy fleet is going to alphadps through you before reps can be applied because lets face it dying before you can react or influence the outcome isnt funin regards to thrysons comments you can have the same bonuses but still require vastly different tactics in how the ships are flown and used as an example you wouldnt fly a nighthawk into point blank range with the enemy but even without the resist bonus thats exactly where youd find the sleipnir because the weapons system influences how the ship needs to be flowim not sure what fitting youre using for that comparison guessing single rep fitting but this change would have zero impact on actual active tanking in regards to choosing the mega vs the hype it would be similar to the geddon vs abaddon currently in one would have better dps while the other would have better tank
defensive bonuses only really matter when youre taking damage yes less buffer means you can be alphad easier but the difference in buffer isnt all that great need to check when i get home from work as i have done a lot of research on thisremote repair received bonus would allow you to tank more long term whereas resist bonus would allow you to tank more short term alphathat seems to be a fair trade off
resist bonuses also make rr more effective let me show you whylet say an enemy ship is shooting your ship with 100 damage and your rr reps 100with armor resist bonus of 25 your enemys damage will be 75 leaving you with 25 extra hp when the rr is given you now have 125 instead of 100 with rr recieved bonus of 375 you will have 1375 let me show you1000 damage no bonus 1000100 10resist bonus 750100  75rr bonus 10001375  732000 damageno bonus 2000100  20resist bonus 1500100 15rr bonus 20001375  14510000 damageno bonus 10000100  100resist bonus 7500100  75rr bonus 100001375  73as you see the rr bonus is slightly better if it had a 375 bonus to rr received about 10 better than resist however resist also offers over 30 better buffer at the cost of slightly less local rep and rr received however we dont know if ccp plans to put bonus to rr received as a bonus in the gamelet us focus on bonus to local armor repair vs resist bonusarmor resist bonus local armor repair bonusresist bonuses offer youbetter buffer ehpbetter rr receivedbetter local reparmor repair only offers youbetter local replocal reps mean crap in large scale fightsarmor repair bonus is greatly inferior to armor resist bonus oh and buffer does matter since armor repairers repair at the end of the cycleactive shield tanking works since shield boosters are much stronger than armor repairers and it starts at the beginning of the cycle
stopped right there no single ship should be able to tank a large gang of enemy ships for any reason alsoarmor tanking works very wellthis is why everybody uses it
to your first statement i am using a dual rep tank on the mega and hype using dual large armor reps t2 everything in tank slots the differance between the mega and hype is so vast as the mega can also get a decent buff tank and has the traccking advantage as i statedto your second i think that you misunderstood what i was getting at with the bonuses a slep fit with auto cannons and using dps ammo still has no need for an optimal bonuses as it would benfit greatly from a fall off bouns intead if i am not mistaken the die most gets a fall off bonus but it would again benfit much more from an optimal making it slightly more useful or less terrible as the case may be i know a lot of ships have the oddball bonuses that bring almost nothing to the table in terms of usesry for poor writing on my phone and i hate texting
not supported i like the active tanking bonus on the gallente ships and do not feel removing this diversity improves the game is some balancing of active tank verses buffer required yes but this is not down to the active tank bonusi would be interested in a dual rep mega fit that can out tank a hype even a t2 dual rep a hype can tank 1100dps and has a extra mid for a tracking comp or webber can you post this please
not sure if you cant read or just trollingi think i see what youre trying to get at thryson in that even with the rep bonus the hyperion is only barely better at that role than the mega a ship that lacks a defensive bonus due to its slot layout the hype really does need to be looked at aside from its bonus as it is pretty underwhelming but that is a topic for another thread to address your example id say that weapon systems determine how ships need to be flown how i envision these ships flying in a balanced system is that the mega have higher dps but weaker tank than the hype but both faster and more maneuverable than their amarr counterpartsin regards to the optimal and falloff bonus im pretty sure they give close range ships like the diemost falloff bonuses as it increases the ships damage projection but without giving it a larger area in which it can deal maximum damage as a means of limiting blasters which are statistically the highest dps guns
the 100m sp bittervet will most likely already have the prerequisites at 5 maybe 4 so if he wants to fly it shortly after release he will no matter what if he respecs he might get a 1month headstart for flying a ship that is going to be in the game for yearsand besides ccp could just limit new stuff so that it cannot be respecced intohow do you feel about remapsalso there is no minmatar hac skill
no respec awful fin idea leave that stuff to wow
op hides in dark corner and cries read and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
a wise man once saidwow holds your hand from level 1 to 80 and even if your not smart enough to do anything once there they still give you a cookie eve not only takes your cookie but laughs at you for bringing onethere is no end game to eve and there should be no remap
true but did you remember when they introduced  pi  gas mining  noctisthose are just an example of new stuff that are available to new player almost from the begginingi will not argue that many hilevel new stuff will always have vets in better position to use them  truei use remaps because they are there i have mixed filling about using them i agree that the moment theyve removed ability to choose skills as you make new char it was inevitableas for hac skills  touche read and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
1 no respecs unless skills are being completely removed from game especially not because fotm changed ffs
if it were there id use it and be glad to get all those industrial skills off my sheet id already be in a proteus if i could respec a few skills if it never comes about im fine with that toothe key word here is limited a limited respec to allow people to respec 12 million sp to correct noob mistakes or occupation changes wouldnt be a bad thing being able to respec from a miner to a carrier pilot in a daythat would be gamebreaking edit i wasnt around before there were attribute remaps but ive got to say its stupid to not have those a new player shouldnt be punished for choosing an attribute set on day 1 that turns out to not fit at all with the play style they developed over six months of play my view on skill respecs is the same i trained a lot of industrial and science skills before i realized those werent what i wanted to do longterm the opportunity to recover wasted sp would be welcome
my point being that i am not going to freak out about the possible consequences of something we know nothing about yet they said they had an idea for a limited sp respec thats itother than that we know nothing no need to freak out about it we dont even know what they have in mind for the word limited what if they implement it in such a way that in order to refund the sp you have to unlearn it by spending the same amount of time unlearning as you did learning it maybe even set it so that during that time you would not be able to learn other skills while unlearning anotherhow could you argue to that spend the time to refund sp and use that sp to put it into something you could have spend the time learning if you hadnt been unlearningif you say that wouldnt work for any reasonyou are an idiot
i now agree that respecing into new gamechangers is bad so my updated position is that new stuff should be offlimits for 23 months or maybe based upon how long it would take to train normally iterations such as giving infinipoints to supercarriers could be included in this limitthere should also be a limit to how many sp maybe 5m per year 500k per month or similar that can be respeced as i wrote earlier just to get my full position downi can respec that hUFFFDhUFFFD
i see what you did there read and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
eve is a game in a competitive market as the market is constantly changing so eve should be constantly developing thats the facts of business if tinkering with sp appeals to the market then tinkering there will be if there are other mmos who do or are doing something similar then its natural that eve will do the same
there are and there are tones wow comes to mind and any other clone but what drove people toward eve was that in here there is notread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
and then ill respec my player into azeroth then eat a bullet because im playing wow thats why alot of people play eve it doesnt follow the market its dark and brutal and mistakes count for something here if you make a mistake and blowup you lose your ship forever you cant wait 15min and get it back our choices count for something good or bad and we have to live with them that is what makes eve so great tough st that you skill trained like a noob for 2 months maybe you should have found a corp to teach you what to skill train earlierno respec for nurfs respec only for skills removed from the game you dont like it go play with your barbie dolls
in light of the recent freakout reactions to ccps post about the sp respec idea i propose the followinga new option in training called unlearn instead of learning a skill you can choose to unlearn one instead doing so prevents you from learning anything else during that time on all characters the refund of sp would be a 1 to 1 ratio and could later be assigned to whatever skill you wantthis woud purely give you the option to remove skills you have no desire of using while expending the exact same amount of time as training any other skill wouldedit change to the proposal for unlearning to take half the time of learning so that some time is wasted vs just learning another skill but still leaves the option to unlearn a skill you dont want and refund 100 of the sp

thread 986144091784987127460 on disbanding the csm
you are always good for a laugh my man
none of the disband the csm threads really list anything that csm 6 has done wrong they just whine about the fact that less than half of the csm members are part of large nullsec alliances hint the majority are not its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
of course they dont dude that would require effort and totally negate their baseless whine postsnoone asked for my opinion on what was discussed in iceland between ccp and the csm but as a rational human being i can read and see that the changes proposed benefit all eve playersheres a tip instead of crying about noone listening to your thoughts on game play mechanics how about post them here so we can all see what you want to change
what is this  grow a pair
as it stands right now radars and ded rated nondrone complexes and to a lesser extent ladars most kspace explorers skip em because gas harvesting is considered a pita by them but its no big deal for wspace types popping out into kspace are profitable mags gravs and rogue drone or nondedrated complexes are pretty much worthless though but for different reasons magnetometric sites drop junk salvage most of the time even some of the t2 salvage parts they drop arent worth that much isk if one wanted to increase t2 salvage inflows this would be the place to do it at although an overall rig rebalance would do more to help the situation gravimetric sites are worthless because the moneys either in bulk lowends or in small quantities of highends abcm ores between those two extremes arent very good perhaps heavily defended grav sites containing small amounts of highish ends such as bistot and crokite might be a good idea arkonor and mercoxit could be added for low00 versions along with more stuff to fight through of course rogue drone complexes dont drop anything useful drone loot nerfed itself into the ground a long time ago and the overseertype loot you get from them is not worth much either fixing this would require either a a serious rework of augmented and integrated drones b the introduction of module drops into rogue drone combat complexes such as faction dronerelated modules or c just removing the complexes altogether i frankly have no idea why nonrelated complexes exist they usually involve rogue drones it seems and are complete rubbish anyway except maybe for a faction spawn on a related note why is kspace gas 10m3unit it isnt worth nearly as much as c540
the presence of highends or even midends if youre truly fanatical about balance in hisec is a bad ideayou might think but it will be more profitable for me right now and that might be right but then consider that there are thousands of other players who play the same way you do if high ends become available in hisec they will be exploited mercilessly and the value of those ores will dropthe low value of gravimetric sites is due to the number of people flooding the market with zeroeffort ores they mine while watching tv doing housework or even playing other games the way to fix the severely depressed minerals market is not to add more minerals to hisec that will only make the problem worse to get more value from the ore you mine the ore you mine must be worth mining which means that theres less of it to mine ideally it would also require more effort than simply warping to a belt and starting the lasers returning attention to the game once in a blue moon to move stuff from the hulk to the orcaas for mag sites there has been some discussion about salvage alchemy where by some process players can convert vast quantities of t1 salvage to t2 salvage if such a thing happens i can see the opportunity to introduce more t1 salvage into the game until there is some mechanism in place to consume vast quantities of t1 salvage adding more salvage through exploration would be a bad ideaother opportunities would include switching rogue drones from dropping drone poo to dropping  salvaging special components which are used to produce dronerelated implants rigs and modules i prefer this idea to straight out bountiesi agree with your comments about gas though lower volume would lead to easier extraction which would lead to cheaper booster production there arent enough drug pushers in hisec we need more
why dont you just make it that once the mom site has spawned no more other sites spawn that way the incursion cant be left open for days to be farmed
i strongly support thisit is not fair to the rest of the eve community for incursion runners to be able to farm them and refuse to pop the mothership leaving the constellation rendered disabled for weeks possibly to those who argue it is somehow not a fair stance to take that they should not be farmable how does it fit into the lore that the incentive for players should be to never allow the incursions to be defeated in some cases people are actually taking action to prevent the defeat of the mothership this is obviously not the way the feature was intended to be used if not a hard limit i would support any sort of strong incentive to kill the mothership i mean after all isnt that the whole point of fighting an incursion
nerf tech moons
no i have never heard of t1 cruisers killing at a 1 to 1 ratio 5 billion isk ships is this some sort of wierd incursion thing or were you wardecked and just really bad at pvp honestly in any scenario i can think of if you lose 50 billion isk in ships to an equal sized gang of t1 cruisers you deserve to explodeyou are doing it wrong also this is kind of an issue with the horrible nap fest that null is evolving towardsas opposed to nullsec or even lowsec where every neut that wanders into your space actually is trying to kill you yeah tech moons are kind of bullshit because its only the power block leaders who see any benefit from them all the front line grunts just have to fight over themi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
already happened just not for sopa
already wrote both congress and the senate
filled out and shared on facebooksummary of eves last four expansions
weapon ambit extension rigs are bastard stepchildren their 15 or 20 bonus to falloff has been worthless ever since the te buff and probably for longer too it might even be the smallest falloff bonus in eve doubling this bonus would put it right on par with what locus coordinators do for optimal with respect to scripted tracking computers or tracking enhancers t1 locus rig  scripted t2 tcte t2 locus rig  awesome almost too awesome
alternatively drop the calibration to 50 so that it can be used where calibration is tighterin fact i would question why the calibrations for all weapon rigs are the same across weapon types when some rigs are much more useful to certain weapon systems
to hell with you bears i was against removing learning skills and i am sure as hell against my implants being taken away i spent almost 2 months as a noob training learning skills so that i would one day have an advantage over someone that was impatient and i worked to buy my learning implants for the same damn reason i was filled with glee when the put implants on the killmails so that i could really see how much that hurt the other guybottom line if your not willing to work to get your implants or your not willing to take a risk by putting them in your head then you need to get stuffed because you dont deserve to own what i worked for and you did not kill me to takeif they are going to change anything it needs to be jc timers and not by simply cutting them down you need to buy a skill and spend some damn time to train it this is eve and you dont rate to have free  you work for it you kill for it and you die for it that is what makes eve different and if you dont like it go play wowrespectfully submitted
ban npc corp forum alts from csm forums
actually this is my main just closed our corp yesterday tuvm
what risk is there to a player with implants that stays in high sec and avoids pvp the problem with learning implants is that those that engage in pvp or other activities that put their pods at risk are inclined not to put high end learning implants in their active clone because of the risk of losing them resulting in slower learning time than someone who takes no risks at all in short learning implants promote risk aversion especially for non veterans with loads of things that they want trained yesterdaylearning skills were even worse as many players wouldnt play eve at all with a character until they had completed them and it was a very big disincentive to new players to even bother trying eve was very glad to see them go
proof they are being removed or please kindly stfups and just like your decshield exploit thread that was an insult to intelligencenot supporting stop the evemail spam
you again with another dumb thread thryson no carebears to gank in hi sec todayagain another thread that only addresses the issue from one side ie yoursits ok for you thryson you will never leave hi sec so you cant be podded unless its one of your lame ass wardecs on miners that wont stand a chance against your t3s so your implants are still safe eh some of us actually go looking for fairer fights in null and low where the chances of loosing implants goes up rather dramatically rather than grief noobs in hi secmost sane pilots in lownull dont use implants as you will see if you look at the kbsso why should we suffer because youre lame and wont leave hi secit was only a proposal on these boards anyway but again you get all bent out of shape over someone trying to benefit all players not just themselvesnot supported
i started to say i was agianst thisuntil i got my ass podded escorting a freighter fleet in coughcoughfacoughcough space and was summarily poddedaccidentally forgot i was wearing 4sso yeahim disinclined to acquiesce to the dont remove learning implants from the game campas we now live in branchbit hard to get replacements out here stop the evemail spam
sucks dude i heard about the jf convoy that was ahem ambushed on someones jbsif the learning implants were done away with these things wouldnt happen and people would be more inclined to pew pew instead sit out a good fight or ambush because they dont want to risk the 1bil in their headsethats not to say we should remove implants altogether keep the pirate implants and what have you just remove the learning part has no real use now that learning skills are gone
my cheap clone is a 5 attribute set id like to keep implants as well there is nothing wrong with paying isk to gain a skill training speed advantage if you have your way and get them removed next youll want damage hardwirings to be deleted so that guys like me dont get a dps advantage over you after that youll want faction mods deleted because i can afford to pvp with them and you cant and then finally after ive left the game because of these changes youll leave too because some other guy newbier than you proposed that anything above a t1 cruiser should be deleted because people flying better stuff keeps him from pvpingi also agree that the removal of learning skills probably wasnt the best move even though i personally gained from that change
it is not about getting bent out of shape over a trivial issue it is about what it opens the door too that you think that you deserve somthing you dont have to work for or risk to own because you dont like it the real trolls on the fourms are people that sit here and ask to get free stuff all day
that wasnt a jf convoy matethat was a freighter convoyno jump drives and op  heysmartassproof or stfu stop the evemail spam
what you are also asking for is all the benifits of high sec in null if you do that youmight as well make missions make as much as null complexes a nd allow corps to fight for control of high sec oh and maybe there should be no local like in wormholes while we are at it everyone should recieve a free replacement ship of the same class they lose in combat and we all need 500 million free exp ect ect ect yeah this seems like a good idea
yet again you whine and cry without proof stop the evemail spam
what do you need as proof drake that was an exaggerated statment to emphize how insane it is to ask for stuff you dont have to work for or own
your proposal indicates they are getting removedwhere is the ing proof stop the evemail spam
let me restate my postion as you are correct and i mis titled this is a counterproposal as there is no dislike button or actual way of stating how much and why people dont support somthingother than reading pages and pages of posts and adding them manually i saw this as a valid way to counter the other proposal to remove learning implants i changed the title accordingly
its called i dont like thisnot supportinghow hard is that stop the evemail spam
you right there is not a lot of risk it does happen from time to time i lost a large ammount of implants recently because of a bad descision i made but what you asking for is more benfits of high sec in null all 3pvp zones have advantages and disadvantages to take away one and award it to the others is asking too much and that is what i dont agree with
there is no way of know how many people do not like it other than adding it up manually on a post that has upwards of 2000 responses that can be tedious
what business of it is yours to know who or whatthat is for ccpcsm to deal withnot youyou state your opinionand move onargue if you feel its ncessarymake a new proposalbut dont doubletripple thraed a idea out of stupidity stop the evemail spam
i would like to open this up to everyone opinionfirst off i believe that every corp should keep their right to joinleave an alliance at will free war dec for thryson odec shield is a really interesting idea even if can prove disruptive i dont have anything against it directly what i do have a problem with is if you target a corp for what ever reason you have lets say they have a pos you want to take down then they should not be allowed to endlessly jump in and out of any alliance to avoid the conflict it is so obviously cheating the way the system works that it should not even need to be brought up in discussion yet i find myself here after getting rejected petitions to see what the rest of you think
hey thrysonsucks having the orca exploit changed on you dude no more t3s ejected when fighting eh you have a bit of a cheek whining about exploits dudealso your post is a bit contradictoryyou say first that you believe that corps should keep the right to joinleave alliances at will then go on to whine that they shouldnt be allowed to do this when you want to kill a pospersonally i am ok with the dec shield idea why should some carebears that youve griefed give you free kills on their possthis sounds more like a whine thread that you are being denied kills in hi secmove to lownull sec and you dont even need a wardec to remove a pos simples
well i would like to behave like and an adult here as we are not in game and you seem to be taking you loss pretty hard even months laternow the orca exploit was never an exploit however the majority of people felt like it was and was changed accordingly i never complained after it was changed because it could be used in an unfair way like dodging a fight completelyalso if you would read in context what i wrote you would understand you should be able to join and leave alliances but to do it over and over is where i have the problem what it comes down to is if you have a pos set up be prepared to defend it not hide behind a game mechanic that needs attentionfighting is not just for low and null high sec is as free game as anywhere else just with a slightly different set of rules concord dose not exist to protect it is there to punish
still a contradictionif you believe that corps should be allowed to leavejoin alliances at will why have a restriction on how many times they can do itagain you are just butthurt that you cant grief a carebear corp and rack up some easy killsone more point if ccp have already answered your petitions and knocked you back why are you wasting our time with thisccp arent going to do anything so seems lame that you come here whining when you already have the answer
this is bullcrap only pussies go after high sec corps recruiting noobs for easy kills grow a pair
im with the peanut gallery this smells bull all over itsoundly rejectingyou cannot and will not make changes to war decs without balancing the booksboth the agressor and the agressed must gain equal benefitsdrawbacksnot only one partyccp has clearly stated itdec sheild is not an exploit not to say i approvebut im not about to rock the boat on this subject eitherdont like itim sorryim fresh out of tissuesi hear theres this game called hello kitty onlineps smiling menaceim starting to really enjoy your posts stop the evemail spam
lol thanks dude
simple introduce a cooldown timer that increases the time it takes for a person joins a corporation within the span of a month then do away with npc corps and make people individually deccable after 34 corp hops the time itll take for the guy to rejoin another corp and invalidate the war will be longer then the reinforcenment timer
see that is an actual soultion nicolo it is not about what you believe about high sec war decs what it comes down to is that it is n aspect of the game that many people enjoy it
firstly i am dec shield i run dec shield dec shield should be considered an exploit what we do is wrong and i dont agree with ccps decision to let it be legal the ability for highsec towers to be made invulnerable through the exploitloophole that we abuse is completely unfair and imbalancedand yes i am completely serious
this is literally genius become the thing you hate to highlight how terribly terribly wrong it is ccp take note golfclap
second golf clap
so you dont much care for having more people to shoot but want it declared an exploit again because you dont get to grind static ehp with limited returns except against absolute beginners who dont know that bpos never have to leave a stationsuggestion hire yourself out to the next offensive null entity that invades a region with lots of infrastucture  that way you get all the ehp grind you could ever want and a bit of spending money on top
nothing wrong with dec shield except that ive heard that some people are able to maintain them at a fraction the cost they should be if you want to spend your own money on wardecs to raise the cost of wardecs against you thats fine if you game the system so that you arent spending the required money to maintain your own wardecs then youre exploiting the game and doing something that obviously is against the intent of the game designscraping however should be considered an exploit when a corp is able to raise the cost of a wardec against themselves and immediately invalidate that wardec by joining and leaving an alliance it gives them the ability to not only completely evade wars but to also cost any wouldbe enemies a substantial amount of iskive posted my solution many times make the wardec follow the intended party dont pass it off on an alliance problem solved
this discussion invariably breaks into the same lines of argument quoting myself from similar threads
here is an easy soultion maybe not the best but ill take a shotyou drop an alliance that is at war the dec stays with you for the same time left on the alliance dec this allows individual corps to come to terms with the aggressor on a small scale
i prefer my idea of sticky wardecs allow corps to be directly targeted even inside an alliance if they drop or are kicked from the alliance the alliance gets the 24 hour cooldown periodthis way if my corp wardecs a rival corp they cant scrape it off onto an alliance and if the goal is to destroy certain pos towers in high sec the corp owning them can be targeted and would be unable to evade the wardec by dropping
to build on what mara said yea you cannot make a bear fight but that is their choice and i dont believe that needs any attention i find plenty of pvp in high sec and when there r no wars we roam low and wormholes nothing reply needs to be changed in that respect but to have a game mechanic that allows someone to completely avoid any fighting ever is wrong war stinulats the economy in eve with out losses there is no demand and all types of pvp drive this large scale wars in null are good for mass orders low and high sec skirmishes drive a demand for specialized ships bot often used in large fleets eve gqnks drive the demand for replacement faction gear and mining ships
how would war dec fees work
just as they do now or at least any changes would be independent of my idea if you dec a member of an allianceor the entire alliancethen you pay alliancelevel fees
hi ccp the system for standing is great when you use the nbsi in 00 but its about a crazy job when you play in nrdscan you add to eve gate the possibility to import or export the some standing file exemple xmlthat will be great because now if you would like to go in providence with the nrds is a crazy job to set all standing
dumbest idea ive seen in a while just dumb you should be ashamed
so this ship just gets killed first then
im drafting a full stat layout now should be able to provide more information by sunday
i really like this idea the orca bay doesnt cut it and your very limited when packaging rigged ship in courier contracts for freighters 1i would also like to see a tech 2 version with a jump drive like jump freighters you can limit the space a little bit for the needed fuel bay maybe make the t1 version fit 4 rigged tier 3 bss and the tech 2 version 3 i could care less if they are allowed to enter high sec or not if you want to make it a new cap i dont think there would be any objection to adding this its not a combat ship cant fit any mods cant deploy ships in space no maintenance hangar and its another cap target for people to hunt
good points all around i still think its going the long way around to get to where you want to go but i see your thinking what if the ship had an array of bonuses for each level in racial industrial like a bonus to shields for each level of one race and a a bonus to armor for another align time for another etc does that just invite abuse it would make people who have cross trained a lot more powerful potentially but really when you consider the nature of the ship it doesnt seem so bad no high slots and only a couple low and medium slots doesnt sound like this could be turned into a war machine  its a tug ive never really understood why there are so few ships that dont fall neatly into a factions category id prefer to see a big pile of ships that arent built to fit the stereotypes of a given racei still support your idea this just seems more like an ore ship from my rp point of view
agree with op 1
agree with you on everything but the last bit which i have supported elsewhere i can see a use for limited mass stabilization of wormholes using player anchored gatesstructures these would require fuel of course and function like a pos in that fashion and also be capable of being destroyed no reinforcement timerzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
i have to disagree with the poster above me with all due respect sirremember twostep isnt the only csm with a familiarity with whsmeissa anunthiels blog  ahhhh just to stir the pot a bit and maybe get whers stirred up and involved in the process from the blog the interesting bit to whers herei have my own opinion of these statements however for the moment i prefer to think it through rather than post before i have considered everything which is a bit of change for me lastly i dont know if im remembering this correctly but there was some speculation that the mechanicmodule whatever that sansha was using to form incursion wormholes was something that was going tomight be put into play generally in eve cant remember where i read that so it might just have been uninformed rambling
yeah im with you on most of this stuffkeep whs for the small corps1
yeah ive read the blog i know she has some experience since she is from rnk and some rnk corps tag along when guilotine therapy roams wormholes but she is still nullsec representative and not wh representativehowever until she will show us her well his magnificent great idea im going to assume the end result will cause larger blobs in whs  and whs are all about small scale pvp i of course can imagine that there is a solution that will be acceptable for both sidesapart from main subject i dont agree with rest of what she wrote regarding whs so in other words no for podding yes for sleepers atacking playersposesetc in spaceread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
about t3 and command ship  bonuses being swapped i disagreea t3 does have a better bonus but it can only mount and use one link at a time while a command ship can use three links at a time in order to get a t3 to use more link you have to sacrifice any essence of tank to do so especially for shield ships as command processors are mid slots t3 must use defensive subsystems sacrifices its own tank for better boosts creating a greater loss of tanka command ship are able to mount 3 links without sacrificing anything and they are given tanking bonuses  damnation with its 5 resist and 10 armor hp bonuses vulture with 5 resist and 10 shield hp bonuses t3s dont have sucha commandship is able to fit more link than a t3 ever will  therefore t3s and cs are balanced with each other t3 can give stronger but less type of bonuses a cs give weaker but more types of bonuses a command ship is able to tank and fight on the field with its fleet as well therefore it has an advantage over t3scs need to be looked at see the claymore and eos with their pathetic active lol tank bonuses
i am ambivalent about the suggestion of limiting gang link effects to ongrid onlyone the one hand i appreciate the all ships contributing to a battle should be vulnerable argument but on the other hand i dont necessarily agree that ships need to be ongrid to contribute eg carriers fightersalso capital ships with gang link capability also need to be in the discussion although rarely used beyond the rorqual since they have less bonuses than fleet command or t3perhaps the whole gang link mechanic could do with an overhaul eg retain offgrid give capitals bonusesfinally a simpler fix would be to just remove the command processor module hey presto no 6link ships no t3 alts fleet command ships get back their eminence in gang bonuses it wouldnt stop possedup fleet command alts of course but its a move towards balance
am i allowed to bump again
i fought in and on plexes yesterday this happenedkill 1loss 1loss 2kill 2if youll notice thats 3 separate systems that plexing was occurring in i realize that you color your plexing is a pve activity with the word primarily i think that since the recent update with more plexes spawning its shifted a fair bit toward the pvp side
garr thanks for posting that looks like a pretty good run and exactly what i would like out of eve when i say i think we should be able to get about 47 fights per 2 hours some people say that is crazy but i think you might agree that with some tweaking it could be possible at least its worth striving for let me try to clarify what i am getting at with this proposal i think using plexes is the best way in eve to get small scale pvp fights so i am always a big proponent of people giving fw a try and using the plex mechanics to get fights however if you want to actually plex in order to gain the most occupancy under the current mechanics you are better off doing it pve stylethe goal of this proposal is to make it so the best way to gain the most occupancy would require lots of small scale pvp that is why the notification system is key i went out the other night and did some plexing now i use plexes in order to get fights not really to get occupancy let me explain how each is differentusing plexes for for fights1go to a system with lots of wartargets and open a plex 2 move away from the button and rats so they dont cut into your tank and force you to warp out if someone comes3 dont actually capture the plex even if you are not getting a fight then leave the beacon up and try a different system that way that plex is open for you to come back to laterplexxing in order to actually change occupancy1 go to an empty system  again getting pvp may result in me having to leave the plex or having to reship this just slows plexing down 2 run the plex in a pve ship so that you can run the largest variety of plexes if i fit a frigatedestroyer for pve i can run many more types of plexes than if i fit anything for pvpnow know plexing doesnt have consequences and people have pretty much abandoned plexing other than to get a fight but when i first started people still held on to the idea that occupancy was the goalbtw i think occupancy should be the goal of fw so what i did was i fit pve ships and did plexing here is the type of ships we would use
they discourage people from playing eve youre still paying your subscription sure but youre not playing the game you dont want to jump to your emptycombat clone and lose a day of optimal training so you can have some fun and then have to jump back to your training clone the next dayyou can have fun even in your learning implants clone what youre saying here is that you dont want to risk them youre asking for convenience here not balance the risk vs reward balance already existsthis affects nullsec especially wormhole players doubly so  losing your ship in a bubble is a surefire way to get podded people in empire still have a better chance of warping their pods out of harms way and thus have no qualms about running missions or otherwise flying in space with their implants unless of course they are at war that however is not our playstyleyour playstyle as i stated youre complaining that the game doesnt work the way you want it tothey are seeded exclusively through lp stores rather than being made ingame entirelyso are faction ships and modules but you see people flying with those in nullseccharacters that need pirate faction implants for any reason supercapital pilots with slavenomad sets freighterjf pilots with nomads etc are essentially stuck with 3s but this isnt about pirate implantsyou get to choose what bonuses you want out of your implants more armor hp lower sig radius more agility or faster learning speed you have choices here and youre complaining that you cant have more than one
you sure love learning implants lawl its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
sure i do they let me learn faster and i believe that a bonus like that should stay the way it is a choice between learning ship boosts or simply not risking implants out on the field
no the game rewards risk averse play a lot already and its absolutely not needed its just a barrier for engaging in risky yet fun activities when i had a couple spare hours when my character was younger i used to go look for a fight in a 8m fit rifter i met random guys doing so we blew each other up and it was funbut i wont do that now with 5s there are tons of skills id need trained for yesterday and i wont give up one day of learning bonuses for a 30 min roam so you have one less solo pvper in space and im sure im not the only oneand with veterans it only gets worse you may have more money available but you can only have so much clones ie so much implants sets and you may need so much different sets carrier clone slave set nano clone snake set incursion clone high sec learning  hardwire implants racial pvp logi low grade racial sensor strength  low cost combat clone 3s or 4s of intelmem or perwil depending on you training list goes onand the medical alone can cost more than your ship hullall this puts off people from engaging in risky activities which is bad for the game and the other players the most people in space to meet  fight the betterremove the learning implants lower  remove the medical clone price
bravo and well said the removal of learning implants will vitalize pvp and thats why i support it arguments about risk aversion are purely idealistic and have little practical merit everybody has different thresholds of isk theyre willing to risk lowering the minimum cost of a pod loss is only going to bring more people out into areas where their pod is at risk if you cant feel the thrill without an expensive clone nobody is forcing you to fly a cheap clone simple as that if youre afraid that lowincome plebs will suddenly have an advantage over your rich ass well you can spend all the isk used for implants on hardwirings pirate implants faction loot etc to give yourself the advantageand if youre a highsec bear thats afraid of losing the privilege of flying with his hardearned 5s that hell most likely never lose you can go jump into a lake for all i care
i am sure that quite a lot of people here disagree with the proposal just because a goon posted it so they think there simply has to be some secret evil agenda behind it funny how far this hatred can go id like to apologize for the poor quality of the post above and sincerely hope you didnt waste your time reading it yes i do feel bad about it
im sure quite a lot of people here will ignore all the downsides that have been clearly pointed out to this proposal and think people who dont like the proposal must just have something against the goonsmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
obvious goonswarm testicle troll is obviousobvious mittani link is obviousnobody cares what you think
now what a kind person you aremaybe i wouldnt care about my opinion too if i were you but i do care about the proposal because i think it is a very good idea and would help me a desperate carebear that got stuck in highsec forever a great deal to have more fun in evethe main argument people are posting here is evil 00 alliances would profit from it true everybody would profit so i am against it they would rather see that nobody gets such a nice benefit since the mere idea that their hated archenemies would get the same benefit is just unbearable for them i am in no way affiliated with the goons i know nothing about 00 politics and i do not care to be honesti would personally profit if learning implants were removed thats why i support the idea and i do not mind if other people profit as well i wouldnt even mind if they profited slightly more than mei would be free to get some casual pvp in lowsec whenever i want thats all that matters to mehave a nice day id like to apologize for the poor quality of the post above and sincerely hope you didnt waste your time reading it yes i do feel bad about it
could you please sum up these downsides because so far i have read mostly the risk vs reward argumentie you play without implants no risk no reward or you play with risk and rewardbut you do not mention the third option you dont play so you still get the reward and have no risk how can that be good for the game if a mechanic makes some people prefer not playing it is a bad mechanicim not against implants but since the learning ones are so good they are needed by everyonejust like the learning skills what did you use to say to a new player in his very first days  train your learning skills and train cybernetics 1 by the way here are 3swant an example  easy page 1 or a ts3 discussion from a random renter corp deep in 00  player a  hey  theres a 6men roam coming our way lets swarm them with a 10men t1 frigs  player b  nah my jc is still on cooldown and my medical costs 10 times the frigate player a  hmm so we can go with 10 bcs  do we have logistics pilots  player c  sorry i have only 1 bc left here and my wallet is down to 40m so ill just stay dockedreally how can this be good for the game 
seriously if you cant have your skills training at less than the absolute optimal for a 24 hour time period of jump cloning you are a bit too obsessive compulsive to be doing pvp anyway you need to loosen your grip if you want to have fun pvping in eve and based on your attitude toward skill training you are way too uptight things dont always go exactly as you would like among others you forgot the argument that there are trillions of isk in learning implants going into the eve economy erasing that from the economy will all but kill every lp store in eve sorry there is no reason to kill a large part of the game in order to cater to the crowd that is ridiculously uptight about learning also if you would like to pvp there are low sec options that do not have bubbles so you can usually warp your pod out but nice strawmanmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
did you know some people prefer not to pvp because they may lose a shipso lets use your logicpvp may cause people to lose a shipsome people prefer not to pvp because they may lose a shiptherefore pvp is a bad mechanicnice lets just make it impossible for players to attack eachotheryour reasoning is baddownsides1 it will kill the already floundering lp stores2 how exactly is ccp going to reimburse people who paid a tone of isk for learning implants that are now worthless3 it will be a huge isk sink that is lost4 it will be a large area of the market and economy will just all of a sudden stricken why well because people want bubbles to hold pods and others dont want to train a bit slower for 24 hours sorry thats not really all that greatagain just make it so bubbles dont hold pods and your problem to the extent there is one is solved make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
pretty sure that if they remove learning implants they will likely give us stat boosts to cover the missing 5 to each skill
yeah but what about the people who paid isk for the set are they going to be treated the same as those who didnt this proposal seems to do thatwhen they removed learning skills they gave the sp back so people who invested time in the learning skills were reimbursed and those who didnt werent giving everyone the benefit of something only some paid for is not really more fair than simply taking the benefit away entirely it just makes the dumb happy might as well give everyone a hundred million skill points yaymake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
so uh who are you its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
no its not my point is that people have enough incentive to avoid risks already and the learning implants are an unnecessary burden they prevent certain people to participate in some parts of the game which is badhell it doesnt even changes anything to the outcome of a fight since they are not combatrelated what does it change that your target has or hasnt attribute enhancers so the lp store is floundering  really  you have data behind that  if so how can this represent a large area of the market  and why would economy stricken the isk sink will not change  people will still use their lp which will sink the same amount of iskregarding the reimbursement i dont care they didnt want to reimburse skillbooks because it would inject lots of fresh isk in the game which would have caused inflation if they give lpisk for the implants i suppose you can buy another item in the lp store so the operation is neutral for the inflation but im sure this can be sorted out im not an economy specialist and this is not the topic here which brings me tonone of the points you bring are actually related to the implants themselves  if they are issues they can be solved in a completely independant wayi have yet to read a real reason against such a change other than i worked hard for something now i want everyone to suffer the same way i did
this seems like a great way to use existing features but i think only pilots not flagged as pirates or with active gcc could issue a mayday and no pirates could see the resulting beacon as for the beacon it would disappeared when the ship issuing the mayday is blown upfurthermore a message could appear in local up to a few systems around indicating a mayday call people could disable mayday calls from their chat and for those that do not the chat line would just say concord reports mayday in systemfor the sake of the story concord would simply not relay pilots flagged as pirates 5 or less due to their known current status for those that want a storybased explanationlast but not least each pilot would only have one mayday call per day to avoid spamming those
distress signals that may or may not be traps are a wonderful scifi staple remove the sec status requirement anybody can warp to them have their own overview category so you can mitigate spam and it could certainly be funheck have npc distress signals like the beacons weve got now but dynamic some legitimate transports under attack by rats some traps fun for all
1bounty hunting fix is long overdue and should have been done before learning to walk in stations
1 although ill probably be on the wrong end of this more often then not
you see it to extreme nobody is able to deny payout it is a insignificant reduction  it would be an exploit if it would remove more isk from the bounty on the bad guys head than the payout which was given to the hunter this is not the casesecondly uninsurable ship modules are in the ship formula includedthirdly its only one part of the bill the second part is the pod everyone is aiming for anywayadditionally this is only an optional implementation detail which can be solved in multiple ways this was only an example for a possible implementation a much simpler tuning option would be to reduce the safety multiplier for the payout as you already mentioned eg to 50 or interpolate between both  substract 50 of the insurance but use a 70 multiplier
why should one not be allowed to sit afk cloaked that space is not yours everyone should be allowed to sit in any part of the space as long as he is cloaked
so is there an actual argument for keeping the active tanking bonus aside from i like them and theoretically decreased diversity ill repeat again even with the same bonuses you wouldnt fly the nighthawk in the same way you fly a sleipnir just in the same way blasters require different techniques for success than pulse lasers obviously you wouldnt close to zero with lasers when facing blasters so while you are decreasing diversity within the bonuses you are creating more diversity in the fleets that people are going to use as more ships become effective for largescale pvpas a sidenote this defensive bonus could be switched to a percentage of shieldarmor capacity if you wanted to maintain the diversity within bonuses but really that type of bonus goes more with amarrcaldari than gallenteminmatar
your math confuses me as im not sure what your understanding of the resist bonus isdo you understand that the bonus doesnt just add 25 to each armour resist but 25 of the remainder of that particular resist this means that your damage received isnt reduced by 25 but an average of 168 this also means that your overall ehp doesnt increase by 25 but actually by just under 14 abbadon used to get figures other ships may be slightly different example abaddonlevel 5 pilot  no amarr bs skill and unfittedem 50 th 35kin 25exp 20ehp  37810level 5 pilot unfittedem 62  increase of 25 of 50 effective 12th 513  increase of 25 of 65 effective 163kin 438  increase of 25 of 75 effective 188exp 40  increase of 25 of 80 effective 20ehp  43057 an increase of 139now that we have that out of the way the resist bonus vs the rep bonus if it was to also apply to remote repair receiveda lvl5 guardian pilot repairs 384 armour every 5s with each lg rr moduleif the repair amount received was bonused the guardian would be repairing 528 armour every 5slets assume the guardian is fitted with 4 lg rr modules4x384 1536 armour every 5s unbonused4x528 2112 armour every 5s bonusedthat extra 600 armour per cycle is really going to help but lets consider fitted ships and the difference between the two i am going to use the abaddon vs the hyperion as theyre both armour and the abaddon is considered 733t and the other the hype5h1te because of the  bonuslevel 5 pilots and buffer tanked fits no fleet bonuses gang links or implantsabaddon 165979hyperion 133908the hyperion has 19 less ehp than the abaddon or the abaddon has 24 more than the hyperion however you want to look at itdefence efficiency with one guardian using all 4 lg reppers but no dronesabaddon1216hyperion1268 inc 375 rep bonus proposedthe hyperion ends up with approx a 42 better tank now this may not sound like very much but on a very large scale lets say a fleet using 10 guardians the hyperion can tank over 600 dps more than the abaddonagain i dont believe this to be enough and i do think that the armour rep bonus should be increased to 9bs level as this would scale far better when used like thisso i would propose increasing the armour rep bonus to 9 per skill level and to include remote repair received
spugg your comparison is flawed aside from the fact that your comparing the abaddon against the hyperion youre really saying youre going to fit all tank in the lows for hype lol leaving out the link bonuses is a huge boost in your arguments favor due to how the resist link applies and stacks with the resistance bonusprobably the best comparison you can do for this argument is the absolution vs the astarte when fully fitted out with the astarte using 1 dmg mod and navy antimatter and the absolution using 2 dmg mods and conflag the ships become almost identical aside from the resistance bonus gun damage and range is 684 vs 682 and range is 117 to 125 tankwise they both have a resistance hole that should be filled as well they both use an acr and trimark in the rigs theyre as close as youre likely to find for this comparison ill post the fits if it proves beneficial to the argumentso lets get down to the numbers ill show the numbers without and then including t2 damnation ganglinks and fleet bonuses you can expect these in any largescale fleet engagement so why are you leaving them outwo links and bonusesehpabsolution 105997astarte 83903 208 difference and 212 with just fleet bonusesrep multiplierabsolution 6112astarte 4816 x 13756622hps per guardian with 4 rrabsolution 2086astarte 2260 77 differencenow lets compare with the links and bonusesehpabsolution 145010astarte 110905 235 differencerep multiplierabsolution 824astarte 6034 x 1375829675hps per guardian with 4 rrabsolution 4157astarte 4186 07 differenceso my conclusion in minor engagements where there are no logi or command ships you fail to receive any bonus so you are at minimum 208 ehp behind you counterpart in smallscale engagements where you wouldnt find command ships but find logistics you get a alright bonus you arent likely to get chewed through in seconds so ehp becomes less of an issue here and 77 per logi is pretty decent however in largescale fleet engagements your idea of using the bonus for remote repair fails to hold up not only do you have 235 less ehp so the chances of logi being able to lock you up and begin applying reps before you pop are lower but your rep bonus only gives a 07 increase in applied reps versus the resist bonus as well
ill 1 on the idea that full or partial respecs shouldnt be allowed ive got no use for them anyway so it really doesnt matter to me a very limited respec might not be terrible but it should come at a cost wipe 12 million sp and get 600k back to spend as you wish this will limit respecs being influenced by attribute mechanics and make people think twice before doing itzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
so im going to agree and disagree and also show you the parts you missed but first lets go over your examples titans could still doomsday after this change so there wouldnt have been a need to give them these sp backyour example would have been better if theyd removed the ddif you maxed out missile training all of the supporting skills went directly into the new weapons type and you could always just get out of the ship and put those cruise missile skills to use in another shipnavigation skills work across all ships what youre neglecting to see is that they did in fact pull all of the implant sets from everybody on the cluster they werent going to be as useful so they gave you the option of plugging them back in or notyou could still do pi after the changethe carrier was still a carrier why would they give you skill points back for it if youd have trained carrier 5 and they removed carriers and didnt refund your sp this would be a valid pointyou see some of the sc pilots have been in scs for years they cant leave the ship and they trained all those drone skills on purpose they were stuck in the ship there was nothing it could do but launch drones so they maxed out their dronesa closer comparison would be like if they suddenly redid all the amarr ships with no guns on them no more lasers just missiles they would in fact give players those skill points back as its a fairly radical change that has drastic consequences that disrupt years of trainingits not the nerfing of single weapons system that you can take or leave its the complete reimagination of a platform where 10 million sp minimum some more like 15 are now absolutely worthless and the pilot isnt able to just reship and use them in something elseall that saidthat part goes on to talk about the alternative which is dockable 00 stations for supers which relieves some of the burden from the supercarrier pilot it then gives him the option of using those skills that hes spent years training in a different platform like the case with the stealthbomber nerf you mentionedone way or another the super pilots whove spent years in training just got pretty boned with that removal it wouldnt be a blanket respec it would likely be targeted at any pilot currently in a supercarrier
we know what they meant heres an explanation for you from seleenes blog member of csm6the world as we know it came about through an anomaly anomou the gospel of philip 15
um creative but did you think about what you said before you said it if you have to spend time unlearning skills at the same rate you learned them why waste your time just leave the skill maybe far in the future you can use it and just train the skill want to begin with
duhnothing gets past you does itpeople want a way to refund sp and others dontthis would satisfy bothbesidesi am sure it could be made so that unlearning takes half the time of learning or something if it is really that much of a problem point isif you want the ability to revert the clock and correct an error you made in judgment by training a skill then there should be some kind of punishment or downside to doing it it really shouldnt be any kind of pay isk get sp back systemperhaps if a skill takes 30 mins to train then it can take 15 minutes to untrain and refund 100 of the sp backbut you still lose time for the untrain when you could have been training something else frankly i dont regret a single skill i have trained and wouldnt likely use this for anything other than removing the starter skills i do not care for from my skills list
i think this is worse than purchased respecs
only because you want your sp refund with no downside to it isk is easy to gettime is not
no respecs unless a skill is removed by ccp period not for isk not for time not for plex not for any reason if you want sps in a new skill train it thenthe world as we know it came about through an anomaly anomou the gospel of philip 15
what is this tripeno one would use thisor even support thisbecause as i saidno one would use thiswho the hell wants to stop training skills to unlearn skillsstop making posts to just post bad ideasthey call that trollingyour just wasting time and being utterly ridiculous stop the evemail spam
irrationalits called coming up with an alternate idea instead of just mindlessly shooting down other peoples ideas you might try it sometime i would use itso there is somebody that would use it especially if the untrain time was half the train time so i wasnt completely wasting timeif anybody is trollingit is you
its called thinking before you postespecially about what people would do and how they would reactassuming its ok because you would use it is nothing more than utter selfishness and stupidity on your parti dare you to ask everyone around you if they would stop training and give up that time to unlearn a skillhow much you wana bet they would either laugh in your face or just flat say no stop the evemail spam
i dare you to use your brainif you do you might realize that neither you or me have any idea how people would react to it and if they would use it or not
translation  you realize your wrong and refuse to admit it let alone to bother with the effort of doing your homeworkno one in their right mind would untrain when they could use that time to train a skill stop the evemail spam
good god you are being narrowminded todaystop and think for a minuteif you can untrain a skill you dont want and it takes you half the time to untrain as it does to train that means you are getting the sp back at twice the speed it would take for you to train another skill it still takes time and you lose the skill but you can then use that sp towards the skill you would have otherwise been trainingits called a  compromise you now have an sp refund option but it does not completely destroy the current system of training  timei dont know how i can explain this any simplervery easy math heremaybe you have caldari carrier 5 and you want amarr carrier 5 instead you can untrain caldari carrier 5 and be refunded all the sp lose the skill and put all that sp into amarr carrier 5 but it would still cost you half of the training time lose the old skill gain the new skill half the training time via untraining old skill
in that case no stop the evemail spam
welli cant force you to like the idea sothanks for the input
eve is a game of consequencesstop trying to avoid them
only if it take the same amount of time to untrain the skill and you only get back half of the sp then there also should be an sp cap in place say 5 million per year the cap is the amount you untrain not what you get back you then have to pay 1000 x the sp in isk to use itdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
noabsolutely notall this will cause is an getting skills at a fraction of the time it would normally take to train themthink about itsps benig remibursed even at half would be a 11 ratio towards a skill you want them to be dumped inan sp is still an spa few thousand sps goes a long way towards a skill you wantthis is bad all over even if you get half backif it takes half the time to untrain the skill accordnig to mr i know better than you do over there then your gonna get an even bigger percetage increase on the time it takes to train the skill you wantthe only way this will fly in the name of balance is the time it takes to untarin the skill remvoes the sp from the charand who the  would want that when they have skills they rather would be trainingthis idea is just stupid beyond all reasonits easily exploitablethe only reason its not balantaly obvious is because its a pain in the  to even do it in the first placesp reimbursement is a sliperly hill we do not wantits only used in server outages and removal of skillsanything beyondt hatis not good that is a majority opinion guarenteed stop the evemail spam
mate im not being serious i cant see him going for it tbh just wondered how much he wants it destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
consider me fooled nice play  stop the evemail spam
loldense i dont want it at all i dont frankly give two  about refunding sp but it is something a lot of people request for all the time and noi doubt that would be the majority opinion since againyou and i have no idea how other people are going to react you might as well face itsp refund is something ccp is thinking about and the csm did not completely shoot it down it may very well end up happeningand when it does you will all  and whine about it and how it was implemented which is why you should be trying to come up with something that will work for everybody with minimal impact to the game as it is before it is too late
no need to get upset its only a game destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
lolim not upset its a proposal for the people the hardcore will hate itthe vets will hate it helli hate itbut the new peeps will probably like it
then why the  are you asking for it in the first placeare you just that hypocritical maybe you should start being apart of the solution and stop making the problem worse stop the evemail spam
becausei may not like it but it may be what is best for the game in the long run a feature like this may retain players that might otherwise quit given the option to do so it may help draw in more players as well i try to look at the whole of the issue in what is best for the game players and ccp and not just what i like or dont like i have supported many ideas that would be harmful to my current gameplay style and what i like to do because i believe it would benefit others morei dont need my sp refundedi havent made any choices i cant live with or dont think i will need or use down the line hell even my starter skills will eventually be used despite being useless to me right now howeveri think an sp refund option will benefit the game on a whole why do we care if vets do this they have a shitload of sp as it isnothing will change there why do we care if the noobs do this they have so little sp compared to most that it likely wont make a dent in the overall scheme of things i almost dont care either way frankly if given the option to untrain and move sp i would welcome the challenge new players that dont know what they want to do yet can finally do what they want by correcting mistakes while again not completely destroying the time  experience paradigm that eve has set up
this would apply for each room with a warp gate in scanned sites when rats engage or get engaged in a room accessible from a warp gate the warp gate throttles down the number of ships that can use it every minute to a number equal to the number of non rats ships currently in the room until all the rats in the room are deadthe goal here is to limit the capability to simply bring superior numbers into a site while the original site explorers take all the aggro without removing the possibility that the same number of ships with the right firepower could still be a menace to the explorers so if a 2 person gang is busy on a site then only 2 new ships can enter that room in one minute time then 4 others one minute later as the room now has 4 ships in it and so on

i think in terms of the balance the points system would help with that one if players spend say 60 of the ships points into speed they are gonna have a super fast ship but its gonna lack in every other aspect  tank weaponry tracking signature etcso that would mean that yes a super fast fleet would dominate for a while but they all the other alliances would put 60 of their points into tracking and squashing the super fast fleetsthe balance would be achieved by the populous if person a invents something person b will invent the countermeasure that would give the edge to people who invent that new ship type first which it should but only as long as it takes the others to invent the deterrent
i think its safe to say that the decision from the gms to allow wardec evasions is just wrong someone on ccps end needs to slap the gm who made that terrible decisionanyways heres a few tweaks that might fix the problem1 wardecs carry on with all the members of that corp regardless if they stay or evade if george was in generic corp alpha when it was wardeced he would still be affected if he quit or joined another corp his new corp wont be affected by the wardec just him as an individual because he was in gca when the wardec was initiated2 the cost of wardecs should be cumilative for each wardecing corp to prevent permadecs a week would have to pass before the cumilative cost resets back to original costsummary of eves last four expansions
sounds pretty fair to mebut isk is easily madethe multipler should be x5 if not x10 extreme yes but my point needs to be made1 for reasonable balance to be reached stop the evemail spam
wait so youre saying that if someone is in a corp and they get wardecced then they cant drop corp to avoid the war i strongly oppose this there are a lot of corps out there who wardec noob corps and can continue those wardecs ad infinitum im imagining griefers inc deccing well help you learn to play and then hunting all of their members down mercilessly even after they leave the corp no this rule doesnt fix anything i can only imagine it increasing suffering in the world i stand opposed
stop and consider what you just saidyou join a corp to do what be in a corp and do stuffbut to be in that corp you must take the risk that goes with itif you dont want wardecsyou have no business being in that corpthose who ditch to evade wardecs are considered cowards in most circlesand honestly if you wantted to do stuff without interfence then have the decency to get an alt and leave it in npc modethere is nothing unfair about this rule changeand i dare say it may solve more problems than notits one thing to park it in a station or not log inits an another to ditch your corp and run off to evade a war decopposed or not if you dont like itthen dont join the corpproblem solved stop the evemail spam
1 is there enough wh systems if not what class needs moreare they under or overpopulatedalthough a lot of the midclass whs are uninhabited i believe there should be an increase in c6s i say this because there are less than 120 of them currently in game and static manipulation with the right ships takes the whole random feeling out of the equation we can cycle holes in less than 30 secs after scanning it down meaning that we can hit the same systems after about 3hrs of chain collapsing2 are pos mechanics enabling to many people to just clean out weak systems and not bother with harder targetsno but pos mechanics as a whole need love3 should access and roles be reworked doubttfull i will be alone on that oneyes4 should moons be mineable for goowaits for the hate from thatim with the crowd not for the same material as nullsec 5 should sleeper sites and other sites spawn rates be raised to foster larger corpalliance growthyes it is one thing to farm your static but mass limitation inhibits cap esc in them and low home system spawn rates after depletion penalyze active dwellers6 should site iskrewards be lowered or raisedraised right now the hardest sights done with full capital escalation by a high dps group nets more than highsec incursions but not by enough in comparison when you consider the ship loss risk from pvp difficulty of the sites and investments needed to reach those levels7 do wh pvp mechanics need an overhaul many things come to mind here need to pop those carebears that jump back to hsno8it was stated by ccp long ago that whs were not meant for long term habitation since they lost that bet should they now look at making them more viable for larger numbers to encourage larger scale wh system warfare and not just the russians taking out weak systems for funyes9 are wh masses and spawn times what they should beyes10 do you think i am pissing in the wind here to think ccp cares about wh dwellers and our corpsallianceswell if you read the csm minutes meeting after meeting we currently only have two step vouching for us often the nullsec babies whine when something about wspace gets mentioned a previous post had it right though we currently only represent a small portion of the subscriber base and i dont see ccp focusing on changing that anytime soonedit 11 how are the pi changes affecting your corp are you too small that it is taking weeks just to blow up interbus should they just remove interbus in whs all togetherours are assploded i am not in favor of making life easier in wspace outside of pos mechanics
with the removal of a aoe doomsday and torpedoes no longer being aoe there needs to be more aoe in the game i propose capital smartbombs that operate at 15 km range and do 600 damage and requires capital energy pulse weapons skillbooks that requires energy pulse weapons v when mounted on dreads in siege mode the range of smartbombs will double and gain 200 damage bonus for t1 siege and 240 for t2 siege dreads will have a bigger use in nullsec since currently its role of structure bashing has been relegated to other ships

i think that giving a boost to security status for attacking pirate players should be implemented the deeper they are in the negative the bigger the boost itll promote some more pvp instances and keep pirates on their toes hell theyll have to worry about others wanting to improve their sec status at their expense to boot those pilots that are engaging pirate players are doing a community service so within the realm of the game a concord boost in security status makes senseariano tkulo
what do you suggest to limit people from killing their 10 noskill alt
yeahthis would make it so much easier for pirates to maintain sec status i would have to say no to this onebut what i am not opposed to changing is the 1 sec a pirat has to have before you can kill him without concord intervention lets make it simple at 001 you are a pirate and can be killed by anybody

a mechanic has been abused where a warring corp would have its members out of its corp and when a war target is found the corp would accept their applications and seconds after the members would go and kill the war target and leave right after this causes them to appear as neutral to the war targets until a session timer is initiated and causes the victim to be unaware and unable to retaliate before being attacked this has been classified as an exploit but many are able to get away with just warnings and continue doing itsince ccp no longer has the manpower to moderate this a simple solution would be to make a session timer for corp joining and leaving ranging from 2 hour to 24 hours during war this will put an end to the exploiting and give the other party a chance to retaliate against the aggressors

ore wouldnt make something like this because lets be honest they dont need to their security is currently provided by the serpentis and when things are going well for them they contract out to mordus legion all of their ships can easily be hauled around in a rorqual or orcaif we wanted to ascribe these ships to any neutral npc it would likely be interbus which would only work if we said it was a stolen interbus design as they themselves would never release it to any single empire

before i rant i support most of opthe continuing persistence of the csm to meddle with mechanics that they do not already have much or any regard for continues to astound me i realize that there may be some experience for some but they show their ignorance of how wormholes are meant to be played that way is the way inhabitants have been living for years now personally ive lived in wormholes for over a year in regards to the proposal of a mechanic stabilization destab etcetc to make wormholes less invulnerable for the residents is insulting that immediately shows true or willful ignorace perhaps even arrogance in my eyes no system is invulnerable no inhabitant is safe not even aharm they persist because they fight for it to live in wspace you must survive and for a corp to thrive takes more than nullsec players seem to realize its not a carebear haven and its not a minigame it is the endgame for many and to trod heavily into our territory in such a manner is irresponsible of a csm representativeill end the rant there i know plenty of similar words have been and will be exchanged now what i think should happen for real progresstalk to wormhole dwellers simple as that go straight to the horses mouth and you will find that things can be better for all involved if interweb spcshps iz srs bsnz which as the csm it would be so for reps then do it right the first timewormhole mechanics as they stand now are solid ideas like sleepers attacking poses at least in higher class whs imo is a good direction and can fit into the existing lore id rather not see a wormhole control mechanic appear but if it somehow does it better at least fit the lore again imo theres many things that can be done for all sec space and those that live there should be consulted in each case as i live in wspace this got to me no super blobs no assurances no mercytake it or leave it
i would like to point out though that it was meissa who raised and suggested the wormhole stabiliser at the most recent csm meetingthis is from her own blog she sent to evenews 24meissas blog i used to have faith in what she was saying until this  im definitely going to be voting for two step to represent us wh folk in the next csm to make sure no idea as bad as this ever sees the light
theres completely no reason why t3 ship should be able to even activate more than one link even less than you can do that offgrid i know i can fly loki with 3 active links on the grid with fleet just fine just for example and just having 1 link activated is enough for most of time i call this offgrid boosting bullshit

i think it needs some workshopping but essentially it does fix several issues mining is boring as hell and bots suck up game resources giving them the advantage over the honest folks if macro mining is no longer as profitable it takes the advantage away make people work for the ore but make the ore worth it i think this is a great start to an epic idea
i liked the idea of having different qualities of asteroids at first but i dont like the idea of spreading them out any more than they already or putting the better ones in dangerous places or mining slag rock none of this does anything to make mining more fun it just add to the frustration of the chore its not going to stop the bot mining either theyll just mine out everything and eject whatever they dont want real players will do the same thing so having lots of jet cans floating around mining barges isnt going to help distinguish them
wont work will be abused by people having high sec alt or somethingie pirate setup trap hisec alt broadcast mayday pilot arrive to help pilot get jumped by piratesso good intention not gonna work
this has been proposed a number of times over the years and as my experience grew realized there are a few other game mechanics that fulfill a similar rolea lot of the points against have been addressed earlierstanding fleets for corps enable guys to broadcast or shout for help and you just warp to your corpie or alliance budetc etc however a possible variation would be to skill it a comms skill or something similar which give the ability to broadcast receive a distress and have the higher the skill the further you can broadcast and the higher the skill the more accurate your warp in would beand maybe only make the broadcast available to corpies or alliance membersand have it a module based transmitreceive item which takes up a slotit then becomes a choice has to how much u spend and what you lose to fly with it etc etc a high enuff skill perhaps could allow pirates to intercept other corpalliances maydaysit could open up a whole new skill set with new modules communicationsbroadcast skillscomms jammingetcmake it harder for fleets to warp to 0 if the fleet pilots dont have the skills to receive broadcastsa top of the head thought can be refined or shot down

the self destruct timer is long for a reason if you cannot kill a target within 2 minutes then you lose your chance at a km additionally kms are not an important part of eve they are important for sites like bc who help people with nothing better to do feel good about destroying internet spaceship pixels kms are working as intended  if you cant get them in 2 minutes then you dont deserve that kill a small concession that might be reasonable however  if you choose to activate the self destruct timer then all your modules finish their cycle and power down with the exception of guns you can die guns blazing having no boosters should help you die faster which will appease some of the butthurt from 12 year olds that dont have their km thats been posted in this thread and we dont need to  with the timer
i dont mean this in a bad way but glancing at your kb you are obviously a fan of flying smaller ships in which case sd timers really dont effect you at allunless you are in a position where you are actively planning on killing capitals have some experience in killing capitals or are actively losing capitals i dont think you can objectively make statements along the lines of if you cant get them in 2 minutes based on personal experienceas for kms not being an important part of eve consider this i dont know you and yet i now know you fly minmatar can use t2 large guns but your engineering skills are possibly not up to scratch youve tried pvp before but mostly you run missions and the odd pvp trip you have made has ended badly this kind of knowledge is pretty damn invaluable when someone applies to join your corp or alliance or conversely when choosing an alliance to joincenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
now i readily admit i have never ever attempted to kill a capital ship simi makes a few good points but like many arguments respectfully submitted seems to discount any perspective that does not serve his specific interest knowing i could be wrong id venture a guess that many many more players have killed or been killed in noncapital ships then capital ships thus to make an argument that would apply a new standard to all for the benefit of a minority seems incorrect and honestly somewhat overly self centered as far as the ability to determine a players skills from killmails when you make that case you also make the opposite case you have no idea how many times i might have self destructed or what kind of ships i fly or anything about how up to scratch my engineering skills may or may not be and i might tactically very well want and need to keep you an others in the dark about those specific facts as long as possiblemany have made good cases in this thread and i think the reasonable conclusion is if ccp chooses to adjust this at all a one size fits all solution will be a poor choicei think a player should maintain the right to self destruct and deny his opponent a killmail cargo and modules if his ship could otherwise reasonably be killed within the self destruct time period player choices player skills and player tactics should not be undermined by the never ending lust for guaranteed killmails power to the players
if you read through the thread youd notice most people want to extend sd timers for capitals only in fact ive actively argued against getting rid of sd timers altogether and even suggested shortening them for pods and inconsequential smaller shipswell i do know what kind of ships you fly i can see them on your killboard given the age of your character and complete lack of anything nonminmatar it is very unlikely youve cross trained yet and if so youve done it very little i also have a very good idea of how up to scratch your engineering skills are from how you fit your maelstroms etcthe point is you may very well tactically want to keep others in the dark but should you be able to i mean to be fair they just blew up your ship anything you self destruct is very likely to contain zomg top sekrit informations in its fitting especially if it just died to a small low dps gangit should also be noted that this isnt purely about kms super caps usually have some pretty shiny loot on them but at the moment theres no real incentive to go after them because you need a gang that can not only survive but also kill it in two minutes flat and if you didnt know already supers have 3040 million ehp to put that in perspective your maelstrom has 60k ehpthe same issue also applies to ratting carriers albeit on a smaller scalecenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
i dont fly minmatar  and the rest of your assumptions are equally accurate i do fly like the majority of players in eve ships you find inconsequential  until we have you scrambled in your big important ship that cant track fast enough to blast us enough of trying to rig the rules so the important ships and pilots can have more and more and more this thread has had good exchanges and a reasonable consensus could be achieved if people did not find the game play of other players  inconsequential eve is for all the players power to the players
so you arent an alt of tidurius then why are you replying to an assesment of his character claiming that it is inaccurate when applied to yourself of course its inaccurate youre a completely different player not to mention your being a four month old forum alt those ships are inconsequential in terms of them self destructing because they dont survive 10 seconds let alone 2 minutes shortening the self destruct timer for them is a buff if you intend to go that routesimilarly lengthening the sd timer of bigger ship is a buff for those in inconsequential ships who wish to kill large ones next time try training reading comprehension to level 5 before replying to a postcenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
1 i was responding to your response which featured my posted comments if you mistakenly thought or assumed i was alt of someone else simply highlights why players should not put so much faith in kill board posts2 on capital ships you have a reasonable position two minutes might indeed be too short  or the game might be designed with the intent that a smaller sized gang can not defeat every target they can sink their teeth into perhaps instead of changing the self destruct rules you should organize larger gangs capable of killing whatever your target is in under two minutes if that is impossible and surely it is not with a big enough blob then and only then do you have a legitimate argument in my humble inconsequential opinion3 you could not accurately say anything about my character because you did not blow him up and if i choose to employ the tactic of self destruction you still would not have blown him up what makes you think you have the right to know facts you havent earned by executing a tactical kill i dont mean this in a bad way but it sounds like you feel entitled to unearned benefits because that information has value to you4 the fact that you can not tell anything about what this character flies and where my skills are prove my point that players have the right to tactically avoid making those facts easily accessible for every other pilot and self destruct can enable that tactic5 eve is supposed to be about risk and reward  in these forum posts i read a lot about how to guarantee rewards and very little about balancing it with more risk right now an attacking gang gets to pick the target gets to pick the place gets to pick the time of any attack they engage in how much more advantage do you require we rig the rules to give you6 i have certainly learned to defer to the greater skill and experience level of many players posting in these forum threads having repeatedly inserted my foot into my mouth due to insufficient knowledge of how many aspects of the game unknown to me are played that being said i find less and less merit to an argument that sounds more and more like crying about the ones that can get away just because you dont like them to be able to employ a legitimate tactic please if you think it worth while post something consequentially material that will convince me of the merit of your argument that would make taking away a tactical tool from other players to enable your felling of entitlement to the benefit you perceive it grants you while doing nothing to enhance the risk versus reward foundational basis of eve gameplay sometimes i am a little slow but a solid logic based argument can persuade me thus far while you make several good smaller points your main point is inadequate to justify taking a tactic away from some to give unearned benefit to others power to the players
because you are a forum althow i assumed you were an alt of his because of this line you have no idea  about how up to scratch my engineering skills may or may not be was my fault for reading it to fast but its not really an issue in game but still looking at your kb and employment history still shows youre an alt just because you have no combat history doesnt mean that that doesnt show it anything no combat history on older toons usually means alti dont think the sd system was designed with capitals in mind at all since it merely wasnt changed when they were introducedas for your if that is impossible argument do you realise how many people it takes to kill a super capital in 2 minutes work it out then get back to me dont forget to allow for the fact that sometimes youre fighting entire fleets of supercapsthe defender also gets to be in his home system with friends scouts an outpostpos hell he even has local if hes in a belt in his carrier with neutrals in system he deserves to diepretending eve is lopsided toward the aggressors is just plain wrong it is literally impossible to force a fight in eve unless the person you are attacking has done something very very wrong or knowingly done something dangerous eg flying around null sec and getting caught in a bubble spiked with cans even then with safeswarping to celestrials its possible to avoid it most of the time meh get back to me when youve worked out how long it would take to kill an aeon overloading its modules with 20 dreadnaughts two prometheus fit carriers and a heavy interdictorthis also extends to fleet fights if lord zim is around here before i believe hes mentioned before that entire fleets have been known to sd before they are even attacked just because theyve seen the enemies super cap pilots log on thus no fight was had their losses were hidden and it was an extremely boring and dissatisfying night for all involvedetccenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
1 thank you for the specific responses2 just because you say i am a forum alt in bold underlined letters does not make it so3 boring and dissatisfying where in the eve eula does it state you are guaranteed that individual player choices will make you less bored and more satisfied your feeling of entitlement is showing or at least i think that is what it is i can not read your mind or fairly make a conclusive statement about your mindset from these few posts thus i can only say what it sounds like from my perspective4 mass self destruction on a scale you are talking about happens how often often enough to rig the rules to make it impossible becomes a priority5 the seeming need to enhance attacks in a game that is balanced already in an extremely lopsided manner in favor of the attacker while hiding behind insubstantial quotes of playing eve wrong or reckless behavior is the only way you end up dead is really unworthy of these forums in my opinionplayer choices are preferable to me then setting the rules to rigidly enforce gameplay that benefits a few and effects many power to the players
1 on kms1 on not dropping lootsneutral on insurance payouts i lean towards no payout but i can see good arguments on each side and pressing the issue would raise more hell than its worth1 on looking at the timer the downside of lengthening it is 
im not an expert of incursions but one of the main gripes people seem to have with them is that the incursion runners purposely avoid shooting the mothership so that they can continue to run the regular incursion sites this of course detracts from the real reason that incursions exist which is to kill the mothership seeing how the first couple of incursions actually accomplished this and seeing how doing enough regular sites spawn the big bad mom lead me to believe that ccp intended people to do the regular sites and then kill the mothership thereby ending the incursion and having everyone reap the rewards of doing so instead people run the regular sites vanguard ones it seems like most of the time as it generates more income for themthis system seems broken where farming the regular sites is more profitable then actually defeating the incursion heres what i proposemake a gas cloud similar to the one in the recon 33 mission appear in all incursion sites in the constellation 5 minutes or so after the mothership appears no cloud in the mothership spawn though of course this cloud will deal 2000 or however much is needed to break the tank of your average incursion running machariel or nightmare omni damage to all ships in the vicinity of the incursion making staying there not that viable this creates incentive to kill the mothership thereby running incursions to their original intent and keeping the farming at bayalso see this post by spank
i am not sure if this has been brought up before but i think that someone salvaging my wrecks should give me and my corporation kill rights on them just as if they were stealing from a jetcan often the salvage is worth much more than what the wreck contains i do not see how it is not considered theft since its essentially taking money out of my pocket this could actually make ninja salvaging more interesting as wellthanks for reading
i completely agree its a simple request i dont run missions much but it really does make sense that it would be treated as theft
bad news for you i am afraid op ccp has already ruled on this one and their view is the salvage isnt yours until its in your cargohold ninja salvaging is working as intendedno support from me for this proposal
nobiomass queue is over give me your stuff firsti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
salvaging is classed as a mini profession within eve and it was designed this way from the start if you want the salvage you need to compete for it the same as everyone elseno it makes no sense at all because the salvage is not yours or his so no theft is involveddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
ccp has already made their point very clear on this one it will likely never change

okay first off the hyperion fit i used did have a damage mod and both ships applied approx 1k dps at close range i compared the two battleships because its the best apples to apples comparison out there i cant compare a hyperion and a rokh because shield and armour tanking is very different but i will later to see what happensnext i am a little confused about your rep multiplier figures could you explain where you got these figures i my self am using a defence efficiency formulae eft with projected effects which i believe gives a very accurate predictionokay lets look at gang links from a t3 with all armour links level 5 pilot and a mindlink implantabaddon 237491 ehphyperion 186430 ehp 21 lesswith fully boosted gang links a guardian now reps at 384lg repper every 325 secondsso384 x 4  1536 hp  325s375  2112 hp  325s 576 hp  325s more or 1lg solace  1med love repper per guardianplug this into eft projected effects1 guardian with 4 lg reps boosted by the legion with all three t2 ganglinks and a mindlinkabaddon 2530 def effhyperion 2609 def eff 31 morethis 31 is good but doesnt really compensate for the 21 less ehp the abaddon has so i refer to the last line of my previous post which is boldedso using the proposed 9384 x 4  1536 hp  325s45  22272 hp  325s 6912 hp  325s or 1lg t1 rep  1lg arup rep approxso1 guardian with 4 lg reps boosted by the legion with all three t2 ganglinks and a mindlinkabaddon 2530 def effhyperion 2748 def eff approx86 morethat 86 better tank per guardian is now competitive when considering ehp during ship selection wouldnt you think
alright i ran your numbers for the abaddon vs hype and got the same numbers i personally wouldnt fit my abaddon or hype like that but well go with it for comparisons sake the rep multiplier is the number you use to multiply the amount repped before dividing by the cycle time in order to calculate defense efficiency aka hps 70 hps difference isnt what id call good 218 hps per guardian is a bit better but the enemy only has to bring one or two more dps ships to negate that advantage also there is is the issue of alpha the bonus doesnt help if reps dont land third look at how your bonus scales on other ships as well such as in the case of my example of absolution versus astarte its only a 58 increase fourth have you looked at how that increase will effect active tanking 75 addition tank can mean a lot in 1v3 fifth your proposed bonus still leaves these ships inferior in any situation where theyre arent active tanking or have a large number of logistics

no skill is useless in eve except defender missiles i want my sp back  so i have no idea why anyone would choose to waste time forgetting skills theyve already learnedjust because you dont use it today does not mean you will not use it in futurealso as others have pointed out your actions in eve have consequences so i would rather not upset the game balance by removing this i have never heard any other mmo allowing you to change your skills once learnedno support from me for this
i totally like this idea and i would use it all the timesp are what im paying for with my subscription its not a gameplay or balancing issue so its totally unnecessary to make unlearning sp take additional time and moneywe can only train one character at a time so all three characters per account share the same sp pool and we should be able to distribute our unlearned sp to any of themeve ought to be about natural consequences not imaginary consequences
sandbox is about no restrictionsyou want to restrict people from respeccing sp if they choose tooin other wordsyour post makes no sense

make it faster so we dont have to spend so much time doing it mining is safe and essential to the eve economy but it is an unpleasant chore for players who would rather be helping their buddies win wars the simplest way to reduce mining time is to reduce the cycle duration and capacitor consumption of all mining lasersthe eve market will automatically adjust itself to this change when the supply of something goes up the price goes down when the supply of something goes down the prices goes up the supply of minerals drives the eve economy the same way energy drives the realworld economy1 increasing the production of minerals will reduce the price of minerals2 reducing the price of minerals will increases the production of ships and equipment3 increase the supply of ships and equipment will reduce the prices of ships and equipmentto allow manufacturing to keep up with the increased supply of minerals manufacturing time for all bp should be reduced as wellanother couple of source of minerals comes from reprocessing and scrap metal processing which are useful but undermines the mining industry and reverse the natural flow of energy from mining to manufacturing to the eve market at the same time the increased sales of ships will increase the demand for rigs so to arbitrate the situation i propose that reprocessing and scrap metal processing be changed to yield salvage materials rather than minerals
no no no no no no90 reduction in cycle time means an 900 increase in supply this would cause insanity in eves economyif cycle times were to change which i oppose i think anything over 5 is drastically hugethis may be surprising to some of you combat people but there are a select few of us that like mining if you dont want to mine go shoot things so we have more customers i think mining should be changed in some ways but this is definitely not a good approachregarding sisi as this has a huge impact on the economy there is no way to test it on the economyfree sisi
absolutely notmost of the mining is done by bots anyways you want to increase bot efficiency by 90 hell noof all the terrible suggestions on how to improve mining this is one of the worstsummary of eves last four expansions
dont forget though there are the select few of us that mine legitimately we arent all out to ruin the game
i wish i could say that this was an original idea but i cant i actually thought about this after reading mabricks blog here
i like this idea as a whole i think that one thing that hurts the eve economy as a whole is that manufacturers have no control over who buys their items unless they sell exclusively through contracts perhaps when setting a sell order you can select three different prices for that order  one for negative standings one for neutral and one for positive standings then for example a goon who is red to the trader sees the goon price when he looks at the market window a friendly however would see a price that is say 50 lower than the goon price i think that this has a lot of potential but would take a lot of market reworking1 for the concept just needs all the kinks ironed out
i likebut on the whole i think it could seriuosly cause complications with the system already in placebut being able to restrict the marketpalce to sayyour corpor the alliancewould be a major boon1 major support regardless stop the evemail spam
this has some amazing possibilities but i suspect would be a nightmare to implement however thats ccps problem1

i tried to put this in the ship balance thread but it was locked the four speed t1 frigates are not often usedadvice for how to get new players into pvp as i spent weeks trying to research this recently tends to be either give them a frigate with a tackle and have them hero tackle for a fleet or send them to lowsec to try to be a pirate by tackling ships and speedtanking themthe current gold standard of a tackle ship is propulsion mod afterburnermwd web and scrambler three mid slotsall the fast t1 frigates have two mid slots as a result prospective tacklers have to be shipped up to combat frigates like the rifter which may need more skill and arent as fast this especially affects amarr as the only frigate they can fit a full tackle on is a misuse of their not particularly tacklersuitable ewar crucifierplease add a third mid slot and the powercpu needed for a new low skill player to cheaply fit it to the executioneratroncondorslasher this will make these ships more useful as a cheap pvp general purpose tacklespeed ship for new players to be able to get into pvp right awayi havent see this proposed even though the complaint comes up a lot probably because most of the people who are active in the debate have by and large outgrown the lower end t1 frigates and have the ability to buy and fit t2 interceptors which are out of the reach of a new player
i think that mindset is a waste of what could be a perfectly good shipim afraid youre right though drake i think that ccp has set up dreadnoughts to be 15 billion isk battering rams and i shake my head at their shortsightedness the potential exists for dreadnoughts to be more versatile and useful but i fear that the inertia is hard to overcome ccp seems opposed to repurposing dreads to be used in the other 99 of their gameim for anything that makes dreads less pigeonholed
scaps have ewar immunity so how about instead of aoe which ccp doesnt seem to like and just give dreads immunity to drones that will make them the ultimate carrier killersthey will still die easily to sub cap fleets but might now actually have a chance against the super carriers

helloheres the deal currently people can use neutral nonaggroed ships like carriers  orcas  rorquals to scoop their aggroedgcc ship and dock back up or jumpthis is a way of evading the consequences of engaging with absolutely no drawback which seems pretty broken to me i propose this if a stores his ship in bs ship maintenance array all aggro timers from a should be immediately transfered to b every npc  gcc aggro timer should be transferred to bs shipfor 00 this rule would not work anyway this scooping technique is mostly used to avoid empire timers from what i have seen we should therefore add another rule a ship can be scooped only when his aggression timer wears outit might have been proposed but a first search have gave nothing sorry if the subject has already been discussed

honestly cant wait to see the blog about how badly worm holes need jump gates ie stabilizers to be better
i agree with pretty much everything the op statedid like some sort of nullsec claiming system but entirely seperate from nullsec mechanicsas for wh stabilisation i have to admit i can see a use for it though not in the way intended i see it as more of a way to link up groups that are spread across several whs acting more like a logistical jumpbridge between them if it has to be placed in a deadspace location away from poss then all the better as it would give something else for roaming gangs to camp thats just what i think it should be like though and ill admit theres potential gamebreaking issues involved so im not clinging to it as teh best thing ev4r the only people that think its needed forlarge scale invasions are those that know fuckall about wh invasion mechanics and logistics

that is my reason for pushing this we have quite a lot of link platforms but none other than t3s are ever used due to the current mechanics  just try telling an fc that you have a link on your canearchonet al  hell throw you in the stockade and throw away the key just added this idea to ccps module brainstorming request in test forum might be an outright alternative to changing mechanics in the first place if a decentcompetitive hull can be found to carry them

who stuck you in hisec you did without the implants you would just find another reason to avoid pvp if you really wanted to pvp you would get a clone with 2s or 3s and go with that if the learning implants are that important in other words it sounds like your just avoiding something maybe you arent but that is what it sounds like your free to do so now but apparently training  fun for you hell  ive spent weeks in a vanilla 2 clone when i was learning about 00 it is possibleand fun again not supported choicesconsequences are a good thing fewer choicesfewer consequences is a bad thing imho

first off incursions arent created necessarily to destroy the mothership thats like saying that the whole point of flying in null sec is so you can use a stealth bombers bomb launcher extremely narrow scope if you catch my driftsecondly after the mom pops its another day or two before another incursion spawns so either ccp would need to decrease how quickly the mom spawns or they need to increase how often incursions spawngenerally my proposed fix to the whole wa wa high sec is making sooooo much money is make vgs harder so that their payout is nerfed honestly this would be a welcomed change as an incursion runner as well as maybe tweeking the payout to be more on par or a little over a lvl 4 and make the mom spawn in the mobilizing phase so as to allow for at the 48 to 72 hrs of access to this content before anyone can end it this is really a compromise between both parties and i feel its not an unreasonable compromise
no they wouldnt incursions are not a guaranteed thing it takes days for a new lowsec one to spawn after its killed so why cant you highsec guys wait a few days too
actually thats the exact purpose of them to kill the mothership

logistics ships are even now overpowered as they are theres no need to boost them further if you shoot people they should just explode as i see it were currently having priest overcrowding problemi can agree with giving remote reps on dreads and hics thoughalso just dont try to active tank in pvp its not even good idea in pve either just why do stupid  if you know it doesnt work its like asking more range for blasters cos they cannot shoot to 100k at least yet hopefully not everbasically people wont be happy about active repairs until they can be immortal
there was one other thing i would like to mention by removing these active repair bonuses from hulls in exchange for equalopportunity bonus such as resists youre likely to drastically diminish demands for active tanking improvements youll notice how there are very few complaints about how the abaddon or rokh active tanks it is because while these ships can active tank quite decently they have an equally viable buffer tank for fleet combat conversely the hyperion and brutix hulls seem to get the short end of the stick their bonus makes it so that they are only good at active tanking but their tanking is only marginally better than ships that have other bonuses and if they attempt to buffer tank they are drastically behind similar ships in their class so if they can only do one thing reason says that they should be able to do it really well and so people complain because that isnt the case make it so these ships can be competitively flown in most situations and people will care less about how active tanking stacks up against buffer tanking
jon the active tank bonus isnt going to change to resistance bonus as it removes a fair portion of the solo and small scale stuff that goes on active tanking is actually exceptionally viable when boosting with armour links for small gang workas you have highlighted the main issue is the fact that the resist bonus essentially carries between spider tanking buffer tanking and active tanking simply homogenising the defensive bonus to be a resist bonus will actually remove diversity and we will be left with people flying different shapes that all do the same thingallowing the active tank bonus to carry to remote repair received balances this issue out look at the numbers the tanking figures become very similar the only difference is buffer which means buffing the bonus to 9 actually makes sense we lose nothing but gain everything else and the argument that the other side just needs to bring moar dudes to break the better tank is utterly mooti stick by at the very minimum giving active tanking ships the remote repair received bonus and if the balance all looks good buffing the bonus to 9

i once thought mining would be exciting like exploring vast space with barely armed mining vessal and then i would sometimes hit jackpot and find expensive asteroids and mine them fast like in couple hours before other guy comes or bad pirate all tihs expensive stuff would of course go into my large cargoholdbut then i logged in 2nd day and i realize mining is meant for botters not for actual gameplayers

you want to increase thousands upon thousands of bots mining efficiency by 90 so that a select few can profit a little morefailsummary of eves last four expansions
not unless you assume that everyone will spend the same amount of time miningi wouldnt
yes i do because the supply would saturate the market with minerals reducing the price to near zero not a bad thing for manufacturing lower prices for minerals and cheaper ships and equipment means less mining and more combat
do you mine currently amines tend to mine for a set period of time they log on have their mining fleet running and watch a movie or spend time doing housework or office work in some cases they are not mining to meet a goal they are mining to do something productive while they are not able to pay full attention to the gameyour assumption is easily falsified miners will spend the same time mining because they mine to fill time
not quite if you wanted to make mining faster you would increase the yield of ore tenfold then reduce the quantity of ore spawned tenfold thus miners would mine ten times as much tritanium per hour as before the belts would run out faster and mining would no longer be afk friendly
i never said nobody mines to fill time i only contesting the previous assumption that everyone does
mining lasers have two attributes that effect the mining rate cycle duration and yield i considered increasing the yield before i made the tropic thinking it would have the same effect but then i realized it wouldnt because a full cycle would more than fill up a ships entire cargo hold causing large quantities of ore to be wasted for lack of room i chose to increase cycle duration instead to minimize waste i see no need to reduce the capacity of asteroids though

the speeder frigs are all pretty terrible in any form of combat and its mostly a tiering issue rather than just a lack of midslots they along with the rest of the t1 frigate range need a pretty major redesign to actually focus them on the role theyre intended to perform
my proposalnerf income to be on par with lvl 4s using an on par fleet with no competition for 50mins but registering in as an hour as your gage the reason for only having the 50min increment is to compensate for competition and fleet comp not being ideal ideally this would mean that someone in any ship would have a choice to run lvl4s or run incursions and make about the same amount of isk either way hopefully incursions will make a little bit more to help encourage moving the systems and looking for fleetsmake vgs harder particularly making tamas do enough dps that they have to be cleared in otas also adding sites to all of the types would be fun make the mom appear in the mobilizing phase and make the mobilizing phase if it doesnt already start 72hrs after the incursion goes live or more basically my ideal here is incursions should be a healthy alternative and only slightly more profitable to lvl4s for hisec frankly even if their payout was on par with lvl4s you would still see plenty of people flying them because of the human interaction
id say that would work pretty well turn incursions into commercial fishing a high stakes race to earn until enough fish are caught that they seasons overmaybe go with once sanshas influence gets to 0 no other sites spawn not 100 sure on the mom spawn mechanics but the mothership does the influence probably shouldnt regen much once its there doing a mom site at high sansha influence would be impossible were it allowed to regen a lotno nerf to the income per site or added difficulty to achieve that income just makes it into a raceits easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths abrazzar the risk of having your day ruined by other people is the cornerstone with which eve was built ccp solomon
you assume that fighting is a chore which people in 00 have to do and dont enjoy at allhaving said that yes nerf tech moons theyre dumb nerf them as well as highsec incursions
make incursions dissapear at the next dt after the sansha supercap spawnsits not a nerf but it stops people from being able to farm them endlessly for days on endor ccp could just undo the nerf to incursion damage output
make all the sites spawn just once or twice and then once the sc turns up everythign else stops easyoh and i love all the comments about 150 millhour in nullsec and safetey and oh wait none of you have a clue what your talking about do you and what alliance leaders keep all the tech and pay their mortgages im not saying it was never done but sure as hell it isnt done in our coalition have you seen the things that the grunt on the frontline gets srfd bss free capitals and skillbooks and more you guys spouting about how we all just drone up and the leaders get all teh isk are basically a bunch of morons
there are 34 alliances who own tech atm all have extensive ship replacement programs the leader of at least one of these tech holding alliances has been vocal in his insistence that the tech bottleneck be fixed give you a hint hes on the csm and his role rhymes with fairmanbesides we grunts enjoy fighting thats kind of why we live in nullits easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths abrazzar the risk of having your day ruined by other people is the cornerstone with which eve was built ccp solomon
1 is there enough wh systems if not what class needs moreare they under or overpopulatedyes for now as for populations levels hard to say2 are pos mechanics enabling to many people to just clean out weak systems and not bother with harder targetsprobably but thats not a problem player wh colonies need some serious love though3 should access and roles be reworked doubttfull i will be alone on that oneyes4 should moons be mineable for goowaits for the hate from thatnot for the same goo as in nullsec except for perhaps the most common junk like silicateshydrocarbonsetc seriously that stuffs everywhere5 should sleeper sites and other sites spawn rates be raised to foster larger corpalliance growthi believe so but not by much id prefer it to be done via an infrastructure upgrade make people work towards it6 should site iskrewards be lowered or raisedkeep the loot the same as much as i want more iskhr making the payout too good would cause a stampede into whs while some people will love the extra pvp i prefer to hit a quiet wh on occasion rather than change the site loot it would be better to raise the value of the non ribbon sleeper salvage more t3 t3 bss woo or for those who have huge stockpiles maybe make a few deployable structures out of it7 do wh pvp mechanics need an overhaul many things come to mind here need to pop those carebears that jump back to hsnot really a group escaping into hs is never nice but thats just a small and very specific part of wh pvp8it was stated by ccp long ago that whs were not meant for long term habitation since they lost that bet should they now look at making them more viable for larger numbers to encourage larger scale wh system warfare and not just the russians taking out weak systems for funyesyes though not necessarily to encurage larger scale wars though that will happen and infact is happening even without any changes9 are wh masses and spawn times what they should bemostly i think the total mass on c1s needs to be lowered10 do you think i am pissing in the wind here to think ccp cares about wh dwellers and our corpsalliancesive long held the belief that ccp doesnt like wh dwellers because we ruined their new game feature by settling down and mastering it11 how are the pi changes affecting your corp are you too small that it is taking weeks just to blow up interbus should they just remove interbus in whs all together we have one interbus co left we shoot them when we get bored
i dont live in wholes that having been said i think1 yes2 i believe so pos mechanics should be overhauled and outposts should be anchorable in whs3 it could use some love but not too much since the foundations work fine as is4 yes but via pi death to pos based moon mining give us moon interaction5 yes6 i think its fine as is7 not sure going with a no here8 absolutely9 yes if ccp allow you to build supers in a wh that would go a long way to making good fights supers should not be able to use wormholes to move betwen kspace and ukspace10 maybe11 they arent but if pi could allow you to mine ice from ice planets then wh habitation would be more sustainable and would all but eliminate the need to go back to hisec for stuff
domu is delayed due to stomach flu
no bueno get well sooni am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i agree with the ranty part particularly how insulting it is to insinuate wspace dwellers are invulnerable thats a load of crap and it seems to me that what people actually mean by wspace is invulnerable is i cant roll in my big nullsec supercap fleet and wreck them mechanics that allow you to actually control wormholes manage their mass etc completely defeat the point of them in my opinion and would shift wormhole space into being little more than a nullsec extension
wow someone that realy knows how gameplay in a wormhole works 1 new pos system new sov system
couldnt agree more with this thread if i tried1 and no i dont live in highsec as if that would make your opinion any less wrong
agree with most of what youre saying but not a couplewhat need is there for this other than another income source you can already make stupid amounts of isk in wh space until new game features are added like tech 3 were there is no need for another resource to be added sorry but the moons should remain unused aside from posupgrades no you want sov and upgrades you can go to kspace 00more wormholes no there are plenty out there if people are sad because they came to the party late and they cant find a free one they want they know how they can get it the problem is people are lazy and effortim all for grav sites that are ice belts but random as to the ice  thus who knows if itll fuel your pos this would introduce full self sufficiency as well as ice trading in wormholes great additions to wormholes imoas for harder yeah incursions and wh sites need to be harder triggers should be random i really dont see how thats difficult every wave could simply have a random ship be chosen as the trigger for the next wave
it should be the new destroyer hulls rolesince theyve expanded all other classes of ships except destroyers
the idea of bounties like contracts gets a vote from me eg i want to put 500million bounty on someone it becomes like a contract which i can assign to an individual or corporation likely a person or group well equiped and experienced enough to pull it off they manage to pod kill said individual they get the payout certainly beats a broadspectrum bounty that anyone can claim definately considering that getting killed is pretty much guarenteed in the long run this way youd have the satisfaction of knowing that your bounty has lead to the direct destruction and death of the person in question ive got a whole list of people id have put a bounty on if the system wasnt broken like it is currently would also allow the bounty system to finally become an acceptable profession with corps and individuals that demonstrate a continued ability in completing the bounties asigned to them getting more contracts from people looking for payback and no i dont live in highsec as if that would make your opinion any less wrong
i suspect im on quite a few of those lists if this proposal were to be accepted id be motivated to fix my sec pretty quickly
what if instead of mining both veldspar and the slag at the same time what if you mine veldspar until it runs out then you just mine slag that way you need to watch what you are doing a bit more but also you keep navigation hazards unless you are willing to spend alot of time mining worthless rock keep the amounts in a rock the same then add on that much extra slag so to completely mine out a field it will take a very long time making it smarter to plan ahead
i wouldnt mind seeing denser rocks like ice rocks for the reason that with multiple hulks on the field normal rocks pop way to fast i wouldnt mind having an extra bit of effort to have to scan the rocks to find the best rocks as long as i could somehow target paint them for the hulk fleet as well as all for the idea of making them harder to navigate however when i go mining i find a centralized spot or 2 that i work my way out from and mine everything i am not so sure of the idea of still having rocks there after all the useful ore is gone if someone could pitch it to me a different way i may be onboardfinally i do not want it more difficult to warp out of if i am multiboxing 7 accounts and a red enter system i squad warp them all out there is no way i want to be dealing with having to individually position each hulk to be able to warp out i understand the whole risk vs reward  and all that but there is a line to be drawn
this is an extremely good idea the only problem is someone will design a bot that reads when your veld turns to slag so it stops and moves to the next rock
i like this ideathe random nature of the ores the fact that you have to work more for them this makes it feel that there is purpose to miningi would very much prefer the asteroids to actually move around sometimes even going beyond the range of the strip miners in random directions so that the miners have to keep moving on top of that you are unable to align or keep at range with the rocks this way you have to manually position yourself every now and then to keep mining lest your rock moves out of rangeto make things more interesting some special rocks should be added that dont generally have any ore but are there to actually deal some damage if a rock hits your port side because you failed to move out of the way then you suffer damage the amount of the damage as well as the type of damage dealt onto your mining ship would be determined by the size and composition of the rock itselfwhat do you guys think
dont limit sec status and yes i am down for the grief
i need help im at the beltno actually i like this ideafake mayday calls 3but it has to be public broadcast
as discussed in this forum thread weapons need better sound effectsthe latest csm minutes told about some exciting changes in shipdesign but didnt mention anything in the sound department with the very beautiful new v3 graphics the poor sound effects on weapons hurt even morewhen you read about your weapons 425mm autocanons for instance they are very impressive and seem quite brutal when you fire them you get the same effect as when a very tall and muscular man starts to speak with a boys voice its ridiculousmost people i have spoken with play eve without sound this is hard evidence that improvements in this department are neededthus i propose that the csm brings this up the next time they meet with ccp
pretty sure they already changed the sound effects a while backmost of them anyway sound is about at the bottom of the list for most everybody who plays eve personally i would like to see some better sounds all around as well but i would say have ccp finish the v3s and ship redesigns before moving on to sound updates
most turret sounds are unimpressive and dont sound appropriate the sound quality is a far cry from the beauty of the ships and nebulas
eve does have soundeffects
tldra carrier should be able to tank a ship thats inappropriate ie a rifter   however if a ship can break another ships tank then the conclusion should be inevitablei believe a killmail would be just even after a self destruct the mechanic is misused and you are clearly not a pvper hence it doesnt bother you either that or your main is a pilot who flies in large gangs and likes to orbit an anchor whilst finding primaries to activate modules on please consider the other end of the scale us who wish to take on larger fleets with smaller gangs pvp is what this game is about and although you might not like it pvp involves shooting and destroying space ships its disheartening after spending say 10minutes taking a cap into low armour only for it to then disappear i agree that loot should be destroyed upon self destructi dont think insurance should pay out upon self destructi do think if aggressed by something and self destructing a loss mail should be created1
and yet you are an alt lolyes it happens a lot there are also plenty of fights that dont happen because whilst you could fight and almost definitely win you couldnt do it in under two minutes caps also sometimes get sdd in a pos because it got reinforced and  cagedand i dont know about you but whilst me may not be entitled to a fun game in most games boredom and dissatisfaction are traits that developers try to avoidi started out in this game as a pvp toon now i almost solely pve except for helping out with fleet ops i have never lost a single pve ship ever seriously look at all three of my toons and go through the combat history and i can assure you i have made a very considerable amount of isk all without ever losing a shipso what was that about the game being lopsided in favor of the attacker quite simply it isnt if youre careful you can lower the probability of being caught to the point where it will very likely never happen and even if it does by that point you should have made many times what your ship was worthrigidly enforce gameplay that favors many the only people who dont benefit from this is capsupertitan pilots and as a capitalsuper pilot myself i can assure you some of us want it changed anywaypower to the players111one etccenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
that scale may not be the most common of occurrences but the more common occurence is like what we saw on saturday where a few ncdot pilots in drakes drakes who escaped a gatecamp safed up selfdestructed and smugged in local about how his killdeath ratio was intact instead of forming a proper gang to smash the gatecampersdoesnt change the fact that a dread fleet has done it simply because they fear their killdeath ratio wont be elite enough
after noodling on it for a while i mostly agree sd should result in a km doesnt matter whether that pilot is randomly chosen from all who were in on the attack or pick whoever did the most damage but someone should get a km since killboards already get gamed nothing much will changethe biggest reason not to give out a km would be theyll see my fit omg  but since they could just shipscan you i dont believe that argument is convincing enough not to give out a km no loot should drop if the sd timer completes before ship destruction this allows the pilot of the ship to decide to burn it all rather then let the aggressors have it a last gesture of screw you to the aggressors who still get a shiny km but no loot other then salvage they may as well still result in insurance payouts unless you change things so that bluevblue kills dont give insurance denying insurance for sd usage will be spitting in the wind folks will instead just get their corp mates to help blow stuff up  timers should be shortened down to 60 seconds for anything below battlecruiser size and increased a bit for battleship and above i would say 3 minutes for a battleship 5 minutes for a capital and 8 minutes for a supercap  titan capacitor regen should stop once the sd cycle has started which may be unfair to gallenteamarr pilots who wish to keep firing their weapons so perhaps all highslot modules should also deactivate
might as well just give it to the one with the most damage consistency is a good thingthe whole argument about itd deny intel is complete bunk nobody has suicided to avoid leaking top sekrit fit info because there are no robot jesus fits the worst that happens is that people point and laugh a bit at the price or general awfulness of said fitnot a problem if the sd timer has run its coursei see absolutely no reason to pay out if you selfdestruct in fact this would be pretty paramount in any changes id implement regarding selfdestruction simply because i want to remove as many incentives to avoiding or pussying out of fighting as hard as you can when youre cornered as possible
so  why cant you just farm the lowsec ones too sounds like a waah im shooting myself in the foot situationto the op no there shouldnt be a mechanic forcing people out of the sites besides there are two possible outcomes from that either people figure out how to beat the system or there will be a whole lot of complaints about ships suddenly going pop because insane dps suddenly showed up midsite a far better solution if ccp did feel the need to stop people from running sites after the mom shows up would be to simply despawn the sites insteadhowever as the first response said stop whining about it either go out there and kill the mom as soon as it shows up or shut up and deal with it dont ask ccp to do stuff because youre too lazy to go do it yourself
actually i think youre right in that regard that just despawning the sites when the mom shows up could work too i wasnt thinking and didnt know that could be done while people would still be in the sites  having lots of shiny ships pop like that would lead to backlash more than anythingim just finding it strange that people would rather just run the sites instead of completing them which is what i thought due to all the rp buildup would be the point although i guess thats my opinion i probably wouldnt have made this thread if it wasnt for the whole incursion bears suck no you suck tears etc thing while i think its silly back and forth griping its getting people to participate in something which i suppose would be good and bringing to light issues with incursions one thing that people are bringing up is that vanguards need a nerf when it comes to payout which i would support
its so easy folks once the mothership spawns all other sites despawn done
this could work if measures are taken to mitigate abuse by farmers while still keeping it easy for true active pilots as you citedsourem itharen  congratulations lady kadesh you have been selected by trial of fire and blood under the watchful eyes of god to represent lord khanid as his champion in the imperial succession trials yc117
wah wah wah its a sandbox take risks or shut up
agreed no more f1 for invulnerability
obvious troll nice try210 for having it pointed out and still goingmmos come and go but eve remains garresh
good pointif you ever played world of warcraft you know that there are some builds for warlock for example that can see invisible and disable the poor stealth rougues although rougues can still back stab all other builds and are still considered op as they shouldthis means that it is not the rougue that need a nerf but the other classes that need a buff on fighting them to balance the gameso as it will be at eve cloakers will still be invunerable in most of the ocasions but in some other ocasions there will be riskso cloak carebears grow a pair and take the risk or shut up new pos system new sov system
1 to the op if not for the support of a good idea that even ccp is finally realizing then for enraging the forumtards
all this anticloak nonsensea ship that is afk cloaked is no danger at all to anyone in system it cant attack cant put out combat probes nothing even the ship itself is essentially not meant for fighting so it cant even do dangerous damagehere i have an idea for all the people afraid of a ship that cant kill you in anywaygo about your businessif youre truly so afraid of said cloaker putting a hot drop on you then roll with some peeps to cover your back while you go about your business cloaker warps in tries to pop cyno he dies from your backup problem solved the whole point of nullsec is pvp yet i get a distinct lack of courage from anyone who complains about afk cloakersin game mechanics already have a counter to cloak there is no need to nerf cloak or to make an anticloak ship this is most definitely not supported
the real problem is large fleet fights have been reduced to1 entire fleet aligning to celestial2 entire fleet locking up one target3 entire fleet pressing f14 entire fleet locking up another targetyou get the idea if large fleet fights were actually broken up into dozens of smaller fights you would see active tank bonuses shine again until then enjoy your predictable fleet dog fight of hundreds of ships primary one person at a time and they race to see who can finish the overview list firstboring
how about a little love for the bastardized gallente drone boats the 75mbs bandwidth is terrible you either dont maximize dps and field a matching set of 5 mediums or 3 heavies or field a scattered assortment of all types which is ugly to see and use youre drones dont stay together you have to stay right on top of them to tend to them as the heavies are too slow and the lights are extremely flimsy the best alternative would be to drop the bandwidth down to 50mbs and increase the bonus to 15 damage the damage would remain the same as before but youre drones become much more organized and easier to manage your overall drone ehp would decrease but you would have addition room for different types or another set it also puts the training time in line with the rest of the cruiser and battlecruiser hulls as drone boats were the only ones of these ships aside from the new tier3s that need to train a battleship weapon system heavy drones andor sentrys in order to maximize dps
jon you have some weird ideas remember a lot of balance in the game comes from a lot of the factors you have just stated you have to remember that there is a lot more to this game than dps and ehpthe speed and tracking of the drones must be considered and simply buffing 5 medium drones dps to that of 2heavies 2meds and a light is very short sightednot supported
as much as i agreegrow a brain and say something creative as opposed to the usual grow a pair that you say in eachandeveryfreakingpost stop the evemail spam
wouldnt you agree though that shorter repetitions are more fun than longer ones
i have no objection with you badgering the witless
silly idea people wont mine less they will mine just as much and absolutely flood the market
its not as though average joe miner is going to stop spending so many hours mining if you give him more minerals hell continue to mine just as long as he always did hell just have more ore at the end of it and since everyone else would be doing the same and the value of the ore would be dropping he has to mine for just as long simply to keep upnow if you want to talk about new ways of mining ways that reward more player input and attention compared to the current warp in target rock fall asleep at keyboard method and combine that with a solution to the two problems of drone region alloys and loot melting then were getting somewhere
heres a blatant forum alt idea for youadd flash to the ingame browser and other bits and pieces to bring it to the same level as real broswers even goons would mine if they could play crappy flash mini games at the same time
an increase in mining yield is not the fix for mining its been said a million times and proven wrong a million and one
and i have no problem bashing your troll idea into ribbons either stop the evemail spam
this would make me mine less i dont want to waste all my time miningif other players want to keep mining fine with me and if that drives mineral prices down great i will transition over to manufacturing and take advantage of itbut so will other industrialists so the prices of ships and equipment will eventually go down does anyone with a normal brain have a problem with everything being cheaperthen i will finally be able to afford to transition over to pve and pvp without trading plex or selling game items on ebay of course i will still have to mine on occasion so i can make something or just make some money but when i loose my ship and all my modsrigsimplants it wont take me weeks or months to replace themthink about it
1 your doing it wrong2 no one said you had to waste your time mining3 your full of crap4 repeat above list again until its clearly in your mind stop the evemail spam
navy ships are supposed to be somewhere between t1 and t2 so bcs are going to be around 7090k ehp and 600800 dps thats assuming they go with a straight up dps role which i hope they dont do id be alright with more ships but they need to balance what they have already before they add more to their plate be nice to see a gallente ship in the top 10 ships used 
you know price discrimination only works if consumers cant sell to one another1 for not taking basic economics
nice idea but may make it a little complex but it does make sense like drake said the best idea so far is to be able to sell to public alliance corp or standings that would be a nice thing
conditional pricing seems too complicated on the face of itembargos and exclusive markets on the other hand i can endorse
well that is a good point a neutral alt could purchase the local goods at the standard price getting around the red mark oreven better a blue could purchase them at the blue price and sell it over to the red at the reduced cost plus a feewhat dastardly friend would do such a thing really in a game like evestill i think as many posters noted it is certainly something to discuss if there is a better option lf9000 please feel free to elaborate
it would be nice to have some sort of control over your market orders 1
the point is clearance to purchase said items requires extra effortstatusin 00 allaincesthis is a major benefit to staving off the heads who love to frak the market over stop the evemail spam
yes thats exactly what im saying
no to 1 when you war dec a corporation you are wardeccing a corporation not an individual person
if thats the caseyou have no business being in a corporation stop the evemail spam
this is eve online you can be in whatever you wantnow what you can do is this leave it up to the players like everything else in eveif you leave your corp during a wardec this should be noted in your employement history for all to see then it will be up to the ceos of those corps to decide during the interview process if they want to bring you onthat way if you see a case where someone has been in a 10 corps but has only left one corp during a war vs someone who has been in 10 corps and has fled 8 during wardecs you kinda know what this person will do if your corp goes to war
yesthis is eve onlineand you cannot run from eve itselfpeople seem to think they can play a dark and dangerous game by removnig the risk entirely and getting off scott freeif thats the casedo not join a corphell dont even undockthere will always been extreme oposistion to both campsi seek balance between the tocorp members who drop to run from war dec should not get a get out of jail free ticketif you wish to runlog offand stay off stop the evemail spam
i would add the caveat that you can not join an agressing wardec corp if corp a decs corp b noone can join corp a until the wardec is over or unless corp b makes the wardec mutual this will limit the workaround corp a decs corp b for week 1 corp c decs corp b for week 2 all gangstas in corp a swtich to corp c corp a decs corp b for week 3 all gangstas in corp c swith back to a ad infinitum i would also add the caveat that continuations of the wardec do not follow runaway players meaning if corp a decs corp b and john doe coward leaves corp b john doe cower is still a targetafter week 1 corp a continues dec on corp b john doe cowerd is no longer a target
works for me stop the evemail spam
war itself is broken reallywhy should newbie corps or alliances be allowed to be war decable in the first place shouldnt there be a grace period of some sort like a month or so where they could not war dec or be war decd just to get their  togetherand i think that you should not be allowed to drop corp if you are under a war dec period the cost of a war dec should go up each time you renew or let the war dec drop and have not waited at least 7 days to renew
not supported at allif this was implemented it would be a license to grief noob corps would get wardecced theyd leave and still be killed leading to less people playing this game cause noobs would leave for greener pastures
so weve all read the posts about letting scs dock in stations for years now and we know ccp isnt doing anything about it i propose ccp creates a password system for unboarding and boarding ships in space example would be if you want to leave your sc in a pos csma or in space when you leave the ship you have to fill in a password only someone with the password can board the ship and fly it its like car keys for your ships o
wait keys prevent someone stealing your car
i would spend isk and time on a sc if i knew it would be safe in a posits either this or make pwds on all ship arrays personal instead of allowing all corp access if anchored for personal use this way corpally members could use pos for safety but not touch ships in ship arrays without your personal pwd if array was anchored for personal use
victory from the patch notesin case youre wondering the gunslinger large projectile turret lx001 gives a 1 bonus to damagethanks everyone for supporting this
this would be a lowhanging fruit type of fix very little time required to bring those ships from terrible to merely its no rifter but useful for some things if you have that third slot you could put whatever in it it isnt wired to only fit a web itd be some extra versatility an extra low slot as well would likely help even more as noted they probably need a good looking over all the t1 frigates could use a good review honestly but if something easy that ccp can slip in quickly brings them up from laughable to situational its worth looking in to mid slot items dont use hard points or extra art or anything
one on the present hulls you dont have the slot to fit that boostertwo if you think this is not needed  how often do you fly a t1 speed frigate if your corp told everyone to ship down to t1 frigates and cruisers for some reason would you chose to fly a t1 speed frigate if you were told we need some cheap t1 tackle ships would you advise t1 speed frigatesi dont think that a new pilot who dreams of someday flying interceptors for the glorious amarr empire should start their career by being told first before you can do anything useful take this book and train minmatar frigate iii in the most goofy manifestation of the issue
please let us change the ammunitionscript in active modules let me explain with an example a pilot has fitted a tracking computer to his midslot he has placed an optimal range script into the module and has activated it he decides he would prefer a tracking bonus instead without deactiating it he right clicks the module and selects the tracking speed script the module completes its current cycle with the optimal range script effect functioning as normal at the end of the cycle the module automatically changes scripts and resumes with the new effectin effect this lets us queue the change ammunition action until such time that it can be carried out successfully particularly in laggy situations deactivating the module for an ammunition change can leave us without the benefit for almost a full cycle this will make instant ammo switching actually function as advertisedeven better this kind of functionality will combine three server requests deactivate module switch ammunition reactivate module into one request which should reduce server loadif you can make it function for turrets and missiles itll be even better  imagine firing scorch at your target selecting conflag and then have your turret resume firing with that crystal at the next cycle if im switching ammunition its obviously because i want to shoot another ammo not because i want to stop shooting
i hear titan ratting sanctums makes 500milh nerf sanctums
ive got a simple fix for incursions i have decided to pushchange the mom so that no longer does an hq site spawn but she starts hotdropping people who are running the other sites that fixes the riskreward ratio without crazy schemes like making incursion areas nullsec or a complete overhaul of the system whether she goes for a random site with people in it the site with the most people least people it will still set the risk at a high barespecially since incursions are tuned to pay out based on number of people in the fleet
the only really good idea ive read in this thread was to stop sitespawning after the influence reached 0that would force the ppl who flys incoursios to stop from time to time so the influence can go up a few percentthe reward should be better then lvl4s basedo n the efford to set up a working fleetyou need logis a webber and dps you have to organize your fleet and someone have to fc that all spreadfire is deadlyfor lvl4 missions you just have to skill a t2 fitted drake or a domiyou never was in a incursion site rightyou can crash a fleet by bumping the logis befor they can warp or scramble them if youre in a lower highsecsystemthe sanshas will melt your fleet yes ships for 50 billion with in 20 seconds
the problem with incursions is mainly that the majority of the reward is just straight cash into your wallet change the payouts to be almost entirely lp based
i know the old system of names was slightly confusingbut i want them backhow could drakes live without their beloved scourge missiles and how will phoenixsnags do without their god thor even tho trauma is quite nice its not conveying the differences if were just all throwing the same ammo aroundmaking things better is one thing but eve isnt supposed to be idiot proof were supposed to get rid of the idiots or at least let them get ganked in their expensive shipsplease bring back the proper names so we can not have boring missiles like other ammosi will always feel bad throwing mjolnir into anything other than a bomberbesides shouldnt kinetic have been mjolnir since its the name for thors hammernova just sounds bad too
so the whole basis of your proposal is because you dont like the namesgot itnot supportnig stop the evemail spam
you expected some other argument for the reversal of the change of a namethese names became iconic with their uses and ships with those of us who are older players no real reason to change them in the first place
i agree there wasnt much of a reason to change the names in the first place howeverthe change is done might as well just move on with it instead of reverting them back and wasting even more time just to do that in the future thoughi would say ccp should evaluate whether such a minor change is really needed
zim your point is well taken it did happen even if it does not happen as often as some seem to want to portray i want to ask of you and the more experienced players if you think that changing the status quo might have the unintended consequence of encouraging the self destruct to keep my elite ratio crowd to not set out in fleets at all i dont think removing peoples nervous escape routes is going to make them grow a pair i think and was encouraged by reading the minutes of the last csm that ccp will implement better training for new players so we dont lose the first six months we play this game avoiding where this game is played with most freedom trying to stay alive in null where real live people might whack me if i get sloppy or distracted is for me a lot more fun then blowing up rats in missions it seems like some consensus can be reached insurance payouts for self destruction seem foolish unless they go to the aggressing pilot perhaps if the aggressing pilot got the payout in lieu of the killmail they would get something besides frustration i do support the idea of a pilot retaining the choice to destroy his ship and all its contents if the attacker can not destroy him within a reasonable self destruct time frame for the class ship flown
if they stop xing up because they could get a lossmail then theyre certainly not going to get killmails which definitely wont improve their killdeath ratioi honestly dont think we can help people who are that risk aversei dont see where this comes into the picture this sounds more like new playersi see no point in letting insurance payouts go to the aggressor i see no problem with letting mods go poof on a ship where selfdestruct allowed to go off not initiated but go off
thanks for the response zim
1killing a cap with a smallish gang especially a subbs gang before the sd goes off is practically impossible even if their tank is clearly broken i know its always been like this but if ccp is looking into it ill add my input losing literally hal
since many null sec players consider all other areas of space and play styles which do not involve null sec pointless and seem to have this burning desire force people into null sec why not just make all space null spacethat way you have no need for concord you can pvp freely where and when ever you want without having to bother with war decs or concord hell might as well get rid of gate guns as wellafter all since high and low sec space and all of those who play it are scrubs and care bears and play no part in null at all why bother having them in gamei mean if every high sec player quit eve tomorrow who would care
1  10 thumbs downedit inappropriate part removed ccp phantom stop the evemail spam
not supported there should still be rookie systems under concord protectionotherwise i would agree
yeah new players can use the rookie systems to get the basic stuff warping undocking activating modules down then join the null alliance of their choosing change their medical clone accordingly which could be potentially anywhere in new eden and get right into it or they could go it alone and once they figure out how just jump through the nearest stargate into 00 and see how well that goesedit recruit hungry wormhole corps could anchor wormhole stabilizers to the rookie systems so they can start funneling new guys straight to wspace
oddly enough as a carebare i am not sure i would be against this kind of changethere is another game i play that has similiar mechanics to eve but all space is essentially lowsec with so many targets the fun of shooting up random ones kinda decreases and players focus on only attacking things that give them economic gain then again the game also has upper limits on the amount of stuff you can do per day so shooting out of bordom is less viable
i cant say i would be opposed to this idea either frankly though it is not something that would be very well received by many unfortunately it will likely never happenalsolast time i remember hearing anything about it the number of high sec players greatly outnumbered those of null sec it would seem unwise to cater to the few and screw the many i could be wrong on that though
turn 00 into hisec
whats interesting is that every time we run a newbie drive we do precisely that and get hundreds of new players into eve as a result
110now here is a gem of a solution this is the real answer instead of ever having to fight for anything we should just have all alliances rotate in and out of 00 space every month to give everyone a fair chance to have all the ships in the game
i would support this if also after some reasonable amount of time 3060 mins they where automatically marked as abandoned both wreck and loot
you wont get any support for this you wont get any counterarguments or reasoning either theyll just call you a carebear and tell you to harden up they will do this whilst directly endorsing eves single lowest riskreward ratio activity they will do this with a straight facemy opinion is that either ninja salvagers should be flagged or can looters shouldnt be flagged its the inconsistency that bugs me more than anything else if i had my way i might actually rework looting entirely to move everything onto the wreck but now im just daydreaming
whats the risk in running l4s in a nonpimped battleship and how does ninja salvaging pay more than thatninja salvaging is low risk low reward l4s are low risk high reward risk reward ratio is risk divided by rewardhow is lowlow a smaller ratio then lowhighits easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths abrazzar the risk of having your day ruined by other people is the cornerstone with which eve was built ccp solomon
its more like abysmalmedium vs lowhighalso you cant run level 4s after 24 hours of training time
the risk is the same for the salvager and the mission runner in his nonpimped bs this is an invitation for you to show me what risks a mission runner faces that a salvager does nottraining time is not what you were arguing so lets clear the riskreward ratio thing before we go gallivanting onto other argumentsits easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths abrazzar the risk of having your day ruined by other people is the cornerstone with which eve was built ccp solomon
oh look its this threadagain
we should bump this thread dailyit is so important that it deserves it
yep i just about had a seizure when i saw that stop the evemail spam
requesting lock so this stops getting bumped
agreed stop the evemail spam
the counterargument was posted three days before you said this ffs the thread was half a page long you couldnt be bothered to read iti really wouldnt care if it were a criminal act shoot me when i salvage your stuff that way i dont have to loot it too
in truth that is exactly what the ninja salvagers wantthe license to shoottokill upon agressionyet they foolishly keep posting this crapthat or its ninja salvager whose trying to pass off as a whiney carebear stop the evemail spam
bumping thread as it has moved down to number 2 on the first page absolutely unacceptable important threads must stay at the top
in case everyone missed it the thread ended on the first page

can you tell when a pilot is afk or nota pvp t3 can cloak and is more dangerous then any pve bsa recon ship can light a cyno while they have your ship tackled you will be dead in seconds with no time to ask for backup  if there is no cyno jammer they can drop even carriers on you a stealth bomber can easily blown up almost all kinds of industrial ships with a single attacka covert ops ship can put out combat probes from a safespot before someone can warp at it and change position cloaked again now being able to reach every single person on the system to tacklecyno itso going out of a pos with a hulk to mine or with an nightmare or a thanatos to kill some rats is not a prove of courage but a prove that you dont know how things are in eve giving an easy kill like this is more then a reason to get kicked from most of the serious corpsalliancesdepending on what is your business you will have to wait the afk cloaker to lavelogoff and it can take some days ruining your fun for example moving billions of isk like outposts parts bpos systems upgrades wh salvage technetium officer modules none of these shoud be done with a unfriendly ship in the localthere must be a way to put some resistance new pos system new sov system
it doesnt really matter if a pilot is afk or not if youre afraid to lose a ship then im sorry to say eve is not the game for youas for asking for backup you wouldnt need backup if youre smart cause your backup is already with you flying around with you ratting with you running the plex with you etc if youre ratting by yourself and theres an afk cloaker in your space you can simply go a few jumps away where said cloaker is not in your space and do your business you can stick to ratting in your nullsec corpalliance sov space so fast backup is at hand and the worse thing is you lose a ship big whoop ive lost plenty and cost people plenty thats whats fun about eve what gets the blood pumping the fact that loses are reallosing ships is a part of eve deal with it peoples fears of losing ships should not be a reason for ccp to change a big part of the game when said portion of the game is working as intended cloaking is there in order for the things you hate to happen its part of war its part of pvp in nullsec and has been for a long time ninja fleets cloakers in your system to spy and to keep you on your toes ccp intended for these things to happenso what if a cloaked ship has combat probes out you open up your directional scanner see that there are probes out get as many ppl in your corp in system bait out the drop drop your own on top have a nice big battle or you can run away a distance and continue you dont scare off would be predators by whining that cloaking mechanics have to change you scare off predators by showing them your willing to fight and protect your spaceyou want to move expensive  in nullsec dont do it by yourself youre in a corp in an mmo with im assuming atleast a few other ppl in your corp make a fleet spread the loot around to maximize potential of atleast some of it surviving get your corp members in pvp ships to fly escort and move the stuff out that lone transport ship might be a tantalizing target but that transport ship with a few bs some tacklers and some hacs flying escort suddenly becomes a less vulnerable target one that just might make said cloaked up hot dropper be like hmmm lets wait for easier prey problem solved no need to nerf a gameplay mechanic working as it was intended to work the only reason ccp is thinking about changing cloak mechanics is because a few too many people who are unwilling to protect their assets in a game that is built around nonconsensual pvp are afraid of a little risk its pathetic and goes against the spirit of eve what made eve so much better then games like wow to people like me whove been playing since revelations and beforeyou want to put up resistance you show that your willing to take them on dont whine to mommy ccp to change the rules for your benifit its simple as that if youre not willing to protect your space in null then you shouldnt be out in nullsec to begin with for gods sakes nowadays with all the high sec indymission running alts most people have its not gonna take you very long to recover your losses anyways short of cap ships and if your corpalliance is well setup even that is not too difficult to replace afk cloakers have been in this game for years but its only now with all the ridiculous amount of botting in nullsec and nullsec bears that ive seen all this pissing and moaning about oh cloaks have to be bludgeoned by the nerfbat every time i come back to this game after a hiatus its like its been emasculated grow a spine its easier then you think
how about we put some form of screen that will tell you who is in that solar system and call it local that way you know if there is a cloaker and you can either move to the next system or just watch a bit more careful
genius
remove local in null sec  problem solvedships designed to cloak recons coverts blockade runners should stay cloaked cloaks should be impossible to fit on anything else
i think ive heard of such a place i think its called something like worms
thats all im gonna tell these anticloak cowards from now onjust go back to high sec nullsec is obviously to much for your delicate disposition to handle
how does this remove solo  smallscale pvp the difference in active tanking is minimal really id say this would improve solo  smallscale pvp for these hulls as people are able to competitively buffer fit if they choose to do so allowing for more potential uses yeah that would be extremely lame to have different hulls all doing the same thing but wait that wouldnt be the case at all with this change the different weapon systems ensure that each race of ships has to behave in a different manner in order to succeed in pvp if you go amarr vs gallente at 0 gallente is most likely going to win however if you start at 30km apart the situation flips and amarr is probably going to win the problem is that this comparison only really works when both ships have roughly the same hit points as it currently stands amarr will probably win in both cases for the discussed ships which shouldnt happen
jon bottom line is that active tank bonused ships are supposed to be better at active tanking and worse at buffer tanking than resistance bonused shipsUFFFDthe main and only issue is that the resist bonus also heavily effects remote rep tankingUFFFDif the active tank bonus also effected remote repair received this wouldnt be an issue as both defensive bonuses would have similar remote repair tanksUFFFDthe only issue left is the difference in buffer which can be balanced out by buffing the repair bonus also buffer tanking ships like the brutix myrmidon and hyperion are also viable options you can get some very decent buffer tanks out of these ships and have the option to shield tank them tooUFFFDanyway if you think active tanking does not work in pvp i suggest you go and watch the kill will videos also jon you need to start posting in the features and ideas forum before posting in the assembly hall
while i am not sure about this particular suggestion i admit i would like to see more done with drone boats for instance for lasersmissilesrails are is an upgrade path through maurders but things pretty much stop at the dominix when it comes to drones i know there are carriers but you can not exactly take those into hi sec hrm maybe even a pocket carrera dronecentric mining ship would also be nice stuff like thati think the existing ones though are fine i would just like to see some new ones added 
eh im ok with this 1
spugg lol i know there are a number of issues that need to be considered aside from dps and ehp but as we know drone boats are extremely under used in situations outside of pve the same goes with ships with the active repair bonuses and that is something id like to see changed there should be a reason people want to fly the eos myrmidon and vexor hulls and its not like medium drones are incredibly fast or do all that much damage anyways i agree that the tracking and speed issues should be taken account when testing but numerous changes need to be made to improve the balance in this game no one race of ships should dominate the pvp field like they currently do i feel this could give gallente a niche in which they can surpass minmatar ships inid also like to give newer players a reason to want to train gallente ships and their weapon systems aside from improving their ability to use angel ships  if you look at training times to get a maximized myrmidon versus a drake or hurricane the time is close to double which shouldnt be the case
definitely up for some boost to us poor drone operatorsthis proposal could maybe use some testing not sure if this would helpmy observation is that drones are on the short range side and we have slow drone boats same problem as blasters doubly nerfing gallente some additional control range might be helpful
i have never had an issue with any drone boat in either pve or pvp they are very good at doing them both the only ship i dont like is the eos but that is simply a cost vs effectiveness issue which needs some balance the myrmidon at a push could drop a couple of turrets and have an extra 25 bandwidth and drone bay cause it lacks some utility highs that can be really useful but its still an exceptionally versatile ship and 1v1 beats the all powerful drake a mate of mine used to fly around in his active tanked dominix and regularly take on and win solo vs gangs ive seen him take on a mega dominix two drakes and a raven and win simple t2 fit and no gang links or boosters there is next to nothing wrong with drone boats other than we would like more drone upgrade modulesalso jon please first post in the features and ideas forum with your ideas before posting in the assembly hall the assembly hall is becoming very cluttered with random proposals that seem to have had little thought before being posted
my skill points represent all the time and money ive poured into eve since day one many years ago eve is all about the natural consequences of your choices not about arbitrary limitations if i make some bad skill choices with a char the only way to correct it is to recycle the char and make a new one thereby flushing my time and money down the drain nothing in your wall of text explains the imbalance or inequity of a skill point redistribution mechanism so i still see nothing wrong with it 1
well the big problem with the docking alternative is super carrier docking games shivers
or you know just train something else and go ask your doctor for stronger ocd medicine
i do not think there should be a refunddo i get to refund projectile skills to train rails because they are finally usefull on a myrmidonalso any skill refund is just bad it will always favor the higher sp pilots
i honestly would be fine with it if it was on a timer like remaps that way character sales would be nicer because you could buy a character with the sp respec and move skill points out of like electronic attack ships 5 and put them into something good but hey i still have not remapped because 15 charisma is the best but being able to lose some skills and move the sp around would be cool
i agree no respec as mentioned before if there was a cap on skill limits then respec yes but since we have 0 limitation then there should be 0 respec you got the benefits of your sp when you could sorry its changed in that case refund all the ships you blew up because of your investment in those drone skills i dont see anyone jumping at that 1 no respec its eve stop whining this universe is to harsh and cold for your whining over sp points to have any effect frig 5 x 4 cruiser 5 x 4 bs 5 x 4 hic 5 as 5 cov ops 5 command ship 5 33 mil space ship command  2 years training to sit in ships i dont fly
 consequences 
the option to relocate sp points is a horrible horrible horrible idea if this happends i will never again play eveopinion of an used to be super active player till leaks showed were nothing but money bunnys for ccp wich sorta ruined the game also adding wth is my station walking wich was promised why are botters still not removed why the gay cave in to our demands in the last few months its not sincere so stop the crap
i have been playing eve since 06 and i have made some bad choices of skills over the year being an older player i think the perks need to flow like wine for us who have been playing for a long time that is why i think respec is a good thing i am all in favor for respec but there should be some constraints 1 respec once a year only 2 limit of 10 million skill pointsthats my opinion
feel free to post in my thread and flame to your hearts content as the other two people that have posted have been for 3 pages
eve is not like other games with a finite amount of sp or techtree optionseveryone has the ability to train everything to max the time frame in which you choose to train something is completely up to you and there should never be any sort of respec option
the point is to save you sp which is what youve paid for with your time and moneyjust because you might use it in the future doesnt mean you should be stuck with it todayeve has distinguished itself from other mmos with unusual game mechanicsyour actions would still have consequences so i dont understand how it would upset the game balance
if unlearning takes the same amount of time as learning you might as well accept you made a mistake and learn a new skill directly it takes just as much time as unlearning something and then using that sp to get it i dont see why anyone would ever use this under any circumstance
i thought this thread was dead with all the trolling going on in itoh wellhathrul an amendment to the idea was later made in the thread to cut the unlearning time in half that way you arent wasting all of your time and could technically gain time by removing a skill you never use and putting the points into something you want lets say you have skill a that took you 6 days to learn and skill b which is entirely unlearned but will also take you 6 days you no longer need or want a so you unlearn it in 3 days and put all the sp into skill b thus learning skill b in 3 days instead of 6 by sacrificing skill a which you already spent 6 days to learn when all is said and done it took you a total of 9 days to learn skill b but 6 of it may have been 5 years ago

almost as astute as the repeated albeit stupidly modified hurrrr skillpoint reallocation idea
oh blah blah blah blah blahwhy dont you guys actually come up with something constructive instead of just attacking me with your stupidityin facti will ask a dev to just go ahead and lock this thread i can bring this topic up again later when the trolls are fewer if ccp hasnt already enacted a change to this by then
hahaahayou are literally clueless

feel free to keep trolling this thread i really dont mind the more you do the more people will see my idea thanks in advance i dont even think i can count on one hand the number of times you have attacked me directly in this thread alone drake shall i start reporting you
i dont harp on people for saying just no like you doand for all of my tersenessi dont act like an immautre child and spray obviously stupid ideas that people can see right through with utter claritynor do i ignore themyes i will call them outand they get all up in armsbut they are just as guilty as they label me to bepeople dont like me because i refuse to back downi give coutner arguments quite readilyand i will back downrelinquish when reason is given enough soemthing you fail horribily to attempt to doall youve said is you dont like this ideayet you support ityour a hypocritical child who wants his way even if he hates the very thing he wantswhat that tells everyone is quite plain and obviousfor you to take offense to thatis quite laughable stop the evemail spam
there isnt any sort of downside to training the wrong thing in evei mean if you play long enough guess what you will have to train all skills eventuallythe only way i would be in support of an unlearn option would be if it took the exact amount of time it took to untrain the skill as it took to train the skill that way the pointlessness of your suggestion comes fully into view and people can waste their training time by untraining items that will no doubt be trained later on

best thing that could happen to make the csm less biased and usefull again was suggested by someone else in a channel i was in last nightsplit the csm into different categories fw trading low sec pvp null pvp wh incursions and many more obviously some categoties would have to overlap players put themselves up for the category they want to stand for people vote ccp would get a more balance feedback from the playerbase in theory
have you ever heard about gravimetricsalso it is not only a chore some people loves to minesorry you guys are doing it wrong go find some other way to get isk or learn more about mining sometimes it can be exciting especially far away form hi secalthough some random spawns of some new rare ore would be awesome new pos system new sov system
no absolutely noti mine and manufacturer in eve online i have seen the effects on how mineral prices effect the mining profession for yearsthis will cause an alreadyunderappreciated career mining to be absolutely useless because the market will be so saturated in minerals that not only will the prices go down but mining will be almost dead on its tracks no one will mine because the return investment will not be worth it at that point it will be years before the market will recoveroh and dont expect manufacturing to be so lucrative either the price of manufacturing will always be tied to the mineral prices people will eventually want to pay less as the minerals falllets take a good look at crucible as an examplewhen the tier 3 battlecruisers came out they were selling on the market for about 200250mil isk per ship manufacturers of course were just taking advantage of the brief rush to purchase as pod pilots clamored to get to them first but the prices eventually settled to about 6080mil per ship as more people realized that the cost to build such a ship is about 50mil when you take into account the mineral pricesif the mineral prices drop by 900 then so will the price of all other ships that are built with these building block of life manufacturing will not be worth it later on as the returns will not be enough to make up for the effort put into them sure you can buy plenty of the minerals off the market but you will find yourself selling a 80mil tier 3 battlecruiser for about 20millets not forget the t2 ships their prices will drop as well but will only go so low depending on how abundant moongoo products will be of course moon mining will probably be the only best industrial profession available one mining and manufacturing have both crashed to hell then more people will go to moon mining and crash that as well when moongoo products begin to saturate the marketwhat will be left then pve missioning will be the only lucrative profession and we all know how much isk in npc bounties will be pumped into the economy should everyone swarm to that professiontldr eve economy will crash on almost all levelsagain no  op
what would make mining more fun emotesthats right dance will make your hulk do the twiststrip will make your hulk produce holographic strip dancers above your ship space porn yayreallyi doubt there is anything that will ever make mining fun
that cant be scanned down has no bubble but otherwise acts like a pos with obvious exceptions like no guns or ecm no moon mining the idea being that you deploy it in a safespot and your gang is meant to stick around ship maintenance or corp hangers as well as black ops cyno beaconswhich have the opposite effect in that if you have sov in the system you get no beacon however there are lots of vulnerable times for the pos you jump to that beacon with your black ops youre going to be sitting by it uncloaked for 15 seconds if you use the ship maintenance array you are uncloaked to use corp hanger youre uncloaked if someone gets a scan off on you youre just got found out
awful idea black ops mechanics are already perfect for getting into non cyno jammed systems discretely adding a un probable pos is pretty silly black ops ships can already cloak so you dont need a pos black ops can bridge haulers so you dont need a corp hanger 1
so you want a way for people to anchor a pos in utter and complete safety with no way to scan it down and not even tied to a moon wowthats a no

well npcs can already do it pthis is actually something that has always bugged me about eves mechanics players and npcs seem to operate by a very different set of rules personally i think players should be able to set up a pos anywhere including setting up locked acceleration gates and dead space bubbles defended by sentry towers
wellacceleration gates would perhaps make me change my mind so long as the acceleration gate was of course able to be scanned and led to the pos then fine but then it defeates the purpose a hidden and unscannable pos would break wh mechanics as well as nullsec war mechanics if you ask me as for your reasoning of if the rats can then why cant we i agreeit is an annoyance but one we must live with in any game give me a way to make this happen without breaking said mechanics and i would be cool with such an ideafrankly i wish rats would regularly attack poss not just in wh space but everywhere incursion systems should attempt to clear out what poss are there by destroying themthe lower the sec status the stronger the rats and more likely the pos to be destroyed
nods i would not be in favor of the unscannable part either i just want the ability to place stuff anywhere and build mazes of doom out of gates deadspace and sentry towers  being able to lock gates would make things even more interesting since that means an attacker would have to pop your or a corp members ship first to get the key
placing a pos or an acceleration gate that needed to be scanned down because it was not at a moon would be very interesting use the gate and experience its hazards jump to the pos and experience its defenses or just camp the acceleration gate and try to ambush a corp member would be nice to set up a series of gates that led to a bubbled death star trap sounds like fun safe spots could be occupied by a pos far away from moons seems like this idea has more plus then minus players could actually decide where and how to populate systems as opposed to only doing as ccp currently allows i prefer player choices power to the players
i think an idea of this nature will require a lot of fleshing out i can already think of a few issues with this such as taking down a gate and putting it back up somewhere else to avoid someone using a key when a pilot is killed i dunnoseems like a lot of work to make sure the system is not abused
bamp
the old jump sound is so much better than the updated apocrypha one it was much more beefed up and actually sounded like the gate was building up energy to blast you through spacealso the graphics of the jump gate energy beam looked awesomeregards bitter old vetmy eve online pew pewUFFFD my youtube videos

highlighting own orders is goodtying it to a skill is not this is merely an ui improvement we dont have skills for things like being able to see overload queue on moduleshighlighting through color alone is less than ideal for color blind people
tech ii covert ops talos plz do want
i think the only way this could work is if ccp implemented a system similiar to the one electronic banking uses where you can trace the flow of money and goods through their full chain and thus prevent getting around the neutral alt hole this is something i could see being intreated into some compeditor to eve something that strived to mirror real world systems more but i can not see ccp putting such an auditingregulatory framework into this game
this is overkill compilictedif people want to use alts to get around thingsso be itpoint is this propsoal makes its bloody difficult without extra effortjust keep it simplestandings permissions much like picos stop the evemail spam
giving this a bump for all the space truckers out there i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i disagree with making triggers random the only risk it adds is that you just need to bring enough logistics to support two waves worth of dps also it may combine to make sites unrunnable if there is a high chance every time you run a site that an additional 4000dps is going to spawn at random a random moment and welp your fleet then its apparent very quickly that the sites are infeasible and not worth runningi always saw the biggest risk for running wh sites as the risk to being caught and ganked by other people if your sole intention is to raise risk of these sites then simply draw the site out longer be it either by more spawns or more ehp that way people are held stuck inside anoms for longer periods of time making them more at risk to other players collapsing into them and ganking them in sitesultimately though everything in eve is calculable most players in this game seek to maxmin everything and will fnd work arounds for what ever preprogrammed environment you can throw at them the only true way of raising risk is my making people more vulnerable to other players i still dont personally understand why the current mechanics around this need to be tweaked anyway

backgroundi started playing this in late 2010 we wwwtribegamingcom had a couple players who were eve vets and a lot of folks who wanted to try eve we basically had about 30 newbies day 1 character and 23 who were vets with 60m sp i was one of these day 1 newbs now what happened was basically what happens to a lot of groups or new players out of all the people who played only 3 of the day 1 players still play myself included most the players actually quit within 23 months i found the downfall to be most of being newbies and not having very good mentoring we kept thinking we needed a bit more before we did stuff when in reality we could have done stuff and had more fun i think within the first week had we had more direction and knowledge of pvp and how the game workedbasically i think we were to scared and most stayed in highsec but the following is some real responses i got when i asked on the tribe forums recently about why some folks quit i thought id add something to the ideas about getting and keeping new eve players even if it was a little bit
i view it as a culling of the weak or just the weak willedthe tutorial is always being worked on to provide a more guiding hand for new players but tbh it introduces you to the tools you need to find your way it doesnt tell you which way but it will give you the tools find your ownunlike all other mmos there is no best training path or best ship fit which is something new players often fail to realize everything is situational and freeform and a lot of casual gamers used to blizzard handholding for example will not find a home in eve but thats almost a good thing the players that are here today started eve with a much worse tutorial and yet years later you still find us plugging away what that indicates is that this game is not for everyone because everyones definition of what a game should be is different let eve be different if anything it cultivates a culture of people with a given intelligence and fortitude to have fun in an arena where the walls are defined and in some senses certain kinds of behavior is expected
in before the flaming hardcore bittervetsyeseve is a rough game to get started in it takes time and patience and it is not for everybody story is pretty boring if not just plain nonexistent so yeahits pretty much a game you get into to eventually do the pvp unless all you like to do is really grind asteroids or work the market i have friends and coworkers ask all the time how i can stand playing the game my answer i play eve at the same time i am playing just about every other game i play because it requires that little attention something ccp should work on fixing short of pvp opsi will rat mine gas harvestwhateverwhile at the same time i am playing star wars or whatever other mmo i have at the time on the same computer using my second monitoredit i am not sure how quitting a game that doesnt appeal to you makes you weak willedbut each to their own
im not sure why this thread is herethis has nothing to do with mechanicsbalanceor even proposing a change so to speakso you got a bunch of noobs that didnt stick around because eve was hardsuckyno funokso whateve online is not for everyonetoughthere are plenty of fish in the seaim sure wow will do them just fine stop the evemail spam
no denying eve is toughthere are casual corps and alliance out there who strive for nothing more than making isk will take all the players who are keen to apply and live a passive eve life sadly sooner rather than later the sheer depth of eve will force them to quit those corps because there isnt enough activity or they want more action or players to mingle with which is all fine and dandybut where all of these newbies strike a cord is the lost feeling when trying to figure out the game in your first few months and the griefing people will run into unwantedundesired unfair pvp within hours of playing eve online get the wrong perception of eve life and quit on the basis that every 2nd player is out to get them and laugh at their wrecksthen again if you see 00 carebears demanding that hisec be nerfed into an iskless zone while at the same time lobbying for more pvp on their terms its not surprising why ccp have successfully modeled and shaped eve to be pvp driven but the future for eve will be to expand the sandbox beyond absolute pvp failure to do so will continue a trend of only attracting hardcore griefers and money makers to eve online for years to comewis space barbie in depth social orientated nonpew pew content will save us from this wonderful 50k player limit we are having an easy time breaking through
the one thing i really wish the tutorial had told me at the end is ok you know how to warp dock use the market and all that your next and only important goal is to find and make friends with another group of players who know how this game worksi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
and the lack of a cockpit view it would seriously ramp up my interest if they could build a view from the cockpit with monitors that would give you all the info you normally have from the external viewand still they go into wow and lack of first person view somehow is no longer a problemi had no idea how to make money get recruited to a corp i could trust and no idea about what skills to train that would be useful longtermobviously it had to be in dark ages before internet search engines forums and all of this futuristic things we can use now
what exactly do you base this idea oncertainly not precedent
why why would you sabotage your own post like this the first four paragraphs were good contained actual content and intelligent comments and yet you finished off your post actually supporting wis douchebaggery whywis is anti eve it will not magically treble the number of players it is a huge waste of time it is not part of eve it should not ever be expanded on its like adding guns and tanks to wow  it is completely alien to the core concept of the game it will take a vast amount of time and effort to produce and it does not expand upon existing content in any way wis would take the focus away from eve itself and leave us with some hideous abominationinb4 the repliescaptains quarters are not part of eve they were the result of a malicious virus spread by a bunch of evil people who call themselves ccp i am still looking for ways to remove the virus from my system while leaving the eve i love untouched but alas it seems there is no cure for the cq disease
you do realize prior to wis we broke 50k every day righti remember thinking that 53k was unusually low at one point prior to the anom nerf
the poor newbie retention of eve comes from two and possibly more very persistent misconceptions about this game1 newbies think eve is a space sim it isnt eves combat is much closer to a strategy game albeit an unconventional one a lot of players join eve thinking that they will be zooming around in xwings but that simply isnt the case2 newbies dont treat eve as a social game this is positively crucial to keeping a new player in the game if all they do is run level 1s or mine while waiting to hit a level cap or for someone to come along and tell them how to play then a newbie will get bored and quit people need to realize that this game is incredibly deep and that they will need help understanding that depth joining a corpalliance like euni or rvb is immensely beneficial to newer players
i started eve in 2006 when the tutorial was hey im aura warp is this button dock is this buttom turn your ship with a double click be on your way captain i was pulled into two broken corps who like me had no idea how to play eve after a few weeks my will was gone to play this game and then i met my eve mentor then it opened this game up when i reached 2 years i started sitting in the help channel and convoed new players that had questions to give them indepth answers and help in the game didnt pressure them to join a corp or give me isk or try to use mechanics to pop them im a firm believer in every player that i can help stay in eve is better for all of us 3 and 12 years later out of the few hundred i helped i still talk to 70 of them this is a social game as much as a space strategy game i believe that as long term veterans we should take off our role hats in the game miner trader pirate ceo of a large corporation once in a while and just be a good ambassador for eve and help out those who need help once a month i sit in the newbie systems and offer in local help most think im trying to chase them down but some ask and i help there is nothing more then giving links to isktheguide evemaps and evehqevemon to help them understand what tools some of us have used for years the immersion and understanding that eve has a dedicated following and that no matter what i will help them and guide them keeps alot of my students around so my suggestion to all of us with a few years in is take a few new players under your wings and help grow the next generation of eve ceospiratestraders or 00 czars frig 5 x 4 cruiser 5 x 4 bs 5 x 4 hic 5 as 5 cov ops 5 command ship 5 33 mil space ship command  2 years training to sit in ships i dont fly

because i canwhat you fis hubbies call doubhebaggery i call foresight your smart enough to see intelligence in a post but the moment that intelligence runs away from your framework of reference you lose the plotfis content alone never allowed eve to see the far side of 60k or even hit 60k for that matter long enough to actually mean something that is largely due to her pvp orientated and griefer heavyfavored nature new players dont care for your killmails gankfits gangs for your sovereignty for your super caps or techmoons they hate blobs and for the most part only care to play long enough to have the novelty of interweb spaceboats wear off over months of mindless mission running skill grinding and exploration free from the burden of having to regrind their isk in the face of losing it to fis lovers who enjoy a good ganksure eve hit 50k but we hovered in that range for a few months at best i even recall the ccp news proclamation announcing that record not too long ago and even with the precedent fis focus only more recently prior to incarna had eve broken that barrier due largely to massive influx of alt accounts i enjoy calling it the pi effect in a world where 1 pi account  1 billion isk  at current market prices for being offline no less thats playing for free and making profit with more accounts than most peoples evemons can shake a stick at only fools grind for isk i expect to be paid not to log inthat increases the demand for plex the after effects we are suffering under now and denounce it all you like thats allot of alt power to steamroll vote extremely controversial and unforgiving lobbyist dictators with their own serlf serving agendas into the csm what do i base this accusation on youd ask my own game style i am pointing it out to you lesser beings because i am one of those pi spamming overlords with more accounts than he can care to look after and i know many like me who have risen with the advent of tyrannisthat eve future vision video wet the lips of the majority of the player base ambulations has long been sought after and will in the not so distant future rise again to be on the tip of everybodys tongue and once incarna 20 comes around and is properly implemented more overlords will rise and give way to much deserted 00 wastelands once joyous griefers who enjoyed trolling poor noobs on the forums over losing their hulks or orcas will start crying because nobody undocks anymore their going to be too busy spinning space barbie to bother spinning a ship the new techmoons will become planets with cities and the new towers that churn out commodities and services for the 00 populations will manifest as establishment owners either on stations or on the planets below eve has much more potential than a point and click spaceboat sim incarna will bring that to fruition and once it does this player base will retain all the sad fis vets while attracting the new breed of scifi mmo gamers keen on making it in a much much more complex new eden than pure fis could ever manage by itself newbies wont quit because they lost a spaceboat theyl quit because they got gang raped in some alley in a station some hobo griefer will break into the cq and steal all the stuff they would have to give on their way back to wow if fis was all that eve would not only have 350k accounts but would have 350k active accounts we would have crippled this massive server long ago its been a decade since eves release how many times was the maximum server player limit increased from the starting 200k limit i read in a pc zone magazine article all those years agonah the future of eve is not pure pvp nor is it pure fis it will start with walking on stations then expand with dust after dust pi 20 will rock our worlds before incarna 20 frees us from the prison cells we call pods and those of you who do not care for wis have no fear youll have more space all to yourselfnah broskies heretics and fellow unbelievers denouncing incarna and the cq as antieve is akin to denouncing ship spinning in itself the cq is here to stay and i say i want moar open my fhucking door
tldr asuka solo has beliefs long debunked by all data and patterns displayed about eve consumers
the new player experience is crap several friends and i spent months muddling about and figuring things out we had to learn the game via thirdparty websites eves poor documentation is what drives away a lot of peoplei have no problem with a steep learning curve eve is a hard game to master im only beginning after 18 months of playing to feel like i have a good understanding of all the games mechanics im not saying the game should be easier or newbies should have their hands heldim just saying that ccp needs to make information available to new players so they dont commit idiotic mistakes out of ignorancethe game should be teaching people the basics of aggression mechanics for example or the nature of the gamespace grids and how they work there needs to be some semblance of coaching for fittings the expectation that everyone stumble upon various information sources via google is just absurd
agreedive learned more in the last year or so than i ever have from the npeand when i started the npe was nothing like it was todayive watched my wife go through thatits  poor to be honestand insulting to the nature of the game itselfof course i dont really have any idea how or what to suggest to make it work outbut people do a better job to be honesthelp channel is inadequateand full of spamall i know isits going in the oposite direction that it intendsnow that said eve online is not supposed to be for people who blunder inmost gamers these days have the attention span of a golfish they dont want cut scenesthey dont want to wait and read and sitthey want action naoeve is for peolpe who are paitentdetailedand willing to work hard for those rewardshence why we get all uppity over stupid ideas like sp reimbursementsor disuprtion of the mechancis to make it easier cause its not fiar misspelling intentionalid rather not see these gamers show up in the first placebut then the npe does need major improvement stop the evemail spam
bump
some people are never satisfiedi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
i want too old names backif i wanted missiles for my ship i am currently flying i only needed to type that specific name in the searchnow they all have the same name which is not only confusing but even very cheapeve should not be optimized for idiots or noobs who cant remember the missile name he needsif you fly a ship you learn those munition names after few days of usage a lot of individuality is lost with the new terrible naming i used to fly a bomber a lot in the past so mjolnirs were torpedoes for the amarr bomber i associate only them to this name and im very attached to that old name  now they all are mjolnirs even if the name doesnt fit at allthe same goes for fhe naming for other items like abmwdccp give us old names back ffs dont dumb eve down for idiots
not only missles but all of them that were changed in the 11 patch
mehafter looking them over it frankly doesnt bother me either way new missile names although simplified across all sizes works fine old system worked fine too
its just the flipside of this opsandbox gaming isnt about doing things one way and one way only the way i go about suggestions is that if i can live with the flipside of any op while having the ops way of life in eve then its an acceptable idea for all options need to be available and open for that little thing called choiceclearly this one has issues as you can either remain in a starting systems or jump straight into 00 blob sov warfare with russian botters or goonswarm jihaddistsdo i want to share anything in eve of course not i believe only those who can afford certain things should be entitled to have them be it via means of sheer isk wealth of numbers brute force or organization and the space poor can die a miserable death in gutters and alleyways while begging for scraps but reducing eve to pure violence in order to acquire items or a way of life is killing the sandboxi dont have to fight for it all tooth and nail if i cant be asked to do so its not like you club the person in a car show room next to you to death on the showroom floor if hes looking at your future car you both order the same model and go crash it at highspeed or find other showroomsyour problem and the most of our pvp orientated broskies with active subs is you want a feudal age where everybody is forced to live by the sword just to make ens meat then you cry about not having enough people to blow up when those people go play other games after a few weeksif you want more 00 add more if you want less local move to wormholes you have that choice stop forcing others to cut out their eve way of life to accommodate youbtw down with communism and the redistribution of wealth
but where will i farm incursionsyeah screw em basically the only highsec systems we really need are jita amarr rens dodixie and maybe a few other trade hubs for me to sell my swag and buy other peoples stuffmost minerals come from drone loot apparently and maybe if there werent a ton of people bot mining in highsec eating belts 237 mining might be a worthwhile profession then there is t2 production which is all moon goo which is lowsec and nullsec anywayon the other hand lowsec is good times a lot of cool people live in lowsec its a great place for single corps and small alliances to run around in 10 man fleets and still be pretty badass its also a great place to go on safari in an expensive clone in the land of no bubbles and very few interceptors so yeah lowsec gets a passbut if highsec was just a few market hubs and maybe a few noob starting zones to get them used to flying their ship and get in a corp and lowsec is still there then yeah id totally support this threadi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
off topic posts removed please stay on topic and polite thank you
just one question if say only 20 of high sec players quit then who would make up what would be a pretty big hole in missing subs
i dont evenno
hey man its your idea to get rid of highsec your first good onealso who cares
who cares where the missing income would come from your right i mean who cares if ccp lost 20 of their revenue not like that would effect the game in anyway shape or form would it
every expansion centering around pvp content that was added to eve subs went upevery time a highsec pve expansion was added to eve subs slowly went down and revenue droppedso your concern about ccps ledgers isnt very well based meaning we can go ahead and push your proposal through ive been talking about it on irc with certain csm delegatesmost carebears would adapt quickly either learning to protect themselves working with others that can protect them or switch playstyles to take advantage of the new paradigm no longer would it hurt their bottom line or put them at a competitive disadvantage to take risks or pursue combat as a solution to adversity because everyone would be on a even playing field once highsec was removed increase in fatalities makes those who succeeds efforts more profitable and worthwhile even mining veld no longer having to compete with autopiloting freighters from trade hubs flooding the market everywhere no gatecamps keeping anyone out because everywhere was nullsec no barriers to alliance entry because all alliances would be in 00 sounds great kobol
it is an interesting idea but an abrupt change would not work however it would be cool if powerful null sec alliances could take over empire space and if faction wars could actually shift security rating and ownership of systems between empires for example a low sec system shifts ownership to the neighboring empire now the 05 system that was next to it becomes a low sec system or if a sov holding alliance could concur a neighboring low sec system with the same affect slowly encroaching on empire spaceit would really make the game world seem alive if the ownership of systems shifted with the results of active warshowever completely eliminating high sec would destroy the game there are far to many activities that are only done in high sec because they would be to risky in null sec how many null sec research poses are there at least 90 are in high sechow many null sec alliances buy meta 1 modules in jita just to fill a jump freighter and jump them out to null to reprocess for the minerals to build their super capsthere are a cetain amount of manufactuing that takes place in null but aside from caps and super caps 90 is done in high sec without high sec there would be no jita
oh those trolls
yes what would we do without invulnerably decshielded dickstard up research poss and flooding of mineral markets thanks to jump freighters
on a more serious notewhat about turning all of lowsec into nullsec
no lowsec actually has a legitimate function pvp minus both sov  bubbles and there needs a place for the sov test lab that is fwalso the sensor booster market would crash
perhaps retain the no sov and no bubbles part but remove the concord and sec status part
allow covert cynos to be lit in highsecdone its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar

 yay for dead bears
was just going over the new neocom features and testing window snapping pinning and configurations memory everything seems to be allright with two small exceptionsthe first is rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things but i still consider it importantfleet composition opens in a new window every time and doesnt stay docked with the fleet window when you stack them close and leave fleet and reopen not when you log off anyway and i assume also not when both are just exited and closedpersonally i feel that if i dock the window with the fleet window the next time i open if from the fleet window it should still be docked also if it were it would be expected for all the columns to retain their spacings within that window the rest of the windows seem to be fine in that regardcontextually speaking they are a little different thoughthe second is far more important and could save fleet commanders a great deal of timeallow us to set up a number of presets for fleets and averts to go with them ideally that means fleet name in advert and description wings and their names squadrons per wings and their names and which voice channels are set to active as well as well as standings requirements and various other settings all the basic stuff that has to be configured every time you form a fleet nowthis way all an fc has to do is open fleet and click the interaction bars then pick which fleet configuaration heshe wants to use for the occaision much less hassle than setting each one up every time especially when many players will most likely be using the same basic setup over and over againid say we should have no less than 35 of these available configurationszubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
also now that we have windows and everything that pretty much appear to stay where you want them and a configurable neocom i suggest we have the option to export and import neocom settings easy as it might be to set up it is still time consuming and has to be done for each accountimpotantly if you have to reinstall because an update or patch fails or for some other reason it would be nice not to have to reconfigure the neocom and window positions and stacks everytime much less for every accountzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
except they arent significantly better to justify a  bonusthis isnt about the viability of these ships buffer tank or their ability to shield tank the issue is that these ships are incapable of effectively competing as they are in the current pvp environment by changing the armor repair bonus to something that improves their capabilities in gang warfare we can start seeing more diversity in the fleets and tactics of the pilots flying around the systems of new eden the difference between your idea and mine is that my proposal straight up solves the issue at the cost of some diversity done move on to something else whereas your suggestion while maintaining some form of diversity needs extensive testing and tweaking it works in some situations but not others the actual bonus varies from ship to ship whats an appropriate improvement in repair amount how many logistics do you balance the numbers on 8 improvement on 12 logistics is much worst than on 1015 at what timeframe should the repair bonus finally balance with the buffer tank of its counterpart 1 minute 5 minutes how does this improvement impact active tanking how does alpha impact this do we look at cases when logistics and active tanking arent involved etc etc wrong the main issue is that the armor repair bonus needs to be changed we may not agree on the best method for making this change but we both understand that something needs to be done to fix it
are you a moderator no well let people exercise their rights to post proposals and this is a proposal here rather than a more generalised idea in fi
came expecting a topic about unnerfing gallente super carriers and boosting their carriersleaving disappointed
the drone boats are pretty balanced as they stand id like to see some more variety and as said they could use some further development as far as a direction to go other than carrier if you love your drones but the current drone boats are very balanced use your imagination when fitting and thing about the impact of your drones do you know how many different flights of drones a domi can carryevery experienced pvper and fc i have ever talked to has expressed a fear of drone boats you can never know whats coming next so its impossible to fit against them
no to sp respec live with the consequences of your decisions
1 no respec in eve
im not supporting drone respec for supercap pilot its completely a bullshit idea and it gives a odd mix message to a lot vets i mean if they can get a respec on drones then as a combat pilot why cant i get a repsec on the mining skills that i have already
the thing is bcs dont fill all the brawling spots available for them to fill the combination of armor and missiles is the classic one drake cant armor tank and all the armor tankable bcs are either turret or turretdrone boats hence some of the hacs sacrilege im looking at you need to step up to the plate besides there are issues with the sniping ahacs as well sentry ishtar rail deimos artillery muninn that could use fixing
the proposal is to add new pve group content to eve in the form of deep space sites this proposal was initially on the original forums for some time and was received well1 sites would spawn 100au or more from the center of the system2 sites would be very difficult requiring several players to complete3 sites would not be able to be bookmarked as to prevent the creation of deep safe bookmarks this should not be an issue since a group would be required to complete them anyway4 sites should be rare or at least less frequent than normal sitesif these sites were to be introduced to wh space then the difficulty should scale and escalations should be much much more difficult perhaps spawning 8 or more bss per capital the risk involved should be great enough that losing a capital or tengu is rather high with a typical fleethmmmdeep space ice belts anyone nevermind
whyalso this belongs in features and ideas
why not and it is perfectly fine here
not supporting stop the evemail spam
as the majority of the playerbase couldnt be bothered to take the two minutes required to vote at all this is a true statement
i think we should keep the csm but i think that ccp should implement a direct polling of the player base on a regular basis and then when the csm meets with ccp the items up for discussion are those that were voted on by the player base in the polling add that to a csm that is voted in based on the player style they play candidates for hs wh lolsec etc and i think wed have a much more useful systemthe world as we know it came about through an anomaly anomou the gospel of philip 15
thread still running  proposal still active  go go go
this has been said many many times before but it is now time to do something about thismy proposal is simple put a timer on how long a pos can be anchored before it is delcared abandoned i like 24 hrs after fuel runs out or after it comes out of reinforced after the 24 hr timer it goes into abandoned mode in abandoned mode it is free to do with whatever you wish blow it up reclaim it claim it for another corp or just flat out take it and sell it pretty simple to say but it is time we do something about these abandoned poss in eve
sounds like a good idea but id only tie it to the pos running out of gas and leave reinforcement timers out of iti honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
sound idea but extend the period for two weeks before abandoned everyone has those derp moments but giving a two week window should separate the derps from the true didnt want it anyway
two weeks lolthats a pretty big derp if you ask me i would say 48 hours max anybody who has ever fueled a pos knows what kind of responsibility it takes as innot much you can fuel them for up to so many dayslike 20 somethingdont remember for sure if you cant check it once a week and top it off then you deserve to lose it
on behalf of everyone else who has a highsec pos but doesnt have enough need to run it 247 and doesnt want to take it down and then make everyone drop corp for a week to put it back up whenever its needed i vehemently oppose this mark them as abandoned for corps that have closed sure but not corps that are still active but not using the pos constantly if theres an active corp that has a pos up but doesnt feel the need to run it 247 either wardec them and then they can either online it and defend it or let it die or get over it
ftfy its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
1 or 2 week timer on it then yesgive me the ability to unanchor those stupid pos in wspace that get abandonedlost with lots of modulesmake it like all forms of theft flagging people to corp that put it up or make it concordrelated with concord wtfpwning anyone doing it in hisec sec status hits in losec and nothing in nullsecsend the owners a message saying pilot deanchored your pos in systemwhen i steal those faction towers worth a couple of billion isk i want them to know
i dont understand why any corp in any system should be allowed to claim a moon by placing an pos at it and leaving it offline with no fuel sorrywardec mechanics can remain in effect but there is no reason to give special treatment to someone who is in essence lazy and cheap
poss becoming abandoned is a good idea imho but the timer should be really long weve left poss anchored for over 6 months before not because we couldnt be arsed to take them down but because we knew wed be going back to them at some pointmake it a year would let people loot all those anchored towers put down by 1guy and his alt corps that dont play anymore but leave most of the towers that are simply not in use atm
i dont see why any person should be allowed to stealdestroy a pos that some people worked to put up and paid for just because theyre bored and if youve ever gone through the hassle of getting an entire corp to drop corp for a week to put up a pos you wouldnt be calling it lazy youd realize that its a pain in the butt what was suggested would just make it so that a corp that wants to have a pos but doesnt have enough people to make full use of it 247 would have to keep an alt there to drop a charter in every now and then to keep it from expiring this wouldnt just be more pf a pain than anything if there is truly an issue of a moon being desired but theres a pos there than thats one thing and theres always a wardec or even asking them nicely to take it down but if its a crusade against any pos thats anchored but has no bubble just because it makes some people feel icky inside then thats just stupid
if you dont have it fueled and you arent using the pos then it is abandonedthat simple doesnt matter when or how long it took you to put it up if you are going to put it upuse it if notits abandoned and yes i have put up and taken down many poss i know how much work it iswhich is why i fuel them
but the timer should be way loonger like month or two
i started with 24 hrs as a starting point on the timer i understand that sometimes it takes time to get back online to fuel things however a notice is sent telling corps that the fuel is running low therefore i will side with human error and judgement and will go with a extended timer to 72 hrs no more this will help clean up the trash in space and give something for those pirates to do and make some money doing it in my personal opinion  if you have a pos then you should take care of it and not leave it abandoned for weeks months  and years let someone else have the space you failed to take care of
with the current fuel bay and fuel block mechanics i believe its 30 days give or takeas for this suggestion i approve 4872 hours is a massive timeframe for a pos to be offline if failure to pay sov bills 1 second after the deadline for the bill results in a loss of sovereignty i believe an unfueled tower with a 72 hour timer could easily result in a free pos to whoever were to come across itclaim it mame it do what ever you want with it just dont let it sit there allowing the spot to collect dust
30 days nice and with only needing one type of fuel now too i would say it is a good change i think the people asking for a month or more on the timer for this suggestion are missing the point i guess this rolls back around to make a mistake feel the consequences forget to fuel your poscome back to an empty space where it used to be i guess 72 hours would be acceptable considering people do have lives and a 3 day weekend will occur on occasion and someone might forget stillshould never happen with 30 days available in the fuel bay
i think 1 week till abandoned is fair game
just taking this idea a step furtherwhat if there was a module you had to anchor that hacked the pos forcing an offline pos to unanchorthe hacking module would need to be online for a given amount of time i am thinking anywhere from 24hrs to 7 days to be determinedthe only way to destroy hacking module would be to online pos and use pos guns thus proving if it is abandonedwhile the hacking module is up aggression should be the same as taking from a can for the whole time the module is upthoughts
works for me24 hour of screaming evemails saying your pos is being compromised would workand i think requrieing guns to online would be a bit muchjust simply power on the pos and fuel it back up to full poweror give the owner the ability to shoot it without concordoken or some such edit  and while weer at ithave it delay the hack timer and require the pos to be onlined for 1 to 3 days to force the owner to pay attention or soem suchbefore the mod falls off or blows upbetter yetother user is flagged with kill rights for the duratino of said agression actionsomething to that effectin exchange for swiping posall modules thereofbecome the new pos owners lewts stop the evemail spam
actually ill agree with you on this one here whats funny is that there is a ton of wspace ore and i mean a ton of it that goes unmined due to oremineralhauling efforti agree that just making mags drop moar salvage parts would be a bad move and wouldnt even fix the underlying problem what id do is make it so that mag cans drop t2 salvage more often and t1 salvage less oftenyes using rogue drone components instead of drone poo as rogue drone loot would make the stuff meaningful heck we could even have some parts that just go into straightup t2 drone production itd make the dronelands more interesting and less of a drag on the mineral market tooyep you can extract c28 more easily than any hs gas and its probably worth moreunit too making hs gas 2m3unit and ls00 gas 5m3unit would make far more sense than 10m3unit and  probably  10m3unit
issue ice compression is too slowbackgrounda rorqual full of ore compresses in around 5 minutes meanwhile a rorqual full of ice takes 80 minutes this creates a very large imbalance in the number of rorquals required to support an ice mining fleetright now a fully researched ice bpo can compress an ice block in a rorqual in 38 seconds the rorqual has 4 lines allowing it to compress an ice block every 95 seconds this lets it compress 379 icehr a perfect mackinaw pulls in 90 icehr this means a rorqual can only support 42 ice miners full time without being backlogged the same rorqual can support around 25 ore minersa possible rebalanceweve been steadily increasing the mining rates over the past few years but never the compression rates to compensate itd be nice if ice bpos compressed faster andor smaller or more industrial lines were added to the rorqual which would then allow for more parallel compression
i would be open to allowing ice to compress quicker compared to the ore dunno how i feel about the extra assembly lines however i would prefer to have the ability to compress from the ore hold
just a friendly bump so other players can show their supportsince this proposal deals with pve i dont expect it to get any support from csm 6
i support this as wellpreferably with option 2 i would however like to know why this mission was removed in the first place
good question like i said when the aura npe tutorial was implemented she replaced all 60 agents who offered the endless battle mission the strange thing about that is theres only 3 career agent systems and 3 spawn systems where new players enter eve for each of the 4 main factions that accounts for 24 of the 60 original old tutorial agent locations i was informed that the other locations did have an aura agent but they werent active maybe theyre active now i dont know i was also informed that the actual idea was to allow players to repeat the aura npe tutorial if needed however players can do that anytime via eve help f12  tutorials still doesnt explain the other 36 agents or the removal of the endless battle missions
bumping for exposurei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
bouncing for more exposure pun intended
id just like to see modular pos and maybe a slight increase in number of sites gravimetric ice sites would be nice and i do like the dea of them being random as someone said earlier that might make for some sort of wh trade as much as i loooove pewing people having something to promote non hostile player interaction within wh space could be interesting has happened once in my 3 months of wh life when a neighbour invited us to come run c4 sites with them
wh mass stabilisers is one of the more pantsonhead idiotic ideas ive heard from this csmand you can probably guess which component of same proposed that notwostep you are needed
what if there was a module you had to anchor that hacked the pos forcing an offline pos to unanchorthe hacking module would need to be online for a given amount of time i am thinking anywhere from 24hrs to 7 days to be determinedi think the hacking module should be invulnerable while the pos is offline once the pos is online the hacking module can be freely shot by anyone in the corp that owns the posif the pos goes offline again the hacking module is invulnerable againthe hacking module should only last 7 days regardless of the number of above cyclesthe aggression should be the same as taking from a can for the whole time the module is upit would in theory be possible to war dec the corp that owned the pos in a push to prevent them from refueling the posnew proposal created as it is substantially different to a simple timer
more specific details on functionality and specs would be greatdont have the time to spitballbut def supporting this stop the evemail spam
with the amount of space junk out there in the form of abandoned poss this is an awesome idealike itlike it alot
three things i would suggest first off the timer should be long enough that people who dont play every day many of us have real lives can still defend the pos a week sounds more reasonable to me than 24h with 72h being a bare minimum of what i would see as reasonablesecond attacking the hacking unit should not flag the defending corp towards the attackers i think this should be a get rid of unusedunwanted poses not a anchor something and make the defenders either come out and diaf or lose their pos nothing stops the attackers from wardecing the defenders thoughthird the thing shouldnt have more ehp than a bc can chew through in an hour or two you shouldnt need to bring 50 friends or capital ships to take one of the things down in a reasonable amount of time providing for those things i think its a reasonable compromise between cleaning up dead poses and allowing people who still want to keep their poses to have themoh and i dont think they should be crazy cheap either i would say 2050m minimum to keep them from being spammed all over the place though the number might be less depending on how much of a pain they are for defenders to get rid ofyes i know what i proposed would favor the defenders but it seems to me that if a corp worked to pay for a pos and grind the standings to put it up they should get a homefield advantage if theyre willing to come out and stop someone from taking it down i see this as a get rid of unused poses not a tear down all poses that arent defended well enough
i dont think it should be longer than 1 week though having it be 7 days would work well as it ties with the same time a standard war dec isin theory if pos guns were used once the pos is online not really an issuetotally agree yep definitely no resists 100000 shield armor and hullalthough i suppose if the time is 1 week and it is unsuccessful in that time it might as well blow its self up when the pos comes onlinethe value will be hard to balance but that is a good ballparkif they blow up when a pos comes online they might be more careful about what poss they targettotally agree
nice one geoff i like the idea  once the suggested 7 day timer is up could you give the target pos owner or anyone the option to salvage the now offline hacking module and score some nice salvage or even to counter hack it and take ownership within a short period of time say 24hr window after the 7day timer is up
umm whati think you have been smoking something else today
you should have at least a weeks fuel loaded into your tower at any given time and i think the op is talking about pos that have run out of fuel1
since i already supported this suggestion in the other thread this idea came from i will support it here as well under the same conditions as the other proposal 72 hour max wait period after pos goes inactive from lack of fuel before module can be placed and tower taken or looted1
i agree my point is that there should be sufficient time to respond if someone is trying to hack your pos even if you forgot to refuel your pos sometimes you know you need to refuel but forget or put it off a bit too long stupid but understandable you shouldnt come back to the game a day or two later to find your pos just gone anyone who logs onto the game every couple days and doesnt want to lose their pos should be able to defend it if someone tries to hack it that is the point of all of what i had posted
what a bad idea are you really serious or trolling
couple pointsthread is here bc i didnt feel there was another good spot for it really if the mods feel it is better suited for some other place i would love for them to move it i dont spend a ton of time on the eve forums so dont know the ins and outsthis thread was created only because i wanted to actually provide some feedback from rl people i have gamed with a lot on why they quit after reading the lastest csm minutes it hit me how much trouble the normal people might have with this i wanted t leave the feedback where the csms or someone could maybe start compiling reason finding the most said and working with them i dont mean the casual i dont mean the wow omg easy mode players i mean people who play a lot of games people i consider overall decently intelligent and good gamers folks like myself who research and read and look things up will slowly stumble through the game the question is though and i used to not agree with this why should they be forced to go outside the game to accomplish and learn stuff i love eve it is a social game when people ask me about how i play eve i am quick to correct them saying i play eve the universe not eve the game bc eve the game sucks and i think this is very much true if youthey try to play eve as a single player game they will obviously faildo i want eve to be easy no do i like the learning curve yepdo i love the fact ccp refers to new players as ones with under 6 months played absolutelyeve is not like dungeon defenders or wow or any of those other games where you max out in level in a week or two then spend the rest of the time grinding i enjoy the fact i dont have to worry about leveling ive done enough that having playing mmos since 98 but with all that said id love to see another 2030k players on every night more players  more pew pew and i like pew pew
ignore the elitist trolls who think they know everything about everything you are fine with posting it here if the mods want it moved they will move it i bet you would get more exposure with something like this in general discussion though
but concretely what should be changed based on complaints newbs made
my brother and i started playing eve in 07 we knew no one in game or in fact anyone who had even played eve we started out doign missions and meeting people in the gallente channel after a couple of weeks we decided to make our own corp all we did was missions and socialising for weeks more made some contacts through the empire channels and got into more involved thingswe had no one to help us along the way no one to tell us th ebest ships or skillplans and we made alot of mistakes we went to lowsec in frigates and got involved in a little light pvp and lost most of our ships to say we were having fun is an understatement we made lots of friends and someone lent me 20 million isk to pay for my first battleship i thought he must be the richest guy in teh world it was a slow start indeed lol bt we didnt know any betterthen we got invovled in a corp that went to nullsec disbanded we ended up in lowsec with some friends then onto wardeccs by this time we wondered how we ever had fun doign missions we lost we won we struggled to keep our wallets full enough to pvp withwe created a new corp sons of 0din at the end of 08 small time pirates in lowsec at first then joined a decent alliance and got stronger from there we moved around a little became more powerful got a decent reputation as a force to want aroundmore than 3 years after forming that small group of friends we are now a very strong corp with great pvpers having amazing fun in nullsec with a great coalition we have a strong income buying capitals and expansive things for our pilots sons of 0din is a great corp to be in and an even better one to have the honour of leading inwe did this with no one holding our hands no one advising us eve on hard mode from day one clawing our way to where we are todaygreatness comes to those who take it
its just a name deal with it
if its just a name they could give us the old ones and no trauma is not just a name its a pain in the brain
no thor is the god of thunder hence em damage
i miss my scourge furys free the scourge
see i had completely forgotten what they were called before the change until you said that now i cant even remember what they are called nowthats how much the name of our missiles matter to melol
improvise adapt dominatechange is made deal with it
hahaeveryone who responds to a mayday becomes flashy red to anyone aggressing the mayday pilot or something like that
the ccp employees whos salary is paid by those subscribers would care
also every player in eve that would no longer be able to play when the servers shut down from lack of funds and ccp goes out of business
not only that but with hi sec gone all those factionofficer rewards in null sec would have no market in fact the economy in general would probably tank not to mention fewer targets and less space for newbies to explore the game so the faucet of new players would start drying up
a few systems are all that nullsec residents use in highsec but if those were removed along with all others that would break the game such is the importance of jita it outweighs all other highsec
factionoffice mods would go on capital ships much as they do now newbies would continue to move right away to nulllow just fine much as they do now the only change to the economy would be thanks to the removal of the ability of npc freighter alts to afk autopilot across new eden and the ability to afk mine a massive boom to the value of lowore mining and basic manufacturing stuff newbies do oldbies used to ratting with their officerfit faction bs or ice mine under permaprotection of concord on the other hand invalidating the efforts of newbies by generating resourcesisk far more efficiently might have career problems however i wouldnt consider those people newbies though support kobol  remove hisec
or nrds would simply become a more viable roe
oh my god i actually agree with thisdamn you
i wish to discuss a possible course of action to be taken by ccp in order to revitalize and reinvigorate this game we love called evefor those of you who have not realized it yet eve is on the verge of a crisis due to its decreasing player base this is evident both in a study of historical players in the world down roughly 1520 at peak time from this time last year and you can see that ccp themselves have recognized this by the ever growing time frame of free trial period which went from 14 days a year ago to now 2 months at the time of this postingnow i personally do not want to see this game wither away from under us but it is clear that something needs to be done to reenergize the gamei wish to discuss the concept of manualtactical ship control and combat as a viable solutionwhat i mean by this is not just simply allowing players to use things like standard aswd controls to maneuver their ships instead i mean things like limited firing arcs for weapons weapon collision with nontarget objects this means that players would need to maneuver their ships not only to optimal range but also optimal position to bring as many guns as possible to bear on their target fleets would utilize tactics such as formations to obscure critical ships such as logistics ships from direct attackfrigate pilots would be forced to engage in pitched dog fights with one another and so on up the line as ships would have to jockey and out maneuver one anotherthere are several proUFFFDs and one really big con to this ideapro1 this new aspect of combat would make the battles much more in your face adrenaline pumping experiences and add a massive new depth in terms in in battle tactics and strategies2 because of this the game becomes more accessible to new players because manual flight control means player skill is just as important as character skill in combat this gives newer players a fighting chance against older playerscon 1this is a rather big con associated with this idea on ccpUFFFDs side of the equation which is that it would be a lot of work for them to do to make it happenbecause this aspect of manual control of flight with things like having to worry about hitting intervening objects would fundamentally change the very nature of all combat in the game this means every ship capable of mounting weapons and all pirate mission and other aiUFFFDs would need to be rebuilt or redesigned to take this change into account and maintain balanceso it would not be something that could be done quickly and would likely require a lot of work after the fact to work out any kinks in the system2 redesigning ships and weapons and such would lead to possible issues with existing players ships especially those who logged off in space before such an update this could lead to all kinds of complaints about lost module ship etc after such a patchi know this is a tall order in what we could ask of ccp for improvement and i would like to see everyone get behind this because really eve can ill afford major hit to the player base like we had with incarna
bumping this because nobody has bothered to post in it even though i can hardly believe that there is a pilot in new eden that would disagree with ityou dont have to give me likes just 1 it for cripes sakeszubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
how about giving the sacrilege a buff like its little sister the vengeance just got but with an extra lowslot instead of highslot in that way you could fit an extra ballistic control system ii get better dps while still having a good tank hams can stay as they are and the sacrilege can still be specialized in close range brawling
ishtar has highs i thought those were just dla slots
exactly and dlaii uses up 55cpu combined with the reduction for drone rigs and the fact that all other drone mods are very cpu intensive makes fitting anything else in the highs tricky
not sure why they need to be deep space just to make them harder to findbut multiplayer exploration sites sound good they do not even need to be particularly hard consider a site about has hard as a l4 mission but protected by an acceleration gate that only lets t1 frigates through
another halfassed idea from vs  this from the guy that tried to sell you unlearning first off assmembly hall is for proposals that have already been well thought through and discussed in features and ideas discussion thread this is not a well thought out idea and has not been evaluated on fi yet so it does not belong here also we dont need more content atm until some of the current issues are fixed this is just another boring site to run when what we need is a change to the npc ai to make their sites more interesting as a whole learn to use the forums and put ideas where they belong
the whole idea is that when scanning for sites there is a metric  ton of space that is just thatspace all sites are located within a relatively close distance to a planet and are easy as hell to find i want it to be that random site out in the middle of nowhere that you would only find if you thought to actually scan the areas you wouldnt normally bother scanning
my sentiments exactlybut my words would be deemed inappropriate stop the evemail spam
add in a polling option in the next poll to see what the playerbase thinks of the csm then see if this thread has merit
has anyone else noticed that almost every single ban the csm poster has almost the exact same avatar its almost always a skinny chick with dirty brown hair in almost the same pose and wearing a tshirtwhich in eve are all the samemaybe im just nuts to think they all look alike but surely someone else can see it
and what about inviduals like mittani who mostly seems to represent goons who happen to do a lot of 00 sov stuff fleet fights pos capitals industry ratting mission running incursions pi etc you guys do realize that a lot of the big 00 alliance do just about everything you can do in this game i think just about the only thing we goons dont do atm is wormholes and mining
lolproove itlink me 1 single pi suggestion by a goon that would make eve bettershow me a single mittani post that would boost capitals
the op has a point its statistically proven that people with more likes make better posts just look at lyris nairn that guy hasnt made a single bad post yet
given threads like the give and get likes type threads i think the whole notion is pretty rediculous personally never took part in it and wouldntzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
k but you guys gotta throw some likes at me so i can keep sharing the miraculous story of ban npc corps from game and csm forums
currently its like this1 guy has 10 to caldari navy100 guys have no standing 10 corporation standing to caldari navyor1 guy has 10100 guys have no standing1 guy has 01 bad standingetc you get the idea its totally pizza adjust standing effects towards npcs and fix it to work according the real average or something so it makes some sense or even better corp only gains standing if some corp member actually does something to inrease it
please do not write in all caps
heres an idea make a way to zero your standings out towards a corpfaction if you have positive standings this would solve the either grind up standings or pray to somehow hit 0000000 standings so you no longer count issue and as the previous poster said dont scream out your message in all caps it just makes people think youre a raging idiot who should be dismissed and ignored
i beg you pardon sir but could you pleaseignorecom
heres an ideastop posting in caps like a  reported for excessive shoutnig and spamming stop the evemailUFFFDspam
yes that is the idea i was shooting for with one exception it needs to be scaled to the existing ships under the basic concept that all existing ships in eve were designed using said tool so players would not be able to say build a equivallent tech 2 frigate of a wolf and have it have completely better stats they might be able to build a ship similar to the wolf that plays to the players strengths but not out do the existing ships
the main issue with having an abandon timer seems to be the difficulty of putting up a pos in high sec due to the standings requirement currently a corp that wants towers kicks everyone with low standings maybe hires high standings filler members then puts up as many towers as they can as placeholders against future need the result is alot of unfueled posesmaybe we need two changes1 unfueled poses become abandoned after a period of time  i personally like a week or 22 a corp that does not have standings can buy anchoring rights say a few hundred mil per pos
yep i think that would be oki think the hacking module should be invulnerable while the pos is offline once the pos is online the hacking module can be freely shot by anyone in the corp that owns the posif the pos goes offline again the hacking module is invulnerable againthe hacking module should only last 7 days regardless of the number of above cyclesit would in theory be possible to war dec the corp that owned the pos in a push to prevent them from refueling the posi was thinking can aggression as it applies to the corp as opposed to an individualplayers in npc corps should not be able to deploy hacking modulesyep
lots of good stuff herekinda feels like a mini sbu to be honest stop the evemailUFFFDspam
i think this needs to be kept simple no to hack module although it does sound interesting no to anything over a week it doesnt take that much time to fuel the pos
agreed the more complicated something like this is the more work it is for the devs and the less likely it is to be implemented a hacking module sounds like a cool idea and maybe not all that hard to implement though i still think anything more than 3 days is far too much if you cant keep your pos fueled and be responsible about it then you dont deserve to have it there
then geoffwice should make his own sepearte proposal because the proposal here is flooded with draw backs that would cause major disruptions for both partiies invovledi will not support this in its current formgeos proposal has the best shot overall in my hoenst opinion stop the evemailUFFFDspam
done
nah dude lets go the super brutal route and say the very instant your pos runs out of gas its abandonedso yeah if you leave a dead pos around a moon for 6 months and nobody notices then all the pieces will still be there just abandoned and waiting for fueli honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
what these two said that hacking thing needs too much refinement to be a viable anti pos mechanic and to be honest i just dont like the sound of an easy way out if you want to take down my pos let it run out of fuel or bring more dps
maybe i misunderstood but i think the idea of using the hacking module to unlock the tower to take it down and take whats inside after it is out of fuel sounds ok a hacking module should not be allowed while shields are up this would be pretty simple and straightforward if it was just like hacking a can after the shields are down
i appreciate the visuals a lot in eve online but i would like to enjoy the effects speed and sounds more like some of the shots we see in the crucible trailer and the likesim suggesting a couple of shortcut buttons for preset viewsone could be like setting a target youre orbiting as parent while following your own ship around but with the click of one button instead of rightclicking the target it will then automaticly follow the target that youre shooting at other presets could be like in the beginning of the trailer where the camera stands still in space while viewing your ship pass by this preset could function in a dynamic way and change position depending on where youre flying and so on a moving camera that focuses on your ship could also be an option and there could be a close range preset with focus on the guns and the direction of shooting  this could be great to really appriciate the new turrets there could also be a preset that mixes the different options to show something similar to what we see in the trailersmaybe these options arent the best if youre in an intense fleet fight and have to concentrate but sometimes you just want to enjoy the visuals this could also give an entertaining value to ratting where you just have to hit f1 and get bored the most important thing is that these view options can be selected by clicking one button and switched away as easily if you need to get an overview of the situation youre ini think its a shame that we dont appriciate the visuals in a more dynamic way like in the trailers because the effects are right there in front of you we just need the proper user friendly shortcuts for these views 
markets dont crash due to increased production they crash due to the lack of production
i come across a grav site called large omber deposit in space where omber is everywhere and think whats the point at least make grav sites have ore that does not occur in that same system in the public beltsalso the occasional small abcm roid would not be unbalancing and add a little spice and variationalso add high end ice roid grav sitesfor mag sites they already drop skillbooks increase that and add many more types to the loot table make it so no one skillbook type drops more often than players buy it from the npcs that way the market never crashesand i like the salvage rebuilding idea making a singe intact item by rebuilding it from parts taken from many damaged itemsgas sites rework boosters so players will actually want to use them even for just casual stuff doing a mission faster or mining faster that was supposed to be part of incarna iteration but has been put on holdbut the real kspace exploration fix thats needed for the kspace explorer wormholes are the vermin of the sky years ago the observer probe would tell you what is and is not in a system but no position information at all bring something like that back scanning out wormhole after wormhole is just tedious
to all those who are in support of this idea get more people involved bump for exposurei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
are we there yet
still trying to get thereits an uphill battle
100 approval for this change i would love this lolwe should take the physics from other games and make this game lulzy aka for boobies ptheres a lot of companies that steal ideas loli just wanted to resupport this proposal if i forgot if i did support it before i hardly remember if i did post on this 
ccp removed the names on corpsesput names back on corpses many other people besides myself like to collect peoples corpsestradesimple fixput the names back on the corpse when you click show info
yes please
1now there is no proper way to sell famous corpses without being scam as you can not see the name while on contractccp please fix this again
i didnt know this had been done but it should immediately be undoneyes please fix
all my precious corpses ruined  
noooooooooooooseriously i have famous corpses why ccp whyhow i feel about this
1 and when can i hang them on teh walls of my cqbut seriously its important to some people that they know who those corpses are
1 who on earth thought this could be a good idea
holy crap what were you smoking ccp
theres no point to me corpse collecting if nobody else can see the names but me
pwease 3
why was this doneplease undo it
they said so many thing which never happends
no 
im not sure how to explain this but here we goxl guns should not be able to hit small ships i mean seriously i know eve is a game but it doesnt even make sense citadel torps were nerfed which was good it made sense and now i see constantly gun basedtitans hitting smaller and smaller targetsexample
you obviously have no understanding of remote tracking links and various fleet boosting abilitiestitans cant shoot sub caps effectively as you claimnot without assistance that issomeone who even comes close to understanding super cap combat should understand this conceptaparently you do not please stop posting requests on concepts you do not understandthere are discussions about nerfing the boosting of such thingsbut you have to have ships fielded with these mods which takes away the dpssupportability of hte fleet in some areasso honestly in my opinion its fairly balancedbut then super blobs make it cheap at that rateps if he the titan wasnt boostedthen its quite possible the ship was standing still due to webbing or otherin that casehes a dead pilot the victim stop the evemail spam
titans do have very strong tracking abilitiessince crucible 10 many weeks ago they can no longer be remote tracking boosted or remote sensor boosted eitherthere are no fleet ganglinks that improve their tracking abilitiestheres strong drop booster which improves their tracking by 375  which is huge and probably shouldnt apply to superstheres a 5 tracking speed implant eifyr and co gunslinger ax2 which goes in slot 7as can be seen on that kill there were no webs used its entirely possible the scimatar was just sitting somewhere but from what ive seen titans have no problem hitting much it is only a matter of time before they get nerfed in some form ccp will not be satisfied until supers cannot defend themselves against subcaps at all
as jita bloodtear so expertly posted mr drake draconis it turns out youre the one who is dumb and has no clue about supercapitals the shoe other foot
loli have his posts ignored so i dont see his blathering crap anymore but that is just funnyto the op i think we had a thread similar to this recently i allowed one of my corpies to pod me out of a wh recently i was movingin my pod with him in a dread one shotpop really didnt expect that lol
i stand correctedwas unaware of these changeshowever it does not detract from the ignorance reflected in the ops posttitans arent much good for a whole lot honestlyi dont see justification for nerfing of their weapons platformsdreadnaughts are worse off to be honest stop the evemail spam
stop posting
that is the most god awefull killboard i have ever seen
hahaha solo drakban is literally hitler and literally bad at killboards its terrible but so is losing a thrasher to titan guns fake edit apparently you cant say the former leaders name of germany during world war ii in these forums churchill would be proud
aw im sorrydid i hurt your widdle feelings stop the evemail spam
the sig radius of that logistic is not as small as you think it is if you fix the reason you make golem pilots very very angry
i agree titans and super carriers should not be able to fire on sub capital shipsin the same breath sub capital weapons should have no effect on titans or super carriersboost caps
you right its not that small but its meant to be one the smallest of all the cruisers honestly i dont see many fleet of dreads shooting cruisers and below mostly because it doesnt make practical sense which is why i only addressed titans in the postdrake so you dont see the flaw to titans hitting cruisers and below i think if you reread my original post youd notice that i meantioned only that they should not be able to hit things that are cruiser sized and below not all subcapsi believe all caps should be viable against battlecruiser and battleship
show up the the fights vs raiden and perhaps you shall see what we are talking about surprised you havent already since its your new space they are hitting 
lolyou thought he played eve nohe just trolls the forumsi was playing around with dreads in eft last night i was rather shocked with what they look like they can do now i could see a minimal tank all tracking spec dread clearing the field of smaller ships
what kind of module does the golem gets a bonus to little hind its the same module that gets a bonus from electronic superiority gank links with maxed skills you get close to 50 sig increase perpainter the logistic in question had the sig radius of a bc and as such was hit as easy then a bcit is depressing how few pilots know the game mechanics of a game they play for years
i show that scimitar as having a signature radius of 608m im not sure what battlecruiser you are flying that can do that but mad props to your l33t devhax ability there i guessthats a signature radius that is incredibly hard to hit for any amount of damage with battleship guns without webbing down the ship to nearzero speed to be able to hit it for huge hits with dread or titan weaponry without doing the same which was not the case in this instance also seems pretty randomgranted when you have a blob of 40 titans its unpossible to keep transversal up against all of them eventually youll fall down pretty far versus one or two and you will take hits i think the op posting point here is that the hits should still be scaled based on your targets signature radius vs the size of your guns perhaps i am mistaken
you are lets have a look at the description of target painters ohh look at all those armor tanked titans i wonder what they have fitted in their med slotsi dont need l33t devhax because i understand the turret formulawebbing doesnt matter if the radial velocity is close to 0 the speed of the target is not taken into account you can actually add that value to your overview very few do i can only assume they do so because they dont understand that turret formula and yes the angular velocity of the titan that is shown on the overview of the logistic is the same then what is shown on side of the titan all you have to do is to order the overview by angular or transversal velocity and find the idiot who is not paying attention at the top of your overview turrets quite in contrast to missiles will do full damage on targets with a angular velocity close to 0 no matter what turret you use in that case you dont even have to use target painters
dont need to be a genius just need to kill one
i cant seem to edit my previous post witbout the bbcode parser breaking sothis is made even more ridiculous based on how the dread and titan weaponry on caldari titansdreads and 50 of the weaponry on naglfars works they all hit for incredibly terrible damage 100 of the time regardless of your ship fit or drugs regardless of angular or radial or transversal velocity whenever a target ship is simply too small while i believe this is nerfed too heavily i also feel like this is much more inline with how things should be for all titandread weaponryedit the point is not that titans can get high enough tracking to hit small lowsig moving targets its that they should still be able to do that without such overwhelming volley damage  ie exactly what capital torpedo or cruise volleys doa hypothetical maxvolley hit on a nonmoving 1000m sig ship gets full damage a maxvolley on a nonmoving 50m sig ship gets hit with 5 of that max damage
better example
no if you would like a detailed reason why not please look through any one of the similar threads in this and the fi forum

this has been proposed before there are plenty of people that want the option myself included it wont happen anytime soon though likely wont ever happen has something to do with the way the eve client manages input and whatever i think ccp could do it but just dont want to either wayi support the idea and wish it would happen but it just wont happenas for the gloom and doom of eve failingdoubtful
considering the first taskforce obviously didnt do anything i have serious doubts that a second one will butcant hurt

just saying no will get your nose broken around this guy stop the evemail spam
really there are some good thoughts here but i think that this proposal has a few too many moving parts let me see if i can break it down a bit i do not like the fact that sites spawn within 4 au of planets i havent seen an explanation for that isnt based off of some arbitrary decision that ccp doesnt want too deep safe spots i would like to see all sites that spawn within a system based off of a range restriction centered on the star 100 au might be a bit big but whatever it is it should be bigger than it is now and have nothing to do with planets your proposal that the sites be harder is a completely different issue from where the plexes spawn i dont know why sites farther away from planets would be harder to do or why theyd be harder to scan down if you just advocated for a few harder sites to be thrown into the randomizer im with you however i dont see why these two concepts are inherently linked im against the proposed restriction on bookmarking id rather not have the sites at all than to swallow you cant make bookmarks here becasueee uhh the subspace influx interference or some other nonsense if you can go there you should be able to bookmark it you say that these sites should be rare but i think that it would be better if this scheme was the norm and all sites would spawn all over a system not just around planetsso i guess this all boils down to a not supported vote i would happily be with you if you just proposed that all anomolies spawn based off of the range to the sun and not the planets id also be happy with the idea that every now and then there should be a much harder or easier site than youd expect in a given system but these ideas linked dont work for me
so i appreciate the actual feedback and not a massive troll thanks for that for your first point i agreebut the 100 au range was made with the idea of just having a large area to search i dont want the sites to be harder to scan down as in it takes more probes to get the percentage but harder as in they are much more spread out the restriction to bookmarks is simply to prevent deepsafes i personally have no problem with deepsafes and wouldnt mind seeing them return but i know ccp is far from likely to allow that difficulty would increase based on the range from the sun i say this because it is a common theme in eve the further out you are the harder things are i would be fine with also not doing this but i think it makes logical sense as for the rarity i think if we understood that the further out they are the harder they are then the ones that are further out should also be more rare thanks again
this is so you dont get ninja looted isnt it
uhnoi live in wh spaceninja looting is the last of my concerns i am sure ninja looting would still occur either wayyou did give me another idea though what if concord didnt give protection in those sites past a certain au i think that would be a little more difficult to pull off considering the way high sec works but it would encourage more pvp in high sec within these far reaching sites
i see no added value in something like this and yes this would result in the creation of deep space bookmarks if i found a site like this i could run it with a fleet and leave behind a disposable alt in a rookie ship to log out in space come back the next day log the alt in and make a bookmark in space now that the site has despawned
againi initially stated not to allow them to be bookmarked for this reason i also dont care if deepsafe bookmarks exist or not

would anyone be intrested in protesting at this years fan fest over ccps reluctance to tackle eves bot problem i was planning to go dressed as a robot performing annoying repetive actions disturbances and sketches to highlight eves bot infestation i think it would be ace if a few of us got together to do this for 1 day at least to adavertise the plight of the honest eve player and let ccp feel our pain in bad pr
sounds like a thread for gd or the offtopic boards this is where you post ingame ideas not oog ones
its game related enought its about bots which are in game and encouraging ccp to remove them or have every game magblog reporting about those pesky robots in fan fest it could be hillarious and just the kick up the ass ccp needs to purge bots
interesting you should say that i got shouted down for posting an in game request here not long ago specifically
i think bots need to be a very high priority and need to be dealth with but i dont think protesting like a bunch of idiots at fanfest is the right way to get the point across if you want to make it clear that we dont want bots then bring it up at the round table multiple times until they get the hint
naw protesting would be good it will harm ccp and eves image in a way it deserves even if we dont get into fan fest we can do it outside for one day well have a robot msk box on so it wont effect the next days
do it
i think public protests these days are about as useful as a hunger strike not saying dont do ithelli am not sure if iceland is a free country so i wont use that line but it cant hurt i just dont think it will work is all awww heckit will be funny to watch on youtube do it
well its not an rp board so that would be the reason why likely
yepand honestlythis sort of thing should be like in the events forum or whatever its calledthis has no bearing on mechancis or balance and honestly most people who protest bots are doing so in ignorancei dont deny their exsistancebut people assume that ccp is doing nothing because they think they see a botwaste of timedont let me stop youbut this is not the place for it stop the evemail spam
please lock  hide from the scan the exploration sites at least in empire space from the other ratting players excluding the friendly fleet members since 1st who have found the site enters it it is really annoying when your wrecks and elite npc ships is stolen by somebody who arrives at the site sometimes later and did not fight all waves for the final reward
its all part of the game deal with itor go somewhere quieter
sounds like you lost a race maybe you should try blitzing yourself next time instead and it would make no sense at all to do it that way how can you lock the door behind yourself as you go in lol
this is eve nothing is yours unless you fight to keep it theres no i found it first here its all about you want to take my cookies ill kill you if you havent got that yet youre playing eve wrongcoo  bene gesserit chapterhouse ceo  sanctuary pact alliance
you havent got a clue what you are talking about if you are upset that someone is stealing your precious wrecks i suggest you go play xUFFFD or something similar where no other players will disturb youimprovise adapt dominate
i was once a loser like you then i put an mwd on my ishtar
welcome to eve working as intended
sorrywont ever happen wrecks are not owned by the player that destroyed the ship ccp has made this very clear and it will not change anytime soon if you dont want people stealing your salvage then fit a tractor beam and a salvager to your ratting ship or pay for an alt account so you can have another toon follow you around
so you want to eliminate even the miniscule risk of financial loss or unwanted player interactions in missions why bother with eve at all just find a nice safe stand alone spaceship game as it sounds more the type of thing your after
how dare they compete with youif you want a game where no other players can impact your gameplay eve probably isnt where you want to be

just as a observation when i read the title i thought this would be a suggestion for a small frigate sized vessel which logistic projection for agility for faster warp for freighters and similiar slow shipsif i can be bold and suggest a name change to ferry class like the large ocean going ships that get used to move automobilesstill given you a like  excellent idea
actually the name has been changed as far as class and that is to envoy classi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

i support this ofc because why not making them bounce on naked body is trivial and wouldnt take more than one hour for professional animator all he needs to do is to add two new bones then weight paint the breast area to be affected by these bones then modify walking and idle animations to all people saying its hard and not worth the effort lol
agreed csmccp please do not try to fix what isnt broken wspace is one of the few aspects of eve that isnt seriously damaged whs could use a few coats of paint random sleeper waves better pos mechanics granular corp roles and a few fixes being able to open containers inside of arrays would be nice many of which are not unique to whs but anything that makes wspace more like kspace is going to dilute this part of the game
keep wh as they are improve them but dont take it away from the little guy  didnt stay there for more than a few h but thats how i imagined eve was like when i signed up for this   not super blobs
makes sense that they the counter originates from the same slothulls might even make bcs carry something other than neuts for once a prospect with which my amarrian half is most pleased withdestroyers are not exactly known for their lightning speed or extreme tanks  a fleet could just have a sniper or speedy hac clear destroyers of the field and keep doing what they do with nigh unkillable safespotted t3sbumpin for great justice

mystified why would they have removed corpse names
new missile names easier to remember when you only have one arm and one hand to count on it helps to have four names to remember for damage types stop being a whiny two arm down with the two arm menace
i support this thread first off shooting at a pos should be like shooting at a wreck or a can by shooting at it you are granting the owners kill rights against you it would mean that pos owners would need to protect their poses at all times it would also mean that a large group of pilots would be required to maintain a pos this is to greater enable the ability to fight over resourcessecond conditional wardecs my opinion wardecs should be about a fight over resources and sometimes revenge basically when you declare war against a corpalliance you pay for a number of conditions for instance if your alliance feels that another alliance is mining your ore in a system you can declare a conditional wardec that grants you priviledges to kill any mining ships from the enemy alliance that are found in the target system similarly if your alliance desires trading rights within a system you can declare a conditional wardec against an opponent granting you kill rights against any industrialfreighter ships that are brought into the system of course if those mining ships or industrials are escorted by pvp ships then you have to weigh your options on whether to shoot at them or not note they would not be able to fire upon you first unless they declare the war mutual which then removes the costs that your corpalliance would have paidthe more conditions you pay for the more expensive the wardec will be a conditional wardec that targets multiple systems will cost more than one that targets just one system perhaps a constellation would be the next step up followed by a region furthermore conditions not related to resources would cost significantly more for instance if you want total revenge war the wardec will cost an arm and leg potentially upwards of 100s of millions but could allow for fullon combat anywhere in spaceconditions would expire 15 minutes after leaving the target systems for instance a cargo ship is shot at and successfully runs through a gate the aggressor can still pursue and maintain kill rights for 15 minutes after the cargo ship leaves the target systems this is similar to the 15 minute killrights timer from shooting a canwreckwhats the point of all this 1 wardecs would still allow allout war for a price 2 poses in highsec would have to be supported by large corpsalliances to fight off both adhoc and organized assaults 3 corpsalliances that wish to push out the competition from a region can do so and 4 suicide ganking is still just finefollowon thoughts the ability to see corp members in space would be a priviledge granted only by the ceo to trusted players i would further suggest removing pilots from local unless they have spoken recently dscan and combat probes would rule the day
thats kind of lame if anything wardecs should cost less if anything because the more they cost the more theyll be evaded
1942 is 2dstarcraft is 2dcommand and conquer is 2dmost modern combat sims are 3dx3 is 3ddust 514 is 3dwhat part of the concept of dimensionalism do you people not understandwhatever the case its a moot point as i think the devs realize that allowing flight control in eve would cause a whole bunch of chaos im fully aware of it so why wouldnt they be but lets just say if you are going to argue try to at least make your argument valid and supply some legitimate reason why it wouldnt worksomething like thisfirst person piloting would give too much advantage to the people who were adept at that sort of thing for example it would be much easier for them to use the game mechanics to reduce damage from incoming fire and increase their chances of hitting the target for high dps due to much greater control afforded them for this reason it would offer them an unfair advantage in pvp scenarios when up against spreadsheet pilots who cant function well in that environmentzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
you may as well write a new game from step one for the amount of work this would needbasically what youre advocating is like the us army in vietnam that ccp need to destroy the town eve online in order to save the town eve online
the server ticks at 1hz meaning that it only accepts any new series of new commands once per second this is what allows large fleets to be on the same grid at the same timeintroducing wasdfps type controls the way you envision them requires a much faster tick rate which forces the server to make more calculations per ship which slows things down significantlybesides the smallest ships in the game that you can pilot are not fighters they are boeing 747 sized ships with weapons that fire man sized shells said weapons also autotrack which makes precision manual flight a bit moot

there are times when you need your ship to move in a specific direction but there is nothing to align to and there may be too much clutter around you asteroids or ships so you dont want to readjust your camera just to click the background so here is a nifty feature that ive often dreamed about having in eve you may have used a similar mechanism in other rpg space gamesinstructions1 open your tactical overview a yellow azimuth appears extending from the center of your ship to your mouse cursor and confined to the horizontal plane of the tactical overview2 move your mouse cursor to any point on the plane of the tactical overview3 tap your shift key the azimuth disappears and a yellow dot appears at that point confined to the vertical axis4 move the dot up or down to a point where you want your ship to go and tap your shift key again the yellow azimuth reappears in the plane of your tactical overview and your ship immediately moves to that location if that point in space is more than 150 km your ship will attempt to warp to iti can imagine using this in system view as well it could also give fcs the ability to select and reposition your ship but only if you give him flight control or whichever key you chose to bind this command to
no to fcs getting command of the fleets ships ever but the rest of it telling your ship to head off in a specific direction i could understand so long as its simply implementing an extra degree of precision rather than replacing or dumbing down anything
it could also work with drones order them to orbit a point in space
well i partially agree with any kind of respec thread  this one doesnt make that much sense tho since you would lose sp  time that could be used for simply learning something new without losing anything at allback at 2011 ive posted much better respec idea  you can see it here
seriously the posts have become annoying as hell the avatar pic makes me want to punch some one and heshe is every where would really really like them just made gone but alas i will settle for a way to make sure i never see posts from certain selected people againmaybe link it with your eve block listo and make it block the entire account so you cant see any alts they make post either please for my sanity

lady spanks noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo destroy the two armed menace
do i need to say it
i havent really been through the whole deep safe discussion before why is that a bad thing i can understand that having a spot that is too far outside of a system is nearly unprobable but surely something within combat scanner probe range would be fine right what is the issue with spots that arent around planets
id been away for a three weeks or so and came back to six worlds in a low sec backwater hoping the resources would have recovered enough so that i would not have to destroy and rebuild everything no such lucki dont mind that they would need to be moved i do mind that i would have to do this repetitive dull process six times i just could not be arsedcould you be arsed if not get liking and posting and lets get introduced
my corp says the best asteroids can only be found in low security and 00 security systems so i venture to mine in 00 systems then i discover these antiwarp force field bubbles that trap you when you try to jump so that you can be easily destroyed they are too tough for anything less than a cruiser to destroy so instead of high risk high reward im faced with no chance you lose why make it so easy for pirates to intercept ships at jump gates wouldnt it make more sense to put turrets and empire navy ships around the jump gates so that players can at least get though them why would the empire factions leave thousands of jump gates around the outer galaxy and not defend themim not saying remove bubbles from the game just change them so they cant redirect your ship when youre warping to a gate
make friends fly in bigger groups sorrybut this problem you are having will not change
uhyou already answered your question00 is not empire spacego back to high sec if you want the security stop the evemailUFFFDspam
soooo your thread goes down in flames over in fi and you think youll do better over here
those arent the empires those systems sovereignty is held by alliances if anything wed put gate turrets to shoot you but instead ccp decided we cantthe bubbles are of course not always there though the nice lownull sec gates are camped fairly frequently for the delicious killmailsoh and yeah please dont abuse the rocks in nullspace our communist overlords force us to mine them 237 to fuel their war engines its uh really terrible and you might get caught and roped into it too

still support this idea would breathe a lot more life into the casual pvp aspect of the game which is definitely something eve could always afford to gain
brilliant idea jack i support this
i just got answer on a petition that this change was not a bug but done on purpose no explanation on why tho
this is a mindbogglingly stupid thing to doreverse it immediately god damn
alright let me get this straightwhen you see a corpse in space now it still says blah blahs frozen corpse correct when you put it in your hangar it still says blah blahs frozen corpse when you show info correct but if you drag it to chat or trade or contract the show info just says frozen corpse correct hmmas for why i suspect it may be eventually something to do with dust and making the dust clones out of reprocessed corpses or something

this is the kind of crap that is driving players out ordinance has different names for a reason it differentiates between class and damage assigning similar names is just moronic change the names back ahs
derp de derp the new names all share a name for a damage type for all classes it makes it easy and great old names were tardharded and while the new names could use some work using a name for the type of damage rocks now if you have tech two missiles you know rage is short range javelin is long range and trauma is kinetic damage
awww you have to have your caps lock on to get your point across are you clenching your fists and stomping your feet too there are gameplay functions within the game that need to be addressed renaming the missiles was really low on the priority list and not necessary ive been playing for 8 years and never had a problem with it now go to your room young man youre on time outahs
also what is nice about the old names for example is if someone says scourge you know exactly the size of missile they are talking about it makes it much easier to differentiate the different classes of missiles from one another

assuming something like this was ever seriously considered by ccp i think it would be most easily implemented to function with the current mechanicsbasically you on the client would get to fly around willy nilly as you wished but you would still only send trajectoryvector information to the server once per second effectively the server would receive a once per tick direction change the same as if you just kep doubleclicking in space the rest would be done client sideeveryone else in game would see you change directions pitch velocity etc just as if you were doing it through the current double click set velocity interface server side there would be no difference and load wouldnt change all that much in fact if you consider people spamming buttons 10s of times every second it wouldnt change at allit would be more graphics intensive on the client in most cases of course but overall not that bad you still have to account for slow maneuverability resulting from time dilation and larger ships some would be almost entirely intolerable to fly this way and even a frigate might seem so when time dilation is in effectthe tough part of all this is actually modifying the client ui for those optional features that would be required to make this happen and change the pov for those players who would use it granted you could make it very basic initially just to try it out and employ a 3rd person view just above the ship ad behind it with those controls and later option to 1st person if that seemed workable and welllikedonly other requirement would be a ui button which you could use to jump back and forth between the two perspectives eve isnt really a game where you can only play from a 1st person perspective as much of the space flight and intel is garnered from that distant perspective that allows you to see everything not having access to that would be seriously detrimental in most cases it wouldnt matter as much as you might think if there was some form of radar available but it would still matterzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub

ecm is the only ewar against you cant actively defend yourself it just prevent you from playing with your own abilities ive recently been permajam by a griffin for about 7 minutes while being in a tempest after that experience ive been surprised to make myself that reflexion   you definitly cant go pvp if you dont have more jam than your targets and then how can this game could be reduced at this point  i often hear pilots relating fights where they have been permajam despite their overloaded eccm you can fight all other ewar damp  sensor booster neut  capbooster tracking disrupt  missiles but ecm  the fact it is based on probability making it always possible even with 250 sensor strenght and finally always happen is a kind of exploit in a game supposed balanced i dunno what ccp was expecting from this ewar but im sure they never wanted the final result which is the iwinbuttonsmallscale fights are ruled by jam nowadays and since a longtime people are using and abusing of it this is dangerously reducing the smallscale pvp at a simple factortopics about ecm seems to get more and more rare like if players are losing hope maybe they prefered to cancel their accountit has always been easy to find out what is cheated or not in this game when something is cheated everyone use it nanoera supercaps dramiels drakes considering the good improvements we had on the last patches im confident that one day ccp will reconsider the ecm mechanics

these forums over time have increasingly suffered from posts made by players clearly ignorant to how eve is supposed to differ from some other better know mmorpgs i propose a pop up alert that will inform them of a few of the basics that they have to then accept as read before making their first post initially all of us will have to click it once after implementationhere are some that come to mind there may be others1 eve is a pvp game you consent to the possibility of other players attacking you when you log into the game high security space while offering some additional protection is not nor meant to be 100 safe2 eve is played on one server and there are no instances interaction with other players both positive and negative are constant possibilities and part of the game3 eve is a sandbox mmorpg there is no end game its up to you the player to define and pursue your own in game goals
people just wouldnt read it or wed get a pile of get rid of this popup threrads along with our change every aspect of the game because its hard bawwwwwwwwww and i personally am bad at this game please chance important feature to suit my whim onesmore chance to troll i guess but i dont think this would help very mucha good idea might be to prevent npc corp characters from posting suggestions hopefully the effect would be the same and itd cut down on some of the alt badposts
bump and added a clarification the goal is not to curb or prevent ninja salvaging but to make sure a sites explorer group will not get jumped by a number of ships higher than their own numbers when they are also engaged with the rats within a room
the answer is still no
more specifically the answer is still working as intended eve isnt instanced ever period which is pretty much what youre asking for
today there is several skills that there is no real logic behind capping them for example max industry slots x 10 max science slots x 10  max planets to have pi on x 6 max remote trade distance etc i propose we add new tiers of skills to skills that doesnt impact on the game play more then give us more ways to gofor example a producers is 10 slots why i dont see a reason why i cant if i would want to go for 40slots with the increase in sp cost of my sugestion  add alot of new advanced version of skills that double the training time so for example of the skill is x4 next version is x8 and next is x16 followed by x32 we probl dont need to go past x32 due to time it would take to trainexample interplanetary consolidation x4 skillnew skill advanced interplanetary consolidation x8 skillnew skill massive interplanetary consolidation x16 skillnew skill master of interplanetary consolidation x32 skillmass production x2 skilladvanced mass production x8 skillnew skill massive mass production x16 skillnew skill master of mass production x32 skill
you can max out at eleven5 for mass production  lab operation5 for advanced1 for being a capsuleerit makes sense because you can train up three toons in 3 months assuming you were using 2 and 3 for basic stuff  copymepeetc and it doesnt cost you anything in fact that second toon will train up to 10 slots lab op 5adv 4 in just about the same time it would take you to train from adv 4 to 5as far as planets  i imagine it would work out the same if for no other reason ccp wants people to work together here sarcasmwhich is i know an insane concept to apply to a mmo game sarcasm
because if you make it unlimited there will be people that will abuse it
warp bubbles are countered by cloaking and by having bms around gates use cloaking to make bms the first time in system  then no problem  you can take anything you want within reason no reason to lose a freighter into null without having to worry about bubbles or cloaking

low sec has been ignored by ccp since the game started there arent any real incentives for people to move to low sec other than small group pirating or fw both also very ignored by ccpi keep advocating the same thing over and over get rid of the ridiculous station games its utterly absurd that a station manager of a npc station would allow someone who just engaged someone else outside his station to dock up after a very short amount of timeatleast not without letting them pay a very hefty fee but even that after quit some diliberationyou want to shoot someone at an empire controlled station then fine but the concequence is that they will keep you unable to dock at the station you chose to fight at for 15 minutesstandings with the corporation which owns the station or the faction can decrease the timer somewhat till maximal 5 minutes unable to dockif you want to dock anyways after the old 30 second waiting time you pay a fee fee depends on your shiptype but should reflect a substantial part of your hulls  modules market valuesame should go for gatesnext to that put some more incentives in low sec to attract more people willing to risk to venture there for a certain advantage which they are unable to get in high sec or null secadd certain minerals needed for certain production to low sec or make it more attractive for factional war to hold certain parts under their control because then the stations in the controlled part have certain advantages for the side holding themccp created a game where corruption by players is part of the game yet there is no way to bribe a factional relieve for a longer or shorter amount of time only thing you can do is grind your arses off to get standing or security gainnow why isnt there a corrupt way to gain those standings for a certain timejust looking at the lore of all factions i know for a fact that corruption is one of the engines the empires thrive onfactional or security standing gain for a limited amount of time due to bribery should be possible depending on what you plan to do or for howlong the price varies depends on howmany channels have to be temporarely altered and then ofcourse even that isnt a guarantee that your cover holds as long as you paid for because next to being able to be bribing there is also the possebility you get uncovered by someone who is specialising in locating and fighting corruption and bribesthere are many options to make low sec get more layers of experience and thrills
99 of this is unrelated to the proposed fix it also fails to address most of the issues brought up in this thread the idea of this thread is that were not trying to attract carebears to lowsec were trying to make people who would like to pvp in lowsec able to do so without the unworkable highsec penalties associated with that id much rather have willing people to get a legitimate fight out of rather than carebears who will get continuously ganked regardless of any added benefits to carebearing in lowsec just saying there are many options doesnt accomplish anythingtldr lets stick to the proposed topic and work around that shall we
and limiting yourself to only one variable accomplishes anythingthe whole point of threads about low sec are about making it more part of the game not just a fun shooting gallery for wannabe pirates whos biggest accomplishment is to gank a few newbees and an industrial at a gateso take your horseblinds off because if low sec only stays a shoor em up place for a few then you yourself exclude yourself from way too much of the game and should be the last to even consider posting in a post which tries to offer options for low sec in the first placeif you bring more incentives to low sec then you also get more people to low sec but instead of making low sec just a thinned out version of high secs station games the whole concept of station games should get a kick under its arse asweli am sorry if that messes up your stationhugging playstyle but if you dont have the balls to stick to a fight or the means to get out of it other than docking up then eve shouldnt be the game for you in the first placethey made it so that supers who are agressed can be agressed over and over so the logoffski doesnt work anymore yet we still have way too many other completely out of context options to start a fight and then run like little pussies over and overpeople who would come to low sec would know no concord retaliation but also would know that if  hits the fan the agressor cant dock up like a little girl after a few secondsships have gained a lot of ehp but still agression timer remained untouchedit would merit bringing for real what you can afford to loose instead of what you know can tank a few seconds before you dock up and quick hop onto your big gun
ignore the posts skip the logic and jump straight to the ad hominem i like your style first of all youre an idiotic parrot who didnt read my post at all and has no idea what youre talking about or perhaps a troll second of all you have no exposure to lowsec if you think you can bring carebears to lowsec they wont do it from years of personal experience the only carebears in lowsec are noobs who dont know better or russians who control huge swaths of lowsec who can carebear in peace pirates will find carebears and kill them with little effort negating any gainrisk ratios they hope to achievealso im not quite sure what your obsession is with station games but its probably not healthy supers compose a nonexistent percentage of lowsec combat and your insinuation that i play station games exclusively is laughable please allow me to add you to a long list of people who badly need reading comprehension trained up a few levels
i have restrained from posting in this thread simply because i dont spend a lot of time in lowsec mostly null and wh space i use highsec enough that i need my sec status high enough to allow access to all of it unhindered now that i am spending more time on lowsec roams i can definately see an issue beginning to arise with my status lowering and thankfully only minmitar certain factions hating me for it this is a good idea 1why has this not had any response from the csm yet this is probably short of my bouncing boobies thread and the dead horse thread the best idea in the ah yet
this pretty muchso it should be a shoot em up place for everyone and it shouldnt exclude you from the rest of the gamewhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp

thought i would iterate on this some moreto make one of these what would be neededremembering it would need to add up to 20  50 milsince it is a hacking type modulecodebreaker iand then some stuff similar to what make poss or customs officebroadcast noderecursive computing modulewetware mainframecapital construction partsstront
very nice idea supported
i would agree to 72 hours max or i should say if the anchored module were to be placed it would require the pos be out of fuel for at least 72 hours and then require whatever amount of time to hack keeping in mind that this is a module you have to anchori would say 324 hours on the hack 24 seems a bit long to me
best idea for stealing offlined pos ive seen yet anchor it and they have 72 hours to destroy the hacking unit or fuel their pos

it isnt about patience there are a few skills that are really very hard to communicate and there is a lack of attempt to even do itthere is a real problem with tutorial agents being able to be driven away no new player should be able to get their tutorial agent to stop talking to them in any way but by finishing the tutorial fix this pleasethere is a problem with skill books in the tutorial being given in confusing ways one communication channel all relevant skill books up frontthat said exploration is a headache the tutorials explain it poorly they should just link to the video of the tutorial maybe in the browserthe more common scams should probably be explained you dont have to ban them or do anything special just have some agent explain how a small selection of market scams work maybe this should be done by a new agent a criminal agent who teaches about the very basic common techniques of how to travel and survive in low security space how can flipping and looting work not to overspend on a ship how to scam in the market wardeclarations on new corps and so on honestly learning the mechanics of some of the scams can give a lot of insights into how the game is to play normally its very useful educational materialfinding a corp this is actually hard i heard in rookie chat from someone who had been kicked out of a corp for sitting and reading help guides and such apparently she looked suspicious because she didnt think to dock in station to do it seriously this isnt spy behavior and the corp in question lives in highsec anywaysthere is no guidance on low sec and nullsec everyone gets the impression that both are terrifying places that one shouldnt enter until they have an ancient character and the best battleship isk can buynowhere do i see any lines of communication where more experienced characters can talk to the rookies
i dont really think that ecm is overpowered in small gang fights when i roam with 56 friends we almost always found that damage drones are better in the drone bay unless we are expecting to run into reconslogi ecm on a nonbonused hull is practically a waste of a slot as a tracking disruptorweb is a guaranteed effect as opposed to the chance of ecm tbh i cant think of a single time when an fc ever suggestedrequested that we fit ecm in a utility mid over a td or web occasionally remote eccm if we are running with logi

the whole point is that there be some kind of punishment for training the wrong thing in the first place we cant just allow a respec for free with no punishment at all this idea allows you to do the respec making it a logical choice for you right then and there if you dont need or want the skill but still puts you further behind where you would be had you not respecced at all in the long run
whats the point if it puts you further behindany reallocating sps is a bad idea i dont care if its aurom whatever isk plex or unlearning time its just a bad ideaeve is about consiquences and living with your choices you claim the unlearning time is enough punishment for remapping skills what about all the money or benefit you got from those skills before you unleant them you used them at one time why should you be allowed to forget them and flip them into the new fotmjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
this is a proposal simply because some people want a respec option and ccp has already been looking into it and the csm didnt shoot it down entirely it is very likely that a respec option of some sort is going to happen eventually whether we want it to or not might as well make sure that we have ideas out there so ccp can at least do it with as little impact on the game as possibleagainit will likely happen whether we want it or not is going to be irrelevant

not supportedi find lady spank to be insightful and witty the op probably got burned by spank pointing out the obvious
yeah just block her there are more than a few people on these forums i have blocked simply because they do nothing but troll and act high and mighty it really cleans up the forums when you block them

only after your permanently banned stop the evemail spam
block her and have done with it if you have a problem just dont bother us with your inability to skip over her posts

i would have to say no to this as well simply because this would prevent pvp in said sites when enough people enter the site so that nobody else can get in i doubt this would hinder ninja salvaging at all since all it takes for that is one more shipeither waysorryits a no
so you want arbitrary rules added so that you can be safer utrollinsay they warp in two force recons or bombers wait a minute then warp in a main force of four ships how is this any different than six ships landing in the site with you at onceedit also i see a serious potential for abuse when someone just cycles an alt back and forth using the gate once a minute so that no one else can enter the ability to lock an acceleration gate is just stupid
this proposal would make pve sites more pointless and boring than they already are
hmmmthis thread makes me think of somethingwhat would happen if ccp added 5 more levels to every skill with corresponding level bonuses would this make some ships and weapons more overpowered than others example leveling battlecruisers to level 10 to get the 5 bonus to kinetic damage per level on the drake for a total of 50 bonus instead of 25 if this happened with all skills and all bonuses and considering the amount of time it would take for you to get your skills that highgod forbid should i have to level up my engineering skills any morewould this break the game as we know it or would it make the game just a little more diverse for pvp
thisthat is why they are capped in the first place stop the evemailUFFFDspam

i do agree that pi has got to be one of the most boring professions out therewhat with all the scanning and repetitive clicking it is already passive and only requires a few skills and minimum competency to use i dont see any reason why not to simplify it to keep it from being so completely boring that nobody does it1

another bump in support of the space truckers who help with the logistics side of warfarei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i generally like the principle but if you are going to call the ship class a tug abandon the dedicated cargo hold suggestiongive them exclusive access to three capital class tractor beams and have all four vessels fly in formationthe towed vessels should be 1 empty of pod pilots 2 have all modules offlineso that if a pirate gang was to intercept they could board the vessels but would have a helluva time delay to get them started and a logistics problem to suss out about what to do with their original ship
since initial work it has been changed to envoyclass and the external towing of ships would be a mechanics nightmare that and it is just downright ridiculousi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
pretty elegant idea tbh it encourages exactly what brings me to low sec  casual small gang pvpliang
are you afraid that the numbers would all of a sudden be against youas it is low sec is under populated and instead of making it more attractive only for pirates and gankers it should be wident up more than just kill some and then squeeze easy back to high seclow sec isnt just to cater the wannabe nullbear who either hasnt the time nor the inclination to be one of the nullbear herd of sheepmore people venturing to lowsec also means more people will get attrackted to pvp but i can understand why some oppose that so darn muchjust imagine you actually get what you want pvp with people who shoot back then the fun isnt fun anymore because they would learn and adapt and eventually overcomeand as for me being excluded from parts of the game you have no idea what parts of the game i have been in nor will you even scratch the surface of it
youre really just gonna keep hurling insults and repeating the same thing over and over without reading what people write do you understand what dialogue is you have no idea what youre talking about and you really should just cut your losses in this thread because youre becoming quite annoying the thing is you dont understand that you dont know what youre talking about so i suppose its not your fault i would advise you to try to gain a better grasp on the issue youre commenting on before the commenting takes place
as a paranoid highsec carebera who is breaking the system and pvping in lowsec while making isk in highsec i have to say this is idea is actually good and even could do a lot of good its not the big lowsec fix aka removing highsec incursions and l4 and l4 and mining and industry and exploration  some people keep demanding and that is why it could actually work and help a bit
i ask for more pvpers in lowsec you think i expect them all on my sidewell thats the fun fighting people who adapt figuring out how to counter them the trap and countertrap the narrow escapes and the times you dont escape its a game i dont mind losing ships especially if i can take something with meit is indeed under populated but populating it with bears will fix nothingthe pve proposals for lowsec generally ask for 1 safer pve 2 more rewarding pvebut theres safe in pve in highsec already you cant compete with that without completely nerfing lowsec pvp this is where all the suggestions about stronger sentries concordlike npcs etc go wrongso we increase the rewards but there is already a place with much higher rewards than highsec in exchange for a nominal risk its called 00 but 00 is secured by alliances and is pretty safe so to compete with that youd need very high rewards in lowsec whats to keep those same alliances from taking over the lowsec pve thenthose two options just turn lowsec into a highsec clone or a 00 clone while ignoring the population that is already there because they dont want to be in either highsec or 00funny expression for someone whose average kill has 50 people on it but why not why shouldnt lowsec be the one almost pure pvp area of the game we already have an almost pure pve area highsecdo you even read i meant being excluded from parts of the game via sec status but that particular char of yours has no lowsec history to speak of so excuse me if i assume you are posting on your main and have no clue about lowsecwhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
ah so suggesting to increase the time it takes to being able to dock after shooting someone decreases people shooting at eachother sorry if that wasnt clear to meand it never even occured to you that the rewards can be designed in such a fashion that the only true benefit would be for the same region of space as you can aquire it namely low secnull sec has its own advantages from the sov mechanics why not some mechanic to have something in that line though more fun to play than sov warfare in low secyou might feel like the low sec population thats already there gets ignored in my suggestions fact however is that i want to get a lower threshhold for people to venture there but at increased risk than it is currently or do you think prolonged docking denial is decreasing riskon the other hand make it worthwhile for people to take that route low sec has the same issue as null sec the risk versus reward is completely off balancesorry for taking my job as logistics pilot too serious and actually have logistics drones aswel instead of killmail hoarding by bringing light drones just to farm killmailsthe few times i actually used other ships was mainly because at that moment no logistics was availablesorry for being part of an alliance who has to work together and has to bring bigger fleets to counter bigger fleets and as a result has more than a few people on a killmailmostly i am sorry for your complete ignorance and assuming that that has anything to do with the underlying problemexcuse me but did i miss the part where you didnt get the choice to keep your sec status and if this were my main i am not entitled to an opinion in a forum section where opinions are gatheredonce again i am not against changes in the system that adresses the issues with the sec status loss and gain but by saying ow lets just pop ships but not pods anymore in low sec so we dont drop below 2is ridiculousyou create a whole new area of abuse then and without differentiation i for one do not support the idea
station games are dumb but they are 100 consensual pvp you are never forced to fight at a station if you dont want to even more so in lowsec with no bubbles just instaundock away and after the recent session timer changes dock if insta fails they are a minuscule part of lowsec pvp and not really the problem at allif you have an idea on how to do that make your own thread about iti find the risk vs reward of lowsec to be just fine the reward is high solo to small gang pvp in tight groups of people i know the risk is low i can lose my ship at a fight but i have a decent chance to avoid fights i dont want and i can save my pod 99 of the timeabout denying docking docking games do need some fix but thats not lowsecspecific and it would need another thread but anything that makes gcc more annoying than it already is is a bad idea so it should be approached carefullyof course i chose to lower my sec in fact i welcome being outlaw because it gets me fights without sentries you still dont understand my reasoninglife as an outlaw is fun life as an outlaw would be more fun if there were more outlaws people dont become outlaws because with a single account being an outlaw sucks for logistics so lets make it possible for those people to enjoy the lowsec side of being an outlaw without losing their highsec logisticsok so you dont agree can you reason why what abuse would it createwhat happens in lowsec stays in lowsec lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp
killer gandry this is the fundamental problem with what youre saying youre posting in a thread about a specific solution to a specific problem but youre adding nothing to the discussion if you want to make your own thread about your own idea of a solution to a partially related problem you are welcome to do so but here youre just muddying the waters and causing confusion you arent offering ideas for or against this proposal this thread is not about station games which you oddly seem to believe plays a much larger role in lowsec than it does nor is it about bringing carebears to lowsec please formulate a position on the specific solution thats been proposed and post that or start your own thread
fully support this proposal a fantastic addition to sec status rules which boosts lowsec and overall pvp at the same time without draining any other styles of play highsec loses nothing while gaining more access to lowsec
the funny thing is every player in the game has gone through the same thing eve is tough to start with but with some research and work you get over the first bump and the game opens up into this huge sandboxnow every player has done that we made it we did the research learnt how things work and we enjoy the gamenot sure what the op intends his post to do there are no new ideas suggestions or anything just some posts from people who quit because they were too lazy to learn things and wanted everything handed to them jint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
all you need is finding a good experienced player who is willing to be your mentorthen you need access to a voice server like ventrilo or teamspeak and start talking with him he wil invite you to his corp or give you advice to join a friendly corpthen he probably give you some isk to buy skillbooks and give advice whenever you need itso if you are a noob go and ask people join help channels find friends join a corp with some experienced players show that you are able to read and understand guides they are tons of all sorts of guides available read thatthen start playing the game spend some real money and sell a plex or two dont avoid loosing your ships at all costs take some risks and learn playing the game by doingif you then still dont like eve is not for you then stop playing and find battlefield 3 or kitty onlinealso look for wwwuosigenade and make yourself a character or play wowif you cant find a mentor send email to me i might be able to support some new players for a while but dont expect ttoo much i am busy learning the game and reading guides still after so many years playingU266B when your ship gets blown to bits U266A U266B and you lose your faction fits U266A U263B dont worry U266A U266B U266A U266B U266B U266A U266B U266A be happy U263B
ill admit it this is my third time around with evefirst lasted about 30 days reason for leaving totally lost in wherehowwhy to play eve and nobody to play it with im sure this is still the biggest challenge for new playerssecond lasted about a year with some irl friends reason for leaving incarna and total lack of resolve for players issues by ccp i could care less about walking in a space station just because the ships arent worth flying also one irl friend quit for reason 1 and i never could figure out why play evethird time is still ongoing reason i came back crucible and the refocusing of ccp back to making eve more eve they are trying so will i i have a corp mate who is an irl friend that makes it worth the play and he didnt stop playing from previous so he solos l4s and i tag along to salvage and such he tanks and i spankthe game is still way bigger that i can comprehend and i am still as lost as ever however i still have time to learn and like discovering new things that i didnt know existed before keeps the game new all the timei also like that that the gates are no longer static graphics on a 2d plane i didnt think ccp was listening when i suggested to point them at the next system for better game immersion lol at all you trolls who flamed me for that suggestion
1because if the pirates find time to kill more npc for their loot then theres less time to kill mehell have the pirate factions regularly fight the empire npcs at stations less visited by players not to challenge the sovereignty but to provide imme
i think mass swarms of npc rats should attack stations in every system number of rats depends on the number of players in system the tears on the jita undock would be epic
i cant help feeling that something of what makes the eve universe a rich and interesting place has been lost by the streamlined naming conventionthey should as least add the original label string to the item description if they are not doing so already
scourge does have a better ring to it then trauma what is this doctors online having the same name for damage type makes things simpler consistent but that name should be cool heavy missiles being the most commonly used with the popular scourge scourge should be the name of kinetic
you know i am pretty sure anyone who does thta will get a warning first instead of getting a ban and to the one talking about not knowing a law and judges that depends really if there is an obscure law you do not know about and that common sense does not dictate you might get off lightthat does not hold true for laws you are supposed to know all traffic laws more or elss after getting your license or the once covered by common sense hurting people stealing etc
the blatantly obvious pop up warning when you open a can that doesnt belong to you isnt enough sorrywe shouldnt dumb things down for idiots that cant readi congratulate you on searching and finding a post on the subject instead of posting a new one while necro posting a thread that is 2 months old is annoying at least you arent posting yet another thread on the subject
so let me get this right in my mindyou want to gank unarmed mining ships in something nicer than a disposable destroyer that way you can be lazy and not need to buy and refit so you can do it all over againno consequences to standingsfree reign on industrial shipslower costs to gankless time between killsmore killmails of unarmed industry shipsother than time and cost pretty much as thing are right now in empire kill as you see fit  nobody is preventing you from pulling the trigger initially you just better be fast on the kill or is that your real problemitd be really funny if industrial ships could buy contracts with concord for protection in low sec space we all know thats out of the question and so is the idea of making empire space 00 space
i have had the experience recently of losing several ships to player pirates who camp out and then jump on you just because your small fry i dont see the point in this but i suppose thats part of the game what has got my back up is that i cant place a bounty on these people because their sec status is higher than 10 they know this and keep thier sec status high for that reason sure i get kill rights but that is no good to me flying and iteron 3can the bounty system be overhauled for a more level playing fieldsd
need more details  but since youre api verified on battleclinic i was able to dig up a few things1 the losses in seylen parts and basgerin were all due to you flying into lowsec space dont do this alone unless you know the locals if you dont know the locals theyll shoot at you concord is not in lowsec to protect you2 the losses in the other systems all look to be your fault as well looks like you were mining and  presumably someone came along and flipped your can because they did this and went flashy red you probably started shooting them soon as you shot them which you were allowed to do they are allowed to defend themselves without concord repercussionssuppose people could be ganking you just for the simple fact youre in a belt mining though bit surprised theyre going for something cheap like an itty 3 or more likely youre at war with someone or multiple someones check the notifications tab in your evemail to see if you have anything from concord in the war categoryif you are at war its generally a bad idea to be mining your ceo andor directors should really be keeping you informed about what to do in wars though edit  clarity
yeah honestly the best advice is to join a player corp and ask them to teach you how to play eve this is an mmo after all and is way more fun with friendsyou know what why not let people with positive security status put bounties on one another this is of course assuming that the bounty system gets fixed and there are some very good threads on the forum about how to fix bounties mainly they are about preventing it from being profitable for someone to get on an alt and blow up their main to get their own bountybut yeah sometimes carebears hate other carebears why not let them fight each other in the only method they know how to with iski honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
actually given that you were in lowsec they were shooting you because you were there not because you were small if you go to lowsec go there prepared for a fight
you are right losing ships is a part of eve the fun is on the risks that is why we have the only fly what you can afford to lose rule also soy should never be alone if you dont plan to lose a ship alone im 99 of my time in a fleetand for moving assets we have some really secured jump routes and we know how to do it so we only care if there are 70 reds on localim not a new player in evebut the only problem that there are on cloaked ships is the fact that you can only fight them if they want and if they assume that they will win the fight otherwise you can bite as much as you want and they will not drop on you and you will have to take the fight somewhere elseyesterday an an afkcloaker stayed in our system we got annoyed so we razed its corporation system and killed their small capital fleet so they would not have capitals to drop on us and now their corporation will not enter our system otherwise we will steamroll the rest off their assets and send them back to hisec but the cloaker lives on and we should have killed him too but we cant at last we got more profit on looting their ships and assets then we would have done that day mining and rating if the afk cloaker doesnt belong to any corporation and it is not willing to get caught he is there only to annoy you and even if you have 143715193213 members in your corp there to get him you would not be able to do a thingnow size up the scene you would have a cloaked carebeer hided inside your bedroom singing to you all night preventing you from sleeping like a big colorful noisy fat and fluffy mosquito while the rage and the will to slaughter it will only grow in your heart in rl i would burn my room to the ground just to see him burn too but in the game you cant do nothing so you say  that  and log off and go do something else  on singularity  cloak is an overpowered defense that prevents annoying thinks to get killedccp can and probably will put a realy nerfed cloaker hunter ship and see how it affects pvp and then buff it nerf it or remove it new pos system new sov system
if you can scan down cloakers then cloaking becomes useless you might as well advocate for its removal from the game
no if you can scan down cloakers in some minutes you will make them move making harder for them  at last harder then sitingsleeping   or if you are better pilot then they are andor are lucky there would be a chance to get and kill them read this new pos system new sov system
i have several points to add in im not opposed to a decloak mechanism something like probes could work well however there are several points or addendums i must add 1 bo jump portals the majority of a danger from an afk cloaker assuming hes no longer afk and actually hunting your sorry ass down is hotdrops if hotdrops were more vulnerable ie not an instant protal for a gang to enter then a huge part of the afkcloaker danger would be allieviated this would allow the locals to actually assess the danger the local represents and fly in gangs that mitigate the risk a cloaker poses truthfully hotdrops have far more issues than mentioned here and a hotdrop balancing will solve most of the afk cloaking problems that is for competent pilots 2 the risk having the ability to hunt down cloakers has a lot of benefits for a system owner they could deny access to station destroy all enemy poss and now probe down all enemies in space effectively removing all danger from the system this is unacceptable as the only way a nullsec resident would then die is via very unfortunate timing an untimely npc scram or you land on a gate at the same time as an enemy enters system or incompetence you keep belt ratting when enemies enter system any anticloaker technology needs to be balanced with our instant iknowwhoenteredlocal intel tool essentially the only way to balance the icanremovealldangersfromsystem playstyle is to significantly alter local or create a new intel system that doesnt provide instant intel on who is in local imo for the sake of balance any new intel system must balance the predator and prey relationship an alert and competent prey nees to be provided with enough intel to be safe 95 of the time but always have a small risk of danger especially when working alone 3 cloaks cloaks are currently a very powerful tool they allow you to hide from an enemy be it to stay safe or suprise attack and they allow you to navigate gate camps that would otherwise be impassible if we create a decloaking tool it must not destroy the above benefits of a cloak or you essentially nerf entire classes of ships and modules there is a diametrically opposed idea there you want to scan down a ship that is using a cloak to stay safe this means whatever the mechanic to decloak a ship it must be balanced so that scanning down a ship is expensive moreso with time than isk and unusual the standard roaming gang should not readily expend the energy to find a cloaked ratting raven but perhaps would take the time to find a ratting carrier which will then just log off to stay safe
1 if you are afraid to lose your thanny or nightmare perhaps you should rat in a dominix or drake you can run most plexes just fine in far less blingy ships people will grow bored and annoyed of hotdropping you if they only get a drake kill but if you keep flashing nightmares and thannys theyll keep up the efforts for months 2 you can go to the system next door and pve there 3 you can fly in groups 4 drakes can fly through anomalies and destroy most cloaky threats very quickly and if they cant most can gtfo before they are caught you can also get into safe habbits to keep your ship safe while ratting 4 if youre moving billions of isk you should have an escort with jfs jbs cloaky transports tanky transports and fleet support you already have a ton of options to move your stuff safely quit sitting in the corner cowering at the shadows
i am not seeing the rational between remap and respec at the games inception players would choose a culture within a race the system had hardcoded attributes which would be beneficial to particular career path in the game too bad if you decided you wanted to move from industry to tradingbased on the sentiment of many opposing respec live with the choice  players would still be trapped without remapsi am in favour an extremely limited respec system something like 3 of total sp every two yearsthe redistrubution of learning sp and adjustment to social sp were widely welcome in the game providing some proof that the system of respec can be worked without major harm to the status quo
voting against respec  remap of sp not even 1 per anno
another no to any type of respecjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
yeah just like gold ammoccp should be careful about making big changes that the majority of the players donUFFFDt wantjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i lold the only ones not wanting any form of respec are those psychopathic hardcores and masochists who likes to punish themselves for no reason fortunately they dont represent the majority
i somewhat agree with that sentiment i dont really want a respec option i simply believe that it would be best for ccp and eve overall as it would encourage new players to stick aroundeve as it is now is a game for the hardcore and a very niche group of players thats what we are companies dont tend to make as much money catering to small groups as they could making it easier to play for the overall casual people that make up the vast majority of gamers
not a worthwhile use of resources nor of the csms time this fixes nothing and encourages careless decision making lets not waste any more time discussing this
the eagle needs completely repurposing its role as an extreme range sniper is completely eclipsed by the naga imo the eagle should be reworked as a speed ship rather than a range ship
herpderp hurrdurr
yea she is
just block me what the hell is this crapalso its not permitted to make threads like this one i dont know you and find this undue attention rather disturbing
my alliance will wardec the op
if im blocked as you say then why do you still feel the need to talk smack about me i have never done anything to you to deserve this attitude anyway i know you have me blocked and therefore wont reply but i dont see why i should have to put up with this kind of negativity its not in keeping with the spirit of the game try to keep your aggression to the blowing up of spaceships

i dont recall exactly what the real issue was i know back in the day you could get a bookmark so far away from the solar system that it would be off the map
what i thought the goal was for everyone to fly a titanwhat a disappointment
if being ignorant to new players and not educating them as to why the idea does not have merrit instead of just telling them that they are dumb may be a reason why its so hard for eve to gain new playersthey are not accepted into the player base  that even though may not have valid opinionstheir opinions are valid to them
the problem is in many cases the newbie will stand firm that theyre right and that whatever mechanic got them stomped should be changed so as to align with their incorrect assumptions about how eve works
