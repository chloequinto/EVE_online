nope pretty sure they wouldnt but a lot would precisely
because it is actually fun for them even though people keep
telling them it isntperchance from some exotic side effect the
meaningless tunnel vision a gameplay directed entirely on the
upsetting off a new player fresh into our beloved game induces
possibly thickasshiteitus or dumbasfuckementia you may have
missed the broad spectrum of gameplay options that are also
available including but not limited too low sec null sec and let
us not forget olscarry mcweary wormholeshowever it would

jolly good show old bean 1
i gotta say its nice to hear the csm really pushing hard for alliance
bookmarks
ive never heard of referred to as the safety bar before thanks for
the clarificationi understand where youre coming from im just
stating that ccp seems to have hit a roadblock with their plans to
change bumping and i dont know if its going to happen in the
foreseeable future i would love to see more cooperation between
smaller highsec groups but the gaps of skill and knowledge
between wardeccers and newer players is pretty large its part of
the reason i wanted to advocate for service advertisements so
groups could look for that help they need in potentially fighting a
wardeccerim hopeful that some of the future structures coming
out may further the idea of building up a corporation or alliances
space and hopefully create more incentive for defenders to fight
well see appreciate your questions and support i know you poke
your head into cp sometimes i normally lurk there and im
happy to discuss these things with people from the other side if
you ever have any other questions feel free to drop them here or
send me a mailtoxic
hey suitonia long time fan of your work but why of all the
alliances would you join goons in npc space instead of pl or nc
you do know that bigger isnt always better
yup thats my concern youre just another pvp centric csm
candidate who might not be able to add some value concerning
feedback about the pve fittingship meta im worried that most
balance on ship in the game is focus on how ship could be usefull
in pvp industrial excepted without considering how those change
goes on the pve side of the shiployal servent to mother

i was wondering if you could answer some questions1 at least
one member of the current csm has stated that citadels make
moving capital ships too riskfree as someone who not only runs
her own jump freighter service but is involved in alliancelevel
logistics do you think any changes need to be made to citadels
where longdistance hauling is concerned2 a lot of people
including yourself think that planetary interaction needs to be
revamped if elected and ccp seagull were to ask you what priority
to give a planetary interaction upgrade what would you tell her
should it be a high medium or low priority3 ccp has made
many changes from new structures to the recent rorqual
upgrade designed to make null sec more selfsufficient
industrially do you think ccp has done enough or are there
additional changes you would like to see4 in your thread sullen
decimus was insulted because you didnUFFFDt know about
the work that csm did concerning industry honestly i had not
heard anything about any work the csm did on industry or much
of anything else either what do you think the csm should do to
publicize their activities better5 as someone who concentrates
mainly in null sec do you think you have enough experience to
be able to discuss issues outside of null sec with the developers
thank you
you may not be here that long but you have my respect and you
do know your stuffnice to see you here
recruited a few corps did virtually all market stocking for at least a
year did a large amount of the jfing placed strategic jc ship caches
around had about 15 cyno alts all over eve in an alt corp with
offices everywhere prephoebe to get us anywhere  generally
just did any cyno chain with some help from a corp mate we
needed for an op was acting ceo for the last few months before it
disbanded handled all the logistics of owning sov in fountain fcd
several supercap ops generally just backup fcd basically just the
main useful people type dude for the time i was there if youre
not familiar with how larger pvp focused groups work the best
comparison i could give is doug stampers character in house of
cards logistics  support roles in fleets  backup fc in that order
roughlythey both need attention but id say null sec needs it
more urgently null sec has had a complete overhaul in the last
year and a bit those changes now need review and iteration as
there are some major glaring issues citadel changed a lot in w
space but it seems to have settled what wspace needs is mostly
qol improvements and minorish tweaks to get more people into
themccp has various teams that work on different areas of the
game so in reality its not an eitheror situation for example
theres a team that focuses in widescale game mechanics like
sovereignty and faction warfare whos name i cant seem to
remember and theres the recently formed team phenomenon
who work on pve null sec needs changes to the sov system and
a lot of the main gripes in wspace are about pve they can deal
with both at the same timeits a pretty unfortunate situation with
no particularly great option right now we have an enormous
amount of code and tools written on top of the xml api that we can
be pretty confident arent going to get rewritten for esi as the
people who wrote them dont play eve anymore for example
evething a sort of webbased evemon thats more focused
towards handling a lot of characters and assets rather than just
skill queues thats a shame and as a community well all be
worse off for iti can also understand the decision to deprecate
crest since theres apparently a lot of messy backend to itwhat i
do think ccp fails to realise is the effect this is going to have on
developer confidence long term the major tools like zkillboard
evemon pyfaeft will all get updated no problem but for smaller
projects like the various alliance auth systems my own tools etc
it severely dents our confidence in ccp to build a coherent long
term and backward compatible api system the direct comparison
id draw would be that to microsoft switching their direction for gui
applications every few years and leaving all code written for the
old one totally in the dirtthe one criticism id have of the esi api is
it cuts up information way to broadly this is inconvenient for
developers and also creates a straw for this own back for
example the location api you call to get a players current system
has 2 seperate calls one for the location and one for the ship
why theres tons of examples like thisas long as ccp stick with
esi its a good system the only major issue is a lack of
confidence they wont just speaking personally thats an area id
have to defer to others ive been been a big fan of primarily pve
games online multiplayer is what has always attracted me to
every game ive played so i feel like this is probably the one area
i dont have much to contribute im sort of okay with the current
situation where its basically riskreward poker but i can see why
others wouldnt be and id be all for any improvements that still
allowed me to spend the majority of time engaging with other
players rather than red crosses
well if you remember the open letter i wrote there were 3 main
concerns i had1 they wont generate large scale content as
capitals wouldnt be required to hit them2  this would also leave
capitals without any real role in the game3 moon mining is huge
top down source of income that funds the activities for a large
number of alliancesthe first concern has been alleviated to be
quite frank because i overestimated the average player id spent
a lot of time pitting individual or very small groups of capitals
against optimally fit astrahuses and fortizars primarily because a
well fit astrahus and especially fort have no problem killing a
cheaply fit dread or carrier also the fact the standup void bombs
are pretty blatently overpowered the vast vast majority of
citadels in the game seem to badly or entirely unfit and cant do
this against more experienced groups it seems like you can just
drop more capitals than are really required and write off any
losses as just the cost of doing business the fight is usually
decided before the fight even startsto the second concern id
simply refer you to this blog post i wrote a few weeks ago the tldr
would be that capitals now have a fleet role that allows them to be
directly effective against subcaps meaning they are now just
another step in the cruiser  bc  bs  carrier  etc progressionto
the third concern weve still not seem drilling platforms yet so
theres not much to comment on i would note however that the
prices of r64 materials has absolutely plummeted over the last
year reducing their value immensely id say thats definitely a
bad thing but the effect of it is that weve largely lost r64s as a
content generator anyway regardless of what ccp do with drilling
platforms
they both need attention but id say null sec needs it more
urgently null sec has had a complete overhaul in the last year
and a bit those changes now need review and iteration as there
are some major glaring issues like what specifically
definitly a big 1 from my sidethere are not many players in this
game which have such a knowledge about the game and also the
outcome of changes to a 00 etininty in eve online

so many rumours 
can you specifically cite what are rumors on here again you are
generalizing overall comments as rumors you also have not
answered or provided any ideas of your own to support your
campaign idealsthis campaign is nothing more but a further
troll by you
being banned from twitter is an example of one of the rumors
posted herei simply do not have time to cite them all
just because you can make a simplistic assertion like the above
doesnt make it true there is no evidence that a large number of
people want to play a noonecanlose version of eve with all the
conflict drained from it in fact when ccp started to move in that
direction and buff highsec safety and rewards is when growth in
the game stalled and the pcu started to decline even though this
argument that giving people safety will make ccp rich is raised all
the time no one has been able to explain why ccp should double
down on this strategy when all the numbers say it doesnt work
the much more likely explanation is all this safety just bores
people out of the game if you made highsec completely safe you
would completely remove much of the demand for players to
gather and build things in a game where your output is almost
completely consumed by other players those players need
motivation to give you their isk if everything is so easily available
and immune to disruption they just arent going to need it and the
game stagnates i have no doubt there is a tiny fraction of players
that just play to accumulate stuff never interacting with other
players who take satisfaction in just watching their wallet and loot
hoard get bigger however most industrialminded players play to
service the demands of other players and play and compete in the
giant single economy of the game if you nerf the demand out of
the economy by making pvp consensual and removing the
competition out of the game by giving players a safe space they
can all use to generate resources with no risk you remove the
meaning for much of what players do in this game even hardcore
pvpers only spend a fraction of their game time directly
participating in space combat but the demand created by that
fuels so much of reason for players log in and to do stuff eve
online has lasted almost 15 years by ignoring the constant short
sighted calls to let players optout of the conflict and competition
that is the lifeblood of the game what astonishes me the most
about threads like this is that there are players that continually try
to get ccp to do so ccp knows what type of game they designed
and the perils of too much safety and while they have tried the
strategy of making highsec safer it has clearly failed to spike the
pcu putting the final nail in the coffin of any movement to turn
eve from a pvp sandbox into a standard theme park mmo
perhaps it is time for the pendulum to swing back the other way
and for ccp to inject a little more risk into the game
csmssince youre meeting with ccp right now any chance you
might get them to look into thisraitaru lab service are not
functioningi realize this isnt affecting everyone but if youve got it
its aids
moved to player feature and ideas
this account linking suggestion is something that will improve this
game immensely and break the hold of the big entities it is
something that i have wanted for a long time as i have seen too
many examples of spy alts destroying interesting new groups with
dynamic leaders by easy to do theft and intel that enables major
groups to take or destroy their major assetsin effect there are two
ways to push account linking the first would be to enable any
character combination on the linked accounts the second would
be a discounted rate as compared to separate unlinked accounts
be it reduced price for paid subscription or more game time with
plexas an overall point of view the small more independent
minded players have been penalised continuously in this game
and it would be good to see their views get listened too instead of
the big blocksthe issue here is quite clear if big wig in plgoon
uses an alt to scam someone how can his actions ever have
consequences if you have no idea who did it as he used a throw
away account i have the capability to go off after someones main
if i really want to but hiding behind unlinked accounts makes for
stale gameplay this also applies to afk cloaky camping as i know
who is doing it i can go after them too it is a truly annoying part of
the game that there are no consequences blocked teckos pech

could you expand a bit on these statements which areas do you
feel have become to safe which mechanics need to be harsher
which play styles could do with a bit more danger
sorry but this post says enough about your campaign youre
either gonna stand for all of us or you dont run at all
how exactly are you quantifying a lotexactly how do you know
more people will subscribe and playeve is not terribly fun when
played like one would play wow you dont even need to team up
to run missions most people can run missions by themselves so
the teamwork one finds in wow or other such games is not
needed in evewhat makes eve interesting is the competition
between players what you suggests is removing thatbased on
nothing
its not 100 true thoughwhen i was new and young 24 months
into the game back in 2010 i used to run lvl4 missions with loose
group of players it was just bunch of randoms from jel local who
could make a fleet and run missions joiningleaving at any
moment at that point i had no proper skills and ship i was flying
myrmidon with bunch of metat2 stuff later i switched to dominix
with t1 medium railguns and teaming up was my natural choicei
believe nothing had really changed since then new players still
have to collect skills and missions are still difficult enough to make
teaming work i guess your most people stands for older skilled
and rich players but even players younger than 1 year would
benefit from teaming up for missions
i would love for ccp to make one constelation 100 safe limited
resources a couple of level 4 agents and nothing much else to do
it would not impact the game all that much the people who want
that kind of space get it and we can all put this argument to bed
forever the boring people can just hang out in those couple of
systems and circlejerk all day long while the rest of use can go
and shoot ships in peace
perhaps you should reread what i wrote i did not say it is not
going to ever happen simply that it is not needed if a player
wants to simply play eve by running missions he does not need to
do it with a team he can go start grinding standings and take the
time to get the isk and sp to run higher level missions whereas in
things like wow it seems that teamwork is a necessityfurther
given the nature of eve teamwork is a strategy with low utilization
that is people in eve are quite distrustful because if you have a
valuable fit there is indeed your loose group of players might
turn around and gank you and take your stuff cant really do that
in wow imagine what would happen in wow if you could turn on
other players and after killing them take their stuff
go play in rookie systems or the test server thenand the irony
that you want to shoot ships but are pissed that other players
want to shoot your ships perhaps you dont quite get the
underlying nature of the game here let me put it simplyso long
as i am willing to accept the consequences i can shoot you
anywhere i want in gamethose consequence maybe from npcs
eg if i use ewar on you in a mission the rats will start attacking
me or it could be concord the consequences may be from other
players if i awox you the other corp members will likely do their
best to blow up my ship and pod ill also likely be kicked from the
corporation and made kos that is the nature of eve you are never
really truly safe
i remember back in 2011 we have had library in our 00based
corporation this was a collection of skillbooks under 10mil price
freely available for any corporation memberi have never heard
about similar things since then

press release 02032017dont miss open coms tonight

i was wondering if you could answer a few questions1 i read on
the forums that you believe force auxiliaries are too powerful do
you believe this is the case only in wormholes or in kspace as
well what changes would you propose to fix the ship class2
usually when players talk about adding a new type of bookmark
they refer to alliance bookmarks you mentioned adding fleet
bookmarks instead why do you believe that adding fleet
bookmarks is more important than adding alliance bookmarks3
the vast majority of your forum posts at least over the past 23
months concern trying to recruit members to your corporation do
you think ccp offers enough tools for corp recruiters if no what
changes would you like ccp to make to make recruiters lives
easier4 you indicated you have been a director or better in
wormhole groups for the last 5 years what types of tasks did you
perform or were responsible for as a director5 you have a lot of
ideas for holding events to get feedback from players one of
csmUFFFDs problems is publicizing what they do how would
you improve the visibility of the csm so players know about the
events you wish to holdthank you
sofar i like most of your idees johnas multiple people all ready
stated changing the cyno inhibitors is not a good idea if you ask
me so i hope you will dropp that ideai like your way off talking
and by the sound of it you know your direction as whit all politics
you cant aggree on everything so i will give my vote to the person
that comes the closset to my opinions and is pro wh and sofar
thats you so keep up the good work and thank for willing to give
wormhollers a voice
suitonia is a legendary eve player and as such would make a
great csm as he has fingers in many pies contacts friends and
knows the community inside out my favorite thing about him and
the reason i believe he would be great is that he is someone who
has achieved much status without being overtly political or having
a trace of ego a really hard thing to do in this game he has
friends with all factions within eve he does take sides but has
never indicated to me that he holds any grudges and not many
people can say thati have also worked with him a lot on multiple
evesports projects and he has always been reliable and given
consistently topnotch analysis of pvp mechanics  he is the best
technical analyst i have worked with and has an incredible
capacity to remember all of the abilities of subcapital ships and
modules in the game and how they interact with each other this
is another fantastic reason he would make a great csm1 from
me and all my alts
go yumene you can do it i believe in you 3
with the summit over the minutes are in progress and will
hopefully be with you within a fortnight or so the election season
is now in full swingthats why im here to ask you to consider
voting for me with three terms under my belt i have a good
handle on the duties and responsibilities involved as such im
not going to tell you im going to make ccp make this change
because thats not what the csm does anyone who does promise
you a change is either lying to you or completely misunderstands
the csmwhat i am going to do is tell you the areas in the game im
suited to giving advice to ccp the interest groups that i
understand and will represent third party development industry
highsec in general mining and other resource gathering such as
pi gas reactions and so on im seriously plugged into the third
party community providing resources and tools to other
developers and the wider eve community

thanks for your hard work in previous csms after three terms i

i did consider it however im not close to burn out and i feel i still
have good feedback to pass to ccpthe institutional knowledge
that builds up is valuable not just from myself but other
members running again letting newcomers skip some of the start
up phase
here is an article i wrote about some of the items mentioned in my
platform
sers internet spaceship pilotsmy name is leyanora varkain
currently director in the alliance its only pixels and ceo of the corp
special assault unit i have been playing eve for almost 4 years
while living in null for most of the timea short overview about the
alliances  coalitions i have been with so far2013 insidious
empire2014 living in lowsec after beeing a short time with
vega2015 gentlemens club2016 its only pixels while beeing
with vanguard coalitionso bottom line is i enjoy fleet pvp the most
but i am not that much into large blobby fights with a ton of tidi i
like gangs where every member has a chance to actually play the
game instead of just beeing a pure anchor up and press f1
pilotabout half of the time i am out in space i like sitting in a logi
ship of all sizes i enjoy flying frigate cruiser and capitalsize logi
my priorities for csm xii are change the current state of sov
warfare in nullsec make sov great again work the gap between
cruiser and capital logistics build a wall around delve and have
mittens pay for itso why am i exactly running for csm there was
this incident at eve amsterdam 2016 where i tried to talk to a
certain ccp dev hint one that is often refered to the current state
of sov mechanics and all i got was blabla political blabla that
got me pretty upset i totally understand that some random guy
wont get a solid plan of what will change and what ccp is currently
looking into but it left me very unsatisfied and i chose to take a
chance of actually change it and work on it to actually work on the
major downsides of the current sov mechanics
 reserved 
i support this ballbag
i like
hell yeahwhat a great guy
build that wall
i vouch for him and think he would be a good choice 
ley woop woop
ley is one of the most experienced and competent combat logi
pilots ive ever met he deserves to have his pvp ideas heard and i
know that he will provide important insights into the sov system
based on the last two years of our constant wars that ccp needs
to hear
endorsedariels been a pillar of the autz and having worked and
played with him i know hes got the chops to deliver good things
and will be a great representative on the csmeve down under  a
community for players in the autz
i will miss the open comms on the mittanicom twitch tonight sorry
for all the people who are following me i will be there next
timethanks for the great feedbacks
today ccp has published updates about the csmreducing the
number of representatives from 14 to 10 is one aspect that will
make it even more difficult for independent candidates to make it
through the stvbased vote processbut the main change is a
change of philosophy the white paper statedccpUFFFDs
vision the council is included in the development process to
ensure that feedback and opinions from eve online players are
brought to the attention of the development team and that
viewpoints from members of the eve community across all
demographics of play style are represented and heardi entered
the csm arena two years ago because i felt my playstyle was not
represented features were nerfed to favor other playstyles and
the interests of the power players were always trumping those
with alternative playstyles the game is supposed to be a
sandbox after all so campaigning to lobby for the playstyle i
favor the most seemed logicial when reading ccps vision about
the csm at the time i proudly stepped up to defend mine hoping
that i was not be the only player that was engaging with the game
this waytoday the csm vision statement has been reduced tothe
csm brings focused structured feedback from the community to
ccp and represents its views and interests up until now i was
advocating that csm should represent the largest possible breadth
of differenciated playstyles this update clearly state that this is
not anymore what ccp needs the csm members are there to
focus and structure the feedback from the community at large the
greater good for the greater player baseas such i have decided
as a player to retire from this campaign in the same way that i
know none of the previous csm has really represented me i do
not know how to represent the community in general rather than
the playstyle i am familiar with the most i am not a bullshit
politician and i am not after free omega account and free trip to
icelandof course i want to thanks all those that supported my
fightthis toon has been specifically created to be a public figure
as such i am going to put this toon for sale in the character
bazaar between now and feb 15th in case anyone more suited
than me to brings focused structured feedback from the
community to ccp and represents its views and interests would
be interested to pick up this campaign and register to run with
him  as a note the same url also stated at some pointthe
purpose of the csm is to represent society interests to ccp this
requires active engagement with the player community to master
eve issue awareness understanding and evaluation in the
context of the greatest good for the greater player base
you will stand in line and do as youre told lowclass pleb
helloim just another wh dweller ive been playing for a bit more
than 3 years and ive got a chance to experience most of the eve
starting from highsec mining to wh capital escalationsrip chose
me as your csm and we will finally have a wh voice in csm who
doesnt have his main in plfly safe oedit yeah im from inner
hell the biggest russian wh corp there is thats been killing goons
in their rorquals

solid candidacy would vote
closed
hello alli am writing today to announce my decision to run again
for csm having arrived home from the last summit happy that ive
done as i set out to do there i feel as though i have both achieved
and learnt a lot within csm xi and hope that you will consider me
for reelection so that i can continue to work with ccp as a
representative of the community what are my goalsmy goals are
UFFFD probably to no surprise to those who know me
UFFFD nothing to do with specific changes i donUFFFDt
see that as a major part of the duties of the csm and
iUFFFDve attempted to correct that belief where i can it is in
my view the job of the csm to first and foremost investigate what
the fundamental problems are then to present this to ccpbut
what i wish to do within my second term is much the same as i
have already done promote iteration on stagnant features
provide consistent neutral communication  transparency from
the csm ensure that as many points of view are brought to the
table in discussions argue for an increase in balancing velocity
continue to drive the csmccp relationship in a positive
directionand if you vote for me these are the things i will continue
to work onwhat have i donethe strongest of arguments come
with evidence so i would like to simply share what i have done in
csm 11 towards these goalsi have taken attendance with the aid
of the judge on almost every csm meeting that occurred during
csm 11UFFFDs term to ensure that people are able to see
what their representatives are doing and hold them accountable
it should be noted that this is not the beall endall of metrics but
it is a step towards transparency in the csmalongside this i have
consistently produced a fortnightly csm update which has
evolved as time has gone on from a very basic stating of
discussion topics to a more fleshed out attempt to archive what
we are doing as best as possible within the nda providing a
catalyst for community discussion with us on various topics of
interesti also direct UFFFD along with other members of the
csm UFFFD the quarterly review wherein every member of
the csm is given a platform to answer various questions and
ensure that they are kept in touch with the communityi have over
the course of my term also put together a series of roundtables
addressing topics that i felt the csm simply lacked UFFFD at
the current time UFFFD the knowledge to fairly portray to ccp
this includes two roundtables on hisec ganking from both the
aggressor and defenders side the recordings of which were kept
confidential upon the wishes of both parties wardecs coled by
toxic yaken and the new player experience in addition to this i
also ran a pve townhall and participated in noobmanUFFFDs
excellent wormhole townhall i also suggested ran and provided a
final consensus from a nullsec content creators focus group i
have also been able to write and podcast extensively taking a
less neutral tack when discussing my own opinions on upcoming
changes or problem areas within the game a good example of
this would be my UFFFDsafeties off gloves offUFFFD
article which i believe had an impact on the overall
implementation of alpha clones seeing as it highlighted the issues
with the UFFFDx omega  1 alphaUFFFD argument that
the community was making at the time in the context of hisec
gankingi was heavily supportive of hydeUFFFDs stance on
balance frequency and UFFFD as shown in the 1st csm
summit notes UFFFD was heavily involved in the discussion
around not balance particulars but ccpUFFFDs incredibly
slow rate in dealing with problem ships within the meta which
leads to what i term a calcification of the meta where something
is so strong for so long that every counter is explored known
and solved after this point the meta grows stale and quite
frankly boringi consider the rewrite to the whitepaper involving
csm 11 as opposed to csm 10 who were mostly excluded from
the proceedings a key indicator of the trust and cooperation that
we were able to bring to ccpcsm relations this year and all of
csm 11 were crucial in achieving that so i cannot take much
credit here but iUFFFDd like to note it at leastunfortunately i
am not at liberty to say what things iUFFFDve worked to
highlight to ccp in terms of stagnant features due to my own
squeamishness at the edges of the nda and the sad reality that
simply nothing may come of my efforts as it may not be
something ccp are able to fit into their schedule or justify
addressing from a business perspective however i would hope
that my fellow csm 11 members will be able to vouch for me
addressing a wide range of topics with the intent of starting
meaningful conversations with ccp on them
what do i knowin addition to this track record of communication
and work within the csm i also bring my own areas of subject
expertise to the table i have a solid understanding of both fleet
command and the larger picture of warfare in new eden as can
be seen in various formats in my noncsm related writings on
crossing zebras and in the video content i produce on my
personal channel iUFFFDm also familiar with solo pvp
specifically in faction warfare space as can be seen in my solo

awesome im glad to hear that people actually like what im
saying i really want to be a voice for not just the wormhole
community but the entire eve community at large i have a lot of
interesting and thought provoking ideas id love to put forward and
even if they dont get implemented i just want to foster discussion
on things
im more than willing to listen to feedback from pve players my
passion is not pve and i dont presume to speak for them if a
change to a ship would cause serious concerns for pve then i
would argue for them goonswarm is a well organised alliance
and im having fun flying with them im a pretty prolific corp
hopper though and ive been in pl test cva before too i dont want
to be in the best elite pvp alliance for the sake of being in the
best alliance im more of a solo guy with my own friends in a
bunch of different alliances and i dont pick sides or hold
grudgesthanks for all the kind words so far friends contributer to
eve is easy
hi i am xenuria i have arms i also have an extensive education
in psychology and behavioral analysis while on csm 11 i used my
diverse subject matter expertise to help ccp on their npe branding
and even some aspects of community development i am running
for reelection and would appreciate your vote last season i had
some really nice endorsements from people like minerbumping
reve and several other communities i was even placed on the
imperium ballot this season there are only 10 csm spots up for
grabs and this is going to change the math of how many votes an
outsider like me needs to be elected i wont lie to you there is a
very real chance i do not get reelected many people voted for
me because they were told that i was some horrible monstrous
person that would end up being a cumbersome pest to ccp i
didnt end up communicating in csm sessions through interpretive
dance like reddits suggested i would and i didnt run around ccp
offices naked like certain other websites proclaimed with
certainty they voted for me to troll ccp and instead i put serious
effort into a position that i care deeply about my autism helps me
see things differently examine them without bias and motivates
me to push myself for somebody who has trouble with social
interaction i think i did a pretty good job this termif you vote for
me again and i am elected i will continue my efforts to reform the
csm and advocate for a increasingly better new player
experience if you dont trust me or dont think you should vote for
me or vote at all ask somebody you trust what they think there
is a surface to all this a thin nebulous thing that obscures deeper
insights i am actually a orb official reelect xenuria video

what needs reformed that you couldnt do this year
reform is a constant process like growth
a vote for steve is a nobrainer hes the only guy on the ticket that
does what he does and a csm without steve ronuken will be
lacking a huge amount of experience and expertisehard work no
drama and a focus on areas that nobody else can bring vote
steveeve down under  a community for players in the autz
tbh you are a no brainier for us high sec nerds who love industry
and spread sheets1
sterling work again this year steve look forward to reading the
minutesas the only representative that is a not in a large
alliance that rigs the voting blocks in their favor with the sole
intention of benefiting said alliance and b the only chap who
solidly represents solo play styles and industry you can count on
my vote again this yeari wish you all the best with csm xiio7
steve is a great man he has been an amazing help to the current
csm as a knowledgeable and trustworthy incumbent i hope to see
you on next term
one cool dude def gets my vote

1 alpha clones rebuilding of the csm csm  player
communication and some stuff that is still under nda a lot of the
livestream stuff was something i brought up 2 yes because over
time you learn how to communicate more effectivly with ccp you
know who to chat with etc3 at the begininning it was deffaintly
trust with ccp csm 10 was not great due to the drama so we had
to rebuild trust and i think we did that perfectly another big issue
is sadly still under nda4 focus groups work great when handled
by the csm to help gather information about specific topics5 no
was due to exams and some rl stuff i still rewatched all the
meetings and gave feedback on the topics that were discussed
also i agree that gambling should be banned its just that at that
time a lot of good things also came from gambling event support
fansite support ingame even supports and at the time i just saw
that all go away thats why i was displeased
answerd your questionalso application is in boys
i was wondering if you would answer a couple of questions1 in
januaryUFFFDs fighting in catch your alliance tactical
supremacy has had experience in both defending and attacking
space in the aegis sov system what was your impression of the
current state of sovereignty warfare in null sec2 for years now
people have complained about ccpUFFFDs ingame
corporate management user interface your post stated that
UFFFDmore work should be done to allow these in game
tools to supplement more complex custom applications
UFFFD so what types of improvements would you like to see
ccp make to the corporate management ui3 when ccp
announced the introduction of recurring opportunities back in
april you didnUFFFDt like the feature were you opposed to
bringing the concept of dailies to eve or was the problem with the
content itself kill one rat for 10000 skill points is there an
implementation of recurring opportunities that you would
approve if so could you give a rough outline of what is
acceptable4 you think that the official eve online forums are
horrible how would you like ccp to make the situation better is it
just a matter of better moderation or does ccp need to update the
forum moderation policy5 are there issues that mainly impact
the autz that you would like to see ccp address betterthank you
i was wondering if you could answer a few questions1 you are
running on an alt character this year why2 besides an interest
in buying things from ccp in and outside the game what are your
favorite things to do in eve3 you ran for election onto csm 9
back in 2014 as your main aram kachaturian what have you
learned over the past three years that makes you a better
candidate this year4 you propose that players should be able to
buy isk directly from ccp in other games gaia online as an
example that has led to hyperinflation hyperinflation in eve
would lead to activities like ratting and missioning becoming
totally worthless why do you believe players being able to
purchase isk directly from ccp would be good for eve online5 in
ccpUFFFDs development process creating art assets is often
cited as the main bottleneck in releasing content you seem to
want ccp to divert even more artists from creating art assets for
space content to developing items for the cash shop why do you
think the cash shop is so importantthank you

everywhere and all of them its kind of an abstract answer but
there is no mystery in space anymore everything has become
too methodical there is a set way to do things now minmaxed
fits optimized routes intelrich killboards the main enemy to a
dangerous new eden is the api the api doesnt allow for
creativeness only for mockery if you do not do things the right
way kill information should no longer be published and neither
should the jumpskills in last hour on the ingame mapi am also
willing to entertain the idea of a delayed local in nullsec
you come and make me atleast if you can find the undock button
that is 
ohh no how will i ever kill your stratios like can you even fly
anything else
hello capsuleermy name is donald alpha trump and i am running
for csm12 with the announcement that alphas are now eligible to
run for csm the time is upon us to make new eden great once
again here are a few promises i make to you all if elected into

i was wondering what do you say to skeptics of your candidacy
who do not believe you can win because of ccps age
requirement ccp requires your character to be created prior to
26 december 2016 and you were created yesterday 3 february
2017
thank you rosewalker for your important question my stance on
this topic is that this is age discrimination and i wont stand for it
so dont worry my lawyers are already hard at work on the case
if that doesnt work ill grab em by the loading dock and show
them whos boss til they drop that nonsensetogether we can
make new eden great again
how many black friends do you have
hi mr trumpwhats your stance on abortionthanks
you got my vote
quite a few of them most of them are serpentis skinned nyx
pilotsif you want to abort a titan or super that should be your
choice the government should not have any say in this matter
you should have to right to choose for yourself
my vote is casted for jintaan
you did good works in the last csm jin you can count on my vote
again this yearconfidentiality still standing im curious if the
conversation went something like thisaggressors we should
be able to because we want to buying people is fun and makes
us happy ccp need to give bullies more reward for their
effortsdefenders help we dont understand why anyone would
want to be a bullywas their any resolution from the round tables
open to questions and conserns stay classy
hellomy name is lorelei and i am announcing my candidacy for
csm xii i am running whilst focussed on high sec i am a self
confessed high sec carebear and am proud of it i have analysed
the commitments plannedcoming up in my life for the next year
and have decided that i can afford the time to run for csm xiii
really havent changed neither has what i am thinking and
therefore neither has my opening campaign post really and i am
looking forward to discussing with you allthis is my campaign
thread from last year
what is wrong with independence this is a problem is being in a
group the only way eve should be played should they be forced
to be social why would a carebear want to be part of a we in a
game full of overly aggressive unpleasant types that you cant
trustwhy what is the point ccp arent even interested in high
sec players they seem to only want people to join a gang and be
f1 monkeys someone playing for fun and to look at pretty space
themed eye candy is not high on their listtold you last year that
moto is dangerously close to the moto of a known ingame ganker
corp not a phrase synonymous with trusti did however vote for
you last year and will do so again this year
thank you for stopping by my threadnothing is wrong with
independence but plenty is wrong with apathy especially if my
fellow carebears sit around whining in local about this or that
and then do not try using the avenues open to them to get their
voices heardim sure that if there was a big enough carebear
lobby some of the issues affecting high sec play would have
been tackled earlier and before people start jumping around i
am not advocating turning high sec into more of a theme
parkthank you
chitsa had a lot of interesting ideas also so did corbexx and
james arget see how this all turned out for wh space
as i tell my corpmates though i wont leave wormhole space
when eve shuts down and the hardware is sold off ill contact
ccp buy a node that was used for running jspace and keep it in
my man cave until i die wormholer for lifei should be posting a
detailed paper and updating my intro post in the next day or two

rosewalker thank you for your questions i hope i can answer
them all below sorry for the slow response i got a bit busy with rl
stuff past couple days1 at least one member of the current csm
has stated that citadels make moving capital ships too riskfree
as someone who not only runs her own jump freighter service but
is involved in alliancelevel logistics do you think any changes
need to be made to citadels where longdistance hauling is
concernedi do agree that citadels have made it more risk free to
move capitals especially with being able to tether to it regardless
if its a ship class that can dock in it or not ie cyno a capital on a
medium citadel it cant dock in but with 1 click you are tethered
safely anyways  which i have done this myself a thought that i
had was similar to stations and cynos when you cyno onto a
station you have a timer that you have to wait before you can
dock up if you dont think that timer matters see video  
perhaps adding that same timer to citadels and tethering
probably not a popular idea there and even myself  not going to
lie i love tethering 3 but its just a thought that i did have on this
instancethat aside and on the next part of the question i dont
really think much needs to be changed in reguards to long
distance hauling and i think the jump and fatigue timers do well in
preventing be able to go from point a to point b in no time2 a lot
of people including yourself think that planetary interaction
needs to be revamped if elected and ccp seagull were to ask you
what priority to give a planetary interaction upgrade what would
you tell her should it be a high medium or low priorityi would
say that it should be on high priority personally its one of those
things that literally has had no love the closest thing that i can
think of as of writing this is the pocos it does desperately need a
revamp3 ccp has made many changes from new structures to
the recent rorqual upgrade designed to make null sec more self
sufficient industrially do you think ccp has done enough or are
there additional changes you would like to seeits definitely
gotten better for sure its hard to say what else i would like to see
when we havent really seen too much of the drilling platforms for
one or the other new structures that were talked about yet on the
topic of drilling platforms id also like to see how it would do things
like reactions where currently we have to use various types of
silos depending on what we want 4 in your thread sullen
decimus was insulted because you didnUFFFDt know about
the work that csm did concerning industry honestly i had not
heard anything about any work the csm did on industry or much
of anything else either what do you think the csm should do to
publicize their activities betterccp has said in a few instances
that csm has played an important role in the discussions related
to industry and the structures we also have the role call that are
posted of meetings  but i do agree that i would like to see more
activity publicized ie whowhatextent but its hard to say
because there are also nda limitations on what can even be
discussed outside5 as someone who concentrates mainly in null
sec do you think you have enough experience to be able to
discuss issues outside of null sec with the developersi do
concentrate mainly in nulsec but i do feel like do have enough
experience yes to be able to also discuss issues outside of nul
sec as well while it has been a while i have lived and done
industry in lowsec as well as highsecthank you once again

thank you so much
thank you 3
update my csm application has been officially sent in 
ill vote for you to continue to represent our snooomepracy in the
csm
hello there im fawlty7 ceo of tactically challenged the corp and
tactical supremacy the alliance you may also know me as the
eternal birthday boya bit about mei began playing eve in 2009 at
the age of 14 i am now 22 and havent taken a single break yet i
have played this game through the period of life where peoples
personalities are developed and they are shaped into who they
grow up to be i feel like this gives me an interesting perspective
of how much a game like eve can shape someones life
especially younger players i also hail from australia that desolate
timezone that is autz where for the past 8 years where i have had
to create content out of a very quiet and much more barren evein
the time i have been playing i have lived in highsec lowsec and
nullsec ive done mining ratting exploration pvp fleet
commanding fleet coordination logistics work pos work sov
mechanics capital warfare and many other aspects of the game
my skills and expertise reside in fleet command and organisation
as well as general pvp and sov mechanics and the things that go
with them such as citadels towers entosising etc i have also
organised and attended many real life player meet ups and
events including venturing to iceland in 2014my positionin the
time i have been a fleet commander the meta for the game has
changed more times than i can count and the nerf bat has been
used so brazenly that leaves players with their last 3 months of
training no longer viable skill extractors help to alleviate this but it
is not a great solution to this issue when one meta rises above
the rest the creation of potential counter plays is a more ideal
outcome rather than the nerf bat approachsince starting and
running a corporation and alliance it is clear that the alliance
system especially needs an overhaul as a leader i feel like there
is very limited options available that come with that power there
are no real options or hard coded game mechanics that the
alliance executor can push onto member corporations it is all
done outside the base mechanics an expansion on options such
as voting to force tax rates alliance wide or direct taxing from the
alliance to corporations these are several potential changes that
could shake up alliance mechanicswhile the current state of
sovereignty mechanics does make it easier for small alliances to
potentially get a foot in the door the current mechanics still make
it easy for a much larger entity to push a smaller one out i believe
there needs to be more defensive bonuses for alliances holding
sovereignty it makes sense that people should have to fight tooth
and nail to push long standing residents out of an area citadels
are also an emerging mechanic that has presented potential
issues especially for smaller alliances and their ability to counter
them being placed by hostiles within owned space and their
subsequent removal obviously i understand this is a new set of
features but i believe it is important to develop them correctly as
soon as possiblethose are the primary topics i feel strongly about
and believe i have the experience to contribute positively to the
csm with i am more than happy to answer questions about
anything people are curious about my views on lastly the csm is
a communication line not a place for my personal wishes to be
granted so while i feel strongly about these topics its not about
forcing this at them more about representing how these changes
can benefit the game overall and enhance players experiencesi
can be contacted ingame on fawlty7 or on the following
mediumstwitter
reserved for stuff
ive known fawlty for years and hes been one of the most
dedicated and prolific content creators in the autz hes respected
by all sides in any conflict and although hes young hes already
got a better head on his shoulders than most people i know who
are much older hes a seasoned eve player too having handled
more responsibility and gained more experience than the vast
majority of eve players ever willim happy to endorse fawlty and
hell probably be 1 on my ticketps happy birthday
ive been holding back on my endorsements on csm candidates a
little bit just to see who is definately running this being said
without reservation i also endorse fawlty7 as a candidate for the
csm to be put bluntly fawlty is known for calling a spade a spade
and will do wonders for both the community and the gamethis
being said fawlty how do you feel about timezone tanking
secondly do you feel that your prelisted responsibilities will
negatively impact your ability to do the csm job or conversely do
you think that being a csm will have a negative impact on your
ceo dutiesfleet commandingthirdly do you think that dt tanking
or doing stuff with respect to dt because you know its a get out of
jail free card can and should be addressededited for 3rd
question
3 for the endorsement man means a lottimezone tanking from
my perspective has 2 points direct and indirect for example my
alliance is 99 autz therefore we play outside the majority of the
games time simply by playing in our timezone we are timezone
tanking in that case it isnt deliberate so much as its
unavoidableon the flip side there is always the option for groups
to time their structures or sov based on their enemies prime time
this leads to interesting situations and opportunities a lot of
groups love to time their stuff for funny enough autz because its
so dead it provides people playing in that timezone opportunities
to have something to do overall i dont think theres anything
wrong with making your enemy come up with new ways to
counter your actionsmy current responsibilities are what give me
the experience to run for csm in the first place if elected i would
have to take a step back from some of them but the ones that i
am passionate about and what keep me wanting to login and run
for csm in the first place will still be very much a part of my game
timecompared to timezone tanking dt tanking is a much more
deliberate use of a specific mechanic especially for us in the autz
dt tanking has removed so many possibilities for content and
possible chances of changing the landscape of regional power
bases so many groups use the safety net of dt to get away with
actions that within any other timezone would end terribly i feel
that at the very least dt tanking completely removes that
timezones ability to have a major impact in certain situations i
feel that a change of some form should be introduced that at least
reduces the removal of risk for anyone attempting to use dt as a
safety net be that the addition of persistent aggression timers or
removal of dt entirely
i have known fawlty7 since late 2010 he is an immensely
talented individual who has a very deep understanding of the
game most notably in 00 and though our paths have diverged
over the years i have no hesitation in saying that he would make
an excellent member of the csm he was certainly mature beyond
his years and has really experienced eve at a high level and is
passionate about it i would have no hesitation in putting my votes
his way on matters pertaining to 00 and for looking at things
honestlyin terms of hisec i think he would at least listen which
makes him far better than most others i have seen blocked

hi space friendsi am jonatan reed or jr of origin currently i
console elo over skype when he loses a dota match try to
convince him to come back to the game run his corp in our
alliance did he say jump dhsj and i am here to announce that i
am running for csm as a representative for all low sec
residentsabout mei have played eve since 2009 spending the
first 2 years of my eve career in mostly harmless before the
collapse of the old nc and spent another year in the drone
regions in the old irc coalition before joining origin and black
legion in mid2012since that point i spent most of my time in
origin and took a couple breaks to play around in wormholes and
took a 8 month break in 2015 for irl reasons before rejoining
origin when white legion was formed i subsequently started
managing origin after elo knight took another break and have
been managing the corp and being part of dhsj leadership and
one of its main fcsmy ideal gameplay ranges from midlarge size
fleet pvp down to solocsm platformi think that a lot of focus of eve
is on nullsec and ccp devotes a lot of resources to improving
nullsec at the expense of other areas of space and one of the
most neglected areas is lowsec i think that the csm desperately
needs someone who represents the entire lowsec playerbase
including faction warfare fwlowsec visioni definitely want to
bring a perspective to eve where fights between entities arent
based on sov and massive fleets but are based almost
exclusively on structures and smallmid sized entitiescitadels
and more importantly structures like poses and pocos are the crux
of fights in almost all of lowseccitadels and structures re
examination of citadel vulnerability timers  ccp plans to replace
poses with citadels and the to be announced drilling platforms
UFFFD but this will create a landscape of largely
uncontestable structures that have mechanics that overwhelming
favor the defender UFFFDdrilling platformsUFFFD  the
proper introduction of UFFFDdrilling platformsUFFFD will
be critical to avoid the evaporation of a major content generator in
lowsec poses provide content by allowing individuals
corporations and alliances to contest iskproducing assets in
space if UFFFDdrilling platformsUFFFD are governed by
the same mechanics as citadels and engineering complexes ie
vulnerability and reinforcement timers we risk losing what is
arguably the largest generator of content in lowsec after all
asakai was fought over a cobalt moon faction warfare even
though i am not personally enlisted in fw currently as someone
who enjoys lowsec pvp in a faction warfare zone and has done it
on a few alts i think the following changes are necessary to fw to
benefit both fw and nonfw players suspect timer on entering fw
complex  i think suspect timers should be given to nonmilitia
players who enter a fw complex by doing so militia playersnew
and old alikewill not receive a security status penalty for
contesting the complex on behalf of their militia against neutral
entities this is especially beneficial to new players as many rely
on high security space to rearm and reship after entering their
respective warzones resetting fw complex timers  i think that fw
timers should be reset back if someone leaves the complex it
forces people to stay in sites or risk losing their progress which
benefits all pvpUFFFDers increase lp from killing opposing
militia targets  i think that more loyalty points should be awarded
to players who engage in pvp with opposing militias by increasing
the payout for loyalty point bounties this promotes content by
rewarding pvp over pve citadels in faction warfare  i think that
citadels should have fw system control lockouts applied to them
as they apply to stations a hostile militia should not be able to
anchor and online a citadel in a system they do not control and
should not be able to dock in any citadel that is anchored in a
system that is not controlled by them even if they are on the
access list or if its freeported capitals examining dreadnaught
role in current capital meta  i think dreadnaughts need a close
examination to find them a new place in eve as carriers and faxes
have cemented themselves as the primary capitals for almost all
alliances in eve faxes are enormously costeffective against
dreads in that a normal t2 fit fax can basically tank 3 to 4 times its
value in dreads carriers exacerbate the fax imbalance with their
utility between capital neuts and support fighters and their ability
to receive reps and capacitor from said triage examining the
dreadnaught role in structure bashing  with the introduction of
citadelstructure damage caps and the impending removal of
poses dreadnoughts will lose their niche in eve as siege
platforms a sieged dread is easily killed by a properly fit citadel
you cannot onecycle reinforce a citadel like you could for even
the largest upgunned pos rorquals should not be jump hics  i
think that rorquals need to receive a penalty of not being able to
use warp disabling modules when they hit their panic module
overall tldrspecific attention to overall citadel mechanics and
reinforcement mechanics how drilling platforms will be
implemented and quality of life changes in fw which helps the
health of lowsec in general and a look at how dreadnaughts
factor into capital gameplay and also jumphicshmu on tweetfleet

endorsing jr for csm i happen to know that jr despite residing in
what some would refer to as larger entities in eve actual does a
lot of solo and small gang pvp both of which have been lacking
attention in the larger scopes of eve and i think jr will represent us
well fw is definitely something that has been lacking an overhaul
for years i remember back when my eve career started that it
was fw that started my pvp adventures but it was also fw which
made me look for greener fields and the mechanics quickly
became dreadful and unintuitive which the recent development
focus on alpha clones npe and other venues leaning towards
attracting capsuleers to the game it only becomes natural that fw
as often opted as the new player goto place for first pvp
encounters should soon get it turns as the center of attention
full support for jonatan reed for csmhe is a keystone to our
operations even if they are behind the scenes and go unnoticed
by the whole of the alliance the knowledge he has and the skill
he has developed while playing eve makes him a great
contestant for the csm would enjoy seeing what he could bring to
the table for the losec groupsmaking low sec great
againmakeevegreatagain
vote for jr if you want to nerf jump dessies i dont want to but
thats on his agenda
mega
great guy who knows fuckton about this game furthermore
probably the only candidate whos able to scare the  out of
even ccp if he enters his famous full rage mode d

hi a question for you how would you react if when talking with
ccp they tell you they dont have the developer resource
available to do any work on pi at the moment im not saying this
is the case but its the kind of thing which happens
sototal pi overhaul t3 bss mining that is currently in a good
place and something yet to be specified regarding industry in all
security levels of spacewellccp knows pi could be tidied up
they will get to it one dayt3 bss are already on the cards they
will get to it one dayindustry is happening right now without
question there are areas that could be improved upon but ccp will
get to it one daywhat by voting for you will expedite this
amelioration
what are your thoughts on instalocking and the travel ceptor meta
that has evolved from it along the same lines what are your
thoughts on interdiction nullificationt3s what changes would
you recommendif any 1  from what iUFFFDve seen and
heard about dancul in the at alone heUFFFDs someone you
want influencing the direction of the game
bobmon got along well with everyone on the csm the key thing
about csm11 was the rebooting of the relationship not only within
the csm itself but also with ccp when you are picking a candidate
keep this in mind as anyone you vote for should be someone that
can get along with a group of their peersbobmon can do that for
you
bob has my vote for csm 12hes always open and receptive to
ideas that are put forward then provides clear feedback to what
he presented to ccp and how it was received
vote ze bobmon hell waste tons of his time on this garbage
cheers for the questions 1 the aegis sov system worked
fantastically well for us as an alliance our pve activities were
spread mostly evenly across the constellation keeping a 4 adm
in every single one of our systems being on the other side of this
in the past in a war that was steamrolled and seeing that we
instead held against stainwagon for so long aegis sov fulfilled its
intention from that it forced tikle the much smaller alliance to
halt expansion and live in sov relevant to its size and carefully
harass neighbouring sov and towers that were hittable due to low
adms and lax tower workon this note though the smooth
operation of aegis sov vs citadels leave much to be desired both
our fortizar drop and the continued astrahus drops by goons and
stainwagon were utterly incontestable with zero effort the
structure was invulnerable to be a safe haven for the enemy for
ever these structures require no maintenance and have a timer
outside of our timezone there is simply nothing we could do2 the
ingame corporation tools do their job currently this is great in
reality these tools and their revamps become useful when your
corporations grows but it doesnt take long before alts begin
crowding your list and last month means yesterday twelve times
a yeari dont thinks its ccps place to attempt to add jackknife or
similar to eve but i hope to raise discussions around these qol
things and increased management roles titles etc via the esi
api3  daily opportunities in their proposed system did not sit well
with how i believe my timezone alliance corp and myself plays
the game we log in everyday to fly beside our friends and
corpmates to shoot the  in mumble and link horrible memes in
jabber there may be places in this system for opportunities but i
dont see them being above abuse if sp is still the rewardwhat i
would be interested in tabling discussions on is dailies for
collectables exclusive skins and the like with opportunities
actually bringing a character out of its shell are you a highsec
miner mine ore in lowsec are you an avid pvper run a data
site things that are both balanced in terms of being attainable but
require you to interact with a part of the game you may not
have4 the forums are a cesspit heavy handed moderation is
some threads with 40 pages of vitriol in another simply being
locked the existing moderation team is either heavily
understaffed or afraid to act decisively with a few rogue agents
what the answer is to this i cant say without being more involved
with the moderation team however working with the forum
moderation policy which has 36 individual rules is simply a well of
text to read sure ccp have expanded this over time to fit unique
circumstances but it is unwieldy and leaves much of the
reprimand system to arbitrary permabans or leniency and this is
before we involve the website terms of usefurthermore both
this post and the op is in breach of the forum moderation policy
since discussion of moderation is against rule 11 although cooler
heads should prevail here in the hopes of a better forum for all5
kill dton a serious note i completely understand ccps stance on
autz we simply arent large enough to justify significant
expensewhat we are however is a nation built on honesty and
integrity many of ccps responses to issues are fantastic at
aggravating this a timezone with low server load and high latency
experiences a bug the common response is that this issue is
unable to be replicated only for the issue to get steadily worse
and magically appear in a major timezone cue slow clap from the
autz as the euros and americans find a new bugi also spoke
earlier about the ability for autz to work around the edges of aegis
sov this is not possible with citadels and makes me quite
concerned about autzs ability to continue participatingthanks for
your time ariel
1 i am a free man in a free state 2 you seem quite arrogant here
and thats not very cool read the first line of my first post3 i
learned that ccp could make terrible choices much worse than i
could have imagined4 you are implying there isnt already hyper
inflation and that ratting and missiniong arent worthless cant
answer that5 nothing exciting left at least let us play barbie
online properly
can we close this thread already its obviously fake
so you seem to be anti goons not a bad thing but are you
likening them more towards isis mexicans or the chinese
if this wasnt actually happening in the real it would be quite
funnyso will you be pushing ccp to add a extra tax for female
players along with a reduction in their basic rights
i agree why bar us from some of the tech i drones when we are
able to get other tech i stuff giving us the other tech i drones
especially the heavy drones to make ratting more efficient wont
break the line between an alpha and omega
to me that doesnt make any  sense ive giant mining ships
in an asteroid belt they cannot give boosts to anyonebecause
they need a refit their ship before combat on the fly in
spacecurrently at the moment if you do not attack somebody you
can refit while youre in combat with the mobile depots if you do
not have any aggression timeri kind of hate both of these things i
hope my alliance doesnt hate my guts for bitching about the
mobile depotsreason why im posting this here maybe you guys
will find a better solution for both of these things without screwing
everybody over that much it rely on those strategies
as a csm 11 member who had the pleasure of meeting and
working with jin this year i highly recommend and support his
candidacy for csm 12 and urge all prospective voters to back him
this year jins work as the unofficial secretaryspokesperson on
csm 11 was invaluable in keeping the community abreast of what
was going on in our discussions with ccp all while maintaining the
level of discretion necessary in an ndad position while many csm
members like myself preferred a more narrow expertoriented
method of gathering feedback jin succeeded in the opposite and
brought valuable information to ccp from a wide variety of players
through forums like townhalls jin is an extremely dedicated and
passionate player and csm member and despite his notorious
inability to hold his liquor is one of those guys that everyone
appreciated having at our meetings and summits i wish him the
best of luck in his campaign this year and hope you all will
consider backing him for another year representing the
playerbase on csm 12
definitly a 1 from me you did awesome work
i honestly dont think jin has slept in the last year due to the
amount of work hes doing for this csmeasy 1 choice for me
as some one who arguably saved jin and tonics life once i will
100 vote for him
jin is a bloody hard worker he is one of the people i was most
surprised by on csm 11 and not just because he can drink a
surprising amount for guy with a small frame he will be on my
ballot without a doubt csm11forever
what are your thoughts on rorquals
i think the e war options in panic need to be nerfed 5 minute
invulnerable jump hictor is a little rediculous
well i started to go through your blog but i was onto page 3 of
older posts andi think that ccp should have a hisec carebear
focus group which focus on making it fun for people who just want
to play casual which would be a counter weight to the get them
out of hisec 00 crowd hammering away at ccp what do you
thinkpersonally i think ganking is in a good place at this point
except for a couple of things the first is bumping this makes it
too easy and very annoying for the freighter pilot needs to be
sorted there are a number of ways this can be dealt with but
having a no consequence way of pointing someone for hours if
they wanted is very poor game play my preferred option is to put
a bump counter on that after 20 bumps there is a an increasingly
random chance that the bumper will go suspect when bumping a
freighteranother change would be removing docking rights fro 5
or worse there are now citadels in hisec that will hopefully
change how people look at ganging together and going after
ganker citadels or those that give them docking rights the
astrahus and raitaru have to have better cap and improved
defences the missile system in hisec is too weak and needs
improving perhaps an alternative is some very effective rr ability
on those citadels which will make people more likely to defend
themwar decs the system is in my opinion actually quite good
but need a few tweaks the first is cap the war dec fee against
major alliances the second is give the locator agent the ability to
say if someone is online as a request but add in that if the agents
corp has good standings with the player being asked about they
will warn him of the interest this also replies to the location
request i would make the war dec follow a character if he joins
another player run corp within the week of the war dec but on the
other hand i would also limit the time that entities with less than
50 charactes can be war decked perhaps two weeks maxhisec
is made up mainly of people with support and indy accounts in
hisec which is why it is so stale but another reason is that people
who are actually more hisec focused and casual play so as not to
be noticed by war deckers who they have no chance of fighting
effectively that is a statement of the issue in hisec but changing
it is not easy because as you quite rightly pointed out it is i rather
than we that is the issue here i was hoping that people would
gang together to keep citadels alive but they are so weak and the
issue of not being able to rep allies in the war dec screws that
one ccp needs to change it so that rr can be applied to allies in a
war i know that this will benefit war deckers too but only when
they come in as defending alliesanyway a few things for you to
respond to or develop further blocked teckos pech sonya

my name is the judge and i am proud and excited to announce
my candidacy for csm 12 who am ii am the judge judge or tj i
am one of the 4 permanent attendees from csm 11 and the only
person to ever hold true perfect attendance in a csm term that
isnt easy coming from melbourne australia and playing in the
autzwhile i have rolled many characters and been known by
many names since late 2003 i have been playing eve full time
since 2008 i strongly believe what makes eve unique in a ever
changing universe is the community that shapes and guides the
universe we all take part in every time we open up the launcher
and log in eve is a massive game fueled by the experiences of its
players it is you the player that i would like to represent for
another year on csm 12i am currently a member of the
leadership team for the alliance circleoftwo i am also a proud
member of the circleoftwo alliance tournament team i have lived
for large amounts of time null high and low security space i like to
think i have my ear to the ground on the issues facing pilots from
all over new eden i come to you not only as a candidate for
nullsec but as a person who wants nothing more than to see eve
continue to succeed evolve and growwhy should you vote for
memy platform is quite simple i want to continue to be the
person you can voice your concerns and issues to i want to make
sure that every every concern that the eve community has makes
it to ccp and the rest of the csm csm 11 has shown that with
mutual respect between the csm and ccp we can work together to
bring eve to a better placecsm 11 has been arguably the most
successful csm for both ccp and the csm as an institution we as
a group have pushed through the negativity and distrust from the
start of our term to bring the ccpcsm working relationship into a
better place than its ever been this is in no small part due to the
personalities of csm 11 this is why i support the reelection of my
fellow csm 11 members who have decided to rerunwith the
change bringing the total number of csm members down to 10 its
more important than ever to vote for the candidates you would
like to see continue moving the csm forward lowering the total
members means bloc votes can only bring a candidate so far be
an informed voter people who promise you the moon are more
often than not pandering to the masses the csm is a
representative body for the playerbase not something that can
force the hand of ccp or bully developers if you want to help eve
continue in an upward trend please consider voting for either csm
11 members or candidates who understand the function of the
csm i will continue to be a staunch advocate for the playerbase
and the csm this is why you should vote for me and the rest of
csm 11closing remarkshow can you contact metwitter
thejudgeingame mail or convo the judgeskype
thejudgeevereddit thejudgein closing i urge you to vote when
the time comes but be an informed voter there are lots of
candidates that promise you fixes or changes to your style of
gameplay and in all honesty thats not something the csm has
control over we are a sounding board a focus group
consultants not elected junior developers the csm needs
mature people who can talk and act professionally in a business
environment i hope you find me worthy of your vote to again
represent our amazing and unique community thank you

reserved
youve definitely got my vote again judge
one of the most down to earth people i knowthe judge has made
good on all the promises he made during the last election he said
regardless of the cost he would do his best to get our voice
heardhe has made many sacrifices in game and in real life to
ensure that he has represented us the players to the best of his
abilitya truly hard working individual as eve online players we
could not have a better person representing us and working to
make this game we love continue to develop and improve in
conjunction with ccpthe judge will have my vote
the judge is one of the most knowledgeable and skilled players in
eve his input will be based on whats best for the game not his
personal or alliance interesti will vote for you
in game politics should not dictate or direct the decisions as to
who is elected judge wants what is best for the game as do i and
that is what is most important csm xi was the first in a new
decade and generation of electees who brought the relationship
of csm closer than it has ever been with ccp anyone who
continues that is worth my vote i support the judge
updated post with campaign goals and things i want to bring to
the table
hello all most probably dont know me unless youre on tweetfleet
slack or have joined karina ivonovichs recent weebfleet slack im
here to throw my hat in to the csm candidacy pot even though im
not a big name i know i can and will work hard to make sure my
constituents are heard when it come to anything that may affect
them anyways on to my postwho am iive been playing eve
solidly since may of 2013 started as a highsec miner and one
month in to the game i got my first taste of pvp venturing in to low
to get some of those rocks never looked back joined euni that
august stayed there for two years then in august of 2015 i joined
waffles while in euni i did try out wormhole space for about 6
months i stayed mostly entirely in lowsec during it ive fcd mostly
small gang my largest fleet hitting 50 people wherein we used
carriers and dreads i run a monthly weebfleet public fleet which
is slowly gaining traction my campaignim going in as a lowsec
candidate primarily to help represent faction warfare space now
while ive never done it myself i am in good communication with a
few people who have one who has done it for a long time theyll
make sure i get all relevant feedback to pass on to ccp you may
be asking why care about facwar if youre not part of it well the
short of it is that even though i dont do it it still has a large effect
on my own gameplay if it wasnt for the faction warfare in my
area it would be much harder to hunt targets a healthy facwar is
a healthy lowsec tldr lowsec pilot small and medium gang fc
cares about all aspects of lowsec due to their symbiotic
relationships makelowsecgreatagain if you need to get ahold of
me feel free to evemail me hit me up on tweetfleet slack on
weebfleet discord on reddit at ukalentsero or even twitter
kalentsero though i rarely get on my twitter
 reserved for replies 
weebfleet proudly endorses this candidate
kalen is good people
do you like waffles
yes in fact i do like waffles do youfun fact waffles are just
pancakes with abs
will you ever remove anime from eve online
with the departure of both myself and gorski at the end of csm 11
the critical role of a balance and small gangsolo council member
will go vacant and will require a successor it is for this reason
that i support and endorse suitonias candidacy for csm 12 and
encourage any and all who supported gorski or myself to back
suitonia in this election although i proposed and supported the
reduction of the total number of csm members from 14 to 10 i
completely understand that it makes it harder for nonbloc
focused candidates to get the necessary votes to secure a seat
this is why it is critical that if mechanics balance and small
gangsolo pvp are important issues to you that you place suitonia
at the top of your ballot this year to ensure these issues have an
experienced voice representing them at the tabledespite
suitonias reputation as a pilot of the detestable frigate class
space vessels i can assure you that in all seriousness that he is
one of only a handful of people in the game with the necessary
experience depth of understanding and ability to articulate
feedback to fill this important balancefocused role this is
demonstrated by his 1 years of pvp experience in the game
2numerous articles and writeups analysing balance problems
and 3 dozens of videos showcasing his understanding of fitting
piloting and mechanics his existing relationship with ccp devs
will only be strengthened by securing a seat on the csm and i
trust him to objectively address the topics i care about most and
continue the work done by csm 11 in this regard i encourage all
solobalance focused voters to back suitonia in this election good
luck on your campaign and may the holy battleships flourish in
your care
wow youre not pathetic at all you must be the cool edgy rebel
of the internet i totally wish i had daddy issues like you so i can
project my insecurity onto others sucks because i cant be as
much of a bitter douche bag as you im new and was just
browsing around and came across this i have no idea what eve
needs or anything remotely of the likes of that however it doesnt
take an expert in any game to notice that you clearly have issues
to get so upset over a single person that from this perspective
has merely listed credentials to establish their experience within
eve and shows you are capable of nothing other than
condescending down to others maybe if you are capable you
can type something a little more constructive and less im
triggered over something so trivial i have to be a hateful whiny
little btch about iti for one hope you dont run for whatever the
hell this election is for no one will probably need a bs internet
edgelord expert
say what dteambattleship
as an outgoing member of csm 11 who along with gorski
primarily focused on mechanics balance and small gangsolo
issues i must voice my strong opposition to the candidacy of
rhiload and urge those voters who care about these issues to
instead back suitonia who is vastly more experienced and
qualified to fulfil this role on csm 12 with the reduction in the
number of csm seats this year from 14 to 10 it is important that
nonbloc entities like the small gangsolo community further
concentrate their top votes behind serious candidates that can
bring a depth of understanding and experience to ccp on these
topics rather than wasting them on charlatans such as rhiloadthe
success and popularity of rhiloads meme video series zkill
guides this year is undoubtedly impressive and has at long last
brought a particular style of comedy video popular in other games
to eve however this success should not be misinterpreted as an
indicator of his knowledge or experience on the topics of balance
and small gangsolo pvp but rather just as a showing of his ability
to entertain and satirise unfortunately for him neither of these
skills are valuable or necessary in the role of a csm member and
would actually would detract from the hard work csm 11 did to
restore productive and serious relations with ccp by trivialising
important discussions on balance topics despite his comparisons
to me in regards to garnering a csm candidacy backing from
videomaking success i respectfully disagree with this false
equivalency i would instead draw comparisons between rhiload
and csm 10 member wingspanntt chance ravinne who
demonstrated how youtube popularity without any substance to
back it up makes for a hollow and useless csm member although
i certainly encourage his continued content creation which brings
a smile to manyaneve player i want to warn prospective voters
on the dangers of letting rhiloads comedic success propel him
above his stationhaving spent many hours and days over the
past year working with ccp to have game balance taken as an
issue seriously i cannot in good conscious allow an eve youtube
comedian to get away with exploiting his recent popularity to
masquerade as an expert on a topic he is not qualified to speak
on i understand that rhiload may take this as a personal insult
however i only voice this opposition because i care about this
game and these topics and have too much respect for the csm
ccp relationship to allow a meme candidate to detract from the
serious work of the council i do not know him personally and am
sure hes a nice person and dedicated player
so vote for a goon as a nonblock entity did you fall on your
head
ive flown with rhiload in last years at and although he might not
be a master of game mechanics he still is a reasonable guy and
knows his stuff see his commentary work in at not everyone in
eve is concerned with the intricacies of the game and the main
problem with the csm seems that it is dominated by huge power
blocks and often the smaller groups get lost in the crowd i feel
rhiload being in a small gang focused group like tl he maybe in a
better position to understand and listen to the feelings of smaller
groups in eve right now
thank you mr grappler the game is still very unbalanced its time
for someone who cares about small ships too and i mean all
small ships and not only the kestrel o7
hi hyde congrats on the nearly 10k subsi see that you feel that i
am not up to the task and or feel disheartened about me running
for the csm but thats a valid concern  so lets get into shall wei
am no expert in game mechanics and balance issues in this
game i dont even say that in my forum post so where did you get
that i feel if both suitonia and myself was part of the csm both of
us can bounce feedback from the devs on howwhy this xyz is
opnot op there is no doubt that suitonia is a much stronger
candidate than myself in terms of game balance and mechanics
but i am not fully running for that position i even commentated
the first weekend of the at i dont know anything about balance or
shipsi am running for a platform of lowsecurity i reside here and
so its my best interest to keep this area healthy i am not just
running on balance and game design alone you may take me for
a joke because of the videos i make and that is a perfectly fine
statement to make in fact i want people to question this how will
people know i am taking the csm seriously the videos i make
point out the strengths weaknesses piloting tactics and fitting all
in one yes they have an incredible amount of memes in them
but it takes knowledge of the game and ship design to actually
make the video in the first place ive helped people get into pvp
new and old i give them fittings tactics and other helpful
suggestions for them i commentate event ive commentated the
first weekend for at 14 if this is not getting involved or not taking
what i do seriously then i dont know im here to give the little guy
a voice to small gang groups such as tl and various thera groups
need someone to step up gorski is currently not running and i
would be worried for said groups to not have a representative in
the csm if there are then more the merrieryou have every right
to remain disgruntled and have opinion about me in fact its good
to have opposition to a candidate but i guarantee you if i do get
voted on the csm i will prove you wrong

a solid platform to stand on yums for space president
my only question is will you make poitot great again when you
are part of the csm that isit feels like poitots importance in the
grand scheme has dwindled a little bit especially to ccp it
seemswhat are your first steps in making a great and unified
poitot again
so this meme is a bit tired but i will try to pick it up and work with
it eh if by poitot you mean everything good about npc null yes i
will do everything in my power to try and focus some attention on
this space space mostly forgotten by the devs npc null is where
ccp needs to be looking anyway for the current crowd much more
than sov 00 despite their best attempts sov is still dominated by
large tired coalitions and the few sparks of promising vigor have
been promptly stomped out by ravenous power blocs hungry for
content npc null is literally the dream of the current gamer crowd
what sort of games are jumping and jiving right now well dota
overwatch etc etc  games where you can take a small group of
friends out for a spin and see what you are or are not made of
thats the npc null dream  take out a small gang of your buddies
and roam around see what you can stir up have fun and then
dock up and be done with it back in the old days when pirate
battleship bpc were worth something npc null was even more fun
as the pve followed this model as well  the few deds out there
created flash points for gangs to fight over thus resources were
acquired by activity and spurred content now npc null is pretty
much dead  it cant really support a diversity of small entities
sharing the same space rather it gets bulldozed over by one
large entity that controls the moons it needs bottom up
accessible income to let people live the dream lowsec has fw and
l5s 00 has sovstuff but npc null haswell nothing yet it
remains one of the last few small gang sanctuaries if the
playstyle was supported things would be greatin building the
new npc null dream a few things have to be done first an
income stream that is bottom up and cannot be dominated by
large groups and afk mechanics like moons has to be created it
currently makes no sense that belt ratting via tags and l5
missions make lowsec many times more profitable than npc null
this would allow a recolonization of the space and small groups
would be supported and they would thus not spend the majority
of their time looking for content rather they could find it by
logging in most of the pvpers i know arent moaning about jump
fatigue they are moaning about roaming fatigue  so much of
space is empty logging into eve is a chore not an adventure if
sov 00 is the arena for coalitions to fight on a coalition scale
then make npc null the space for small gangs to play out their
dramas and strugglesive lived in syndicate for a long time
entities like cas repeatedly voice to me that its hard for their
players to source income in hisec or on alts and then look for play
in syndicate theres no reason why they should have to do that
when aegis sov doubled the escalation rate it gutted a lot of
income from npc null if it were up to me i would make the loot
tables separate  escalation deds drop different things than
scanned down naturally occurring ones right now its just plain
silly how cheap pirate bs hulls are and the saturation of loot
makes things just blah reintroduce scarcity and rewarding
specialization by separating the loot tables and npc null gets a
tiny buff again a lot of players do not want the coalitions of sov
space they want a small gang sanctuary i would love it if ccp
supported all the playstyles out there poitot is great again when
npc null shines

1agreed on all accounts vote fawlty
fawlty would make an excellent csm member and it would be
great to get some autz representation so 1what are your
thoughts on how the server comes back up after downtime it it
better for it to be online quickly with some elements still offline
systems markets contracts or slowly with everything working
as it should
i like fawlty7 he is a pgood dude
downtime has come leaps and bounds in the past few years in
its current form it is bearable but definitely needs work the fact
that downtime usually ends fairly quickly but with several services
lacking considering the progress that has been made over the
recent years is a small price to pay however the overall goal
should be the complete removal of downtime
having known of then met fawlty many times i am confident in his
ability to confront issues head on and be frank open and honest
when it comes to addressing any and all issuesfor some of you
who may have known fawlty years ago and have had no
interaction with him since  his experience both within eve and
without have given him a unique and wise perspectivethat is to
say he has grown immensely in leaps and bounds into the level
headed man he is todayfawlty would make an excellent addition
and valued contributions to the csm and you as a voter would
miss out if fawlty were not a part of the csm

for what it means fawlty7 has the peoples diplos endorsement
having though only known fawlty for the past two years i think
without his initial leadership back in the main autz squad in goons
that made the game so fun for me i would have likely not stayed
within the game from getting to know him initially ingame to
meeting him in reality he is indeed a strong leader and is not
scared to let his opinion be heard through all the things tikle has
so far gone through the fact that the alliance still stands and even
after out multiple sovevictions most members of the alliance
stayed through it all to which i believe is a strong example of
fawltys leadership1 here
nothing fawlty about fawlty7 good dude to fight good dude to
drink with all around good dude that being said he does go on
and on about it always being his birthday says he gets lots of
free crap from restaurants and he printed 365 fake drivers
licenses with different date of births so he can get free food and
drinks and cheap tickets to the cinema bit sad a barely grown
man faking his birthday for attention 
about time lowsec get a representation
as a white man i can 100 throw my support behind jonatan
reed because white people thanks obama
well since youre apparently willing to do ccps work for free
youll have my vote not because youre doing it for free but
because youre doing it right but i still believe youve got
scammed into thisbut hey you look like a grown up and the
choice here is yours se be it
ccp should hire steve already but until that happens he gets a
solid 1 from me
with most people you would be right to get a little weary of
someone who has been on the csm as long as steve has  but he
really is the exception to the incumbency rule from the moment
csm 11 stepped in he was the font of institutional knowledge that
we all relied upon to ease the transition period and kept up that
positive helpful attitude all the way through his areas of expertise
are those which very few candidates can offer insight on making
him a great representative for third party developers and market
nerds alike high sec and industry nerds need not look any further
for their goto candidate for csm 12 and i hope you all will cast
your support behind the man  the myth  the beard  fuzzy steve
ronuken
has my vote again
steve is an amazing man and its not just because he has the
beard of a god i pity anyone running on a
marketindustryhighsec platform because you will never find a
better candidate than steve i cant imagine a csm without steve
ronuken he will be on my ballot
hello steve thanks for running again me my alt and i will be
voting for youif i can pose a few questions1 mining crystals is
one of the most complex munitions in eve with a specialization
down to individual ores yet the refining rigs from upwell are
simplified into primary groups what is your view here2 outer
ring excavations is restricted to null sec whilst sisters of eve and
thukker are available within highsec without restriction why do
you think this is so3 the values of faction standings have been
eroded with loss of anchorage and jump clonewhat do you think
can be added to restore the prestige of having earnt standings
i wholeheartedly support capri for csm 12 he is a levelheaded
and articulate player who will be able to build upon the successes
of csm 11 had in restoring productive relations with ccp he has
two of the most important skills for any successful csm candidate
1 understanding the real role of the csm and how council
members should behave and 2 proving wellwritten constructive
feedback on the game without letting things get hostile it is easy
to complain  the playerbase is very good at that it is an entirely
different thing to be able to find the root of a problem and
propose a wellthoughtout solution or change that benefits the
game as a whole i am confident capri will be a valuable addition
to the csm team and will be able to bring his particular subject
matter expertise to bear while also supporting other areas such as
game balance and smallsolo pvp best of luck on your campaign
heya folks iUFFFDm robin my character name is kalbuir
skirate and iUFFFDm hoping to become part of the csm this
year in this post i will introduce myself and explain my platform
credentials passion and focus introiUFFFDm a director at
pandemic horde where my focus is on our new player experience
and our tooling  analyses square what this means is that i
spend all my free time helping new players in various ways i
founded and actually run the newbean initiative nbi which is our
UFFFDnew playerUFFFD helpers group within pandemic
horde a collection of super useful people who spend all their free
time helping new players ive worked hard to find ways to
improve horde for new players in shape of our flight schools
classes centralizing information and ways to distribute isk
towards new players iUFFFDve discovered ways that enable
us to help more people faster and more efficiently this focus is
the only reason we were able to cope successfully with huge
influx of new players during wwb and ascension patch to put it
into perspective we handed out 10000 ships and 50000
skillbooks in the first two week of the patch i collect and process
feedback on horde specifically as a means to improve our
alliance i run all the industry for the ships that gets handed out to
new players finally helping new players ingame duh it might
not look like it but much of this collides with our tooling and
analyses this allows us to gauge if changes we make have any
effect on metrics we also automate a lot of mundane tasks
through the eve api which allows us to spend more time on stuff
that is important rather than tasks that just needs to be done
iUFFFDm not going to talk too much about tooling as this is
not why im running for csm for me eveUFFFDs
apiUFFFDs analyses and tools are a means to free up as
many useful people so they can do what they truly enjoy help
new players why the csmiUFFFDve had an interest in the
game industry online games and online communities for much of
my life if we go back about 15 years it wasnUFFFDt
uncommon at all for a game company to have a council of
players class leads or community representatives skip forward
and to my knowledge ccp remains one of the only companies that
upholds this practise to a high level i believe in this concept and
have a huge passion for online communities which for eve the
csm is a vital part of while it is a lot of work both for ccp and the
players involved it is my opinion that this collaboration contributes
significantly to making the gap between players and developers
smaller however all of this stands and falls with having the right
csm members with the time intellect and motivation for the job i
think after 2015UFFFDs csm a lot of us were starting to
wonder if all the effort and time put in was worth it i can
confidently say that 2016UFFFDs csm proved to us that they
can be useful and contribute to eveUFFFDs developments
cycle in a meaningful way for 2017 itUFFFDs important we
continue this trend and elect competent csm membersi believe i
can be one of the csm members that has a positive effect on the
game and provide something that i already offer my alliance a
funnel for feedback regarding new players much of the analyses
and ideas in horde are things that we can only take so far without
running into game limitations my hope is that by broadening that
scope of feedback to all of eveUFFFDs players we can work
towards solving some of these issues or at the very least get them
on the agenda to be discussedimportance of csm this yearafter
phase 1 of the npe last year 2017 is going to be a very important
year for the success eve has with new players and potentially the
future success of eve from what i heard at eve vegas phase 2
and 3 of the npe are going to completely change how new players
learn the many aspects of eve while iUFFFDm very excited
about this new direction i also feel strongly that ccp needs all the
help it can get to get it just right i will say it again for emphasis
ccp needs all the help it can get to get it just rightyou could argue
that running for csm with a voting platform that almost solely runs
on new players is a waste of everyones time many old players
cough bittervets cough donUFFFDt care about new players
and many new players donUFFFDt know about the csm  well
lets change that the real kicker however is that we should all
care if eve is to exist for another 13 years the npe that both the
eve community and ccp provide go hand in hand with retaining
more players eveUFFFDs biggest issue isnUFFFDt
pulling in new players the issue is holding on to them and
introducing them to enough core features that will get them
hooked and in love with the game as we all are in my opinion one
of the biggest struggles of explaining eve is that both ccp and the
community have been playing this game for so long that there is
so much knowledge that is implied and accepted to be common
knowledge that it gets skipped over when trying to retain or
explain things to new players luckily team genesis has been
taking a good hard look at that and is definitely on the right track
if we look at the last 2 years ccp has been on the right track in my
opinion with ascension however beyond that we have the
smaller changes such as the adjustment of starting skills inject all
skillbooks feature multi buy multifit and skillpoint injectors that
allow new players to customize their character a lot better than
the character bazaar offers there is a lot left to be done and i wish
that there was more room for smaller changes like those
mentioned above that would do a lot of good for the quality of life
of new players
i want to contribute to the npe as much as i can and feel its
something every player in eve should at least slightly care about
attracting new players to eve keeps the game going creates more
content and most importantly fills up the galaxy im not running
based on an idea that im singlehandedly going to save eve or
make eveUFFFDs meta great i think itUFFFDs rather
delusional that youUFFFDre going to achieve that as a csm
member your role isnUFFFDt to be a game designer but a
player with an opinion and the ability to funnel other players
feedback instead im running based on something i am confident
in have expertise in and care deeply about i already spend all of
my free time on the npe with a lot of enthusiasm and joy adding
a csm perspective to would be another great motivator and
something i would do with a lot of satisfaction the key to the csm
in my opinion is this the ability to deliver proper feedback able to
keep an open mind about changes but most importantly
remember that youUFFFDre not there for yourself but for the
community meaning that staying in touch and true to the
community that is key my expertisein two words my expertise and
value to the csm are npe and toolingnpei can confidently say that
iUFFFDm one of the few people in eve that experiences the
struggles of new players and works towards improving them daily
in the nearly 2 years that iUFFFDve been trying to improve
hordeUFFFDs npe horde has been improving bit by bit
tweaking and streamlining things to affect our retention and
success of explaining eve weUFFFDve come a long way but
at the same time i feel i could quit my job spend 112 hours a
week on improving horde and still have a lot to do there is plenty
of overlap between new players struggling in horde and in eve in
general such as the ui what is and isnUFFFDt explained
reliable ways to make isk and how they are taught or
arenUFFFDt however there is also a lot of differences for
one thing eveUFFFDs new player experience in nullsec is
entirely different from the experience in wormhole space lowsec
and highsec i donUFFFDt have the delusion that i have the
answers on how to fix eveUFFFDs npe for all these
playstyles a csm member is only as good as the people he is
willing to listen to iUFFFDm willing to listen to everyone who
can take the time to phrase his ideas and constructive criticism
properly i want to broaden my horizon by not just focusing on
hordeUFFFDs npe but look at the bigger picture together with
anyone willing to contribute to itif going to fanfest eve vegas and
other fan gatherings has taught me anything its that there are a
lot of smart and passionate people in eveUFFFDs community
all of which love to talk about their space hobby or job   i enjoy
listening to those people more than learning about new features
or announcements because that isnUFFFDt what fan
gatherings are about in my opinion they are about making new
friends meeting existing ones and sharing a hobby i want to
listen to as many of you as possible and have some ideas on how
to do this effectively if i am fortunate enough to become csm
member toolingas for tooling being a middleware consultant and
full stack developer in real life i am someone that looks at data as
a valuable asset that supplements a process the process in
hordeUFFFDs case is turning a new player to a long term eve
player eve has such a wide range of publicly and privately data
available that it becomes an awesome repository for analyses and
tooling horde uses much of this data to save valuable time and
help new players this is something i could write a long article
about but iUFFFDll do that another time a quick tldr
impression you could obtain from the screenshots below
screenshotshaving spent almost 2 years integrating data and
tooling for horde i can confidently say i have a firm grasp of the
various apiUFFFDs eve offerscrest  xml api  esi as well as
the limitations and potential growth it could makethank you for
considering me as your csm member and please feel free to ask
me any questions i look forward to answering
themregardskalbuir skiraterobin
hi when i heard about wwb i finally decided to try out eve i joined
the game on trial account and within 4 hours i was on the front
lines getting blown up in ships provided to me by nbi a program
led by kalbuir if it wasnt for the people in nbi who guided me for
4 hours and tolerated my stupid and silly questions i may not still
be here but when i experienced pvp and hundreds of pilots
fighting in space i knew this was the game for me and 9 months
or so later im still herenbi gave me the skill books the skill
plans and the ships to pursue several aspects of nullsec pvp
mining explorationratting and many other things memes  this
allowed me to go ahead and give a shot at everything without
there being any hurdleseverytime fleets went out at the time and
when they still go out newbeans are specifically encouraged to
join and they get free ships this culture has its roots in nbi
despite the nullsec politics and hordes involvement the alliance
still primarily caters to new players you wont be surprised that the
leaders of one of the biggest entities ingame spend considerable
time flying newbean ships and tweaking the fittings to ensure
effectiveness of ships in fleets as well as the ability of the new
players to fly them and make an actual difference and contribution
in the fights i cannot tell you how many brand new players ive
seen who have been superthrilled when their merlin tackles an
opponents ship for the first time and that leads to those ships
being blown up if you remember your first time youll know
exactly the amazing feeling that im talking about kalbuir has
been the point man that enables this training new players is just
one thing training contentcreators is also important and hordes
leadership allows anyone to fc the fleets and actually train fcs too
kalbuir is being quite humble about the amount of work he does
for horde and makes things smooth for us in terms of services that
he has coded for us kalbuir you have been a great help without
the support structure that you established i probably may not
have stayed around in evethank you for the services i believe
your first hand knowledge and experience in designing and
implementing npe is a great contribution to horde and eve
community you have trained 1000s of capsuleers and were
proud to call you our directoro
kalbuir is a guy who genuinley cares about this game and the
npe he has innovative solutions to even the most complex of
problems puts others intrests before his own and would be a
genuine asset to the csm the amount of work this guy puts into
horde is insane and i have no doubts that his work for the csm
would be treated with the same dedication if the npe api or just
having a smart hardworking guy on the csm matters to you
please cast a vote for kal
i dont think its any exaggeration to say personal opinion that
pandemic horde would not be the force it is today were it not for
the unstinting efforts of kal to try and make us the most effective
group around when it comes to helping new players into the game
 and then to retaining those players im not putting down any of
the other groups and small corps who help new players into the
game but i really believe we have a system that must rank up
there with the most efficient in eve please take the time to check
out the screenshots for example and try and get a handle on
what we have access to in order to help new playerskal devotes
an inordinate amount of time to this he is totally passionate about
what he does and he inspires all of us to be as passionate as he
is in helping new players find their feet i am a very proud member
of hordes newbean initiative nbi and i devote some of my time to
helping new players out note i said some i have other things i
like to do and horde lets me do them kal devotes his time to the
new players and to us in the nbi to help us become great
ambassadors for the game to our new membersa vote for kalbuir
skirate isnt a vote for pandemic horde it is a vote for a man who
will be as passionate on the csm towards helping the new player
experience for the whole of eve as he is towards helping the new
player experience for people joining pandemic horde and he will
come at it with a staggering amount of knowledge and
understanding of how eve works and how it doesnt kal will
make a difference and it will help all who play this wonderful
game1

kalb is a man
acknowledging that being on the csm isnUFFFDt about wish
fulfillment and you donUFFFDt really go there to give direction
but to provide advice on a direction feedback on plans and to
help brainstorm UFFFDwhat ifUFFFDsUFFFD when
askedUFFFD can you provide us some examples of what
your constructive feedback would look like on any current
mechanics functionality or balance you feel passionately abouti
realize thats an open ended question without any specifics or
quantities requested iUFFFDm asking because i want others
and myself to see an example of your thought process level of
knowledge writing style and hopefully balanced approach when
talking about a topic you are passionate about i think it is
important that csm members have the ability to talk rationally and
intelligently about topics they feel are important and can take into
account play styles other than their primary chosen style ie can
you represent to the best of your ability the entire player base on
general topics and on topics that you have a greater knowledge
can you engage in discussion that involves seeing the topic not
only from your particular play styleother than the question above
 i already like you because you do amazing work with horde and
it has been a pleasure seeing you work your magic keeping our
newbean chaos organized thanks for all you do kalbuir
i am simply 1 of 1000s of success stories that could be attributed
directly to kalbuirs hard work but instead of bragging about all the
kills ive been apart of 
greetings allafter much thought and discussions with my wife and
friends i have decided to finally put in my ticket as a candidate for
the twelfth installment of the council of stellar management i
actually intended to start campaigning this year for csm xiii but i
think there is no better time than now to see if i can gain more
traction by running this year as well who is kael decadencewell
iUFFFDm glad you asked while you may see that my
character has been active since 2006 i wouldnUFFFDt say
that i started playing eve online until 2013 like many players i
found a free trial of the game installed it and made my character
and had no damn idea how to play the game it didnUFFFDt
make sense and didnUFFFDt play like any other video game i
had ever played so i gave up every so often i would get an email
from ccp letting me know that there was a free weekend for
returning players to come check out the game again and see what
was new so i would install the game and recover my password
only to be again disappointed and still not understanding how to
play this gameit wasnUFFFDt until i was in afghanistan for
my 4th deployment that i saw on a real news source something
about an eve online battle that costs tens of thousands of dollars
when i read about the battle of 6vdth i knew that i should take a
second look at eve online while i waited to get home to install the
game i took the time to start watching youtube videos and learn
everything that i could about how to play before i even stepped
back into the gamesince then i have been in a few corporations
while i learned how to play for really the first time and took longer
than i would have liked to start feeling like i got it searching
around on google for a ship fit one day for an algos i came
across a fit on a site for the high drag podcast i knew what a
podcast was but didnUFFFDt realize that this game had one
so i started listening to everything they had then i realized there
were more podcasts about this game i was starting to fall in love
with then i found eve radio and dj big country the podside
podcast and so many more i was hookedone friday morning in
germany which was when podside with manny bothans aired live
on thursday stateside i was invited to fill in as a guest for my
favorite eve online podcast podsideUFFFDs thirsty thursday
edition i kept coming back week after week to lend my voice to
the show even when the time changed and it was at 4 am for me
i didnUFFFDt care i loved talking about this game that i loved
now i joined a wormhole corp with kazumi one of the hosts and
learned so much more than i had to that pointafter making the
rounds as a guest host on ever edition of the podside podcast
before it shut down an appearance on the open coms show and
starring on manny bothans is primary i decided to start my own
podcast with meredudd nearing its 23rd episode our show is
now over 10000 downloads and is syndicated on crossing
zebras not only that i have been a writer for imperium news ever
since i started a campaign called eve an hourwhy am i running
over the past few months i have been very vocal about how the
game needs to adapt to allow new players to more easily learn
how to play the game for a long while even before the new npe
and alpha clone state i had been adamant that ccp needed to
make some changes to help new players get into the game in
2016 i hosted an player meet up and started talking to new
players and recruiting prospective players in the game
culminating in me starting the eve an hour campaign to help
bridge the gap between veteran players and new alpha clonesit
amazed me how many players were joining the game and were in
the same boat i was back in 2006 they joined the game because
of all the advertising on game news websites about being free
but just a few hours into it they had no idea what to do i decided
to do the new UFFFDnpeUFFFD and started talking to
people in the rookie help chat about it from what i gathered by
doing it myself and from talking nothing had been changed to
really help anyone want to continue with the game if that had
been the npe that i experienced in UFFFD06 i still would
have left the game it did nothing for me as a veteran and
wasnUFFFDt doing anything for these new players hence i
started doing what i could to help new players find their way
through the gamewhat i found was that the isd game masters
and UFFFDofficialUFFFD representatives of ccp and eve
werenUFFFDt very helpful in the help channel and that the
best help was found from players watching streamers and talking
to other players one day in rookie help i had been answering
questions and pointing people to my discord channel for two
hours before a gm finally chimed in and said i couldnUFFFDt
advertise my unbiased help in a help channel two hours and i
was the only person giving help and advise in a help channel
before i was told that i wasnUFFFDt allowed to give that
helpif i wasnUFFFDt vocal about my desire to help new
people before then i was now so if i have a platform at all its to
help new players this is what i want to do
what will i do if elected be a voice for those who still are learning
to speak be in a position where my help is taken more seriously
and be legitimate advocate on behalf of new players and help
make the game more easily learned show veteran players that its
not their way or the space highwaylook i know being a csm
doesnUFFFDt mean being a junior dev i know that i
canUFFFDt force changes onto ccp what i can be is be a
voice of reason when the developers are planning on or have
done something that just doesnUFFFDt work for the entire
player base having lived in every area of new eden and tried my
hand at everything and having gone through the rough self
taught method that i did i feel that i am more able to present the
ideas and frustrations that a new player might have in some
respects i still consider myself new and have so much more to
learn but at the same time i think my perspective and viewpoint is
enough in line with the alpha mindset that i can effect and
provoke a strong dialogue that is really what i want to be able to
do open the dialogue and bridge the gap between the old and
new as i am somewhere in betweenhow to contact mealthough i
have made myself very accessible there are probably a lot of
people who donUFFFDt know how to contact me and might
want to ask me questions if you want to chat or ask about my
thoughts on what i can do for you and csm reach out to me
though the following methodskaeldecadence on
twitterkaeldecadence on tweetfleet slackkael decadence0732

forumsthank you for reading my post and i wish good luck to all
of the candidates for this csm session

i thank you for your comments i am very shameful yes but i
would be a great help to the russian community also in rus rus
rmt tz i would make more whs randomly spawn so the horses
could find you
i actually smiled a little
are you saying that the goons are better then mexican or the
chinesedeletetheweak
would you like to come on the mind clash podcast to discuss your
bid for the csm
at the risk of sounding stupid i am putting this post up because i
am rather ignorant of the current issues that people want ccp to
address via the csm i took a year off and came back last may but
i spent most of that time just getting myself refamiliar with what
was changed new sov mechanics fleet doctrines and just
generally relaxing and having funso what are the big issues in all
the aspects of eve like pvp mining industry etc
greetingsi am scylus black former ceo of ccdm and former
alliance executor of templis calsf 012013102016 i represent
lowsec with a core focus on small to medium scale pvp and
faction warfare i have continually served the caldari state for 45
years and have been an active participant in lowsec life i submit
my candidacy to the csm as an effort to bring representation to
this part of eveoutlined below are some of the major points i will
be bringing to the table reaching healthy pvp balance at the solo
small and medium scale especially with relevance to lowsec
pilots citadel balance especially within faction warfare space
various fw related issues including but not limited to current
warzone control method and system flipping mechanics are long
due for a second look tendency for fw members to turn pirate
negative security status due to current plex mechanicsi believe
the points above and partnering with the others leaders in csmxii
are mutually inclusive faction warfare is often a gateway to other
areas in our beloved game as that improves so does the skillset
of those going elsewhere pvp attracted me years ago for the
engagements faction warfare attracted me for the flexibility to
login and pvp i merely needed to undock working with a cohesive
team with a faction warfare goal only improved that enjoyment
aside from the introduction of citidels there has not been a major
revamping or evolution that affected faction warfare in over 3
years i look to create awareness around the importance of the
faction warfare mechanic and how it adds value to those who are
pvp driven as well as how it compliments the lowsec lifestyle we
attract many groups pirates included into lowsec to compete
with us in pvp you can see the content in our numerous videos
we want to improve on that and the faction warfare portion while
evolving the new mechanicsi am a leader irl chief operating
officer i bring to the table a level of expertise characterized by
partnership and a cocreative relationship to get the job donei can
be reached ingame and slack scylus blacki am available for
interviews and vetting of my candidacy i will be participating in
podcasts and other mediums to give you all an opportunity to
meet mei look forward to serving the entire community and seeing
the next evolution of our gamebestscylustemplis calsf
whqtemplis calsf youtubetemplis calsf zkillboard former executor
templis calsf alliance
ive known scylus for several years now over the years ive
witnessed scylus unwavering passion for the game and
dedication to the pilots within our organization and militia at
largewhile hailing from caldari militia i know that scylus is a
professional and will take an unbiased approach to low security
space and its mechanics his motivation is to simply ensure that
future mechanics features and balance passes by ccp help or do
not harm the ecosystem within low sec for pvp and pve alikei also
believe that his high levels of dedication and passion for the game
will translate well to participation in the csm should he be elected
he wont take the commitment lightlyits time that pilots living
missioning exploring and fighting within low security space get
the representation they deserve on the the council of stellar
management and i believe scylus black would serve as an
excellent council membermember of tweetfleet stalence 
templis calsf  youtube channel
well spoken i too can attest for scylus leadership and conviction
having worked directly under him he is a man of his word and will
certainly look out for the greater good should he be chosen for the
csm its time for lowsec and especially fw to have a voice on this
panelanybody wishing to contact scylus may also reach me via in
game mail or message and i will be sure to pass it along to him via
direct channels
this man is certainly one of the top three judges i know off along
with both judy and dredd
i would like to also endorse judge every time i have poked him
with a complaint  question  suggestion he has it onboard and
either come back to me with an answer or even just a
sympathetic ear i feel that he has the best intentions and best
actions at heart for the gamei am going to ask the same
questions as i asked fawlty71 how do you feel about timezone
tanking and what can be done to address this if you think its
bad2 how do you feel about tanking til dtbest of luck with your
reelection campaign mate

in the short of it nah
thanks for the endorsement mr hyde  i think im the best fit as a
candidate if you previously voted gorski car or mr hydecontributer
to eve is easy
1 sutonia is a rare breed of eve player who shows a depth of
understanding and theory crafting when it comes to pvp and
shows an understanding of ship roles and stats that few others
can match i am very pleased to see this candidate signing up to
step in

thank you for the support
aegis sov  goals note quite reachedso aegis sov set out with the
idea that the large scale bloated renter and vassal empires were
not conducive vibrant new eden and the goal that they should be
forced apart via the stress and strain of the defense and
vulnerability mandates that the entosis and adm mechanics force
upon them however coupled with a few quality of life changes in
conjunction with ship balance updates it has instead had quite
the opposite effect  the empires have gotten larger and more
condensed with the end result being the same  most sov is
rather stagnantwhen they decided to put more anomalies in
systems and more high quality anomalies in lower trusec
systems it may have been designed with the intent to make some
space desirable as for the longest time entire regions were
considered worthless thanks to low truesec what it did at least
from my viewpoint was allow a compression of space  entities
can have much more ratting per system and support many more
players with far fewer systems on one hand this is good on the
other hand liabilities do not grow linearly as entity size does 
entities do not need to spread out as they get bigger and incur
more vulnerabilities and organizational stress basically instead of
leaning down the monolithic entities it actively allowed them
control over just as many players in a more consolidated
fashionthen they rebalanced the roqual on one hand they
needed to make it defensible enough that people in all parts of
sov space would find it usable  its use couldnt just be the
domain of incredibly large monolithic entities on the other in
doing so they created another one of these horrible problems of
scale for which they should know better slowcats are a prime
example  a handful of remote rep carriers were not a balancing
problem but 200 of them absolutely were lone rorquals are
somewhat threatened but large groups of rorquals in hardened
space are practically invulnerable topping this all off unlike
ratting anomalies where one attains the optimal iskhr by soloing
them many rorquals may comfortably share an ore site making
even easier to defend large fleets of these essentially you can
now cram more players into a sov system doing safer activities
which scale and pay better than ever before meaning the
empires footprints on the map may be shrinking but they are just
as monolithic as before if not worse aegis sov was supposed to
increase strain on larger organizations but now more than ever
they have an easier time holding even more players with fewer
liabilities mayhaps there are open spots on the map but they are
not really open in a game when numbers mean everything and
player monopolies are even more easily held
wardecs  content seeds in salted fields good mechanics are like
seeds if they are carefully nurtured by players they present an
opportunity to grow into content likewise if players see no fruitful
end they will simply discard the seed to the wind the problem
with wardecs currently can be summed up as much  both
involved parties involved in them rarely see a potential end they
would like to work for so they typically grow into nothing
everyone wants more people undocked more things to fight for
more things to get and more things to lose  every mechanic that
encourages participation is good for the gameits time to make
wardecs produce rather than stifle contentsay i belong to a
dedicated pve corp in high sec on their weekly rotation one of
the large wardec corporations wardecs my mission running corp
the best solution would be to simply drop corp until they are done
with their dec if you did rally the troops possibly even get allies
and friends to assist you possibly even hired mercenaries the
wardeccers have nothing on the table  they would just dock up
the war is unwinnable from the start because there is no way to
actually force the attacker to commit no way to actually end the
war and the attacker has nothing on the table to lose once again
i go to my starting statement  content seeds are fruitful when
both sides see an outcome they wantsay my own alliance is
wardecced maybe its any other alliance that lives in low or null
the best solution is again drop to an npc corp or use out of
alliance alts if we did bring a fleet to highsec looking for a fight
its plainly obvious we would not get one  the wardeccers would
dock up once again both parties cannot see an end they would
like to work towards in this case low or null dwellers want a fight
and most likely would not get one in the former case the hs
dwellers want to mine or mission but cannot do so and cannot
actually force a situation where they can do so again regardless
of how much they rally either way the best solution is non
participation which is a net loss for new edenthings work
differently in a different rule set even a tiny ante like a reinforced
pos or poco can spark massive conflicts in low or null and a good
deal of this is because all involved parties have something they
want out of the situation  participation is the best solution if there
was a way to force an end to the war or create real risk for blindly
deccing most of the game then more than one party may have
something they want out of the situation and participation will be
a better strategy there are a lot of proposed solutions as to the
nature and size of what wardeccers should risk to wardec
ultimately the solution must make the decced partys best solution
be participation or it is not a solution at all however the
wardeccers must realize too that people are not going to
participate unless they can actually inflict real punishment of
some sort for the inconvenience they caused  what do they have
to gain by nurturing this content seed

vic has my vote he is passionate about content
                                                                   1
current mechanics still make it easy for a much larger entity to
push a smaller one out i believe there needs to be more
defensive bonuses for alliances holding sovereignty it makes
sense that people should have to fight tooth and nail to push long
standing residents out of an area citadels are also an emerging
mechanic that has presented potential issues especially for
smaller alliances and their ability to counter them being placed by
hostiles within owned spacedo you believe longevity of a groups
existence in some area means they deserve to have advantages
to holding it beyond whats already in the game what advantages
might those be how would you ameliorate the impact of greater
numbers on a smaller entity in taking of space what increments
would they kick in at or would it be ratios also happy birthday
you get my vote the csm would benefit from having you there as
would we the players
firstly the csm is not a mechanics development group so its not
really up to themme to say this is exactly how it should be
however i will answer as best i cani do believe that the longer a
group has occupied their current space there should be some
form of extra defensiveness provided if you have spent 4 years in
an area developing it and investing isk into it then yes there
should be more options to the defenders or at least some form of
passive bonuses that accrue over time the kind of advantages i
believe would be realistic are more for mechanics related to
possible invasions such as citadels vulnerability timers being
extended on citadels that do not belong to the sov owner if it is
linked the the strategic index at the very least the buffer comes
from time of sov ownership alongside this perhaps there could be
additional levels of strategic index that go towards these bonuses
rather than adm for a systemwith the proliferation of astrahus
being dropped all over the game there is quickly becoming many
safe havens for people within space they do not own obviously
attackers need a chance at getting a foothold but the defender
should get a decent bonus to defending their own space if it were
to be some form of additional adm accrued over time then i feel a
ratio system would probably be better but that is something for
the real devs to design i simply want to push the idea that it
needs to be more geared to a defender who has been there for a
longer periodhonestly the greater numbers vs smaller numbers
is always going to be down to balancing and even then eve
players have a habit of breaking that as soon as humanly
possible i believe in giving the defender an advantage be they
big or small will help alleviate some of those issues the obvious
hurdle is to make ensure those bonuses scale well enough that
they dont make it impossible for any alliance big or small to be
removedi hope this has helped again i want to stress i dont see
csm as a game developer job its about providing feedback and
pointing out areas that we believe the playerbase desires
changes in

jonatan reed is a good man a vote for him is a vote for a greater
lowsec
keep the good work you got my voiceim third party developper i
love your database conversion if you can talk a few to improve
api for pos management or citadell management in future if they
replace moon mining pos
you have my accounts votes yet again for whatever thats worth
i have some bones to pick however regarding group industry
engineering complexes and very much agree with you around
mining changes where did you suggestion box go is it easier to
pester you on the tweetfleet slack
sorry for that short delay in getting back to you1 while mining
crystals are a complex munition they also have the simplest
targets you know which crystal you should use on which
asteroid its explicit in the names which balances out nicely it
also gives a good reason for group play with the more limited
cargo bays of the miners being supplemented by the boosters
larger general bay mining crystals can also be swapped at
willthe refining rigs on the other hand are far more limited once
installed they can only be changed by destroying them if they
were split more then youd need to have a greater number of
refineries which isnt viable2 you could expand the same
question to mordus legion i suspect the real reason is to add
terrain to nullsec so there are reasons to control certain
systems 3 im really not a fan of standings in their current form
gating content behind a grind isnt fun and jump clones hadnt
been a standing benefit for years you either just joined a jump
clone corp for a day or you had someone grind out standing in a
corp and then share it with everyone else in corp and bob
protect anyone who accidentally got standing with the donor
corphoweverwith the introduction of the mining npcs were
beginning to see where high standings have a use where they
should moderating npc behavior sure its a limited number of
corporations at the moment but long term id expect to see more
tweetfleet slacks a good place to grab me i might not respond
immediately for some reason my boss actually expects me to
work during office hours odd right but i do try to get back to
everyonedepending on the format evemail or email may work
better or if were massively off timezone
steve is good peopleoutside of the political posturing the meme
runs and the general undesirables  stands stevehes been a
pillar of the 3rd party community for years and hopefully will
continue to be so for many more cyclesthough if he can stop
running for csm so i can justify running myself  the csm

eve officially supports 5 langages and you only adress 3 of them
which is already 2 more than any other candidate and thats
nice but what is your problem with japanese and french not
valued allies enought loyal servent to mother amamake
evetetsel
took me already quite some time to get the russian translation
dmy french is a bit rusty and i dont speak japanese sadly neither
russian had to wait for the translation pi know that there are
certain groups playing eve that have issues with only having
these 5 languages available spanishportugese ppl and while id
love to have localizations available for them i strongly propose
only having english available simply because it eases
communicationand i know quite some ppl that learned english
through eve even though its not good its enough for
communication which makes me happy d
vote for me and ill forward all votes to vincent minus 5
1 articulate and a polished writer who is plugged into the wider
eve community across a number of platforms something that is
very much needed as a csm member in terms of ongoing
communication with the players as a whole
my fellow space friends i am officially running for reelection for
csm 12 it has been an adventure this year and i see no reason to
stop now for those that donUFFFDt know who i am i fly
proudly under the banner of the bastion in nullsec however i am
also well rounded flying regularly in wormhole space where i am a
director in a low class wormhole corporation that being said i am
by no means tied to these forms of gameplay as you will read
belowmy rookie year on the csm my only justification for your
votes was my professionalism and dedication to make this game
the best possible my dedication has not changed but my
experience has below i have listed some changes which i had
direct involvementmining command ship rebalance UFFFD
this was particularly special for me i felt with boosting changes
coming it was a necessity that these ships get an overhaul the
public document of my original proposal can be read here
obviously ccp did not go with all of my recommendations but a
large portion made it to the final ship versions along with additions
i didnUFFFDt think of this coupled with a roundtable gave
invaluable feedback for ccp citadel data removal on singularity
UFFFD while not quite as big an issue in kspace although
still abused this problem was a huge in wspace thankfully it has
been corrected now engineering complex revision UFFFD
during the final month i passed on numerous recommendations to
the developers which they utilized directly in their final designs as
referenced in this article production tax equation visualization
UFFFD already released on singularity and coming on
tranquility the production tax equation was a
UFFFDblackboxUFFFD of mechanics ccp thankfully
agreed and now every step is represented allowing producers to
know what is going on the entire year of csm 11 has been a team
effort but these are the elements im personally most proud of
this has been an effective cohesive csm and i would proudly give
my vote to any returning candidatesthank you for your support

the mobile scan inhibitors msi are a limited antigang deployable
structure that removes the ability for an enemy combatant to d
scan anything within a 30km range of the the inhibitor this
includes the use of combat scan probes however it itself can be
scanned down by combat probesthe problemwhile on paper this
looks like it might be a viable tool because an enemy does not
have the ability to know what might be lurking in that hole in
space practical application of this as a surprise tactic is very
limited and situational as such it is not commonly used for any
purpose including its intended one the price point seems to be
about 30 to 35mil which is too high for a mere hours functionality
second since the scan inhibitor is able to be probed down by
combat probes you need to use at least two of them to have any
reasonable chance of effectivenessi propose one of the following
solutions1 dramatically reduce the build costs of the msi so that
they cost approximately 5 to 10mil isk this would allow even one
man operations to put up at least two without impacting the users
overall profitability2 increase the deployment duration from 1
hour to 4 hours this would offset the highcost of this unit and
allow users to use them as a strategic asset3 allow them to be
picked up and redeployed a limited number of times between 35
times this limited deployment will justify useage as it will allow
the user to move it to a more suitable location in case they move
to another mission pocket another belt or another gate
minutes give us minutes
aye please giveth us minutes i hast been waiting patiently but
alas mine patience wears thin i wilt forsooth beest very depressd
if t be true thither art no minutes soon 
this was the reason i actively seperated them actually i was able
to draw things that both parties agreed on specifically that
permabumping was overall not a great mechanic and that a
timer for it would be as much as the exact time would be
debated overall a positive gameplay experience change even if
they disagreed with the philosophy behind it both sides also
understood that there was an issue with information availability
with gankers feeling that if there were more of a general
understanding of how it worked as an activity people wouldnt be
as heavily negative towards it gankees and antigankers also felt
that this information assymetry lead directly to a feeling of
dissatisfaction that also was unfairly weighted towards newer
players one specific change brought by both sides that i felt was
worth escalating to team genesis was a one time warning for
newer players undocking with a large amount of worth in assets in
a t1 industrial as its not immediately apparent that one can be
killed in hisec it would be simple to do and help prevent a lot of
bad feeling i gleaned a lot more from this but these roundtables
in general are a way of me representing the interests of people
who i think arent brought to the table effectively on the csm
especially when i see a possibility of said interests being
addressed by ccp see the pve townhall in the conclusion stages
of the shadow of the serpent event for another example of
ensuring that my own views are not unrepresentative of the
playerbase before talking directly with ccp
1 jin has embedded himself within the wider eve community on
a number of various communications platforms and is very
approachable he has proven his ability to accurately
methodically and comprehensively review and understand a
number of topics in both
wars need change
yes yes they do
i was immediately impressed with scylus ability to lead and keep
members active and keep all involved egos in check hes been a
great leader in eve and a great help with rl issues involving his
pilots hes become aware of
scylus has been a major fixture in black rise for years and i
believe that he is a clear cut choice to represent fw low sec pvp
im confident that with scylus will have nothing but positive
contributions to the improvement of low sec pvp and fw alike
itUFFFDs my absolute pleasure to recommend scylus black
for csm with the eve online communityi have been one of scylus
pilots from the time i was a fw newbro i can also safely say he is
being humble in his description of his skills setsi thoroughly enjoy
my time working with scylus and came to know him as a truly
valuable asset to templis as a whole and myself he is honest
dependable and incredibly hardworking in all aspects of eve
beyond that he is an impressive leader who is always aiming to
improve all of ushis knowledge of eve and expertise in factional
warfare is a huge advantage to our entire alliance he put this
skillset to work in order to improve ccdm templis and calmil as a
wholeoften funding projects himselfalong with his undeniable
talent scylus has always been an absolute joy to work with he is
a true team player and always manages to foster positive
discussions and bring the best out of other pilots both in fw and in
the surrounding areawithout a doubt i confidently recommend
scylus to join your csm team as a dedicated and knowledgeable
player and an allaround great person i know that he will be a
beneficial addition to your csm system and all eve playersplease
feel free to contact me ingame directly or via the gates email
system should you like to discuss scylusUFFFD qualifications
and experience further iUFFFDd be happy and proud to
expand on my recommendationbest wishescharlotte the
reverend deberryccdm director of special operations  templis
training academy instructor
in what has been close to 3 years now that ive been in fw scylus
has demonstrated himself to be among the prominent and
decisive leaders within calmil even from outside of his alliance his
actions as a leader in the calmil coalition have proven to me that
he is among the best players out there who could adequately
represent those of us in faction warfare he has my votesua

in a perfect world we wouldnt need downtime at all obviously this
would be the outcome id like to see the game move towards and
something ccp has expressed interest with in the past it is
arguably the most elegant solution to the get out of jail free
nature of downtime mechanics if you are talking about structure
more importantly sov timers that is a bit of a different issue
within the confines of the current mechanics i dont see an easy
fix but more importantly its not for the csm to find a fix csm
members point out the issue and then its on ccp to either a
agree there is a problem and think about a fix or b disagree and
take no action ive brought up the overall issue of timezone
fragmentation with ccp though so developers are aware if that
makes you feel better
the judge has been a constant and consistent force within the
csm for both productivity and also for outside communication his
attendance at meetings is an indicator of the lengths hes willing to
go and how dedicated he is to the csm i cannot recommend him
for those who look for communication and responsibility in their
csm members enough and he will be high on my ballot
csm members circlejerking npc agent tier portrait generic
19092 plateform no flavor named himself the
judgeembarassing candidacy
til speaking from experience in working with someone is circle
jerking
how do you intend to continue your work in outside
communication judgedo you have any new ideas on ways of
gathering feedback and disseminating it to ccp or do you think
the tried and true methods of townhalls threads and direct contact
workyou say the relationship is in a better place how specifically
would you use that this year if reelected to improve your
feedback could you give us a bit of an in an ideal world example
to elaborateface the enemy as a solid wall for faith is your
armor and through it the enemy will find no breach wrap your
arms around the enemy for faith is your fire and with it burn away

youve got my vote
lillik e here announcing my candidacy for csmxiiwhoive been
playing eve online since 2010 have taken several breaks then
restarted in 2013 and have continuously played since i was a
member of eve university for almost a year participating and
helping in their various UFFFDcampusesUFFFD this is
where i caught the wspace bug after a few false starts i settled
permanently in wspace living in both low and highclass
holeswhyin my almost four years playing ive noticed a
perpetual stagnation of female players whether this is caused by
lack of interest some stigma or something more basic is
unknown to me i do know this game is enjoyable on many levels
and could be enjoyed by anyone with the slightest of interestive
also noticed that there is a definite lack of female players in w
space whether by chance or by choice is also unknown as a
female gamer i dont see any space as particularly
UFFFDbetter or worseUFFFD though i have my obvious
bias howmy goals are twofoldhelp bringing more female players
to know appreciate and love all that is eve onlinehelp bringing
more new and not so new female players to know appreciate
and love wspacemy goals will include outreach and whatever
tools ccp will allow this will be determined at a later datewhats
so great about thisbringing in more players obviously that
theyre female players would be a nice balance too honestly im
not here to reinvent the wheel nor stand on some feminist soap
box this is my little way of taking a great game and making it
greaterconclusiondo i have a chance of succeeding here pretty
slim after all this is a popularity contest and im a relative
unknown but im trying anyway eve online is worth it new eden
is worth it youre all worth it lets do this update its official lillik e
is on the ballot lets bring our female friends to the awesome
world that is eve wspace awaits them

thanks for the kind words  contributer to eve is easy
some players have voiced concerns over the 40km scram range
scripted hictors being oppressive to solosmall gang pvp do you
agree how big of an issue is it how would you fix it if needed
seriously hyde useless csm member i think if you take a step
back and consider that literally a third of csm x quit boycotted
csm got removed or were implicated in some kind of scandal its
pretty insulting and petty to use me as an example of a useless
csm why dont you spend 10 minutes thinking about how useful
all the vets of csm x were who literally were so bad they
disappeared or got kicked before using me as an example of
uselessness some of them straight up went awol and left eve but
somehow im the bad guy when citadels were going to have
features that would ruin wormhole space i pushed along with
corbexx for their removal when literally nobody on csm
understood how missile damage application worked i lobbied hard
to try to bring missile guidance comps and the associated rigor
catalyst nerfs to a reasonable point when the new probing system
was being put into place i pushed back again and again and again
to get every fix possible made that wormholers and explorers
were asking for when the camera was completely screwed i sat
with ccp and jayne for several hours to walk them through
community feedback on solo fleet and videomaking issues dont
even get me started on just straight up trying to be a positive
productive member while dealing with pretty much the most toxic
csm environment of all time that stupid bracket for your own ship
was part of my ui qol agenda did i mention that i actively and
positively contributed to csm all friggin year i dont believe in
calling people out by name but there were legitimately veteran
players on csmx that didnt know how attributes affect skill point
gain meanwhile they ranted just as loud about how injectors
should work there were veterans that responded to maybe 10
of the feedback posts in confluence even on issues they in
theory knew about when we had a brandingadvertising exercise
one wellloved csm flat out refused to participate on some
unimaginable grounds but you know im the problem right
totally didnt get carried by youtube channel
hold up bois getting popcorn oh look the cat is sitting in the
litter box and pooping over the side again every time we go
through these rough patches in good humor and slight
annoyance boiglio
youre trash kid
youre all trash and the csm is a jokei am not voting for any of the
streamers and instead just not voting for anyone at all
does content creators also mean you will send some love towards
all the eve news writers out there
csm is still a thing
i am noob solo pvper who hit f1 and scram with marauder or tank
bonused ship and make dank meme videostream now im
famous now i am csm i support rhiload in the csm wars
in fact i would be interested in more information on what you
want specifically what are things you want to change what are
things you dont want to change what possible reactions do you
expect from ccp regarding these things
lets settle this the old fashion way1v1 at sun between hyde and
rhiloadjita
the salt is strong with this one
if the csm could be more about game balance rather than another
notch in your  spacefame belts thatd be great1 wont be
getting my vote
well its still quite a problem for sure
have you ever tried citra with salt
give all 4 midslot bs a 5th midrightrightmemes are love
memes are lifealso letUFFFDs not kid ourselves into thinking
that the csm is some kind of a super tryhard serious
organization i for one would welcome a candidate who could
bring some fresh airi see no reason for memes to stop
someone from running for csm do you seriously think he is going
to spam memes and play vuvuzelas during the meetings not
that it would be a bad thingalso i dare say anyone who doubts
rhiloadUFFFDs actualy ingame skill is talking out of their
arsei support rhiload in the csm wars
ayy lmao chance thinking he matters anywhere other than his
 corp and youtube subs although i recently became a
thera resident i dont think you represent my opinion nor the
opinions of anyone else other than sc0utlol as for rhiload i think
he still needs time to prove himself as a worthy csm candidate
and show that hes capable of being mature and cut the memes
yeah i thought memes are cool once too
isnt the commentating job mainly reserved for eves notable
personalities and not always indicative of a pure understanding of
the finer points of eve mechanics and balance most of the
videos are just trash memes and poorly overreaching slam
attempts at americans additionally i find it easy to just bash the
ship and its balance design for lacking a mid slot pg or maybe a
bonus as you do in 90 of video we watch that isnt filled with the
aforementioned trash memes any new bean in horde or test
could figure out whats lacking in a ship pretty quickly but it takes
a person worthy of being on the csm to note the potential draw
backs to the complex web of ship balance by simply adding a mid
slot to the punisher or buffing medium autos unfortunately i do
not believe you have shown yourself capable and as you
admitted of understanding the big and small picture of balance
and mechanics to add you say you want to help lowsec and the
little guy yet have given very little to address the issues you
would like to solve and that are at the core of your candidacy
quite frankly in my eight years of playing this game i havent
seen a candidate that i thought was more unqualified to be on the
csm than you and i was friends with darius iiithis is one
candidate i will not be voting for this year
we need fresh ideas give the kid a chance
so as someone who isnt part of one of the largest alliances out
there i should want whatgoonswarm or test or pl representing
my interestsno thanksid vote for rhiload just to get some fresh
perspective and fresh air on the csmrhiload for csm
when are you running omegawould rather the plebs seek the
true wisdom than divide themselves like this
why would you bash one of the few content creators this game
hasitUFFFDs not like someone forces you to watch those
videos if they arenUFFFDt your cup of tea itUFFFDs fine
but given the popularity he has gained apparently an
overwhelming majority of the community likes themand i see that
as a good thing not all eve videos need to be 100 percent
tryhard
another youtuber dank fresh meme
this isnt satire
well that might be the first problem you have right therethe csm is
not solely or even primarily about game balance thats merely
one of the many facets it deals with and less so recently as ccp
has been using focus groups more being an expert in the
minutiae of ship mechanics is only one potential strength for a
csm candidate there are other valid strengths for a csm
candidate and other issues the community cares about
when you cite the videos as part of your platform and experience
it makes them fair game
your entire post is hollow and empty instead of  talking rhiload
and wingspan why dont you talk substance youre inciting a
flamewar and providing nothing constructive
please rhiload balance meme in the game
csm is suppose to stop ccp from putting out crappy game
breaking features pl salt aside you dont need to be an expert on
ship balancing to be on the csm while admittedly rihloads not an
expert hes still someone whos lived in lowsec and has
knowledge of the different regions im pretty sure rihload knows
what could be bad for lowsec and what may be good for lowsec
he is truly a candidate with lowsec interest at heart
haaa funny to see how hyde torpedoed his own reelection
campaign with this thread even funnier is his argumentation that
rhiload wouldnt be able to provide serious feedback i mean you
have to actually attend meetings to give feedback wouldnt you
agree csm attendance sheetteamjintaan
you know suitonia is in cfc right nonbloc what are you
smoking hyde
uh look at the sov map fam cfc is kill
does your sov map not have delve on it
jesus we almost made it a year without drama from the csm
theres a right and a wrong way to do things when representing
the csm i think we can all agree this is not the right way
instead of blindly going for the memes 4 csm circlejerk please
try to understand what hyde wrote before saying its
unsubstantiated
got my vote
stereotyping much
dont act like people would have voted for you without your
videos youre now not the only one with a youtube channel
running for csm wingspan was a  to want to give jfs an agro
timer but you were trying to get cargo buffs for battleships youre
irrelevant
tfw people arent just voting capri  suitonia  rhiload and
instead are wholly focused on their personal favourites because
what is stv
great now i know who to cast my 4 votes for chance and rhiledit
also xenuria
i support the dawa on hyde remove remove
lmao the pl circlejerk is soooo saltyrhiload you have my vote cuz
you are so good  triggering this salty dudessrry mr hyde i
tought you were a good dude gamerelated ofc probably being
so long in contact with pls dudes made you salty bittervetthe
recent usa prooved that we the plebs are tired of you cool dudes
who are part of the establishment we want dunk memes
fck it xenuria gets my 1 vote this year
will you push for jfs to get a weapons timer upon jumping to a
cyno
i read through his post multiple times and their is very little that
could even vaguely be considered constructive or usefula he
thinks suitonia is a better smallgangsolo pvper candidate without
actually providing any evidence or arguments for itb attacks his
knowledge and experience of small gangsolo pvp because he
doesnt like rhiloads content format ie he doesnt actually say
why rhiload isnt experience or what even experience can be
based upon other than style the hydes and rhiloads videos really
arent that different he doesnt once describe what qualifies a
player as experienced at game balance c attacks wingspan for
being a useless csm member without actually describing what a
useful csm member is propel him above his station  hyde
says everything you need to know about hyde hes an egotistical
tryhard who should step off his high horse instead of talking 
about others
mr hyde i had some respect for your efforts as csm and your
vidsbut now after i read your post i must saythis is some
serious bullshit yourre affront people you dont knowmaybe
chance a bit but surely not rhiload if you are rly care for the
game you should spend your time with supporting people where
do you think could fit as future csmbut complaining about ppl you
dont even know and trying to stop their effortsis some
subhuman  this sounds not like a guy who had some progess
this year as csm to make the game better this sounds like a
bittervet and cryhard poor mrs hyde o7btw i know rhiload and
believe that hes able to do good stuff as csm
ok i was still making up my mind but this has definitely tipped it
for me voting for rhiload
and you expected thanksyou dumb choob
so far only one action has been necessary here and id like to
keep our activities in here to an absolute
minimumdisagreements arguments and everything is fine and
welcome this is a forum after all but please do so in a
meaningful manner without making a mess of things buldath
rhiload alive in serbija hyde we war you
i disagree with mr hydestreaming and public exposure of pvp and
tournaments is a growing aspect of eve online one which i think
needs more attention so in that regard as well as having an
informed opinion about smallgang balance i think rhiload has a
lot to offer as a csm member
tbh you were more of a yoloswag csm poster boy than anything
else and you were carried by your youtube subs saying that
hyde was carried was and is ridiculous seeing has his sub count
was by far lower than yours did people vote for him because he
made videos probably but i think most people voted for him
because his videos showed he had a firm grasp on how eve
mechanics worked same reason why somebody would vote for
big miker also saying you were a positive member while posting
this salty of a post kind of make that hard to believe and also why
not vote for suitonia and rhiload your allowed multiple votes for
that reason suitonia seems to have a better understanding of the
mechanics rhiload seems to have a decent more than me at
least understand of mechanics have both would be a positive in
my booksdeletetheweak
tldr most unqualified member of the current csm accuses others
of being unqualified salt ensues noobman and rhiload for csm
what when hyde is posting crap that has no evidence or
serious arguments in it that slanders chance then i think chance
has every right to defend himself id be livid if hyde posted that
load of garbage about me without actually providing some form of
substantiated argument
i dont get the vote for suitonia because only 10 ppl can get in
argumenti can just vote for suitonia and rhiloadthats rather silly
of mr hyde
believe it or not all suitonia doeshas been doing lately is solo and
before he joined goons a lot of small gangs in querios he also
has no life so im at least sure hes competentnot even close he
criticises him because he hasnt shown seriousness once its all
memes and memes thats like saying wingspans pvp vids are
the same as chessurs thinking i havent been around for csm x
to know but to be honest we dont need an argument to prove that
chance has no place on the csm i am actually not advocating
hyde because of his occasional arroganceand to keep the
narrative going tbh nor rhiload because of childish behaviour
what im trying to say is that hyde actually has a point and memes
on csm should never be a thingoh yeah and rhiload puts in voice
for content creators in his campaign how does this make sense
i just came here to say that you are all gay pwnedalso wingspan
ur  lmao
well this has turned entertainingfirst lol is hyde attacking people
because of game balance seriously hyde ccp cant balance 
and its their gamesecond lol hyde thinking csm is relevant in
anyway shape or formthird lol all the salt from pl defending hyde
being a trololololololo
hrhyde you have let me down you really just posted all that and
provide no evidence its all subjective and how would you know
who is going to be a good csm member this post certainly is
making me lean to rhiload and make me look at his platform more
seriously lastly csm seat for nonbloc members coming from
the mrhyde with the pandemic legion module maybe you say
that seriously but im not sure if i can looking at your affiliations or
past affiliations
actually hyde has been afk and has literally nothing to do with pl
other than use the ticker to trigger people
tbh im just gonna vote for capri and hope for the best
that doesnt change the fact that hyde didnt provide an argument
for why suitonia is better rhiload has done a lot of small gang and
solo  as well but somehow he isnt experienced at it what do
you mean not even close first of all seriousness does not mean
experience just because mr hyde has a stick up his ass doesnt
mean hes experienced hyde hasnt described what he means by
experience and says that rhiloads videos arent a measure of his
experience because they arent serious even if they arent a
measure of experience doesnt mean that rhiload doesnt have it
rhiload wasnt all memes at the at so he has shown that he can
give serious input if you think his input his bad then you should
provide arguments for it which hyde didnt doit really isnt i didnt
say that all pvp videos are the same but i think this point is mostly
off topic lol what you absolutely need an argument to prove that
chance has no place on the csm he has provided a bunch of
good arguments for why he was actually useful and saying hes a
bad csm member because you dont like him his content or his
corp says a lot more about you than it does himrhiloads childish
behaviour if you want to say his behaviour has been childish
then point out examples because meme videos arent exactly
mature and serious but they dont mean hes exhibiting childish
behaviour even if he was childish at some point doesnt mean he
cant be a good csm memberbelieve it or not but rhiload has
experience with content creating who would have thought so i
dont see how you think that doesnt make sense i think rhiload
could provide a more clear platform for what he thinks is
unbalancedbalanced and offer up some solutions so we can
actually judge for ourselves if he would be good at providing
criticism to ccps planned balance and gameplay changes as for
dedication i think hes shown that hes very passionate about eve
so i dont believe hell have a childish break and delete all of his
content and disappear for two weeks without a warning unlike
some csm member
still pretty hard to accept those words considering allegedly past
affiliation clearly has some use for the ticker i dont care who he
is affiliated with but its very clear they are affiliated with one of
the big blocs even in just name like i said maybe they are
serious about it but with mere affiliation it can change things or at
least my opinion
do you have anything else to say other than prove the obvious
lmao
chance has been running his mouth against hyde since the start
of hydes csm career seen here im pretty sure they both have
had a feud going on for a while now chance was the one who ran
his mouth bringing it into the csm so if you want to point fingers
on who started it first theres your blamedeletetheweak

bit rich of hyde to be criticizing others when he cant even be
bothered to attend meetings he has only attended 10 of the 42
meetings 39 if you include holidays according to
mfw when you call out rhiload for being childish and then reply
with thisare you referring to chances clearly sarcastic comment
about electing a youtuber
i find that hydes criticism of someone being useless is patently
laughable seeing as his attendance or lack thereof in the csm
was as abysmal as g dubyas during his time in office hell even
xenuria had better attendance than you id rather have someone
that is actually there listening rather than having an impotent
empty seatlook i generally like your videos hyde but its a bit of
a stretch to say you have a better understanding of mechanics
and balancing when your streams are almost always using the
blingyiest of fits thats like someone commenting on the
performance of a honda civic whom drives a ferrari 70 of the
time also sure chance isnt the best of players he never
proclaimed to be as such and he had a bad idea jf aggro i do
appreciate the issues and solutions that he brought forth if
anything i think there needs to be fewer bloc players that are
there to represent the interests of the entirety of eve rather than
being beholden to the special interests of their blocthanks for
solidifying my vote for rhiload he should hire you as his campaign
manager for how many votes you managed to flip to his side by
this tantrum of a post
so many idiots that dont understand just how important content
creators are for eve online every csm should have at least one on
the team there is no need for 100 bitter vets that dont know how
the game works much less programming but think they are cool
because they have a lot of sppeople with many many years of
playing eve have done  in the csm there is no reason to shun
someone who has 45 years hell i know players who started in
the last 12 months that know the game better than many bigshot
vets
do you actually expect me to waste my time proving that memes
arent serious im sad i cant directly call people retards on this
forum
i never said that memes are serious and your replies arent
getting anyless childish
the solosmall gang crowd are obnoxious the appeal of that
gameplay was that it was hard and took skill since the game was
not balanced with hat in mindpushing the game down a path of
solosmall gang balance will only appeal to a vast minority
completely agree though the same can be said about most
playstyles individuallypushing any path doesnt really help unless
its inclusive of all playstyles eve needs more players logging in
more often performing a blend of gameplay types that they all
enjoy and that interact with each other whether voluntarily or
notits a big universe lets fill it30000 logged in with 90 docked
doesnt help eve one bit
in this quote are the 2 reasons why i would never run for csm i
really cba any longer to respond to stupid people
1my alliance lives 2 jumps away from rhiloads hangout in low
sec often see him out solo roaming the area he is always a good
sport and actually talks to you in local after a fight or in betweeni
think your videos are hilarious and you should keep do
wow i had a lot of respect for hyde even voted for him i dont
really like sutonia or rhiload as candidates rhiloads vids are
fcking hilarious all the same but trying to sway others to not
vote for somebody else is just sad especially from someone
currently in the csm leaves a bad taste in my mouthif i still
played eve other than just skilling id be well pissed off
rhiload gets my vote just because of this
outside of all the comments around mrhyde etcrhiload your
statement is weak man there is no depth or substance that even
interests a vote your statement that working with sui would be
good worries me because with weak views and a strong
experience that sui has means 2 csm seats will be taken up when
1 seat would be adequatei think you should really focus on what
you are going to bring and how its going to affect the player base 
be specific about an area of specialism because sorry man
youtube and commentator credentials  capability
can we vote for both of them so they have to spend time together
it takes practice lots and lots of practicemmike azariah 
UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
im pretty s at the game wont lie but i feel that rhiload knows
what hes doingi think that following the rule that all good jokes
contain truth in them he probably knows whats up with major
balancing issues as such i personally dont have much
experience in pvp since im awful at the game but it seems that
there are some recurring themes that i hear in his videos that
resonate in the eve subreddit like svipuls are cancer or
balanced legion or whatever i also see his cynical approach to
ship balancing as perhaps a correct one given that he doesnt
filter what he says in any obvious way again im bad i cant
reference his statements to my own experiencesure he might not
appear to be 100 serious or extremely knowledgable but i am
sure of one thing  this guy spends a lot of time doing pvp and has
enough sense of humor to hopefully not get caught up in his own
for that hes got my vote

im capsuleer hyperflare and this is my favourite dramathread on
this forum
not empty quoting
lol mr hyde hardly even showed up and hes calling out members
who didi reckon we should strip old members if their title if they
have less than 50 attendance rateuseless prick
while rhiload may not be an expert on game mechanics to argue
that because his videos are of a comedic nature he knows nothing
about the game and to compare him to chance ravine no less is
low and simply not true hes not only demonstrated a reasonable
ability to deride the strengths of weaknesses of ships and their
fits but also a willingness to learn and improve his understanding
of the game which is more that most of the csm can say on top
of that hes proven himself to be an extremely capable small gang
and solo pilot we dont need more experts in game mechanics
and major players is massive alliances we need more of the little
guys solo players small gang pvpers industrialists high sec
pilots and people that arent from one of the games three major
coalitions for that reason hes got my vote
edit message to hydei dont know about all that  you just said
but i do know thisyou are a baby back  that whines and cries
whenever you lose a fight and completely lose your  when
you get pwnd chesseur toorhiload does not in fact the grace
andor good humor he shows in local when he loses makes him a
vote in my book and even tho i have never voted for a csm yet i
will vote against you specifically nowhave a nice day
hyde isnt running for csm xii which is good since he did frag all
besides trying to get larger cargo space for bs because you
know he hates not being able to hold enough cap boosters to
fight frigates in his vargur for less than 30 mins at a time and
there isnt anything else of note in this game that should be fixed
or improved
its interesting to see that what appears to be a legitimate
complaint albeit without much substance is dismissed as salt
and being part of eves meta game no wonder it took eight
years to fix links and the community is split on the ecm issue
i have no problem with someone like suitonia effectively
explaining deficiencies in ship balancing on a csm that also might
include rhiload explaining what features need improving to help
eve reach the broadest possible audience or the both of them
arguing in front of ccp about how to make battleships great again
the ultimate arbitrator in all such discussions is ccp who pick and
choose from what the csm is saying to inform their opinion of how
the broader player base will react to this or that game change or
new feature ccp is considering some of the subtext that
candidates need to accurately understand and explain game
balance implies that ccp doesnt and shifts in the meta or
economy and the time game designers are allowed to spend on
a given feature in the midst of other priorities at ccp also help
lead to balance problems
i didnt even know who rhiload is and i certainly dislike youtubers
too old for that  but after mr hydes comments and pl
brigading and shitting im definitely going to support him
with this thread i submit to you the player base my intent to run for
csm 12this would be my 3rd run for csm i was a member of csm
8 and csm 10 i would like to say i had complete success on both
my terms on csm but i will begrudgingly admit that i also had faults
and failures i would say this year is my chance to show that i am
still good at what i know and still have the ability to share it with
people on the csm and ccp and especially with you the players i
do not believe i deserve it just because i have been a csm before
and run a coalition i believe i should be elected for what i can
bring to the tablein game i run a moderately sized coalition called
guardians of the galaxy gotg for short we have also been
referenced in the past as dumpster co which i personally prefer
but that is just me i am ceo of darkness alliance a former
member of stain wagon and n3 coalition i am famous for
speaking my mind and not always being totally diplomatic i am
also famous or infamous for being a backstabber i gave up not
long ago trying to defend this because i came to the realisation
that if that is how people see me then they are welcome to their
opinions i can be abrasive but to people in my coalition i am
known to be open to talking to if and when needed on discord i
run a server called the blue donut in this server is content
creators and fcUFFFDs and some leaders from all round the
game i have spent a lot of the time in there to help connect both
current csmers and past csmers with a voice direct to leaders and
fcs in this game during csm 10 i submitted 10s of pages of
information direct from these people straight to ccp i would intend
to do this again should i be reelected should i not be elected i will
still aim to provide this same source of information and
communication with whomever the player base electswhat i
stand for and what i believe ini am a strong advocate for 00 but
during my time i have tried nearly everything there is in eve
online mostly to success and some to horrible failures i am a
fierce advocate of new players entering the game and our closest
ally is pandemic horde the biggest new player alliance in the
game a lot of people have asked why gotg or darkness does not
run an alpha or newbro program and the answer is in 2 parts 1
because we would be  at it 2 because we would prefer to
send people to an ally and or someone who knows what they are
doing than risk hurting them and running them from the gamemy
platformafter 3 years i am going to say the same thing i did on
the last forum thread like this i run on a platform of listening i
want to work with ccp to point out possible conflict points but also
to provide answers and help towards bettering the game as a
whole i do not run to better myself i have been at the top and
bottom of this game i am using this time to give back to the player
baseme as a personin my personal life i am married to a
beautiful wife and have recently become a father to a beautiful
baby boy i have frequented multiple player meets and gotten to
know hundreds of players and families of players i may be
considered by some to be an  in eve but when you get to
know me its known i donUFFFDt actually bite i am more of a
huggerthis year is going to be a hard fought election i hope you
consider me for the post thank you for reading

i debated on making this post as im not sure if it was worth my
time but anyways here goesi wanted to clear up a couple of
points you bring up and hand wave because theyre telling about
you as a leader and have weight on whether or not youd be an
effective csm this may come off as a personal attack and ill try to
steer clear of that i think however its important for people to hear
from the other side as someone whos watched you closely in
your various leadership positions youve had over the yearsfirst
you bring up being a backstabber or being known as one i dont
believe this to be true what is true is that youre erratic there is
little consistency in your behavior and it takes very little for
someone go to from friend to enemy people see this as being a
backstabber but i think the actual issue is that you have no
internal consistency in your actions and simply react to whatever
situation is in front of you without much forethoughtyou bring up
being abrasive this is true but this is also true of almost
everyone the issue is however that you dont apologize for your
abrasiveness when given the opportunity to do so when youre in
the wrong running independent communication streams you
have what at this point a dozen maybe more channels that
youre part of between skype discord and others this doesnt help
your erratic nature and as a coalition leader youve become
increasingly isolated these places are fine to have but
segregating yourself in them and them being echo chambers
speaks poorly for your leadership capabilities rl you is a nice
enough guy though the couple times weve met and best wishes
to you and the family
hurray for boss dude 1
vic jefferson is the man for the job lets make eve great again

interesting ideas and proposals but i have a few honest
questionswhat constituency really are you representing what
kinds of players are you looking to speak on behalf of and how do
you intend to gather feedback from them to go on to present to
ccp i feel like youre trying to appeal to a broad base of players
and putting up your ideas and credentials without actually telling
us how you intend to act as a representativeare you aware that
the csm is not entirely an ideas machine with csm people able to
get an agenda filled are you prepared to accept that its going to
be a lot of this is our idea what do you think and having to build
working relationships with specific devs and teams you could
table all of these ideas and proposals on day 1 what are you
aiming to do with the rest of the yeari like your way of thinking
and your ideas for the game but having spoken a lot to some
former and current csm members about what the job actually
entails i fear you might not be doing the job vague as a csms
role can be these days justice and how youll respond to the
needs of those who vote for you if you were running for a dev
job yeah id swing you a vote but youre running for basically a
consultancy jobi want to know how you actually intend to canvass
feedback from us on specific areas of the game over the course
of an entire yearface the enemy as a solid wall for faith is your
armor and through it the enemy will find no breach wrap your
arms around the enemy for faith is your fire and with it burn away
his evil

steve should be a shooin but there are no certainties until after
the votes are counted put him on your top 3 or do like i will and
1him on all your accounts
3
gets my vote guy with strong vision and even better track history
of delivery1
ima type out a better spag bol recipe for you
what would you say went right this year and what went wrong
similar to thejudge how do you intend to improve representation
and communication better if youre reelected do you feel it
doesnt need improvementface the enemy as a solid wall for
faith is your armor and through it the enemy will find no breach
wrap your arms around the enemy for faith is your fire and with it
burn away his evil
steve will always get my vote 1 for steve
representation is a hard thing to improve i mean i try to represent
the people who contact me and i try to keep up to date with the
issues people talk about in places i see it the forums reddit
slack twitter and so on but if youre meaning people who dont
contact me thats not something i can really docommunication
other than through the aforementioned places well again its
hard to improve i could write more blog posts but other than
that theres not a lot i can do i like to think im easily
approachable and i do take things to ccp as i see them in
general this year has been a lot better than 10 was part of that
has been having two coordinators rather than just one and ccp
moving more communications to hipchat has helped a lot 10 got
hit by the migration phase and communication suffered because
of thatas for things which went wrong there was very little with
the process itself theres some changes id have liked to have
seen earlier in the process so more shaping input could have
been given but were talking perfect world there
i dont know steve not sure i want tohowever that saidfuzzworks
saves me years of indy work life and helps pass endless hours at
workand those market charts are amazingyou sir have my
votethat is allcarry on
can confirm he is super nice irl too
1 figuring out what the best form of mass advertising is for the
current perspective new gamer base retaining is a mixed bag of
continuing to improve the npe for getting started and making sure
they are aware of the tools to find player run organizations 2
providing payouts early on that allow such activities currently due
to the imbalance of faucets and sinks early access to income is
horribly handicapped for starting players short of finding someone
else to help boost them up 3 i dont necessarily think that
everyone should be forced into nulllowwh as there are people
who ive met who literally just arent comparable with these
forms of gameplay short of extreme handholding it might be worth
exploring how to convey the possibilities of this space more to
newer players 4 giving them something different than the every
day grind right now the pve is repetitive as  and is purely done
for isk making purposes there will always be some people who
literally want nothing more than to plex up for a big fight and then
do nothing but there are people who want to log in and just have
different things to do than the same thing theyve been doing for
the better part of a decade
appreciate the responses thanks
anytime
1 to any combination of the following vince the horse for
csm riding
that was borrowing without the intention of returning intact
you list your strengths in the game knowledge and that you have
a lot of ideas but similar to other posts ive made to candidates
are you aware the csm is not strictly an ideas machinewhat
would be the one thing you think you can do better then the last
csm to represent your voters if electedhow do you intend to
gather feedback and report to ccpwould you be willingable to
take up extra work in the vein of consistent reporting to the
community on yourscsms activities as allowed by the ndaface
the enemy as a solid wall for faith is your armor and through it

hello space capsuleersmy name is jtclone ares i am the ceo of
strangers of the cosmos i have been playing eve for a little over 3
years i have had my fair share of risk vs reward most people
know me to be a bit on the side of short and sweet i get to the
point then the details later i spent 2 years in hs and now most of
my time in 00 industry mining and bit of pvp on the sidethe
reason why i am running for csm 12 is i decided to see if i can
make some stuff happen between the community as well as the
developersccp i do have plans to put ideas across the table as
well as fixes to the gameie bugs i do want to help create
content for players who play evethe things i would put forth are
skins  custom alliance logo or full ship skins  custom at skins 
citadel skins for those who just wanna show off  skins for the t3
outposts to become destructible citadel deterioration over a long
period of time easier way to make bug fixing easy for ccp to find
and fix new addition of t2 battlecruiser  name them assault or
siege bc  naga tornado oracle talos t2 battleships  rokh
abaddon maelstrom hyperion  new usage for using subcaps to
help put more dps against sub caps as well as capitalships
mining platform arrays  ideas for having moon control to planet
control to a system wide control of moon goo installation of
player owned stargate and how they should work  sov rework on
jump bridges possible introduction to a capsuleer faction ship
tree ranging from frigates up to capital ships  overpowered but
hard to find and get or usage through npc missions available in
citadels help increase the ideas of npc missions or corp
missions for lp that is available through citadel access  having
lvl 5 missions available in 00 factionnavy pirate or corp fix
ships that arent being used much often anymore  rebalance of
the dreads  ships that are least usedbring the least used ships
up to the main bigger ships revamp them back up new support
capital ships which main usage is ewar  high ewar strength
barely any dps and heavy usage for support fighterssome of
these ideas have been brought up before hand but i do want to
help increase the stability as well as increase the player flow into
eve i do like to tackle the big issues as well as listen to both the
smaller guy as well as the bigger guy look for the problems and
see how many solutions can come up with in order to fix some of
the basic or complex issues when they arise i do want to bring
these ideas up and get ccp going on increasing player ship
diversity as well as increasing the boundaries for the players
these are just some of the ideas i have at this timecontact

hello capsuleers of new edeni am djavin novienta member of eve
university and i would like to announce my candidacy for csm
xiimyselfi first began my career as a capsuleer in 2011 and
quickly found a home in a small highsec corporation eve was my
first foray into online gaming and it has always occupied a
special place in my heart after piloting for about two years i took
a long break from my piloting careeri came back to eve
september 2016 and immediately joined eve university the game
had changed a lot in the time iUFFFDd been gone and i felt a
little lost and in need of some help iUFFFDve since gotten
back on track and now spend the majority of my time helping
other unistas begin successful careers in new edenif you look up
my character info ingame youUFFFDll see that i carry the
vanity title of UFFFDcariest of bearsUFFFD i received
this title at my own request and it is one that i wear with pride
iUFFFDm not a competitive person and i donUFFFDt
particularly enjoy pvp when iUFFFDm in space you can find
me either mining missioning running incursions or exploring
however most of my time is spent on various support roles within
eve university teacher reimbursement officer orientation officer
and wiki curator i have taken on these many administrative tasks
for two reasons first to contribute the community in a way that
does not involve combat and second because i honestly love it
iUFFFDve found that in eve administration is my gameplay
and i truly enjoy teaching classes editing the uniwiki and helping
manage our ship replacement programmy goalscontinued
expansion and refinement of the new player experience and other
tutorial contentwith the release of ascension it has become even
more important to ensure that eve is accessible to new players as
an orientation officer at eve university iUFFFDve seen
firsthand the positive impact that the inception npe has had on
new players but i think there is a significant amount of room to
improve even furthera few things things that can be
doneestablish a list of essential knowledge for new players this
list should answer the question UFFFDwhat should all
players in eve know or know how to do and where can they go
with itUFFFD any future tutorial content should be centered
around imparting knowledge from this listmake more information
readily available ingame with the removal of the ingame
browser most information about eve is no longer accessible in
game and requires opening a separate browser window
additionally now that playerrun sites such as the uniwiki or the
fuzzwork suite of tools have become the primary source of
information about the game there is greater cause for concern
that information found on such sites may not be accurate or upto
date for example i can say from experience that the wiki curators
are still scrambling to scrub all mentions of warfare links and off
grid boosting from the uniwiki even three months postascension
there is very little means of verifying information on external sites
other than going into the game and verifying it for yourself some
ideasoptions that can be implemented additionalexpanded
tooltips UFFFDactive helpUFFFD popups perhaps
similar to those utilized by games such as final fantasy xiv these
could appear upon first exposure to different game mechanics
such as agents low or nullsec incursions etc distinction
between base ship  module stats and bonuses or effects from
skillsa renewed focus on pve content both reworking existing
content and adding new contentnpc mining operations were a
welcome addition to the vast array of pve content that eve has to
offer unfortunately the majority of the pve content ingame has
existed in its current state since its original implementation there
are many ways that this area of eveUFFFDs available
activities can be improved but here are a few specific ideas
implement opportunities for solo player participation in incursions
options include reducing the strength of incursion rats to make
them challenging but soloable with proper preparation perhaps
weakest in scout systems strongest in headquarters and
implementing solo combat sites as cosmic anomalies andor
signatures increase the drop rate of faction tags and make data
center missions repeatable andor allow players to turn in tags to
any corporation for a standing increase particularly useful for
trader characters with plenty of isk but few combat skills rework
cosmos missions and increase the stats of storyline modules to
match the difficulty and cost of producing them add security
missions with diverse win conditions currently security missions
are based entirely around combat and the only thing needed to
complete them is a sufficient tank and passable dps different win
conditions such as providing reps for a besieged freighter or
tackling a battleship so npc allies can destroy it could encourage
mission runners to maintain a number of different ships and
reward them for training a diverse skillset
reinforce the idea of new eden as a living world and smoothly
integrate eve lore into everyday gameplaywhile the lore of eve is
substantial and generally available to anyone interested in it most
of that lore is completely separate from gameplay in some
egregious cases that lore is even directly contradicted in
gameplay see any reference to a UFFFDconsoleUFFFD
while piloting a ship on the large scale more frequent ingame
events in the vein of crimson harvest and purity of the throne can
be used to signal changes in new eden on the small scale the
UFFFDlittle touchesUFFFD can subtly reinforce the idea
amongst players that new eden is a living and dynamic universe
some ideas to be implemented npc
UFFFDbestiaryUFFFD having a little more information
about who youUFFFDre fighting can be both interesting and
provide a method of teaching new players about enemy
resistances and weapons allow enemies to be more than just
enemy pilot 728 unless youUFFFDre fighting
sanshaUFFFDs nation that is unlockable journal entries for
expeditions and complexes epic arcs already have a whole
journal section devoted to recounting their lore expeditions
already tell a story adding that story to the journal would give
them more impact and make players want to run them again to

i recently had a wonderful interview with matterall of talking in
stations please do check it out here
lore really needs to play a more active role in the game it needs
to be reflected on more in the mechanics and npcs need to be
more than simple ratting victims both in high sec and null a lot of
people seem to dismiss lores importance in eve but i feel like
immersion is a vital part of making this game fun not only that
but its a lot easier for newer players to get intoyoull probably get
a vote from me simply because no one else is really pushing for
these things as much instead of vague discussions of balancing
game mechanics i think simple touches like these are what eve
really needs right now to become more appealing to a new player
base which lets be honest we need more of
aram has proved me more than once that he is a man of his word
but thats not why he has my vote he has my vote because i truly
believe that his wisdom will lead us and ccp to new heights made

remember the live incursion events whose were great and got a

just a small note which really should be made on all csm
candidacies such as thisthe csm can propose stuff yes the
chance of getting ccp to work on something you proposed unless
its trivial is close to zero they have limited development
resources like anywhere and thus prioritize if theyre working in
an area anyway thats when you can help shape it but getting
something looked at which isnt already on the roadmap is few
and far between
the absurdity of the csm council in a nutshell stop being this
arrogant btwdont listen this disillusioned man godspeed

erebus thechin sundancethank you very much for showing

give you everything but rather make you tempted to pay and
play the better versionin that regard they give you a taste of
drones but not all the flavoursm

years to come i dont have a platform or a set of objectives that
must be fulfilled i dont have any illusions as to my ability to force

csm campaign interview with matterall on talking in stations
youtube linkmessage to the gamermy name is justin weve
probably never met but that wont stop me from saying hello  i
began playing eve in december of 2007 from 2008 to december
2009 i derped around as a super bad noob before joining a
wonderful group of eutz guys that stayed up way too late and
taught me a lot we began participating in the sov wars out in
provi bloc as a member of the now dead slyph alliance after sylph
died my friends created an alternate group for mercenary work
and hisec war deccing contracts we received several lucrative
contracts from both friends and enemies of our former alliance
we also roamed through low sec and null looking for brawls and
occasionally ran hisec pve missions with new bros we were part
of the initial wave of wormhole divers during their inception
though i was unable to accomplish much as i began attending
college in the fall of 2009 i returned to eve full time in 2013 and
picked back up with some of my old friends from slyph now part
of the kill it with fire alliance and operating out of c5c5 spacei
joined prozc and got back into the swing of pvp roaming with our
allied corporations ekchuah and hardknocks from 2013 to now i
have experiencing various aspects of eves pvp and pve
environment from blops drops to cap warfare to the mo keepstar
battle i have participated in npsi fleets with bombers bar and
specter fleet i have gone on week long solo camping trips in the
depths of jspace and i have learned to once again despise the
long grind of l4 mission running i have played the station trading
games running the markets and looking for the low buys and hi
sells i have also gone through hq and vanguard incursion fleets
and seen the amazing fluidity of a well ordered and well
commanded fleet i love eve and its many fascinating areas of
play there are boundless ways we can improve upon and change
this game for the better or for worse i would like to represent the
interests of the community as it grows and encourage changes
that will improve upon the growth and strength of the player base
i am willing to listen to and hear what you have to say regarding
anything that is on your mind when it comes to eve feel free to
message me any time in game or out of it you can reach me at
claevyan1gmailcom or message claevyan in game you can
also fill out this awesome survey thing that google helped me
make trolls encouraged

your commitment to eve and the csm last year has been
exemplary i shall be voting for you again plus you have a giant
america flag hanging on your wall so thats a major 10
i fully endorse what is currently considered to be the high sec
ticket when you vote for me down the ticket also vote for toxic
yaken and roedyn this will help insure at least one high sec
candidate make it on the csm
any industry related questions or conserns
scylus is clearly the person who can best push for changes that
would benefit the whole faction war community
hi lilikits good to see another wspace candidatei will note that
im not sure you have a solid grip on the number of women
players in wspace nor the ability to estimate the population over
time and ultimately i dont think it matters women men
unicorns  who cares as long as we have people who enjoy the
game and contribute to new eden in some fashion eve will be
fine while getting more people into the game is key choosing to
focus on women is too thin a platform and will set you up to be
easily dismissed surely there are wormhole centric issues on
which to build a platform yes or to focus on specific aspects of
the game which can be intimidating or confusing to new players
i wish you the best of luck
lovelyi would make all csm woman onlygood looking one if
possible youll see then how the number of players will grow
esponentiallynever understimate a woman and her power boiz
specially on nerds
anyone who has questions fire away
what do you think is the current state of wormhole space
overall and do you think that is good or notwhat do you think
needs to happen to wormholes to improve the current state
overall not just high or low class but overal please restrict your
anwser to one item only that you think will make the biggest
improvement
dear jonnit would be nice if youd inform the public of your
attempts to remove keepstars from wormhole space while trying
to keep it under wraps because youre afraid the groups who
have them will try to come after you i mean aside of your entire
campaign its not befitting a csm member that we should vote for
to push an agenda that is both hidden and aimed at crippling
large organisations like hklzhxinnerhelli am well aware that
other csms do the same but that doesnt excuse you to do it as
well
now would be the time to complain about fake news and state
alternative facts jonn
let me be ahead of jonn then and post this
jonnim confused based on the first post in this thread it seems
youre interested in running for csm to represent those of us in
wormhole space however this information seems contrary to
your purposedoes your platform for csm include removing
keepstars from wspace if so what conversations have you
had with wspace dwellers to help you create this decision
thanks
hi everyone im white 0rchid and im happy to announce i will be
running for csmwho am iive played eve on and off since 2008
in the latest on period ive been subbed for just over 2 yearsa
brief timeline and run down of my experiences in eve 2008 omen
incorporated part of brutally clever alliance  living in sovnull pre
aegis fountain these guys helped me get off my feet when i first
started and without them id most likely have quit soon after

fleet pvp logisticsjfs we are a nomadic group who deploy where
the content is ive recently been appointed a director most of my
time spent playing eve is focused on pvp in any one week the
situations i find myself in can range from solo t1 destroyer
roaming to 200 fleet fights with caps on field you can check this
on my zkill i am a regular player and not afk by any meansive
also written various third party webapps that make use of ccps
apis im a consultantsoftware developer in the real world and
enjoy a problemwhy run for csmfeedback between players and
devs is critical to the games successful evolution i believe i am
the type of person who would do well in such a rolewhile i dont
think having a single agenda is ideal one aspect id like to tackle
is lowsec more so i feel it should have reward equal to its risk at
the time of preparing this each of the top 10 most active pvp
lowsec systems 24hr have either higher or equal pvp activity to
their nullsec counterpart taking into consideration there are 4
times as many null systems as there are low thats a lot of activity
packed into a small area of space which makes it dangerous the
rewards for living there however are not particularly
fantasticthere are several other issues that i believe also need
attention from ccp if they are not already looking at them session
change timers  jump clone irks certain aspects of citadels
courier contracts broken tethers set and forget mentality  space
is getting crowded customer support for hacked accounts to
name a fewdue to my varied history and diverse experience in
game i feel i would be able to contribute to almost any
discussions that arise and need inputtldr i want to get things
done because i love this game and the people in it im not in it for
the space fameif you want to chat feel free to hit me up
tweetfleet slack white0rchidin game white 0rchid  its a zero
not a letter twitter white0rchidevethanks0rchid o7

reserved because everyone else seems to be doing that
we are happy to announce that white 0rchid is sniggwaffe
waffles official csm xii candidate he is smart openminded and
ready to listen to anyone who has a good idea his experience as
a hr officer and later director in sniggwaffe one of the most active
corps in game will surely help him in his gods work as csm
representing the voice of the lowsec people who seems to be
forgotten by ccpa vote for white 0rchid is a vote for making low
sec great again
what are your attentions with my daughter eve
super excited you chose to run whitesince i joined waffles a
couple months white has been a constant aid and source of
knowledge when it comes to lowsec he is always easy to reach
and happy to answer any questions mlsga
lelcheck your stationedit hes actually a chill reasonable guy
hes a dirty ewwuro but hes a good man what i actually enjoy
are candidates that are capable and willing to learn more about
eve when you recognize that you dont know everything you
spend less time chest beating and more time learning from others
and how to effectively solve problems or present new ideas
coupled with the fact that he actually has solid knowledge and
experience in eve i think hed do a solid job to mega
i am happy white 0rchid is running for csm he is a good man with
enormous knowledge about lowsec and game in general i know
he is going to do proper job in csm
two lowsec candidates one pirate and one from faction warfare
is this real life white 0rchid what are some ways you think you
can connect the nonfaction warfare lowsec players pvpers and
pvers with ccp what do you feel the major obstacles are
towards again not faction warfare lowsec and what is memes
aside the best way to make lowsec great again meaning what
has been overlooked by ccp that you feel needs another look or at
least brought to ccps attention
if you want an idea you can peruse my thread
1 for whitemlsga
you go white we are with you mate
good man 1
what do you like on top of your pancakes
i think its an issue and its really hurt solosmall gang roaming in
nullsec its killed a lot of affordable kiting cruisers and pigeon
holed a lot of people into going 100mn ab or bust my preferred
solution would be to introduce a new script for hics that has 40
of the current range and attach the scramming effect to that
script focused warp disruption script  infipoint stops capitals
from jumping same range as currentfocused warp scrambler
script  infipoint scram effect  above this would be a 15km
scram on t2 and a 1575km scram for tsconcord hic scrams for
reference this is better than heated true sansha scram on any
nonbonused hull i also think that the value of a highslot
scrambler has been completely ignored with the balance of the
scram effect on hics it essentially was an extra midslot on a lot of
hics that were running a scrambler anyway i think this is good
enough for a hic to do mjfg defence without making it as
cancerous for gatecamping or antikiting as it is nowcontributer to
eve is easy

do you have any plansideas on the navy caracle naga and
rohk personally curious on those all three of them seem to be
overshadowed by similar counter parts and dont have a role to
filldeletetheweak
a vote for suitonia is a vote for eveaside thatthis is the man for
csm xii a top tier choice indeed if ive ever seen one
you already have my vote based on the amount knowledge you
have shown in your videosi am curious however on your
thoughts related to the lack of ns wormholes after the change a
couple of years ago i am hoping more candidates will push to
increase content holes wh groups like to do small gang ns roams
as well
i am sorry but isnt your fame mostly from vids man
flying a blinged out marauder in militia space against t1 destroyers
and cruisers mostly
i very clearly recall chances strong involvement on both these
points
ive lost all respect for hyde as a result of his posts in this thread
sad to see that happen as one of my favourite youtubersbut you
went full kanye man never go full kanye
probably the best way of putting it
disregarding drama rhiload how do you plan on pushing for
better lowsec changes you said you are running as a lowsec
csm but apart from that you havent said much else what
concrete suggestions can you offer what do you feel needs to
change for lowsec to become more populated outside of the fw
systems you also said you are a csm for content creators that
word phrase gets used a lot are you refering to just video
creation how do you plan on making that better for the
community or did you mean content creation in general
deletetheweak
im gonna let you finish but suitonia has the dankest mechanics
knowledge of any of these fools  mr hyde
lol this hyde guy has never even won an atrhiload on the other
hand has won 16 of themgit gud
the pl salt was real eh bois amirite amirite wew lad wew lad
now i know who not to vote for cya hyde
who
the pl propaganda parade is strong in this threadwhile i do think
suitonia would be the stronger candidate there is more than 1
spot thankfully and as of right now i think both him and rhiload
will get my votei will not be voting based on the pl shills in here
trying to further their own agenda yes i know suitonia is officially
nullbloc with the goons but as he hops around and focuses on
small gang i will trust him with my votewish there was more wh
choice
ya man the popcorn was a little too saltyoh look the cat is
sitting in the litter box and pooping over the side again every time
we go through these rough patches in good humor and slight
annoyance boiglio
as an equally useless youtuber for the spaceship massively
multiplayer online role playing game eve online i feel compelled
to chime in with a hot takejust because you bumble around with
a face cam optional a microphone video editing software and
use the ever so complicated upload file function on youtube
youre not necessarily the most ideal person to have on a 10
person council that talks about game balance design and the
other assorted topics ccp throw at the csm you tend to need
more going for you than that and yet you somehow couldnt
convince ccp that keepstars in wh space was a hilariously dumb
ideathinking
whoever you are mrhyde go back to your abyss delusional
demon
rhiload gets my vote for provoking this very entertaining fall from
grace
that better be a different abyss then the one you sent me to in
whats his names threadmmike azariah UFEFF
UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
all of you are getting rused hyde is just setting riload up for
success
rhiload can you tell us what is happening in your side of
lowsecnullsec maybe even hisec any glaring stuff that needs
attention can you site a common grievance of lowsecnullsec
residents that you wanna tacklewhats your standideas on npsi
fleetshyde csm attendanceive read a post down at reve
claiming that he still goes to school and the meeting times just
doesnt agree with rl again thats the claim which doesnt
negate the fact of his attendance

go back to your twitter page and quit that m thing
hello all now that the nuclear fallout has cleared i will be
addressing peoples concerns and questions in a video hopefully
to be released within the next 2 weeks hope to see you all there

why do you feel lowsec needs a changeits got the best pve top
kek wow 610s and faction warfare level 5 its got all the top tier
pvp all the way from solo 1v1 frigates to 20vs80 fights where the
80 is 15 logi and 65 sleipnirs 3most of it is populatedwhereas
nullsecs barer than a desert in the middle of dry monsoon
seasonconvince me 
the gravest of mistakes are made with a serious facei dont get
your issue here tbh its very easy to see past rhiloads jests for an
actual message he conveys you may criticise say the depth of
his understanding of the issues he talks about but you choose
not to for the record im nobody to make such claims but this
thread has a number of examples of attacking his actual points
properly and you did not contribute to that numberwere giving
an evaluation here obviousness is not something you can appeal
to in this casemore on topic im not someone who believes that
csm candidacy platform is a primary thing and i dont think that
csm members own ideas on changes really matter however it
would help if op told us a bit more on the matter of his plans for
csm in detail as i understand it ccp tend to discuss a variety of
topics with csm and apparently an external media can very well
become a topic of conversationto me its a bit difficult to see what
ccp options on that front are what would you support or advise
against what would you discuss with community members when
it comes to this topic what sorts of opinions are to be collected
just about everyone i talked to in my little group last night was
unaware of who rhiload was before hyde did thissomeone do me
a favor and please pass this along to mr hyde
tfw muricans take more seriously the election for cms than their
presidents election lmao lets dig in in the matter option 1  mr
hyde found rhiload with his mom last night and got mad option
2  rhiload raped him in a 1vs1 in battleships and didnt write gf in
localoption 3  its all a cospiracy mr hyde playing mindgames
with all of us think carefully what you would do if someone tells
you to not vote someone else being salty etc wouldnt it let
rise some suspects in you you would probably ending to vote for
that person on the election dayso basically mr hyde is a true
follower of rhiloadmindgamespart2  what would happen if
everybody on the election day think that everybody else will vote
for rhiload following the same reasons  and decide to vote for
someone else with the excuse the others will vote for him
anyway mindgames boiz ps never let muricans vote
again pls pjsalt
i dont know what the cms is but i do know youre an idiot
im all for giving some new blood a chance but you have never
really shown us a serious side and i will not support some random
youtube memer for csm i also dont want to just judge you based
on your youtube without giving you a chance to show your serious
side i think the best way to do this would be to start actually
talking about issues and solutions that you are passionate about
in the game a csm member needs to be passionate and willing to
fight and debate to have their ideas considered by ccp from what
i understand what are you passionate about changing or fixing in
eve onlineadditionally i have a few more questions that focus on
lowsec since you say that is your main area of focus within the
campaign how do you feel about the current state of lowsec pvp
is there anything in terms of balance that sticks out at you as
being an issue if so how would you propose fixing the problem
how do you feel about the state of t3ds after the latest balancing
that occurred in the last couple months do you think it was
enough to bring them down a bit to balance the ship meta what
is your opinion on how citadels are impacting lowsec groups do
you feel they are creating more content being spammed too
much or are they causing any other issues from a lowsec
perspective
fallout indeedlook forward to the video what are your thoughts
on jump fatigue does it need to be reworked for ships like black
ops or jump bridges or do you think its working as intendedin
addition are you satisfied with the implementation of the new
structures thus far or are there significant features you would like
to see changed or rebalanced
ive heard words of approval about your campaign from most of
my small gang friends but your platform appears pretty weaknon
existent here are some questions what do you identify as the
biggest hurdles getting in the way of content creation in eve
there are many avenues of pvp in lowsec that can be as different
from each other as night and day from faction warfare to fights
over moons to piracy to other objectiveless small gangfleet pvp
which of these do you specifically care the most about what do
you think about the current state of pvp within your defined
interests what do you identify as the currently biggest balancing
issues in the game and how do you propose they get fixed
can everyone just cut the chit chat ahole self righteous bullcrap 
first off i dont like chance ravinne either but i do respect his work
as a content creator and i respect his work for the csmsecond
mr hyde i respect you as a content creator and i think youve
done amazing things for this communituy but maybe you should
keep your mouth shut i like trolling csm members just like
everyone else but there is a difference between calling people out
and poking them a littleyoull never be alone you got gremlins
rhiload has my vote because he makes me wee every time i
watch one of his videos and because hyde doesnt want me to
vote for him
i intend to speak for all players for there is a good chance that am
playing or have played your game your eve maybe it is a little
vague and handwavy you would be correct about that i think i
have been pretty straight forward  i am largely agnostic to what
space you call home what activities you call fun whatever those
are i aim to demonstrate only that i have a good understanding of
those things what makes players tick what makes the game
interesting to them and why they log in therefore i would be able
to provide a good sounding board as to the merits and hazards of
a particular change having both the experience and the
knowledge on a broad range of topics within eve yes i have no
agenda  i accept that the csm exists to as a feedback
mechanism i have no issues working with many people in a
professional context  everyone is on the same team we all aim
to make new eden better whatever the topic whatever the
issues i am signing up to be useful to ccp not to make ccp useful
to my alliance or play style specifically everyone has gaps in their
knowledge but hopefully i have convinced some readers that
although i certainly have some knowledge gaps if ccp should ask
for feedback i am able to evaluate and think critically about what
the proposed changes would impact it comes down to do you
trust me to have good enough insight into the game itself that you
would want me to have a special spot in providing the first wave
of feedbackfirst i play this game as in actually logged in in
excess of 5 hours a day during that time i am in contact with
players from all sorts of play styles i am a regular poster on the
eveo forums but these have rapidly fallen out of favor with the
player base for various reasons which has left the collective
feedback rather scattered across the internet i would be game to
start a blog or open another avenue for more regular
communication if that is what players want it should be obvious i
am not shy about writing lots and i enjoy interacting and
discussing all aspects of this fine game what avenue do you
think is best
im primarily a hs player ive used the wardec mechanic for four
years i am both biased and well versed of the mechanic and how
it works not as much as some other like lord raz vimsy and
others but enough to make educated opinions on the matter i
also dabble in small gang and solo on this character and my
alts stifle what content they do not stifle content they stop the
content of pveers not content in general and to be perfectly
honest not everybody wants what you describe most highsec
pve alliance and i mean true hs pve alliance not a pve corp
inside a lowsec alliance want to be left alone most pveers are
pveers and do not like pvp interaction so what you get is two
conflicting systems one which wants to fight and win and other
which wants to be ignored this interaction obviously doesnt mix
well this is for a random dec primarily because the
wardecermerc take losses very very seriously to the people
where if one ship is lost during a wardec it generally means that
the other side has dealt a very healthy blow a wardecers aim in a
dec is a perfect ratio in their favor contracts with mercenaries are
different story vairable by what the contact demands also wars
against merc corps are winnable you force them to stay docked
you not only block them from killing you you block them from
killing everyone else as well if an alliance has 100 wars and you
keep them docked in station you suddenly make all that isk
invested into wars wasted wardecs do not have predefined
objectives it is up to the parties involved to define their own
objectives in a random dec meant purely for killing a
wardeccers object is simple kill and dont be killed by defining
them that simple outcome you technically win even if you lose a
few ships you killed one of them which hurts them a lot more
than most people understand as i said above if you plainly show
your fleet to the enemy and the enemy can see he will not win he
will not fight same goes for everywhere in space blue balling is a
thing everywhere as do fights in highsec ive gotten in plenty of
fights three i can link videos of over poses herehereand here
we both can agree that wardecs and highsec in general is stale
and needs refreshing i know and like the idea of structure based
war in highsec but i do not like the overall tone of your post
making it seem like the defending corps are completely
helplessdeletetheweak

i have always been a big fan of vic and his saltiness he has some
good ideas though and i am sure that he will be passionate about
this game when working with the csm
valkin mordirc you have a lot of valid points in your post  i will try
to address each oneso lets talk what pve people say they want
what people in general say they want and what they actually
want are not necessarily the same thing generally you can be
more sure of what they say when theres good evidence they
have a broader and deeper amount of experiences and
knowledge going into their opinion if pve is all they have ever
known and in some cases it regrettably is how much do i really
trust they like it having tried none of the alternativesin this
context  pve is often the only aspect of the game they actually
know and can say with confidence that they like have they tried
jousting spaceships certainly the success of groups like spectre
and other assorted npsi groups shows there is a large market for
trying to break into what is a very at first confusing and punishing
aspect of the game  pvp when their first experience is just
outright being denied their game play with no substitute they will
tend to have a terrible experience with it i can say that a healthy
amount of players that i have talked to myself included started as
a missioner and gradually realized it was the worst part of the
game once they had proper exposure to the really fun parts thats
where the problem is the first experiences shouldnt be a denial
of what they currently consider fun they should be engaging in
other ways carrots not sticksas i detailed in a previous post
they need to see something tangible other than making you dock
to actually want to put effort in you took their pve paradise of rats
and lp  what can they either take from you or do to get that state
back if the answer is neither to both than you can expect non
participation which doesnt exactly inspire the player basewhile
that is tactically and technically correct its not a victory condition
most people are either excited to work towards nor is it really all
that engaging while ccp hasnt nearly eradicated mechanics
which encourage these tactics and neither have player groups
stopped using them as a crutch i think we can all agree that is
not an optimal solution there needs to be a penalty for not
participating in a war that you startedperhaps you are correct
maybe so heres the deal most things in eve are an acquired
taste someone else shows you an aspect of the game
sometimes people do this though blogs or youtube videos or
whatever but usually its a friend or acquaintance that makes it
interesting enough to check out maybe you and i both know a
decced corp is not helpless yes they could make you dock up
and deny you content we may have a developed a taste and an
appreciation for this after probably many years however it is an
aquired taste you cant expect everyone to like it the first time
not without instruction heck it could be years before the subtleties
of such a taste can even make themselves known to a palette
that has only known shallow games in todays fastfood pay to win
game design climate a lot of people would probably like jousting
space ships if their first experience with it wasnt so negative
where the best solution as they see it was nonparticipationim
not against hisec antagonism heck ive done my fair share of it
if you want a more interesting game a game which encourages
participation a game which more people will stick with to learn to
taste and savor those subtleties a more apparent and exciting
goal or antigoal is needed to make wardecs something that will
generate content more often for a wider variety of players and
provide a positive experience where their view of the game is
widened go ahead and smash their fleets with t3cs and over
comped logi sure they still have to physically win a fleet fight but
at least give them an objective they could win  just as you always
retain the ability to deny them their pve paradise it seems only
fair that they should be able to deny you in some way the ability
to keep decs up indefinitely i do not like one size fit solutions
phoebes jump range changes did reign in a lot of the silliness
with the game but it really did put a hamper on legitimate use of
capitals in the same vein i would hate for any change to wardecs
to affect legitimate merc activity just because the bluedoughnut of
blanket deccers are at least in my appraisal abusing the
mechanic whatever the fix is it must be not hamper the
legitimate use of wardecs
i like vici joined his alliance on my very first safari he gave me
money and good advice and i didnt steal from them because they
were so nicehes a good guy and very knowledgable
unfortunately this niceness forced me to create another alt and
steal from someone else but hey thats eve right
as someone who flies with jonatan on most fleets i can vouch for
his knowledge of the game his will to help our group and his
leadership in all combat situations he is also the kind of guy that
will listen to your ideas and give you constructive criticism on
them i think hell be a great addition to the council
yup steve is always worth a votemmike azariah UFEFF

thank you so much for the supportit has always disappointed me
that eve has such amazing wellwritten deep lore but almost
none of if makes it into the actual game ive devoured the
chronicles and short stories and the live events that do happen
are incredibleas you say immersion plays a big role in making
eve and really any other game memorable and enjoyable part
of what makes me love this game so much is those moments
when the immersion just clicks and you really feel that sense of
awe at something that you could never see in everyday life
are you going to make liquid ozone a charge
dancul is insanely good at picking apart game mechanics pretty
much naturally hed be a good fit to the csm
i like your listdo you feel like its in your personal priority order
more questionswhat changes in the last 23 years do you feel
have been unexpectedly bad for the game and youd want to
changewhat changes in the last 23 years do you feel didnt go
far enough and youd want to advancethings like instation ads i
think have been a great way to subtlely hint to new players that
theres a world outside lonetrek and im wondering what else
youd suggest to lead folks into the wider worldvet
aram csm  its the best y
this suggests you think wspace currently is not that great can
you give a more concrete description on what you think is lacking
and what are your own thoughts on how to actually make it great
againplease be concrete we understand youll want feedback
but we need to know that you can identify problems corrently on
your own as being on the csm you will likely have to look at
issues under the nda and cannot ask for any community
feedback
rapid blue wrote i want to help make wh space great again this
makes it sound like you want to build a wall and lie to us what
was great in the past and is lacking now
hello my name is serg sinistwhat i ami am a simple capsuleer
in the wormhole it came into play in 2012 3 months later went to
live in the whmy campaign0 prohibit the use of citadel
doomsday to wormhole or balance keepstar upd1 my bad its
already balanced upd2 for keepstar reduce the protective
characteristics of a decrease in its construction prices1 balance
wh mechanicenlarge spawn anomalies with a slight increase in
the possibility of the emergence of lowend k162 system for
beginners making 15 anomalyes have to wait long for the
newchoosing me csm12 newcomers to the c1c3 can expect
more anomalies more anomalies  more newcomers  more life
into wormholes2 add a second static in c6since c2 and c4
wormhole added a second static then the logic necessary to add
such and c6 this will add to the diversity in search of goals as
there are concentrated most influential community3 add the
game thing which can increase the maximum weight of a
wormholemany large groups may complain that they need to start
the attack fleet in several wh since fatigue is even more difficult
it is therefore necessary to make a special piece based on things
from drifter bs and decloaked transmission relay4 add the ability
to respawn in the home system in the citadelif there is a citadel
with clone bay and kill you in the system where you live why not
add the ability to install a second home systemthis is particularly
critical for the inhabitants of wormholes it is not always they have
enter back into the system through the kspaceexample you
live in j1337 and you dead and regroup to jita if you vote me then
you take choise respoawn jita or j133741 add5 add the seventh
launcher slot for drake and a fix lags6 jkingdomeveryone
knows that ccp did wh with the aim of the movement through k
spacebut there began to live and make money to fight for life in
the systemsometimes after the growth of the corporation all
may not be enough money for the t3 and they are in other
systems to create a farm with altaccounts but records show the
system name constellation and even the region wh is not a hole
but a system with the sun with posthe citadel and capsuleers
without local chat and constant inputheres an idea create the
ability to move jump clones between the systems in your
constellation this process can complicate the search links to
your other stationthis can be done in the service of the citadel
using fuel without timer or with him components  some things in
data  relic sitesthis will help in the development of wh systems
more rapid invocation of a new green anomalyes in the region to
increase the influence of corporation or alliance will give impetus
to conquer all the systems of constellations7 make fozziesov
great againwhere are you in real life saw the change of flag is
accompanied by a small fishing probes in a particular areato not
abused ccp fozzie you just need to remove appearing out of
nowhere in the constellation of probes or create a bpo and
submit it to the market that will hinder the speed capture
systembecause it just makes the game boring and there are a lot
of peopleexample entosis in mo that means  takes mo
sovereignty not a constelationactually my campaign isyou can
vote but why it bezsmyslenno but maybe youll find something
here for their programthank you now lets see what answer
grabbing popcorn
you do realize youre not going to be a junior developer right
of course this is just an ideanot everyone likes the balances that
make the power block
if its useless then why do anything to it surely thats a waste of
developer timeif its not useless then youve already lied once
and this people is what it looks like when youre on acid and you
decide to have a go at the csm seat without any forethought or
competence
oh my bad keepstar dd are already balancedthen need balance
keepstars protective characteristics with construction price
so basically you wish to become part of the csm and have a few
ideas  but it turns out you didnt inform yourself about the topics
you are talking aboutthat really is not the best way to gain trust
from the community
woah 2nd pagetd for csm
as the second owner of winthorp the character the original owner
no longer plays as far as i know id like to express concern
about the number of owners the character has hadi personally
know of at least four owners including the present one the reality
is that with so many owners over the years it is hard to be sure of
the identity of winthorp their history and what they may stand
forat any rate the current winthorp probably has much less of a
history and breadth of experience than the character history
would hint at which should dissuade anyone from selecting them
for csm
have a listen to the poor that had to sell a char once and has
sellers remorse i hope that you have now found skill extractors so
you cant have a whine about your next life decisioni am actually
amazed at how many people so far have failed to even read this
thread or are on the crystal pistol
you realize that ccp has made mutliboxing harder right people
who use to isbox 100 mining barges dont do that anymore you
say the player base has gone down 20k but do you take into
consideration these isbox minersincursion runners in 2011 over
by antem in genesis the high sec system next door to antem had
a isboxer who would run 100 barges 2 charons and an orca i am
pretty sure that constituted for 100 if not more of the 20000
players you talk aboutnow also the fighter change i know i
stopped multiboxing supers and carriers as well as many other
players if you consider maybe 100 players who stopped
multiboxing 2 you are talking 200 accountscharacter slots that
are useless did they unsub is 200 a fair assessment probably
notso in the years you have been playing i am pretty positive
that 40006000 accounts got shut off because of isboxer another
10003000 were bannedyes i am going to throw numbers out
there cause they are a lot more practical than 20000 player
decline and suicide ganking is to blame
jump range was nerfed out of stupidity they did it to keep from
power projecting across all of eve however the original
implementation of the range and timer nerf was so heavy handed
that it kept people from wanting to move any capitals people
would rather selfdestruct and collect insurance on
dreadscarriers and they would rather sell their supercarriers or
titans than move them with the range and fatigue nerf bat hell i
know several people who just let their supers unsub because ccp
wouldnt move them and they couldnt sell them where they are
located they still play and they just recently decided to resub them
with the new range changes they should have left range the
same as it was prephoebe and just left us with the fatigue doing
both was dumb
claevyan is an awoxing dirty sob and i regret ever letting him get
his filthy hands on my corp wallet i fully endorse his message of
lunacyvote claevyan
may i chip in not really industry related but as trade empire with
several bulk supplyers i really would like to replenish my orders
like resupply existing orders pls suggest that to our devs it is
really annoying that you have to repay taxes to keep stock on
market if you want to top up on an order
schrUFFFDdingers missile i dig it  makari aeron
that would actually be a huge quality of life improvement good
idea
pushing fir the little things initiative to come back its been
successful in the past and i feel it is a great opportunity to get it
going again
i suppose the big one is what do you consider to be the most
important things in need of changing with regards to industry
so this is a variable question based on what level of industry you
do so lets break it up into little things for each level  things that fit
into the roadmap moving forward for ccpt1 products mineral
based  can help all adding runs remaining as a visual indicator
on the bpc picture would be a huge benefit to everyone
especially those of us with thousands of bpcst2t3 productionso
start from the beginning for this one so moon mining first mining
arrays are an opportunity to break away from what can only be
considered mining arrays give an opportunity to make a
interface with reactions and moon mining that isnt frankly a
painful long process to deal with simplified interface that is easy
to comprehend what is happening and if it is setup correctly
additionally using the upwell access lists allow for tower tending
from select groups of people without giving them access to fuel
bays and etc but enough to actually have them do their work this
isnt a little thing but this is something i work with often and is part
of the road map moving into this fall t3 specifically wormholes
need some love 100 of wormhole residents will say
contradicting ideas on how to do it ill add a simple one asteroid
belts in wormholes gets people into space as mining as
protection as response fleets and as hunters its simple and will
seriously help wormhole industry so lets step over to pi getting
cpp to change pi as a system probably wont happen any time
soon but making small changes like being able to interact and
launch materials to customs offices remotely would be a huge qol
bonus though changing pi from start to finish wouldnt hurt in my
opinion or add it to the mobile app for moving extractor heads
around new esi api system may create options for this provided
the endpoints are there advanced industrycontinued work with
api and new endpoints for pulling more information  making the
api pulls more readable to the general public citadel endpoints
are key here growing these to allow for market data to be more
complete is a great toollastly reverse the decision by ccp and the
current csm to not release regional industry data this is a huge
market forecasting tool and its going to mean issues down the
road the argument of its free intel is easily countered with
thats the cost of doing business its not inconceivable that
concord gather info on this considering you do pay them for the
space
scylussince you are focused more on faction warfare gameplay
and we have two pirate lowsec candidates right now i want to
focus asking some questions that involve just faction warfare you
already mentioned the citadel problem which i believe ccp
themselves stated they overlooked i think i read that somewhere
in csm minutes so i wont go thereinstead i want to focus on the
more pve side of faction warfare and a major isk sink that is the
lp store and lp payout do you feel right now that the lp store is in a
good place are there any buffs or nerfs to the store itself that you
feel are neededlastly what is your position on a militia receiving
50 payout while in tier 1
you get my vote the only true csm
dont vote with whats in your pants
exactly
as a csm member what changes do you feel you could make if
any to encourage more female eve players
i dont vote at allbut some good advertisement is always
welcomecsm is useless anyway and people on csm do their own
business like normal politic nothing different
right now the best tool at my disposal is wordofmouth without
ccps implicitexplicit consent thats really all i have not that wo
m is a bad thing many grassroots campaigns began that way
ultimately this is ccps baby im just a nursemaid if i do make the
cut then ill have ccps ear to whisper sweet nothings in to this is
really about marketing and whether ccp feels changes to their
plan warrant the expense sometimes the best plan is none at all
i think wormhole space isnt in a bad space but i think its
definitely been neglected overall i think the 1 item will do the
most to help wormhole space out is rebalancing combat sites so
that they have a despawn timer which will allow for better isk
upping the iskreward
its definitely an idea that ive had thrown around with a lot of lower
level wormhole corps and the feeling is almost unanimous it
takes groups like hard knocks lazerhawks and inner hell and
moves them from incredibly difficult to evict to near impossible to
evicti feel like this isnt a balance thing we need as keepstars are
designed to fight super capital fleets and theres no counterplay
in wormhole space explaining it this waygroup a forms a
coalition to evict group b group b is an established capable wh
group with 300 active characters and approximately 100 capital
ships in their home hole  for arguements sake lets say 50
dreads 30 faxes and 20 carriers in order to be able to come
fight and have a chance of winning the attacking force should at
least have parity with the defending force were not taking things
like player skill and such into consideration as this is already a
complicated enough example so that means group a needs 100
capitals  a sub capital fleet to match bs capital assets alone
given that a keepstars doomsdays can kill multiple capitals or
effectively kill multiple caps quite quickly we also need to
compensate for that well say we need 50 more capitals to have a
reasonable shot of being successfulok so now that weve
determined that we need 150 capitals to consider pulling this off
well need a subcap fleet for support which will say 300 should be
sufficient arbitrary number but whateverso with 150 capitals
that means we would need to be able to jump through 50 capital
capable wormhole connections given that group b is much more
likely based out a c5 as c6 space is dead well assume the
number of wormholes there to be 500 theres more than that but
rough math hereso given an even probably of rolling into it
again not completely true but good enough for our example
that means group a would have to roll something in the order of
25000 wormholes to get the capital fleet in lets say group a has
247 activity and can roll a wormhole nonstop in 8 minutes
generally speaking if youre ragerolling it can be done in about 3
minutes but well give some leeway for things like rolling
fatiguehow long would it take to get a force into that wormhole
about 140 days thats 13rd of a year committed to this there is
no group in eve that can handle this kind of slog or would
consider even doing itnow that doesnt even take into account
the groups that are large in c4 space what if they managed to
anchor a keepstar with 0 capital assets able to get in youre
looking at a tidi fest to end all tidi fests in wh space which is
already notoriously light on server resourceshow would i deal
with removing keepstars i dont know im not going to announce
something until i have a plan to deal with it its true that i feel that
it is an unbalanced and unfair mechanic in my opinion almost as
bad as a 1sided infinigun from back in the day and i wont lie
about thathow would we compensate the people who already
have keepstars up again i dont knowwould fortizars be
sufficient as the best anchorable structure in jspace i dont
know i feel like there could be a fortizar thats only anchorable in
wh space that has some kind of toned down keepstar doomsday
and i think that would be much more fairso why would i suggest
something that i dont know the answer for its true that i dont like
keepstars in wh space but ive held that opinion since day 1
because i feel its a very 1sided advantage for the defender and
essentially creates such a huge boon for the defensive side that it
becomes near impossible for an attacker to win and thats with 1
keepstar a group such as hk which has 2 on the same grid how
do you deal with thatso im open to suggestions about what to
do but i dont know an appropriate path yet so i didnt want to add
it to my campaign

 are you actually braindead
by your own math the majority of the eviction difficulty isnt the
keepstar  its the corporation behind it most people would have
a difficult time evicting hklzhxinner hell before keepstars now
they still have a difficult timeyou dont rageroll c5s to seed that
many dreads into someone put a scanner in their home and
seed them through their own chain while theyre asleepsince c4
keepstars are so unkillable if you anchor one in your c4 before
voting opens march 6th ill vote for you first on 16 accounts and
post proof
youre invalidating your own point by using an argument that has
been the case in every single eviction and heavily relies on
participation from both sides if we take all structures out of
consideration and look at the use of pos towers youd have the
exact same problem youre dealing with before you even reach
said structure a group such as hk is entrenched enough that the
structure in itself isnt so much the problem it could be a fortizar
and they still put up a similar defenseif you want to evict anyone
that above quote is a requirement regardless of what structure
your opponent has to defend itself if you cant bring the logistics
to defeat the defending armies youre not going to evict them
even if they would live in small towers
im not arguing that the majority of the difficulty of an eviction is
whats existing im arguing that the keepstar pushes it from
incredibly difficult to near impossible groups such as lazerhawks
hk and inner hell are already very well established groups im not
arguing for an easy way of evicting them im arguing for not
making it essentially impossibleregarding anchoring a keepstar
even if i had the isk which i clearly dont i wouldnt 6 vinatieri i
respect that csm is a feedback group but feedback should go
both ways theres probably been plenty of ideas that ccp has
implemented based off of or inspired by player ideas i bring ideas
to the table i want to listen to ideas and improve upon them
finally a csm candidate i can get behind
whites a good man and i have faith that he will serve all of
lowsecs interests well
good luck white i hate lowsec but you have my vote for sure 
just be sure to send me free stuff ok
love me some lowsec representation love me some waffleseasy
choice for a csm candidate
id be happy with more nullsec  wh space wormholes especially
for higher class wormholes like c4s and c5s quantum flux
generators right now are pretty useless ive done a few
experiments with them myself and they are pretty weak they
could probably use looking atcontributer to eve is easy
the navy caracal is bad because hamshmls need some help and
it doesnt get a bonus to rlmls which are op the naga and rokh
dont really fit the current metagame at the moment with rlmls
getting balanced then maybe the naga will see some more action
and the rokh will hopefully get better with bs sensor adjustments
and less pirate ship proliferation contributer to eve is easy
from what i have heard chance has done a good job in his term
on the csm unlike hyde who has failed to attend on a number of
occasions and so not sure why the insults against another csm
member are necessary in this case hyde your giving solo and
small gang pvpers a bad reputationi wont be voting for rihload
anyway as i cant see what he is going to bring to the table but
the personal insults just leave a bad taste and have probably
increased rihloads chances of being elected
you are easily manipulated kid
you know honestly it would be pretty hilarious if hyde and rhiload
did this to bolster votes for rhiload specially since chance and
wingspan have gone full tryhard troll mode over on

hi erikaive got a question for you given the recent decision by
ccp to remove regional stats from the monthly economic report
what overall effect if any do you see this as having on the
industrial market in new edendev blog by quant is here

making a positive impact thus you have my support you are
great logistics manager in our current situation and sure this
knowledge base you have accumalated will come in helpfulgood
luckkakaarmy coexec of diplomacy
thanks for your show of support
the csm would benefit greatly if fawlty7 would join ive followed
him since 20112012 ever since joined the cfc hes an excellent
and skilled fc a great leader lots of fun and trolls and he makes
people happy i endorse fawlty7 for the csm xii youll have a vote
from each of my accounts mate o7
i like that you didnt purely focus on the pvp aspect of lowsec life
what are some things you believe can be improved upon for the
overall health of the lowsec ecosystemhow would you go about
communicating issues from all lowsec residents fw pirate and
strictly pve to ccpwhat potential changes that were announced
do you feel area gamebreaking to lowsec but not any other
space if anything at all not counting citadels in fw spaceyou
mentioned increasing lp payout for faction militias for killing an
opposing factions player are there any other lp buffs that you
would be behind how do you feel about a faction at tier 1
receiving 50 of their normal payout as it currently stands
one of the best members of the previous csm in terms of
productivity and contribution so will definitely be top pick for me
glad you are standing again this year
hi i am xenuria i was in pl once it was ok what experience do
you have interacting with people in an inperson setting
ive known jt for along time great guy he has my support and vote
for csm
if you send me 1 million isk ill return 10x more right back at
you
i appreciate the fact you want to improve wh space but i am
curious how much time you have actually lived in one from your
post it sound like you are a ns guy who is just interested in
wormholesi echo the previous posters that i would like to hear
more of your ideas with details
i tried to read your post but the grammar feels like something
from google translate
one of the reasons many groups live in wormholespace is that
mass limits forces the smaller fleet sizeshow do you think the
ability to increase fleet size will improve wormhole space

5050on the one hand complicate the closing holes  crit in order
to something rolling to search fleets secure system for make
money mining etcon the other hand it will facilitate input on big
fights capital carriage also balance the pilots which cover the
hole way to capital ship  50000 mwd jump without use mwd and
jump back with mwd in during jump animation
i thought about all the ways i could explain how this would benefit
already large pvp corps that print money in high class wh space
now c4s with a c5 or c6 static but i dont think its worth it
expanding the mass on a wormhole  jump cloning into cits 
these are ideas that would turn wormhole space more into k
space im all for making more money in wormhole space if
theres more people that want to bear because they can make the
cost of their ship back pretty quick  thats what would get
wormhole space hopping againthe ideas you posted are not
good you also mention nothing about wormhole dynamics bear
indy pvp  i could edit stalk not troll your killboard and corp
history but i feel if you want to be taken seriously maybe say
something about what you do in wormholes and about the various
play styles perhaps also mention how you perceive the health of
wormhole space too much  little bearing not enough targets
too many large corps  not enough good on you for putting
yourself out there you wont get my vote this year but good luck
all the same
corp bio is in russian if hes bilingual then props to him theres a
fairly large russian playerbase in wormhole space and they
deserve to be heard maybe not by this guy though
thanks noxisia arkanathis topic just kidding and reated just like
that i know about csm this member is a powerful know game
mechanic and see what need to improve game also known for a
large number of people and may irl fly to ccp baseanother
answers1 for mass i think create player things what may to
expand stability mass for some operations2 too much  little
bearingtoo much and too much safety in hi level statics because
many 5 system are either this is someones farm or desert
system and that small amount is the main or subsidiary of the
corporation or alliance3 not enough targetstrue pvp need rolling
many many system for find targets4 too many large corps  not
enough no all good here
i think your a bit too early for april fools please go stand in the
corner and think about what you did
add new ideas 6 jkingdomeveryone knows that ssr did wh with
the aim of the movement through kspacebut there began to live
and make money to fight for life in the systemsometimes after
the growth of the corporation all may not be enough money for
the t3 and they are in other systems to create a farm with alt
accounts but records show the system name constellation and
even the region wh is not a hole but a system with the sun with
posthe citadel and capsuleers without local chat and constant
inputheres an idea create the ability to move jump clones
between the systems in your constellation this process can
complicate the search links to your other stationthis can be
done in the service of the citadel using fuel without timer or with
him components  some things in data  relic sitesthis will help in
the development of wh systems more rapid invocation of a new
green anomalyes in the region to increase the influence of
corporation or alliance will give impetus to conquer all the
systems of constellations7 make fozziesov great againwhere
are you in real life saw the change of flag is accompanied by a
small fishing probes in a particular areato not abused ccp fozzie
you just need to remove appearing out of nowhere in the
constellation of probes or create a bpo and submit it to the
market that will hinder the speed capture systembecause it just
makes the game boring and there are a lot of peopleexample
entosis in mo that means  takes mo sovereignty not a
constelation
i know this and its unfortunate that i know many things i would
like to see changed for the better i may not even be able to
introduce if elected
i think t1 heavies should be available theres always the argument
of ccp tempting players to sub but what many forget is that there
are a whole lot of other things that are tempting no serious alpha
player who can grind for plex will stay in alpha status their
contribution to ccp would be in the form of plex lock out alphas
on utility drones fine but at least provide the t1 heavies for some
ratting potential thus isk its t1 lol
i dont understand what so urgently needs fixing with moon
mining and im really wary of what solution ccp would bring like
when they fixed t2 production which totally crashed that market
while making the ui only somewhat less of a clickfest than it used
to be much betterlooking though same thing with when
exploration was fixed which over a few months completely
killed wspace exploration siteslets face it if individual players
are able to farm a resource to the ground they will because they
cant count because they cant do opportunity costs and
because even when they can count or do opportunity cost their
reasoning is theyll take a part of a smaller pie rather than no part
of a bigger onethe one thing the current system for moon mining
has is capped output on the rarer goos even though most moons
arent profitable because of overproduction at least there are
some actual money moons which people will organize into
alliances to fight over and hold or which people will take the
trouble to recon and try to ninja hoping noone catches them if
moons are turned into yet another form of endlessly farmable
resource the game will lose out nobody fights over asteroid
belts mining anomalies or pi planets after all
so its no that moon mining needs fixing its that the mining arrays
are taking that over for the current pos system and for the
reasons you listed above and for others it really does need to be
something that ccp has some people who have the knowledge of
the market of industry and of the current systems to help them
make it better in terms fo what needs to be fixed with the old
system pos management sucks access lists and everything else
need to have the right options for these and the interface for how
they are run needs to be considered
in response to the reduction of seats for csm xii commander aze
roedyn and myself are encouraging anyone interested in seeing
more highsec representation in the next csm to vote for the three
of us as their first three choices vote strategically and vote for
highsec
prometheusthank you for posting this you brought up pve lp
stores and tier penalties so ill comment on those i do want to
circle back to the low sec pirate piece as i believe our platform will
support those candidates also pve is fine if you are in tier 2
obviously tier 1 can create some stress however it should be a
motivating factor to partner with the rest of the militia to get out of
tier 1 the upgrade system does not promote this if the tiers were
driven by system control it would incentivize the militia to take
systems vs just upgrading the hub it would also improve the
content of fights and demand improved skill sets from the pilots
just to competethe lp store needs to have inventory catered to fw
and low sec currently it has everything found in a high sec store
granted fw lp is gained quicker than high sec lp however there is
nothing special about the fw store if there were items exclusive to
it this could attract pilots to get involved in low sec even revisiting
the tags and how they are applied to goods in the storetier 1
should be 100 payout with bonuses at higher tiers its not an
indictment on a militia for being in tier 1 when the mechanic
needs to be improved to evolve with the rest of the game if the
goal is to attract more talent pvpers and content then the
systems in place should compliment that goal as for my two pirate
colleagues faction warfare is often used as a stepping stone for
piracy and other aspects of the game the small print is if you are
in fw long enough your sec status will be negative we all want
content we love pvp so any improvement in low sec that supports
that goal is worth discussing imhoscylus former executor templis
calsf alliance
scylusthanks lastly what are some ways you feel you can
connect to lowsec players and convey their thoughts feelings
and opinions to ccp
i think weve struck a good balance with townhalls and direct
contact be it contacting subsections of the community directly or
being contacted by the public and id like to continue those
moving forward there is always room for improvement id
probably like to see townhalls used more than just presummit
too i did put together a nullsec focus group before the first
summit consisting of leadership and fcs from all over nullsec i
think we ended up with around 30 people i believe we did get a
lot of useful information and pain points to bring to ccp out of that
focus group but im not convinced its the best way of collecting
information townhalls collect roughly the same information in a
much more effective and immediate wayi cant say this enough
csm xi has taken the damaged relationship we started with and
with help from ccp transformed it into a fruitful cohabitation of
sorts there were devs who had been burnt by previous
experiences which didnt want to talk to the csm for many months
which is completely understandable and we were able to both
integrate ourselves into their work and integrate them back into
the csm as an institution this speaks more and highly about the
personalities of s than anything elsebeing able to continue this
relationship and help the next wave of csms acquaint themselves
with the very complicated world that is ccp while continuing the
current workload with as little downtime as possible is something
i strongly believe is important the perfect example is steve
ronuken who cut down what i would estimate as 3 months of
catch up at the start of our term into a few weeks the shorter the
catch up period the more work a csm group can do with their
termother than that showing up to every meeting ccp has called
or scheduled has shown me the use of doing just that while not
all meetings will have a lot to talk about some are vitally
important and you never know when those will pop up i dont
think anyone could argue my commitment to the csm ccp or the
community with how much time and effort ive put in over the last
year i want to continue doing all of this for the betterment of the
game and the community hopefully this helps make me worthy of
your vote

while in recent years theres been several csm representatives
hailing from the autz i dont think ive met one who has been as
proactive when it comes to seeking input from the community and
promoting the csm and what it can accomplishhis work ethic is
clear from his perfect attendance in csm meetings and his
willingness to listen and advance the players concerns to ccp has
been demonstrated i think the judge has earned a second term
before you secure my vote i need a csmrelated pickup line
you presented a good suggestion on how to rebalance rlml in this
reddit post
formerly respected player currently member of goonswarm
are you with the cartel because youre definitely an
angelcontributer to eve is easy
acs gain the least by going up tiers more falloff from going to 220
or 425 would be nice you also lose so much tracking going to 425
from 220 that its usually not worth it so reducing the tracking loss
between tiers would be nice too i also feel like acs have the worst
t2 ammo selection not having scorchnull feels like hell on
blasterspulse but barrage isnt nearly as useful as those two
types maybe putting a big optimal increase on barrage would be
nice ie instead of 15x more like 3x this works for acs since its
ac exclusive so wouldnt break arty would make optimal bonused
ships like jaguar munnin etc better with acs too instead of
wasted bonus right now blasters seem to win against acs at
scram kiting which this would help with contributer to eve is easy
great response and i learned something from it thanks suitonia
its so funny how a  talking post actually did the opposite of
what the author intended it to do bitter vet vs youtuber  0  1
planetary interaction needs a level of improvements to make it
enjoyable and accessible to people it will cut in some extreme
players profits but for overall mechanics there needs to be
improvements
go erika freelancers wish you best of luck d
i have always enjoyed looking at the reports personally because i
just found it interesting to see all the isk flows around the game i
wont turn down graph porn that said tho i also havent really use
the stats other than to feed my graph porn quota its sad that they
arent going to be doing the regional stats anymore but i dont see
it having too much effect really overall while not to same extent
we do have other resources to also get similar data for those who
use it
thank you i really appreciate it
very much this thank you
thank you for the support
sending out an esslets talk about contenton paper on release
the ess was probably one of the best single ideas in years in one
new item you had a way to make nullsec more profitable have a
way for ratters to risk a little bit more to gain more rewards fight
liquid isk inflation via the lp earned and a content seed for small
gangs to actually get some interaction with the locals perfect
players soon realized that the rats could do their dirty work for
them content seed lost i presume they havent really examined
this or revisited it potentially waiting on some grand revision of rat
ai its sort of a shame it has the potential to solve so many ills all
at once defending your home should mean more than timers 
active defense and curating of your space should yield far more
substantive rewards than it does the game should be heading
towards more mechanisms that reward participation and active
mechanics i would think it would be great to revisit the esson
paper the mobile siphon unit was probably one of the best single
ideas in years in one new item you had a way to steal from the
rich and give yourself perfect players soon realized that the api
could give them instant free reliable intel as to make the siphons
anything but covert content seed lost liabilities lost i presume
they have not revisited these due to the imminent removal of
poswhen imminent is measured in years they were a great
idea that got very little support i wonder why just saying if i was
on the csm i wouldnt be beholden to any interests which quite
frankly were probably quite happy with the siphons
performancecitadels may be the very impetus for big ticket
content but they are harming content generation among smaller
groups no longer can you try and force a fight on a station during
a small roam  the defenders can force youa off without ever
risking anything i hate to say it but eve is becoming way too safe
 the entire charm of the game was that all risks werent voluntary

i fly with vic and he knows and loves this game1
i think that my fw changes i advocate for will definitely help the
health of the average lowsec inhabitant and have been asked for
by the overall fw community and regular lowsec pvpers for the
past few yearsi really liked noobmans townhalls that he did for
wormholes id use the same format in conjunction with any other
lowsec representatives so that we could as a group bring up all of
our collective issues and discuss them with the lowsec community
at large devs would be invited to attend and listenspeak and
members in general would be invited to submit suggestions
bugs and issues in general to any of the csm lowsec
representatives that would be present to bring up in the meeting
for discussion unfortunately i have proposed changes that are
some of the same changes beyond the fw citadel changes that
previous csm members have pushed for and ccp have mostly
ignored im not the only lowsec candidate this year and im really
hoping that the lowsec community at large will vote en masse this
year to push more representatives of our gameplay and lifestyle
onto the csm so maybe ccp will finally listen to our problems and
suggestions seriously additionally the serious talk of drilling
platforms replacing poses within the next year in accordance with
the roadmap demands that lowsec players from both fw and the
larger lowsec alliances be involved deeply with these mechanics
becausethe drilling platform changes effect both fw and nonfw
lowsec alliance they both derive content and income over those
moon towers i think that using current citadel mechanics mostly
in the way vulnerability timers work is complete  frankly it
takes the timezone defense to obscene levels at least right now
you can strontkite if a tower is going to have an unfavorable timer
for reinforce theres no ability to strontkite on citadels without
keeping a minimum amount of dps required to pause the timer
until the reinforce cycle is favorable to you in general i really feel
like current citadel mechanics being brought to the moon mining
area is the single biggest threat to lowsec for the reasons i
explained abovefw was never intended to be a pvecentric
system it was designed as a pvp system with pve incentives i
am behind increasing pvp interactions by adjusting fw lp payouts
for pvp activities but not pve i appreciate your input obviously on
all of my ideas
i would argue that if there are more pvefocused activities such
as increasing lp payout for tier 1 systems to something
reasonable like to 75 payout rather than the current 50
payout it would give more incentive to flip systems and thus
generate pvp by default the side effect of that is more warpcore
stabbed frigates running plexes but imo thats the same
frustration as roaming in nullsec and being reported 10 jumps
outother than that thanks for taking time to really reply to my
questions
no problem obviously im open to feedback and you make a good
point increases in fw payout like such can have benefits and side
effects that transcend the simple pve vs pvp i just like that as a
rule of thumb when talking about buffing lp payouts as a whole
no question you have my vote in this year too sir
hey there dude no questions but support of 7 accounts 
this guy has been an excellent  but he is humble and doesnt
brag enough about what he has helped with i support his csm xii
candidacy and urge others to vote for him
make wars optin
that is definitely an option that has crossed my mind corporations
can choose to be unable to declare or receive wardecsthat would
take a lot of balancing though at the very least i think it would
need to be an unchangeable property of the corporation selected
as part of the corporation creation process and corporations
could only form alliances with other corporations with the same
optin status
even if im not that much into the gameplay aspect you want to
change i wish you good luck with your csm election there will be
enough pure 00  pvp candidates already and eve uni has usualy
a good coverage of all aspects of evebe careful with that
wardecs may be a pain in the  sometimes especially for
smaller corps but they are also a essential part of the sandbox it
would be better to reduce the wardecs you can have at once to a
small number that would make smaller corps and alliances more
unattractive for casual wardecs because the attacker has to
make a decision which target brings his corp enough content 
targets and thats was it is about mostlylorewise yes please i
mostly like it when ccp doesnt put it in in form of events or
missions loved the carolines star thing for example nothing was
said about it there was just this little new star growing bigger and
bigger until somone was wondering hey whats that and things
started rolling or more lorerelated unique sites seeded into the
universe to be found and exploredpve i like the general direction
ccp is taking at the moment with lesser but much cleverer npcs
burners were a good start and the responsefleets from the
mining npcs actualy use pvp tactics logis tackle etc much
more engaging than just grind these little red dots on the
overview
edit because of fail
lets not go crazy on the changes now optin wars is not
something that any eve player should strive for conflict is the
most important aspect of eve it drives both the economy and the
ingame contentwhat you should look for is ways of making wars
more fun not removing them
the wardec system definitely needs some changes but nuking it
completely is a bad idea and making war decs optin basically
turns it into faction warfare still the issues you stand for are
some that have been here since the earliest days of the game
pve combat and missions need to be changed at the fundamental
level if theyre going to stay a main source of content especially
with all thats going on in null nowadays a full wiki on the game
with a similar style to the uniwiki would be extremely useful to
new players and those looking advance their knowledge eve is
one of the most complex mmos ever made in terms of both
mechanics and possibilities and information on those need to be
available and finally as a person who played both wow and
runescape for the lore aspects when i was younger i cant
welcome a lore edition to the game enoughfor these reasons
youre definitely on the shortlist for my final vote d
no thanks
hello will explo data sites get a buff or rework
thank you for your support even if i may disagree with other
people on what can be done to improve eve ultimately i want the
same thing that they do for eve to be the best game it can
possibly be 
what forthe whole point of incursions is that theyre a form of
group pve even if many public fleets have people multiboxing or
downright semiafk if a player wants to solo pve there are lots of
anomalies signatures and missions he can do what would
adding he same content with a vague sansha flavor add to the
game roleplayingsupply and demandincreasing supply doesnt
automatically make people richer see how ccp buffed
exploration and killed wspace explo sites as a result right now
people are farming tags if you add more tags to the market youll
just hit the income of those who are bringing in the existing tags
any reason why the game would be better off besides the fact
that you want to buff a gameplay you know and hit one you dont
btw kudos for the work on helping to maintain the euni wiki that
job probably benefits the community more than the entire csm
ccp didnt confirm my application to run for csm yethave faith
when you submitted the form did it return to the form or tell you it
was successfulit should tell you that youre successful but its a
trifle flaky doesnt like waiting around for any real length of
timewhat i recommend make sure that the two bits of text in it
are below the character limit have them waiting in notepad ready
to copy and paste reload the submission form fill everything in
quickly including picking the character youre running as submit
immediately if you want to check go back to
sent
i did it for the free isk
make csm great again
sorry for the late reply i have been extremely busy packing up to
head back home and i havent had much time to myself lately i
have recently left mcav due to issues i had with ore sites in w
space as well as a new capital i have acquired let me say first
that i still have intentions to help improve wspace and i may
someday returnthough that is not the only thing that i want to
focus on now lets be honest wspace is not nearly what it used
to be and it will never be the same as it once used to bei have 2
focus points for wspace 1 ore sites or the lack thereof2
bringing new players to wspaceill start with mining in wspace1
generic ore2 no guarantee of an ore site3 no safety unless you
have a rorq see 44 mass on a hole if using a rorq or inability
to use rorq in static because the hole is not large
enoughnullsec1 plethora of better ore2 guaranteed ore no
matter what ie anoms or asteroid belts3 system cyno jam
bubbles on gate easy to use rorq4  profitid like to see
better ore in wspace sites should also respawn if left untouched
for 12 daysnow i know that the csm are not devs and they only
bridge the gap between the player base and ccpi know these
issues were brought up to a couple of csm members during a
recent townhall and it would be nice to bring it up with ccp i
personally asked about seeing roaming npc miners but
unfortunately it is not possible for wspacebringing new players
and new corporations to wspace i believe that making changes
to the industry side of wspace would bring in some industry
based corporations keeping in mind that i have not played
through the entire npe but as far as i know there is no part of w
space in it it would be great to see a further along part of the
npe that touches base with wormhole space and lets these new
players know that living in wormholes is actually a thing
bloemkoolsaus  please be concrete we understand youll want
feedback but we need to know that you can identify problems
corrently on your own as being on the csm you will likely have to
look at issues under the nda and cannot ask for any community
feedbacki am well aware of having to keep certain things secret
that is one benefits to being in the military timoxa zero also
you havent addressed the issue with z142 nullsec holes in c5
space being closed but still being visually open do you plan on
interfacing with ccp to try and get this bug fixedi have not yet
replicated this issue as i have found a few z142 null holes in
static c5s and have not yet had any issuesif you encounter this
problem again please submit a bug report and send me a mail to
confirm that this is still happeningedward harristhis makes it
sound like you want to build a wall and lie to usya got me see
aboveaaril i appreciate the fact you want to improve wh space
but i am curious how much time you have actually lived in one
from your post it sound like you are a ns guy who is just
interested in wormholesi have been in and out of wormholes
since 2014 up until about half a year ago when i joined mcav and
learned in detail a lot more about wspace diplomatics etcif
anyone has any more questions please send me a mail ingame
man you joined darkness the only thing youre still doing is making
yourself an embarrassmentleaving a wspace corp and moving to
nullsec over ore site issues and acquiring a new capital
certainly sounds like someone with the experience required to sit
on the csm
frankly this is eve and i have the freedom to go and do whatever
i please if you dislike this so much maybe you should try to run
for csmi had too many subbed accounts lying around being
useless because they were almost fully skilled miners to add on
to that most known corps wont let you just bring 1 toon into their
group that can only fly fax and up but then again you may not
know that because hk have a lot of connections
for those of you who are interested in how i see the csm i made a
video here which i think sums it up nicely
main focus game content pve  tools  00hello alli am excited to
be running for csm this year its my first run for csm so i will
include my main goals and some background info in the post
belowthere are multiple candidates from around provi running
this year and i would definitely recommend to also vote jin back in
but if it is your alliance candidate first consider gecko hareka
second media for the impatientpodcast english talking in
stations
i voted for you last year and might do it again this year if i can
stop crying over that sad fateother than that thanks for the good
work on the wardecs there was a guy from rff last year who also
wanted to make wardecs fun in last years candidates dont know
what hes become but if you get in touch maybe you can bounce
ideas with himgood luck even though fcon seriously right
good luck anyway
appreciate the support i actually have him on my buddy list
already from last year  i was already planning on dropping him a
line to go over his thoughts about contracts which kinda tied into
my desire for a services hub but ill be sure to talk about him
about that too sorry about your feelings about fcon if it makes
you feel any better im more actively playing in my highsec corp
learning how to fc a band of bloodthirsty newbros
i had a chat with toxic great guy find out more
thanks for having me on ash
been in and out of templis over the years scylus has been a great
leader throughout it all with a level head which was rare for
caldari militia even when the going got tough against impossible
odds such as when galmil kicked everyone out of the warzone on
multiple occasions scylus worked to overcome those odds many
leadership types in caldari militia over my 7 year tenure as a
blackrisefw resident have simply quit made excuses or even try
to pass the blame to others instead of this behavior scylus asks
how can we do better and empowers everyone to strive
towards doing just that even when almost all caldari
corpsalliances have left templis remained due to scyluss
leadership lowsec for life which is why templis is one of the
longest standing caldari fw alliances never have i witnessesd or
even heard of scylus behaving in an unprofessional manner even
behind closed doors all of this is a strong indication of his good
character you wont find a more professional experienced level
headed lowsec candidate capable of hearing all sides to a
discussion and making informed balanced decisions scylus
would be an extremely valuable asset to the csm i fully endorse
this candidate
scylus has the steady but light touch evidenced by him steering
templis calsf calsf and caldari colonial defence ministry ccdm
through rough waters though a complete rebuild its evolution
over time which has resulted in caldari militias longest lasting
force resulting in the lowsec apex force that is templis calsf today
he will have value with his unique input gained from the peaks
and troughs of militia and lowsec life a vote for scylus is the
surest bet one can make
i have podcasts coming up i will post that information here i am
interested in receiving mail about their concerns and needs i dont
profess to have all the answers i truly look at myself as a
representative to convey their thoughts to ccp in a respectful
professional manneri come from a world where partnership and
working as a team generates the answers needed to a problem or
opportunity you know the saying win as a teambestscylus
former executor templis calsf alliance
ive only been in templis for about 2 years so i havent known
scylus as long as others but i can attest to his near unnatural
ability to speak to and for his pilotsscylus is quite literally a shining
beacon in the darkness of space  he gives his undivided attention
to the topic at hand offers advice when asked and goes above
and beyond to help those around him his diplomatic prowess is
second to none and he is always courteous as an active
participant in fw for many years and under many hats he has
seen what works what doesnt and what would improve fw and
lowsec as a wholei proudly endorse him
i will be voting for the judge you should too
confirming this entire post is pretty much spot on in regards to
current bs meta i particularly agree with the sensor strength 
scan res  targeting range on bss needing buffs and so glad to
see you have picked up on that something i have requested
myself in previous threads you have my vote on that platform
aloneif only people had warned larrikin that 375km scramming
hics would dominate the small gang meta and kill a lot of viable bc
and bs options before they were announced over a year ago
s
may i present the following suggestion also linked in my sig as a
simple and easily implementable solution to the binary and unfun
nature of ecm in eve there is quite a bit of math but the concept
is relatively straight forward without having to read all the maths
involved
me too
given your own aptitude and interest in balance as a candidate on
the csm do you feel there are any other candidates who you feel
serve the same areas or would compliment your efforts on the
csm mrhyde last year had a large amount of his vote go to
exhausted ie not counted after he was elected and i feel that
csm 12 could do more with the raw mechanical knowledge that
he and gorski provided in csm 11
this is a good question another question suitonia have you any
thoughts on how to improve faction warfare and if so what are
your thoughts on that subject
no vote for me everytime i engage this dude all he does is trash
fellow eve players me and others who leverage the game
mechanics someone who disparages existing mechanics to the
point that he does is dangerous on csm i have a feeling hed ban
all drugs all implants and the ability to receive reps after all
tough to solo if you run into cancer who flies with implants
drugs and dudes who may rep you
lol  good one eve quick reference pdf
will you campaign to remove the sov requirement for
supercapitals
i obviously think supercap prolifieration needs to be accelerateds
hello to eve playersas some of you may know it is that time of
the year again where we elect members of the csm this year i am
asking you to vote for me even if it is second or third on your
preference listsmy pasti started playing eve in mid 2014 and for
about a year all my time was spent there trying to find stuff to do
and losing ships all the time since then i have run an alliance that
fell apart moved to provi and joined many pvp groups and
recently started to fc fleetswho i amlow and null small gang
pvperpvp in large providence fleetsprovi fc for 2040 man fleets
usually talwars and small stuffoccasional streaming on
twitchsomeone who stands up for the little guys but doesnt
ignore the bigger onesmy campaigni would like to see more
emphasis on qol changes to make life easier for the people who
come on to have fun and enjoy themselves ccp have recently
revealed some amazing changes that make life easier for people
and i would push to continue that trend it wouldnt need to be
major devtime put towards some of the fixes but they could
improve peoples play massivelythe lore is another place i would
love for some improvement it was going very well until recently
where it seems to have stagnated and a lot of people i speak to
would like more frequency i would want to see more frequent
news articles that lead up to in game events that are fun for all
involved it may be necessary to bring in major names from the rp
community in order to help accomplish this however i would love
to see a more vibrant world around usi will represent the players
as csm is supposed to do im not going to take the view of one
player as less than that of someone else just because they come
from and area of space or alliance that is viewed unfavourably by
peopleone thing is that i will be open and honest as far as
possible without breaking nda if there is something i dont agree
with then ill push for us to get a community opinion on itafter all
of that i am open to suggestions from other people and i am more
than willing to take on their feedback and do the best that i can to
raise the issue and get a response from ccp on those topics me
not having experience is not a bad thing it means i am going to
be less biased to a certain playstylecontact details  mail me in

i cannot vouch for sullens efficacy as a csm member enough he
has been a consistent hard worker running discussions with
industrialists on capital industrials from before we even knew they
were going to be rebalanced as he saw problems with them and
wanted a headstart on it hes always been approachable
reasoned and willing to converse on any point i will be putting
him high on my own ballot and would recommend that you do as
well
i will be voting for sullen you should too
1 wealth of experience as said in the op
there will be an interview with the guys from the new german
podcast evepodcastde if you have any questions regarding my
candidacy and are a german player make you sure you poke
them on twitter evepodcastdesorry for messing up the

wissen
kalbuir already is an ambassador for this game with all the work
he puts in for newbeans in hordei strongly believe him being able
to directly communicate with ccp via the csm platform would
benefit both ccp and new players as a whole and theres no doubt
about his dedicationthis is a vote i can comfortably say will not be
wasted
classification unclassfouoto all pilotssubject i started eve long
ago in january 2004 shortly after my 24th birthday and have
been playing ever since i have 40 accounts with over 80
characters have much experience in many aspects of eve and
have experienced everything the game has to offer at least twice
except being on the csm becoming csm member will allow me
to assist all of you in making this game even better i have ran a 1
man 40 alt corp for both industry  pvp with much success
before they made isboxer illegal i have been heavily involved in
alliance leadership several years in the past i have commanded
dozens of fleets once upon a time long ago however i mostly
prefer manufacturing mining and trading ie making isk trillions
dont get me wrong i like blowing stuff up too but usually its my
stuff that seems to do all the exploding if elected i hope to be
able to contribute more to eve on the behalf of you the ignored
and misunderstood capsuleers than i ever could before trust me
or not vote or dont vote but if you want a voice that will not be
ignored then i am your candidatethanks in advance for all your
support or constructive criticismvrfrezinviperclassification

dear alli would like to announce my candidacy for csm 12i hope
that as someone new to the csm i can bring fresh perspective and
insight that perhaps is lacking when the same faces are re
elected year after year which i believe to be
platitudinousiUFFFDve been playing eve since the winter of
2013 where i first began as a humble high sec miner i soon
however began broadcasting on eve radio in the summer of
2014whilst at eve radio iUFFFDve taken part in a number of
community endeavours including pvp tournaments as well as
major giveaways and the regular eve radio mining opmore
recently iUFFFDve taken the leading role in recruitment for
eve radio where i have moulded and developed various djs into
the broadcasters and entertainers that they are today as such i
feel i can take some of the credit and or blame for the success of
the stationi have also been an active member of the eve
community outside of game being an original regular attendee of
event where i have had the privilege to interview various ccp
devs as well as players of significant standing in the eve
community i am proud of the fact that i appear at the start of the
event promotional videoas a lawful evil personality i consider
community service in a leadership role such as this to be a high
honour and i am a strong advocate for the harsher side of eve
which we all know and love to hateas such i seek to represent the
humble low sec pirate and militia memberiUFFFDve decided
to run under my eve radio persona in order to comply with
ccpUFFFDs rules regarding alts however my main has until
recently been an active combatant in faction warfare ex parte
minmatar militia i would like to work with ccp to develop this
aspect of the game one which has generated a great deal of
passion both from myself and others across the warzones
admittedly an area of the game which has kept me interested due
to its naturei feel that even after the tireless work of sugar kyle
on the csm low sec remains an unattractive area for capsuleers
especially outside of faction warfare with players either remaining
in high sec or being shuffled to null sec almost as soon as they
receive their first pods as a result large swathes of low sec
remain barren wastelands especially with the introduction of jump
fatiguei would like to see low sec being an area worth fighting
over with penalties and bonuses for being active in the area and
not simply be condemned by the thuggery of the highwaymanthe
recent events that have been run such as operation frostline and
purity of the throne were available in low sec but there was no
added incentive to run these sites there with the additional risk
that comes from being in low which ironically meant that it was
far easier to find and run these sites uninterrupted in low sec
space at least in my experiencepersonally i was a fan of these
events even if i wasnUFFFDt able to take part in them as
much as i would have liked and i feel that there should be more of
them run both from a lore perspective and from a player retention
standpoint as they were quite appealing to the casual player
which i believe is rapidly becoming the standard for
mmosadditionally i enjoyed the coronation of catiz i and would
love for more of these events to take place when the state visit of
malteau shakor was announced i feel that a gameplay element
was missed whereby amarrianUFFFDs could have attempted
his assassination with minmatar loyalists defending him i am still
waiting with baited breath to find out the real reasoning behind
that visiton that note i would love to see the events of faction
warfare affect gameplay in high sec and the wider new eden for
example station services such as repairs or jump clones could be
more expensive in amarr space when minmatar have control of
the warzone perhaps as the result of a slave rebellion or perhaps
certain minmatar items could not be sold in amarr space as part
of a trade embargoi would also like to see changes to citadel
mechanics whereby neutral or enemy citadels cannot simply be
anchored in a system held by an occupying militia on balance i
would like to see the vastly underrated mechanic of reduced
market fees for orders placed in certain fw systems i would like to
see this mechanic iterated to provide an incentive for industrialists
to conduct their operations in low security space as such i would
seek to encourage pirate trade hubs that enable spaceship
violence to continue especially for those with low security
standingand finally one of the most complained about modules
in the game the warp core stabilizer whilst there are many
campaigns to remove this module from the game i however
would like to see an introduction of additional escape modules
such as this possibly in the officer or deadspace varietiesi say
this not because i donUFFFDt know the pain of persons
escaping me being stabbed particularly in fw plexes but because
i feel that it must be possible to choose the terms of your
engagement and where necessary make a hasty retreat thus
allowing your underlings a greater share of the
UFFFDhonourUFFFD of battle for nothing is sweeter than
the tears of the enemy you have denied a killif youUFFFDd

lowsec does indeed need some drastic incentives to get more
pilots out to low looking for a fightfw changes would be cool
along with something like solo systems in which you can only
use a jump gate every 5 minutes
sorry allow me to clarify when i say incursion rats im talking
about the npcs that spawn outside of combat sites i think adding
solo content to incursions would encourage more players to move
around new eden following incursions and allow players who
dont want tocant participate in incursion fleets to experience a
flavorful lorerich game experiencemy idea for tags isnt geared
toward making people more richer but rather to make it easier to
complete datacenter missions raise standings and purchase
items from lp stores i ran missions exclusively for amarr
corporations for almost a year and even after keeping all of the
tags i received from those missions i still do not have enough of
the requisite tags to purchase anything from corporate lp stores i
think individual players should be able to gather enough tags to
make lp store purchases over the course of normal gameplay
without having to focus specifically on gathering tagsalso thank
you for the kind words about the uniwiki i truly enjoy working on
it and it feels good to hear that people appreciate the work that
we do
i think it depends on who the defender is really i would say that
in almost all cases the defender doesnt have fun when they are
being killed and forced to use neutral haulers and whatnot when
traveling through a pipe or going to a hubwhy would any
corporation want to optin for wars other than mercenary groups
and whatnot you will have literally almost all of highsec immune
to wardecs and thats not goodthat wouldnt change much to be
honest this would just push groups to have multiple alliances and
maintain different wars on each fill each alliance with multiple
corps for you to hop between and you can have all the fun you
want and not worry about being limited by the number of wars any
single alliance can have
its clear that wardecs need fixing and that there are a ton of
different suggested ways of fixing them i dont claim to have all
the answers and honestly finding a solution to wardecs is beyond
the capability of one person that said im committed to fixing
wardecs so that theyre acceptable to the entire community
im interested in finding out exactly what the entire community
considers acceptable lots of really bad ideas and uninformed
opinions here and on reddit
npe is prolly one of the best things that happened to new eden
since isogen 5 its really nice to hear about someone wishing to
help ccp on new player experience and other ingame tutorial
contentim also glad to read that at least someone realized that
having lost the igb made quite a lot of public  nonpublic
documentation and tutorials used by new players far less valuable
than they used to be id gladly read a whole lot more of your
ideas on these subjects quite a few documentation projects like
fits collections missions helps etc remain in limbo since even if
we all know that esi is the future and a really nice thing i do love
to play with nothing tells us atm if the information that was made
available ingame to the igb will be on the long run available via
esi  quite a lot already is but should we except commitment for
some reasonable time however since neither the csm nor ccp
prolly doesnt give even one tenth of a  on these subjects why
do you believe that getting elected would change anything to that
 or are you just campaigning to try to raise awareness from the
usual csm lobbyists hoping to have some of them getting a few
clues about the expectations of the playerbase  wardecs are of
course a very important subject for newcomers but you prolly
know from the publiclyavailable notes that neither csm x nor ccp
had even half a clue on the problem they created with this half
baked showerthought scheme and since quite some time
passed since that mistake quite a lot of players adapted to the
problem and some even managed to get fun from it of course
players having chosen to play with new players also adapted
mostly at ccps expense for having created the problem and just
use the problem as it is to help people beginning into eve get
what makes eve different from most games in the industry so
why do you believe that getting elected may help to improve the
situation however mediocre it is which can be adapted to mostly
at ccps expense 
making war optin only would be terrible idea if its just a straight
optin approach poses pocos and citadels would be untouchable
even you had to optin to have a citadel or something of that
nature incursion players and every other player who wants 0 tax
would use it you would basically reduce highsec pvp down to
suicide ganking and station gaming if want wardecs to be better
for all teaching new players what it means to make a corp and
what can happen when you do is a start also giving highsec
corps better benefits to staying incorp and not leaving as soon as
a dec drops i fully believe one of highsec biggest problems is the
ignorance of newbros not their fault when it comes to eve npe
is a huge issue when it comes to eveonline and even though ccp
is make bounds and leaps with it recently there is still a ton of
work that needs to be done concerning it you still need someone
to basically guide a new player by the hand so they understand
that eve is meant to be unforgiving in its nature also have the
tutorials stop giving shield and armor reps to players at the same
time seriously thats why we see so many people trying to dual
tank its because the game indirectly encourages by giving new
players both an armor rep and a shield booster at the same
timedeletetheweak
thank you so much for your replyim not sure i entirely agree with
your assessment when reading the latest csm minutes i noticed
quite a few mentions of new players from csm members that did
seem to be brushed off by ccp staff ill admit i think that there
are csm members who are aware of the importance of making
eve more accessible to new players and that they may be willing
to speak up a bit more with someone on the csm who has that as
their 1 priorityi am sincerely campaigning to be elected not just
to raise awareness the first step of getting the csm and ccp to
care about an issue is to actually elect someone to the csm for
whom that issue is paramount i dont expect to just waltz in on
day 1 and miraculously show everyone the error of their ways but
if i raise the same issue consistently logically and relentlessly
im confident that i can bring some people around
so
we all get like all the money
you can do it you sexy beast i trust you you can do it
you can do it yes you can lol
when this man posted in dodixie local i knew this was a guy that
could get  done vote for this man make the council great
again
this is a guy who has been around the block long enough to know
the ups and downs the community has seendefinitely someone
you want representing the player body to the developersmake
new eden great againhe gets my thumbs up for sure
i was skeptical at first but considering how long people have been
saying this it must be true like if it was a scam ccp would have
shut it down 10 years ago righti say get behind eletherus and
support local chat begging it is after all what makes eve
greatupdate  i was paid 100 isk for this post
having closely studied this guys campaign i have to say that he
gets my vote he has rafts of measures that could really revitalize
this game i definitely think that if you want a candidate who will
try their best to keep eve fresh then eletherus is the guy for
youmake new eden great again
dear capsuleersthis year again i wish to get in the csm so we
need youstop the bad campaign hereif like me you are a bad
pvper you do not care about the alliances the politics and the
dramas like me you think pi fw trading ganking is soooo boring
and you do not have an isk to pay you big shipssimply vote for
methis is my program for csm xii i will update it regularly your
ideas are welcome  first of all we want only 1 guy in the csm
not 14 or 10  this guy will be chosen by myself and renewable
eternally in case of death his son will continue at the head of the
csm for the first year only one candidate will be eligible for the
position me we want roundabouts and crossroads lights to
streamline traffic at the dedock of major commercial hubs such as
jita this will avoid ships bumps and so many accidents every 2
hours of flying a ship a forced rest will be imposed this to avoid
falling asleep when you are driving and create an accident with
this system you wont blow up yourself on a gate because afk
we want also implementation of radars between 2 gates with
imposed speed limitations 5au  s max for distances within 30au
between 2 gates each offender will receive a fine of 10m isk 
less space accidents if titans or supercaps are present in a
system red and green lights will be activated on the gates to
make the traffic more fluid 20 ships maximum at the same time in
one system  tidi is over any corporation taxing more than 5
will have to justify how they use the money a commission of
players elected inside the corporation will keep an eye on this
for roamers we want green and red lights on each gate  how
deaf people can hear the orders gate is green or gate is red
from their fc so they jump when the gate is red and they die in
the next system shame at least 1 free skin  ship why only
minmatar ships should be beautiful in this game  other races
should be nice also we will work to make concord as bad
shooters as the stormtroopers in order to maximize the chances
of the pirates to escape safely the end of cynos with 20 ships
that jump in 1 time now the ships will jump one after the other
with a delay of 10 seconds farmers will have more time to warp
outvote for a new hope vote borat 

are you on weed
very good idea my friend i will propose something on that
what is this even what
so does this mean ccp rejected your candidacy application
probably more to do with the character being sold
very niceoh come onyou knew it had to happenits
traditional eve quick reference pdf
about meyou may have gathered by now that i have absolutely
nothing special or innovative to contribute to eve i started eve by
going to the forums and complaining about how the game was
unfair and broken for alphas sometime around two months ago
sp you can rest assured i have little to no experience playing evei
have evolved from beyond those dark days into a fully fledged
gaypwneer spending my time flying around in uttter utter shitfits
claiming that i will be the one to break the metavision for
eveputting me on the csm will be your guarantee for someone
that will push hard for changing wormhole space so that there
will only ever be one wormhole open at one time ever in the whole
of new eden and it is frigate sized having ecm modules be able to
affect everyone you lock rather than just one person at a time
introducing realistic flight mechanics into eve in which warping
across a system will put you the corresponding amount of time
into the future relative to everyone else not being elite being a
bannable offense multiboxing being a bannable offense adding
a new mode to t3ds in which being in a fleet with other t3ds using
this mode will combine the t3ds into a gundam  mlp skinsto
concludei have neve led a fleet i have never owned a corp i
have never flown anything larger than a cruiser and i have never
flown anything tech 2 i have little to no knowledge of game
mechanics and my understanding of solosmall gang pvp does
not extend beyond hitting approach and pressing f1 i believe the
csm will benefit from my election and i look forward to my much
deserved free trip to iceland thank you all
reserved for shitposting
looking forward for the gundam part
once again csm 11 visited ccp at our reykjavik hq for their second
summit this involved four days of meetings between csm
members and ccp developers as part of the summit process a
set of meeting minutes are released you can now view the
meeting minutes hereplease feel free to discuss the minutes and
ask further questions to the members of the csm in this
threadedit added the missing link isd max trix edit 2 messed up
the url fixed nowccp logibro  eve universe community team 
distributor of nanites  patron saint of logistics
thanks for the support there max means a lot coming from my
own ceo that i totally havent gotten killed or anything
i would like the fully endorse jin in his reelection for the csm he
has been a great asset in not just nullsec items but also the game
as a whole as many current csm have stated it is better to
endorse candidates who will better the game and are more than
just an alliance ticker jintaan is one of those people i can fully
support as helping to make the game better for everyone
jins got my vote amazing guy that has done some amazing work
to help bring the csm back from what csm 10 was viewed to be
stay tuned for a great interview with ashterrothi will post link
when available
glad to see you running ive fought scylus for years and would
love to see you on csm even though you are a dirty squid
i think vic jefferson is a solid pick he has a decent grasp of game
mechanics and is also good at presenting discourse and rational
arguments rhiload could also be a good pick too i feel like my
weakest areas are wormhole space and sov null so im hoping
noobman will be able to serve another term to clue me in if i get
elected and of course nullsec tends to be pretty widely
represented already and hopefully youll make it gin and tonic 
contributer to eve is easy
i dont have a problem with implants links and drugs i cant
engage them with my clean playstyle of not using them so i just
avoid them when those same pilots ask me to 1v1 when they
have a deadspace fitted ship with drugs and i dont and they bring
in their link rr legion dishonoring the 1v1 then yeah i do like to
make fun of them in local but that is part of eve contributer to
eve is easy
thanks suitonia i posted a response i like every suggestion you
make except for one breaking it up into 1v1v1v1

i will say that ive flown with erika through at least three different
corps now and shes pretty great if youve never had a chance to
be in a corp with consistently reliable and affordable logistics you
dont know what you are missing shell be getting my 1 vote
because she more than almost anyone else in the game has
made my eve experience betternow on to the meaterika i know
your intention with the accessibility stuff is to make it easier for
people with disabilities to play the game but what about people
with high resolution monitors will you make ui scaling great
again in 2017 asking for a friend
thank you otroand yes i approve of maketheuigreatagain
remove the travel banget rid of bubbles and remote sebos i want
to travel around eve and not stay docked
always appreciative of your support jintaan you will also be high
my recommendations
indeed that was the thing i did like about the valkyrie event you
had much better chances of getting the loot in the low sec sites i
also found them easier than the high sec onesid like to see more
things like that which are exclusive to low sec to give people a
reason to go thereeven with a warp core stab equipped
bumping for an intelligent candidate with good communication
skills and a talent for constructive discussion
he has a medal of wealth dont you want wealth the obvious
vote is for eletherus
this man gave me 100 free isk 1010
eletherus is a scam artist dont give him any of your time or
money
dont trust 71350 he is a known scammer
hmm well i wait my isk d
sent
i enjoy this man give him a seat
truly a man amongst men
i believe in this man just look at that hair
you are the the reason cavemen painted on walls
he explains it at the end of the other thread it means he feels ccp
has moved he goal posts for the csm  again  and they are no
longer interested in having all gameplays particularly his own
representedas such this represents borats ragequitting from the
csm race
i dont seem to able to find the graphs i just see underlined links
i cant click
i had hoped the overhaul of the npc mission system was farther
along than these exploratory questions suggest its desperately
neededon the first question i dont think pve needs to be harder
overall some small newly authored randomly selected goals
inside of a mission could keep the overall difficulty if measured in
damage and hitpoints the same while providing new choices we
havent seen before for example one time youre asked to rescue
the damsel just like it is today from a structure with the usual
defenders another time zor undocks as you approach or start
shooting the structure takes the damsel and microjumps one
time only 100km away forget the structure youve got to stop
zor on the second question i think new players should be able to
get into most level 4s during their second month a sense of
progression and ability is important for retention every month a
new player has to decide if its worth it to keep paying the burner
missions provide great info up front so a player can make an
informed choice about the intense difficulty its a good template
to follow for the most difficult content to help avoid morale
crushing losses the other level 14 mission texts arent nearly as
helpful most players are recommended to consult external
mission reports marauders were overhauled bastion mode with
the realization that level 4s were too grindy and heres the ship
class players should aspire to fly for best iskhr

thanks
aryth brought up the topic of shield capitals and how there are
issues with being extremely vulnerable to energy neutralizers ccp
said they would revisit it after releasing shield slaves ccp said
that they were also aware of application issues with caldari
weapon capitals edit sorry missed it when i read through the
first time and didnt come up under missiles 3  any kind of
roadmap on thisbobmon brought up the topic of capital ship
movement via tethered structures ccp responded that theyre not
happy with the current system but it was again a matter of
priorities compared to other work they needed to dofairly
disappointed in this response in all honesty id like to see dev
work go into making sure feature and content work and are
balanced before deciding theyre good enough and wandering
away i understand the reasoning but its pretty darn
overpowered at the moment
wut kind of nonsense is thisthe ability to cope with reallife eye
strain andor have more displayed at once because of monitor
resolutions dont make a player good the overview ui in a fleet
fight particularly small gang is like trying to read a financial
spreadsheet where the rows and values keep on changing
ordergive us the multi overviewin fact give us multimulti
overview i know that i would straight away create 3 for logistics
purposes my fleet enemy fleet my logiin b4 100rorqual hot
drops that can mine the entire asteroid belt in seconds so theres
no roids nearby to allow panic to be activated

this new focus on ai pve content is frightening me  do you guys
even think before requesting new improved ai npc which pose a
threat to players what i learned in the last couple of months only
a minority does pve for fun only
because eve pve is not intrinsically fun if it were more people
might look for it to be
the moment shooting rats in eve becomes intrinsically fun it ends
to be a pvp game
i totally agree about dscan hotkeys i also would like to ask about
separate hotkeys for fighters i even made ticket about it and gm
suggested me to post my request here on forums he also said i
should post it on this forum aswell
i think the same but for factories instead producing 300020
something as 1200080  but preserving cost per unit cpu and

thanks for both
ive had the complete spectrum of csm representatives in my eve
experience on one end i was in nulli secunda so i know what a
complete reject you can get with a representative like gorga on
the opposite end of that spectrum is noobman who has been the
best representative for my eve experience to the csm to dateone
of the most important things is that he is still passionate about the
game he continues to find challenges and goals that drive him
his motivation for working as a member of the csm is clearly to
improve the game experience for all of us he is not a block vote
getting in to boost his ego and get a free trip he is the opposite
he is there for us for wormholers and he listens to everyone the
most clear examples of how well he represents us are his town
hall meetings and how those translate directly to the message he
delivers to ccp as recorded in the csm minutes everything from
fax balance in whs without impacting nullsec all the way to mining
ore or npc spawn ranges in low class wormholes are on the
agenda he is easily approachable and good feedback and ideas
presented to him will make it to the csm and ccphis expertise
experience and energy make him the best wh candidate for eve
hes got all of my votes good luck noobman

thank you for all youve done so far you have my votes for csm
xii d
only good csm member ive ever seenand the only good the csm
has ever done is promote noobman1
thanks for the feedback at the very least connecting all the
warzones into a circuit would helpcontributer to eve is easy
greetings capsuleer or as the old intro used to say dare to be
bold so hereUFFFDs my being boldi am a member of
brotherhood of spacers a sovnull alliance currently holding
space in perrigen falls while a member of an alliance i am not
being a candidate for this alliance only although my focus might
be weighted towards 00 as it is the area of the game i am most
familiar withi am a candidate for you the players the real
strength of eve onlinethrough my years of playing this game i
have really come to realise that the primary strength of this game
is the social structures that exist within the game iUFFFDm
not necessarily speaking of alliance or corps but also of
communities like the incursion communities groups like
bombersUFFFD bar spectre fleet or channels like broadcast
for repsi would love for those community aspects to be
strengthened even perhaps through ingames means perhaps
uiuxwisemy second point is that this great game needs to
remain dynamic while groups can start a chain of events that
lead to great content like the recent tribute war i feel that ccp
could help motivate this kind of change i will not claim that i have
any readymade answer as to how ccp could help the ball moving
but i will gladly participate with my input of whatever changes ccp
might present to the csmas your csm i will strive to be your
voice while i do not keep a blog or host a podcast i am an ever
present part of my allianceUFFFDs online and offline
presence my alliance mates and people beyond the confines of
my blues know that they can count on me when the need arises
i have played eve since november 2012 when i created my
first character less than a day in the trial i chose to subscribe as i
found the scenery beautiful after spending some time in my
newbro days in a small corp i went my own ways towards
highsec missioning in my solo corp while i didnUFFFDt take
part in massive fights i followed the eve metagame on twitter
reddit and through forums and blogs i am an active member of
tweetfleet and will gladly partake in any discussion about the
future of the game hence my candidacyfollowing the 2014
UFFFDthis is eveUFFFD trailer i decided to shed my hs
hem and join with brave newbies inc where i learnt so much i
have forged some of my strongest friendships with the people
with whom i have shared space corp and commsi am currently
fulfilling some noncritical roles in my alliance i have worked with
recruitment diplo and some light small gang fcUFFFDing i
think that being a csm would not impact my current rolesin my
real life i work for the main library of copenhagen in the logistics
dept my work hours allow me to dedicate most of my free time to
evefinally iUFFFDm always available on twitter
minustar or in game i pride myself in answering every evemail
i should receive if you have any questions feel free to contact
meand with thatfly safe dangerously or however you likeo7
stellan c
and heres an itemised list of what things i would like to see
implemented by ccp together with the csm game mechanics
should encourage dynamic pvp and pve play styles add an option
to share character information when applying to a corp eg
mails wallet assets etc every mechanic should have a counter
play system security should change depending on the activity
the more ratting is done higher sec more pvp lower sec system
security band shouldnt change and should remain tied to the
static base security status third party kill boards are great but
there should be an ingame ability to search killmails one has
participated in the market window should allow camelcase and
word search scourge missile should return all scourge missiles
rockets light heavy assault cruise etc the drone ui needs a
revamp drone health bars should update while tethered and
repairing proper beards and long hair for male characters the
new eden system should have a memorial to lost friends right
clicking on a corpse should have a show character info option
contracts need to show which corpses are being contracted an
esi endpoint to collect character sheet notes hovering over the ig
clock should also display the local time according to the pc
settings communications officers should be able to send ig
notification popups

good luck xenuriai believe in you
you sir have my vote warped intentions would be lucky to have
you represent us
o7im putting my name in for csm 12 on the faction warfare
platformi want to see a harder stance on lp farming and an
emphasis on building communitiesid like to hear your thoughts
because after all i will be the person who brings your thoughts
concerns and ideas to the table with ccpo7
bumping in support for thomas he is definitely another candidate
that has shown excellent leadership and communication skills on
eve radio and beyond
helloi really liked the threadthe information and critics are pretty
accuratei am fairly a new player to evebut i am fairly an old timer
when net gaming is the subject i always read about games and
their backgroundstoryline and always interested in
roleplayingabout evestorylinepve and pvpi support your ideasi
also think all three sides of eve gameplay should not be
seperated form eachother but should be brought
togetheroriginallypvp meant to be roleplaying aswellpeople pvp
to roleplay the dread knight hunting innocent prey or the knight of
valordefending the lives and the honor of the realm and
justicespoils of war meant to be the natural result of the
skirmishesaccording to the rules based on the in game scenario
there shall be natural punishment for whom that breaks the law
non pirate amarr bounty hunters keep a track of an amarr pirate
player and hunt him down whenever he kills an amarrian
citizenor the similar for other factions etcsame players cant
run pirates and bounty hunters to milk the game mechanicsthis is
pvp with rulespvp with roleplaypvp with resultsnot only
scoreboardsalaspvp part at most sandbox mmo games i played
untill now were simply this  some bully gamers who log in drunk
or high or have some kind of psychologic issue randomly attack
anyone on sight to harass and speak their hate wordsi say
sadly because as i stated abovepvp meant to be a part of
roleplaypvp should never meant to be a gifted tool to be the
annoying bully who cause newbs and veteran players to get sick
and tired and leave any mmoopposite of this is bad for
gamersawfull for the gaming companiesthe reason behind this is
not eve developersthey meant to create a space fantasy that
people could run their own dungeon mastery and roll their own
dices and let other players play freeand that is the hot spot
therewhen anyone who owns the biggest treasury or the
strongest weapon out there wants to be a dungeon master  and if
any sort of strictly set in game rules or written scenarious do not
existthat dungeon master can do anything to anyone and
anywherecan also get over with anytihng saying who cares i
made up a new rule right nowdoor is there if you dont like itbut
check thisthe dungeon master is the narrator and rolls the dice or
lets other players roll and keep up with the storydungeon masters
are not there to ruin the daydelibarety for the dungeon
runnersjust becasue they feel bad that dayi hope it is clear up to
nowthe strong pvperthe corporation manager or a random pver
or a roleplayer are meant to be all equal even if they dont have
the same rights on their own propertyif eve meants to be a scifi
scripted game with pvp and higly social interactionand not only
an ordinary space arena first person shooter gamethen it needs
some rework about player interactioncorporation roles and how
players behave in and out the pvp situationsthis includes roleplay
and reasoning when player killing aswellwith respect to the
original idea that creators of this game intend to shapebringing
eve or any other sandbox out there to a better placesolution is
hidden there at sticking to the orignal scenario script and making
anyone following in game rulesbe it strictbe it loose
years ago we were promised to walk in stationi dream of others
seeing my clothing in station or sitting down and playing card or
other games in station this was killed when burn jita happen a
vocal group was able to stop the development of this part of the
gamei still want to walk in stationand would like to talk to and
work with ccp to explore completing content and allowing a new
types of game play including station related game play
you can but the chance of it happening is pretty low as its not on
the road maps csm are not minidevelopers i would love it being
completed as well but theres a lot more important thats on the
table than captains quarters

while i agree with you there are things that may be important as
well theyve actually started this and had a reasonable amount of
it worked out and done i would assume opening the station door
at this point is not insurmountable and would be relatively easier
than for example making dust 514
the csm doesnt get to set ccps development priorities and one
feature which may have no work done on it im being very very
generous with that may is a very weak platform to run on at the
very least let people know what you do and what you know
im glad you put so much detail into your candidacy post but
yeah i doubt itll happen and its such a niche concept to run for
csm on good luck

lets examine what we can know or say about the character of
eletherusyou can always just a persons truthfulness by the
twitch that their mouth makes when they speakclearly eletherus
can tell no liesjust recite the motto that is his
nameeverylittleeffortthatheavenexpectsredefinesussatisfactoryhis
eye gaze downward is not in pity for the futile struggles of man
beneath himhe cant help that he is tallhe looks down so that he
may meet the gaze of every person he meetsclearly eletherus is
humble
i honor the man who has honor it is hard to find someone who
has honor in a game that encourages scamming what else do
you look for in a man with as such qualities just as treasures are
uncovered from the earth so virtue appears from good deeds
and wisdom appears from a pure and peaceful mind to walk
safely through the maze of human life one needs the light of
wisdom and the guidance of virtue the guidance of the man the
guidance of eletherus
this guy might be the biggest loser on the planetim jus sayin
honesty is what i look for in a candidate and i can tell you
eletherus was honest with me when he didnt have to be he has
also been around a while and know what we need i vote
eletherus for csm
two things are infinite the universe and the need for eletherus as
csm and im not sure about the universeUFFFD
what a nice man i support you
i support this man he helped me in local once
i am in support of a man that i have known for many years he is a
great person and i would be glad to have him as a csmthen again
he promised me 100mil
give that guy a seat so we can make csm great again

ccps inability to balance their game properly i will push to have
the effects of pheobe reversed or drastically changed i will push
for a travel ban on crappy csm members who are only interested
in what benefits their particular block alliance or furthers their own
personal goals lets work together to ensure that future csm

the more ppl will do pve the more pvp targets you will have im
more concerned about all this npe thing it seems to not
accomplish anything spectacular yet after initial boom pcu is
dropping but hey new skins everywhere
good npe is important i didnt try the current version yet so cant
judge aboutmy comment above was about that ccp has to put
theme park like resources in making pve intrinsically fun
including new content stories every patch also people are lazy
if the reward does not scale with the effortrisk people will just do
it in secure space for fun or dont do it at all because other stuff
gives more iskh hence scaling the risk and complexity aka
fun requires to scale the reward as well which leads to
balancing issues see the new clever mining npcs only few
bother the reward does not justify the effort and risk the drifter
incursions are a second example first people found clever
strategies and the reward was too high and when it was cut
back nobody bothered to run them anymore
question is what is good npewe dont need new npc ai ive
wondering what is the purpose for those new mining fleets we
can interact with only by shooting them what the point here so
miner gankers have more fun it has nothing to do with improving
any pve experience apart from i can see the fleets on my dscan
sometimes we need something more than warp to site shoot
trigger loot warp off after 15 sites most of pve players will
uninstall where is the fun in unpredictability in difficulty ive
done all kind of noncombat exploration sites all types of 14 ded
sites most of unrated complexes loot table is good most of it
but they are all the same this is no game for pve oriented
players they will be bored too quickly
but why do you do pve what is your motivation would you still
do it when its more exciting but without any valuable reward for
the time spent
even in highsecurity space people doing pve provide targets for
someone read mtu killersbaiters mission item stealers suicide
killers of blinged ships etcnot sure if it is a problem though
look at burner missions the problem as i see it ccp cannot find
sweetspot or they do not want tothey either make stupid ai low
reward npcs look at recent event or totally overpowered npcs
with big rewards burners im looking at you as result such
things are not popular among casuals i believe exploration is a
perfect example of properly done pve it is totally pve but to find it
people go for lowsec and 00space and even wormholes
providing pvp
yes its nice but i would not call it pve as it has more pvp
elements and exploration is isk neutral other than rat bounties
mission  incursion payouts which are faucetsbut also here you
see clearly that not many do it just for fun  only few bother with
data sites why because the reward is bad
why do we play games to be bored its doesnt matter how high
reward would be if game become second job if im willing to
spent part of my free time to the game i want its mechanism to be
entertaining exploration is all about rewards ofc thats why we
exploring to find some good stuff pi is good example it may
bring a lot of reward isk but did you ever do it i manage to do it
for a week then i throw up and went back to exploration edit
second good example are events i do them for the rewards
booster mostly do i enjoy them no because they are boring
caught this review at crossing zebras 
faction warfare fw space is one of the best arenas where older
and newer players go to learn and participate in solo and small
gang pvp not only those who are actual members of the militias
but many many other players neuts and corps who visit regularly
i know so many players who have alts in fw space it is very active
and imo one of the most fun aspects of eve online im surprised
that there as never been a ccp fw representative and its time
there was one fw is over due at least a few tweaks or perhaps
even a complete overhaul of its mechanics particularly with
regard to the impact of the introduction of citadels and also pilot
sec status problems a faction warfare representative in the
council will be critical to this i can think of no better candidate than
scylus black who has the knowledge and commitment to
represent fw pilots from the player perspective effectively he is
widely respected and supported across all the faction militias
noob is pretty much the only csm member i want to see on this
year at any cost good dude and has done incredible work for w
spaceid write something longer but axels post is spot on1
fixedloyal servent to mother amamake evetetsel
yet hes actually working on trying to get better payouts and
decent mining in wormhole spacei was like you a year ago didnt
think much to the leader of the pack running for csm listen to both
the recordings and read the minutes from the csm he actually
delivered
so as a person and as an alliance mate i fully endorse jr i do
want to know 3 things one do you think removing the refit ability
for triage only was a bad idea or a good idea two what way
would you try to keep lowsec from turning into an area where
large blocs to dominate exclusively thirdly do you think eve as a
game is getting less skill intensive to benefit a more open market
no doubt fuzzy steve holds place 1 on my ballot
jt has a lot of ideas that i like also i would like to see someone on
the council that could set forth some concepts to make the
greatest game even bettervote jt i am
you have my voteccp should here that some player still want this
it might not be on the top priorites list but with effort this feature
should grind this list to the topyou could also add to your
plateforme that cq need to be available in citadelsloyal servent to
mother amamake evetetsel
yes also this i dont know why its not there already
if you could make that happen id vote you number 1 on all my
accounts sadly ccp is not gonna do it
you know ccp only puts in what the players want and if enough
players are vocal about completing it i am confident they will put
forward work to it i think from what i understand from confidential
sources a lot of the content was created and worked on and that
at this point it was mostly left up to artists completing the interior
but this could be pure conjecture from someone that was a scrum
mastereither way i would endeavor to working with ccp to make
sure that ccp understands that there are still players and will be
players in the future that would enjoy and make use of walking in
station
eletherus has been around eve for five years so has plenty of
experience needed in a csm i say vote for him while many
players vote for the oldest players some whove been here since
inception a fresher approach with a player whos experience is
focused around the era of the biggest upheavals to eve is who we
need on the next csm

this man is a great man he is a man of great integrity and
principals over the years he has taken so much fire for the team
and he will do so once more he has proven that in the face of
great hardship he can get the deed done for years hes been
firing into locations that would make you cringe and i truly believe
that this man is one of the only men in the world to have walked
out of a south florida pharmacy with a bottle of penicillin head still
held highhe has offered to undertake the burden of the csm
candidacy for us all to ensure that we fight for what is right he will
keep his campaign promises and block all immigration of dirty
poors into our spacei am susan d coomby and i endorse this
candidate
a vote for dogg is a vote for mega
trump memes never get old



i thought eve was having trouble getting in new players because
of competition with other games i mean there are emerging
mmos now that support sandboxy elements like player driven
economies and player factions theres eso which is buy to play
though its a themepark but it is fun though guild wars 2 is fair
f2p crowfall is buy to play yet to be released though albion
online is another buy to play in fact if eve didnt go f2p i wouldnt
even bother to playmy point is i dont think that not having a risk
free high sec space hinders the game from having new players
im freaking new myself risk is fun in this game and drives people
to form groups playing and coordinating with others is whats fun
in this game for me at least but i think other people will agree as
well coordination with others mitigates risk i dont think sandbox
and consensual pvp mixes well together
i do and have a nice 5 planet setup in nullsec doing r0p2 with
minimal maintenance effortmy personal challenge and fun is to
come out ahead in all kind of competitive situations using only
one char which also includes getting samemore while spending
significantly less effort than others incursions are an example of
an activity i tried and wont touch again  its tedious attention
consuming and gives not enough reward compared to what i can
get by just chilling in perimeter what i liked was the inofficial
challenge to get hands on the elite drone ai chips when the price
spiked so i ran a lot of missions to get as much agents as
possible locked into the specific mission to farm them for a week

great opportunities for pvpasroleplay and i think that
emphasizing lore more in everyday gameplay or perhaps adding
the ability to fight for pirate factions as ive seen suggested would
make roleplaypvp more of a reality

hii am surprised that nobody has yet picked up on the potentially
coming changes with a new forum if i have understood correct
ccp will give up or will no be able to binding a name in the forum
to an actual character that belongs to the respective eve account
i personally find it very undesirable not to be able to match a
forum post to an in game character that opens a lot of possible
abuse situations i hope the csm will push to make sure that does
not go ahead the way it looks in the minutes have funzora dijon

thank you i really appreciate it
so heres the deal eve has the highest degree of character
customization of any game out there there is no other game i can
think of where who you associate with and what you do so
fundamentally define who you are you can literally be whomever
you want with no restrictions thats quasiinfinite character
customization  its part of what makes eve such a good game
and contributes greatly to its longevity  no templates to follow no
lists to complete you are whomever you want to beeve has a lot
of notable personalities and organizations and no shortage of
enmity between them there are so many unique ways so many
nontrivial ways for your character to define itself both by
association and action that there really isnt a pressing need for
more development time on avatar play or cosmetics thus i really
dont have an opinion on it a finished captains quarters probably
wont change all that much  revitalizing npc null or energizing
lowsec just might break some of the stagnation the game is
currently facing thus thats where my thoughts generally are and
at least in my opinion where the game needs the most
development

break when i joined the australian army in 2008 i came back to
eve in 2012 and have been playing fairly regularly since then i
should explain for any of those who might be scrolling through my
history that i lost my account details from my first account so i
had to create a new one when i came backmy main gameplay
experience has been focused around the market industry
planetary interaction and highsec pve based on my personal
experience in the game i would be best suited to voice the
concerns and ideas from players of the above mentioned
categories however i would always be open to hear comments
from players regarding other topics in eve i believe that as a csm
member you should be representing the concerns and ideas from
the player community as a csm member i vow to uphold the role
as a representative of the player community and will not push any
agendas based on individual or single group demands if a large
majority of the player community were to bring up concerns and
ideas then of course i would represent their concerns and ideasi
have a great passion for eve online and truly believe it to be one
of the best mmos in existence although i am quite new to eve
politics and dont spend much time on the forums i am practically
on eve all day long if you have any concerns or ideas regarding
market industry pi or highsec pve feel free to contact me in
game i will end with a few points on what improvements i would
like to see in eve to benefit the player community improved story
content for pve missions regular special events in high sec
example pirate invasion into jita concord workers strike
improvements to war dec system in high sec improvements to
market ui and market data ideas for alternate power source for
structures example solar harvesters ideas to make pi more
interactive and less set up and leave it for two weeks ideas to
have a damage radius from exploding npc structures ideas for an
interactive internal station area for players to actually walk around
and see each other ideas to reduce or prevent ships from
camping in front of jita undock hanger in order to prevent larger
ships being bumped ideas to reduce or prevent player deployed
structures or containers from congesting trade hub areas please
remember that the csm is put in place to convey ideas and
feedback to ccp on behalf of the player community i cannot make
any promises that i can make changes happen but i will do my
best to relay information to ccp and get them to hear your voice
thank you for your timeviktor koraka
i will be voting for capri you should too
i am carbon alabel and this is my candidacy thread for csm xiifor
those of you who have no idea who i am i am a member of the
alabaster albatross part of sev3rance and provibloc and this is
my first time running for the csmi started playing eve in 2013 in
high sec where i spent about a year and a half mainly running
missions along with some light industry and trading after that i
moved to providence where i have been building up experience
with various types of activities null sec has to offer during both
my time in high sec and in null sec i have also been spending
time in wormholes though in general i prefer the false sense of
security provided by local chat and fixed gates in kspacei am
also an experienced third party developer iUFFFDve made
various bots apps and utilities though not as many of them as i
would like are publicly available along with numerous
contributions to the third party developer documentation and am
participating in the ongoing development of the new esi api along
with many other interested third party developers iUFFFDve
also recently started a blog for which iUFFFDve only written
one post so far which should still give you some insight into my
thought process and inform you about some upcoming
changeswhy am i running for csm i know eve inside and out i
have the time for it and trust myself to be responsible with the
role should i be electedwhat would i do on the csm as every
csm member should i will provide feedback to ccp based on the
issues and challenges faced by eveUFFFDs community
along with that these are my primary beliefs and interests which i
will be pursuingcsm transparency the csm is a democratically
elected body and as such the voters deserve an insight into its
workings even though recent councils have major strides with
respect to their transparency the fact remains that the csm is an
opaque body by design despite that i feel there is still progress to
be made and that i could help make that happenprotection of
information the amount of free and accurate intel which can be
collected in eve with little to no risk or effort is astoundingi
believe that most forms of intel collection should require some
kind of investment of resources whether that is in form of players
being active in space or infiltrating competing organizations
deployment of structures which require maintenance and are
vulnerable to assault or interaction with npcsavailability of
information eve is a sandbox and the ingenuity of its players is
responsible for a large part of what it is however many players
both old and new lack awareness of eveUFFFDs various
game mechanics placing them at a huge disadvantageplayers
should experience loss because they made a mistake or were
outsmarted by someone not because they werenUFFFDt
even aware that a certain game mechanic existed and
information on it wasnUFFFDt available to themthird party
content creators they come in many forms third party developers
who make tools that help make some parts of eve less tedious
writers who report on ingame events and help those who
arenUFFFDt actively playing stay in touch with the game
tutorial makers who help educate players on both basic and more
advanced forms of gameplay and streamers who showcase what
eve can be and help bring in more playerswhat all of them have
in common is that they help make eve a better game in a way ccp
couldnUFFFDt manage by themselves which is why ccp
should support them as best as they canthatUFFFDs it from

me on your ballot if you have any questions at all feel free to

hello my fellow eve lovers its that time of the year again where a
handful of pilots run for a chance to hold a seat and be the voice
of players all over new eden through the csm yours truly has
decided to step up to the plate and be a guide for the voices
wanting to be heard to try to improve the game that they love so
much for those of you who dont know how i am let me introduce
myself im brohamo member of ironpig part of sev3rance and
provibloc 2nd generation player to the mach empire i started out
in eve as a child 8 years ago hauling for my father after some
time from the game i came back and took refuge in the region of
providence where i studied under some of the best pilots in the art
of nullsec warfare industry and beholding the nrds bannereve
is an amazing game and there is nothing that can stand up to the
adventures and interactions that you will experience it has many
unique layers that take time and skill to pull back and master and
the chain reactions pure coincidences perfectly executed
strategic moves that players can create and cause just makes
eve a truly worth wild experience my friends i ask that you join
me as we embark on the adventure to breath fresh air into eve
and keep the fresh air circulating as if we were taking nose sips
from our cans of perriair i promise that i wont be overshadowed
by my fellow big time csm members if elected ill be your voice of
reasoning and take time to hear your experiences from all over
new eden and try to preserve the things that have your heart
driven and stuck on this game but in a responsible manner as i
respect and hear out the needs of the other members as we
coordinate to improve and incorporate new mechanics i plan to
dive into the following alpha clones and the new player
experience push for a better balance with auto cannons
maintaining a fairminded unbiased point of view on all events
and discussions that will transpire i ask you once more to join me
as i push for your voices to be heard and really listen to your
feedback and maintain a connection between all parties in and
around eve we all love this game even if we choose to admit it or
not we all really have a love for this game that drives us to log on
every day or so and endure the hardships or the stellar times
please let me show that our love for this game is very similar as i
hear you pleads and concerns to keep you logged in and loving
evethank youcontactvia eve mailemail

still running for csm xii to defend solo players and their fun in this
gamefreedom fighters we need to have a voice inside csm dont
let the biggest enforce their rules to yousleepers must awaken 
character sold
thread temporarily closed pending review
i got the vibe that there was a lot of we dont know how to do
that coming from ccp as though theyve just about hit their limits
for what they can produce and now are in a state where they are
desperately just trying to keep the thing up and running they
seem to be always hiring but never really increasing their
capabilities are they bleeding devs as fast as they are bleeding
players
we dont know what resources are consumed by nda stuff or
other ccp projects but i also get the impression that eve
development atm lacks of skilled resources in both areas
creativity and coding
i also do not agree i think skills should be only available from the
relevant factions and from resellers
got my vote best csm member
i could not be happier that we have a fw pilot running for csm a
voice close to ccps ear squeaky wheel gets the grease
3 judgeyour friendstest
was now you need 10 damage application mods to come close
to the other dreads for hitting stuff
1 great guy knows all things has my vote
yeap good dude1thks for all 
not a meme candidate has made zarvox oface on his stream
pretty sane quality nullsec mining and ratting wellestablished

players join fusenpublic for more infoerr uhh vote for ncc
thanks for the list im in close contact with gorski car ex csm 11
who lobbied hard for a lot of fwlowsec changes and im going to
take over from him and try and push the same things contributer
to eve is easy
thanks
you have my vote
not that any of this matters cause you wont get on
butunderstanding how the csm can effectively work might be
your first stop
this is where most people would list their myriad reasons they are
running for csm maybe they would write out long platform
statements with some overarching narrative their dreams of how
to make eve great againi am not going to do any of those things
because i dont need your votes you terrible pubbies
bump most mediums acs 
in a little over a week i have had a handful of both exciting and
disappointing experiences in this game i feel like i could go on
forever but in the interest of keeping this on track i will share just
a fewi recall attempting to play this game back when i was in high
school and the complexity was a turn off back thenrecently
noticed that alpha accounts werent limited to time constraints i
decided to give this thing another shot went through the tutorial
and paid as much attention as my limited span allowedkept
saying ah man this is much less complicated than i remember i
feel this is in part due to ccps efforts in improving the new player
experiencefor the first session of gameplay i raided the rookie
help channel with as many questions as i could come up with
which helped a tonafter shopping around for a while i have
managed to settle into a corp who has decided to take me under
their wing and provide a more immersive experience to this game
this same corp had a member who was stalking me in a
stealthed proteus while i was mining in lowsec with my venture i
decided to be brave open up private coms with the guy next
thing i know i am a member of a small group of experienced
players who have been nothing but the most valuable part of this
game is this a game or is it a simulation of life in spacei have
braved the frontiers of space and dove head first into wormholes
way under equipped for the adventure i was on infilled my
cargo hold up with my entire life and risked everything i had to
move to a new homemy first highsec ganking experience being
running my frigate straight into a much larger vessel spamming
his smartbombs at the jump gate i was warping tobut i can tell
you the exact minute i was hooked on this gamemy corp invited
me to go roaming with them as a bait ship me not worried about
my killsheet jumped on that opportunity immediately i wanted
redemption i wanted to experience my first hunt and my first
killso here i am sitting in a super tanked out punisher fitted with
an afterburner a warp scrambler and some turrets which i felt
would essentially do nothing just sitting on top of an activation
gate for a faction warfare site trying to attract someone to come
in20 clicks above me and 20 clicks below me my corp mates in
fully fitted curse ships ready to pounce completely invisible on
the directional scan the trap was set i was anxious i was getting
bored we moved around from site to site system to system just
waiting for some action a few highly experienced pilots who
wanted to check the bait would show up and then disappear just
as quickly as they camewell i had practiced using my dscan to
pinpoint down ships in the area low and behold i spot a jackdaw
on the scan and pinpoint it down to a gala rendezvous point he
was out there farming for event skins i let my corp members
know i spotted him they decided it would be worth it to try and
take the fight my orders were to warp in and charge him blind try
to point him down with my warp scrambler to keep him at the site
and they would come in and back me upwe align to site one
last check yup still there i warp in hit approach burn towards
him while locking onto my preywarp scram engaged cmon guys
lets get him he locks me on im taking damage my voice on
coms is getting louder and more excited my shields at 60 30
gone im thinking in my head cmon guys where are you hes
getting away  hes speeding up i lost my scrambler on him
overload your racks they tell me im not guna let him get away
i heat em up and manage to point him down again man that
speed burst and range increase was the make it or break it of this
fight i swearbut still no corp members i have tunnel vision not
watching overlay just hoping they are right behind me and getting
in rangearmor 90 70 cmon guys where are you then
boom all kinds of beautiful and colorful beams are nabbing this
ship right in front of me instantly i felt an equal mixture of relief
and excitement its on his cap is draining hes slowing down to
a crawl woo there goes the drones flying right passed me ten
of them swarm his ship and tear him apart in what felt like
seconds my first kill yeah it was pretty much all my corp mates
but it was my first kill in the game you couldnt shut me up about
it for the rest of the night i felt like a giddy little schoolboy who just
got a kiss from the girl he likedand here it is my corp mates let
me keep all of the contents of his cargo holdwhich i turned
around and made a killing in the market hooked sign me up
this game is a drug that cures my itchso i am sure you are
wondering why i am rambling on about this in the csm assembly
hallwell because i am a new player i decided to read over the
minutes of the last summit in the posts below this one i will be
citing some of the stuff they went over and just offer my input
now i know im the little guy in this and i am only one voice but
maybe just maybe i have a good idea in the bunch maybe its
new maybe its not i havent spent too much time here but with
the new player experience being a hot topic as of late well ill give
it a shot
now to start this off reading the minutes of the summit i sort of
honed in on a specific member who seemed to have new players
on his mind the most xenuriaquotexenuria current state is a
vast and moving social medium in a better state than previously
but needs work dream change would be for the social aspect to
help new players keep playing in a game where the community is
in the drivers seat eve being the shining star of this example
the things i have been told and the experiences i have had thus
far seem to be polar opposites of each othereveryone in this
game is an  you cant trust anyone at any given time you
can be killed or betrayedwhile these statements may hold an
inkling of truth to them so far i have seen and received myself a
great deal of help from veteran players even people who have
killed me out there in lowsec have taken the time to have a
conversation with me and even teach me how to be more
proficient in flying safe i think in general the community is still
pretty darn helpful to newer players even if they do teach you a
harsh lesson
quotexenuria explained that he had guided a number of people
through the npe and that he had found with all of them that they
had been overwhelmed the first time they docked and were asked
to inject a skill one thing he also pointed out was that players are
not told explicitly that skills will always be training regardless of
whether or not you are logged in or not ccp paradox explained
that this is something they have already fixed with the next
versionthe npe did a great job initially and yes even with the
improvements aura does not cover many facets of your options
for character development one thing i did have to do research on
was how attribute points worked both by googling and asking
other players as far as i can recall the tutorial says nothing about
them and very little info is scripted into the game on how they
work
quotexenuria pointed out that one of the things that players have
trouble with still is that weapons have limited rangesnot only
that but they do nothing to explain the damage types that your
weapons do or how certain enemies can be tougher to kill using
them more on this in my personal thoughtsquotexenuria brought
up that it would be good to encourage players to complete a task
that they need to do some learning on their own so as to
encourage them to start getting into the habit of searching for
solutions he pointed out that it needed to be relatively simple so
that they can work it out on their own ccp surge asked if he
thought it should come before the career agents to which xenuria
replied yes  i really like the idea of this but off the bat the only
practical type of scenario i could come up with is where an agent
sends you to bring them something lets call it the mystery box
and there are 3 different ones only one of them being the correct
answer which could cause you to spend extra time on your
mission finding the right itemi see it as a test maybe you could
get one before you set off for your first agent missions become
available then to end each of the starting agents the same type
of scenarioquote xenuria asked if it would be possible to pay to
force a video to be played in a specific area for the purpose of
psychological warfare to which ccp replied maybe ccp also
added that keeping videos in rotation is going to have a cost in
the future and that you would add them through account
management  such an awesome idea keep them coming i
really hope that this makes it into the game some
dayquotexenuria added that it would be good to make it so that
the tasks also assess how well you completed the objective
rather than did you complete the condition ccp surge like the idea
of an efficiency rating i really like this idea too it seems that
when i was running my missions i was being reckless the entire
time in order to get it done quickly all i wanted was the mission
speed bonus for a bigger pay out i learned nothing about how
well i was doing in a realistic perspective i think that other factors
which affect the payout could help shape a pilot for the bettermy
personal thoughts and suggestions one thing i wish i had learned
earlier on in this game was about resistances since i am limited
to faction specific weaponry being amarr its beam and pulse
lasers along with my ships resistances and modules which could
helpperhaps find a way for pilots to learn about them could be
as simple as having an agent mentionthese insert whoever
your fighting here tend to favor insert whatever type of damage
their weapons do and the ships they favor flying are most
vulnerable to insert whatever type of damage here i suggest
you fit your ship to compensate for the parameters of this mission
the first time i had ever seen this was on one of ccps youtube
videos talking about the gala event i thought it might be nice for
agents to offer the same kind of info sometimes especially the
lower level missions i feel this could help pilots learn how to be
more efficient and effective with the ships they flyfor a quality of
life suggestion after learning how to use the market better there
is one thing that still ercks me everytimewhen i have buy and sell
orders up and i use the my orders tab to look them up i would
love to see a colored bar on them if they are still the highest price
purchase order or the lowest price sell order i like that i can see
them in the market details clearly marked in blue but if i have a
lot of them on the market it really is a pain to individually have to
check on them to make sure i am still offering the best pricenow i
know that scams are a part of this game and the learning curve is
really steep but there is a specific item i looked up which is still in
game and as far as i know serves no purpose anymore which
are the attribute boosters from previous events which are now
expired i know very little about them so this could be a shot in the
dark but instead of them only being sold on market to swindle
someone out of their money maybe offer an option to repurpose
them somehowwell i hope someone else here sees this and likes
my input thanks for allowing me to take your time
blackbeard
ill vote for you because the csm seems like a joke and you are
good at those
you sure op intended to do what you think he intended to do
i had to share car rides with xenuria to and from the airport at both
summits he did not murder me 1edit also he got you pink
skins
i should note pink skins have been heavily pushed in the past
sugar kept asking for them pink skins being short hand for oh
god give me bright colors
                                                                      1
speaking from experience sullen is one of the hardest working
members of csm xi before last years election season id never
talked to him before almost immediately after our term started he
had proven himself as a knowledgeable guy with a great work
ethic i dont think i could ever say enough good things about how
he has presented himself on csm xi he has without a doubt
earned a second term on the csm and would be an asset for the
csm ccp and the player base if you dont have sullen somewhere
on your ballot youre making a mistake

the problem is you lack vision and inspiration sean would
chastise you for the same rip vr
behind the tough exterior hes actually a pretty nice guy kind of
like the cool dad figure on csm 11 also he finds good beer in
iceland
greetings amantus i am not an expert in transhumanism but you
can submit your ideas here space techno nightclub could be an
alternative to space bar we could imagine being able to mix with
your keyboard and mouse wheelimagine being able to send vip
tickets to your friends to join your private techno party where you
could mix even if i am a huge fan of ccp and especially ccp
fozzie and his hard work to balance the game i quite dont
understand how is it possible that new eden hasnt space techno
party gameplay implemented already
good luck geckoan idea for you  ship builder corporations logos
could be on ships or if too difficult to do on all ships maybe some
types of ships can have a builders mark of some sort if my
corporation builds a ship and we sell it and the buyer sees our
logoticker maybe they want to contact us to get more shipsbuilt
in advertisement 3 tasha
with the thousands of years there is to play with as far as ingame
lore goes and with what has been done already to bring that lore
to the player i do agree that there could be more added to the
game in that regard for all security spaces i also agree entirely
that nrds and the idea behind providence is great for the new
player experience and would like to see more than a generic plus
or negative 5 or 10
i personally would like to see boost ships put back into system
wide boosting instead of on grid boosting as it makes miners lifes
more harder and more expensive when trying to work in the fields
and you need to spend like 10 mins trying to warp a giant boost
ship out the belt before a fleet of ceptors comes and scrams you
while dropping cynos for others to blow you upthe way boosts
worked before was fine i dont mind keeping the ammo charges
just would love to see boost ships back in safe spots boosting
system wide instead of forcing people to sacrifice there own
mining fleets to get a personal booster as there isnt enough
people around in any system to boost fleets so lots suffer from
lack of bonus ore gains specially the people who are dedicated to
indy2nd thought something to tackle the issue of afk cloaky
campers in systems yes they are annoying as hell to deal with
and worse when they not even there 90 time maybe add a afk
timer logout system to the game where if you dont click
something in x time you get logged out or add a module to sov
holder systems where you can detect there cloaked ships or
even a tower module that decloaks ships in a entire system so
we can combat scan them down and kill them while they are afk
sleeping all time something that has bugged many players for
years this situation has and no one has tackled it personally3rd
thought maybe add some new ships to the game not t3
combats but maybe a new form of miningindy ship something
that is like the current t2 ships but can mine more like a rorqual
but isnt as big as one and slow as one and also update the
industrial ships i mean a miasmos in null with 63k hold isnt
enough and im not saying bring freighters into it im suggesting
maybe a bigger hold ship designed for oremineral moving for the
people who mine with fleets of alts and dont like to dock ships
every 5 minutesthese are just some thoughts i had lingering in
my mind and thought would throw them out in a moment of just
hoping maybe one day they will become a reality 
full support for gecko as csm best of luck buddy oideas to talk to
ccp about jump bridge modules for citadelswider range of
standings colorus would be very much appreciatedactive cloak
timer ie max 1 hour cloak before a cooldownfixing the pocos
not seeingusing alliance standingsmoon harvesters capable of
harvesting the abundance 2 matsmoon goo reactors for
citadelsa new capital of some breed  vov just my crazy ideas
best of luck got my vote o
wishing you all the best for csm well all be there championing
you for the spoti would really like to get cloaky camping looked
at we all know its an age old mechanic but i think it really needs
to be reviewed as the game moves on when offgrid boosting
was in effect the number one complaint was that well offgrid
boosting is a thing minersindies complained that
gankerswardeccers used combat boosts from across the system
and likewise they complained that orcasrorquals were sitting safe
in pos shieldstethers with impunity that changed in ascension
and here we are nowcloaky camping brings up a number of
issues especially in null a single person in a cheap cloaky ship
can in effect cripple activities in a system now while there is no
problem with this mechanic per se  after all if he is there at the
controls more power to him for being able to do thatthe problem
is whats stopping someone logging in after dt cloaking up and
leaving for the whole day they are not actively playing the game
and aside from the one in a billion chance of someone decloaking
them by bumping into them they are totally immune and they are
having an effect on the system without potentially being there
now increase this to multiple pilots and you see what i am getting
ati think cloaking should have a timed mechanic whereby a
cloaked ship must do an action within a certain time limit  for
example change heading move not necessarily decloak in
essence showing that the pilot is still there if they do not the
cloaking module starts to take overheat damage and with each
time limit passed it gets prone to failure once it has started to
take heat damage from running too long without any action then
it shuts down for x minutesif you want to build in a lore
explanation the cloaking device starts heating up while all other
ship systems are not working without sufficient cooling on behalf
of the ships systems running the device starts to faili think if
such a mechanic was set up even with the time limit set to as
long as an hour it would have a big improvement on the
gameplay forcing players whose entire mechanic is to camp
cloak systems to actually be at their consoles or if this was to be
put to more detailed effect a skill can be introduced cloaking
specialization where you can increase your cloak timer for each
level the maximum should still not exceed one hour
one more idea for quality of life  and a simple one to
implementeach combat ship should have an ammo bay unlike a
fleet hangar or drone bay however this should literally just be a
label so the overall space is still combined with the normal cargo
bay but this would allow us to keep ammo  boosters in a
separate area to the main cargo and not accidentally offload them
when clearing out bought items salvage if ratting etc so it has no
effect on the actual cargo capacity of the ship as the cargo bay 
ammo bay are still combined in size but just allows us to
categorise charges your favourite ship  ammo bay  drone
bayjust a thought
here is a couple of ideas for you 1 target management a clear
way to see who in your fleet is shooting at so the fleet can
concentrate fire or each of them can shoot at another target to
make fights more efficient 2 a way to share missions so anyone
in the fleet can read the mission and objectives also being able to
warp to the mission on the agents missions list independantly 3
fleet warping to agent mission bookmarkshope these help you
go gecko bring passive mining boosts back  and make
items in hangaras multi split my best wishes for your election
hey gl manwould like to see a buff tot he rate npc space spawns
anomalies we cannot upgrade the ihubs or anything so some
days content is sparse at bestkali
good luck at the polls gecko gecko and his corp are
representative of the best of providence we have a very inclusive
group of players and with nrds provide an enclave in null sec that
is perhaps not unique but allows for nonalliance players and
corps to feel as safe as our ownaside from some of the great
ideas already posted in this thread is some kind of installation that
allows citadels to scan down cloaked ships that have been
inactive for hours on end aka afk campers  if there were a 2 or
3 hour scan time for scanning down cloaked ships it would
dissuade people from logging in their favourite cloak cyno ship
and then going to workgfc  gecko for csm
gecko you are the nicest person and i know everyone who meets
you in rl will adore you you have been here since our early days
and i know you will represent afk well may you help to open new
doors of opportunity for all and earn respect for the nrds way
even though it is the hardest and often unsafest way we can
play we share the fundamental belief that our values cannot be
compromised we enjoy helping those who need it and we hold
ourselves above the savages that ruin the experience for others
although evildoers may gain strength now from their many victims
tears we introduce more players every day to nrds who will work
tirelessly against those who grief and scam players i know you
will listen to peopleUFFFDs feedback with enthusiasm and
help them always from many backgrounds of diversity we are
nevertheless united and from all of us may you gather the
strength of ideas wisdom faith and trustto ccp fix the bugs
slow down the changesi would personally like to see you slow
down on some of the radical changes to the game a little
itUFFFDs exciting to see new additions to the game but when
so many changes are introduced at one time and constantly more
on top of that repeatedly it leaves even many older players feeling
noobish and itUFFFDs not quite as fun to relearn things you
were already good at over and over the excitement that should be
like UFFFDhey thereUFFFDs changes
awesomeUFFFD often sounds more like UFFFDccp and
all these  changes grumble grumbleUFFFD
people may poke their heads in because UFFFDyey free
alpasUFFFD but they quickly feel overwhelmed and lose
attention faster than they get the interest to plex their accounts
and become invested in playing again the reason you have a
much smaller active audience at any given time now than
historically is because most people simply cannot keep up with
the enthusiasm of your team to implement great new things and
they feel left behind save up some of the new ideas you want to
add in and mix them in a little slower thereUFFFDs nothing
wrong with the changes but the last few years have been
increasingly excessive in how many and how close together go
back and spend some time and fix the kinks that drive us all crazy
from day to day and everyone will love you for it and
youUFFFDll give your inactive veteran players a chance to
catch up and make full comebacks if you feel the need to go into
hero coding mode your production types will love you if you make
the industry window lag a little less but please stop changing
things so much that many need to spend more time reading up on
all the changes than playing the actual gamedrive more industrial
corporation growth tidy up the bpo lockdown interfaceif theres
one thing i would like to see addressed is that the entire bpo
lockdown functionality is way overdue for an overhaul the voting
process is tiresome with the way the window drop downs dont
keep track of batch lockdowns ccp please go try to lock down
100 bpoUFFFDs and see how long it takes you even when
you totally understand the game mechanics itUFFFDs really
brutal even for your die hard bpo collectors im not saying to go
change the formula of how many minerals each bpo needs to
build something again or to change the max mepe again or to
phase out more bpoUFFFDs we all spent time researching 
im just saying its a pain in the rear to lock bpos down and thats
why so many corps have thefts of them if this mechanic was
easier more corporations could buy more bpos and build nicer
collections to be selfsufficient selfsufficiency means when
someone plays with the market prices in game you can build
things yourself so it would have an effect on the way power
alliances can drive market prices while also better enabling the
ability of corporations to work together to share their assets
effectively and unite efforts around stable and consistent
gameplay styles help the industrial corps to grow by making the
lockdown voting be a lot tidier looking of an interfacegood luck

gecko for csm oif ccp could make a module that would help
capsuleers fight against cloaky campers that would be great
some way that they cannot just leave the pc while staying cloaked
all the time something that would require them to be actively at
the gamebest of luckyou have my vote d
gecko for csm oi support this idea no more afk then 10 minutes
for this  hhmmm  people
on grid boosting is fine god i know ima get hateregarding
standings listrather than having every playercorpalliance add
members to their limited list taking up a slot and having this
repeat across multiple playerscorpalliances ccp should allow
example cva to generate lists with those they deem
redorangeneutblueblahblahblah their allies can then choose
which lists to follow overall this should cut back on how many
active lists are out there and with multiple lists it could get rid of
the cap on number of slots we currently havewar or lack there
ofwar declarations should have a reason not just because
example corp a declares war on corp b over 1 or more of the
asteroid belts on a system corp a can then attack corp b only and
only if they are in said asteroid belts if the war is over an entire
system then the cost goes up but now corp a can attack corp b
any where in the system constellation then region example 2
corp a wants a phisical object say a poco corp a declares war
over said poco crop b can choose to end the war by surrendering
the poco corp a would then pay corp b for the poco at market
value and ending the war after all the war was over the poco
crop b can choose to fight over the poco which means that within
the grid of the poco corp a and b can go at itthis would only
apply to highsec and lowsec systems null after all is lawless
a few simple ideas that i dont know why still havent been done
hell ill fly to iceland and code it in if need be  allow
repackaging of items in containers since there is no properly
defined hangar structure and we use containers let us repackage
stuff in there such a massive pain to have to keep dragging
things out and back in same goes for reprocessing 
compressing ore allow us to drag chat tabs into any order we
want nothing worse than accidentally ripping a tab out of the chat
window and then having to rip them all out just to position back in
the same spot chat window settings  adding an option to apply
to all channels so that font size portrait size etc are applied to all
windows  structure advertising boards  when right clicking a
structure and selecting show info there should be a panel like
the character bio where the owner can put any text they like
this would be great to advertise what rigsmodules are in a
structure rathar than having to look at the services tab and in
case of engineering complexes having to look in the industry tab
for the system and working out what has bonuses to which items
i heard there were upcoming podcasts interviewing the candidate
that true
yeah scylus why dont you post that schedule
removed an off topic post
will you be endorsed by those bee guys again this year or are you
running as an independent candidate
fair questiondue to the math behind ballots and the total amount
of seats being reduced to 10 i will likely only have a symbolic
place on the official goon ballot its important for them to get their
people back in so that slots on the ballot that matter are 13 and
those slots are going to be reserved for directors and what goons
call operators my position on the goon ballot if i am on it at all
will not really contribute to my reelection because runoff is much
lower with only 10 seats
just like last year steve has my vote he runs on a platform few
others do and he does it with skill no offense to other
candidates but there are too many bloc candidates and they
represent only a small part of eve nullsec
im mostly still running to  off j mclain ya damn choob
from cz
is it possible to see the damage per weapon system graph 
hiyasome more thoughts for you1move the x remove item to the
right of ask price box in the multi sell window instead of or as well
as to the left of quantity box so the name of item doesnt get in
the way and can be clicked easier when enlarging regional
average percentages to the right2choice to make windows as
transparent as you like so you can have windows open and
choose to see background or not especially in space where it is
more dangerous3would be good if everything you can do right
clicking overlay like align to or warp fleet could be done on the
plotted route under a route on the left of the screen too4to be
able to engage salvage mine or repair using drones by right
clicking on anchored target list5to receive a notification when
industryresearch jobs you are waiting for are completed6to be
able to see fleet members shieldarmour and hull hp without
locking on to them maybe hover over them mainly for repair
reasons and engagement
the application period ended on the 17th did you submit your
application in time
yes i didi didnt make a post yet because straight after handing in
the application i went on a holiday just got back last saturday 
lowsec candidates yes please d1 for white
i like aryth he is really good with numbers
as i said a year ago you can try to convince me your a bad guy
but it wont work
make scanning great againscanning and finding hidden content
in a system currently everything shows up in the probe scan
window it may not be 100 but it showed it was there the joy of
jumping into a system and not knowing if you would even find
something is gonekeep the current system as is but add new
hidden content for those looking for actual adventure not just
repetition
thank you all for the posts btw more info on candidates for your
list beside myself naturally   can be found at csmwire
im excited i have been in touch with all the factions i have
received feedback from 3 i will continue to reach out to ensure
that the desires of each faction is represented in csmi truly view
this candidacy as a forum to bring our fw pvp and low sec
interests to the tablei am being interviewed tomorrow 222 by
kirith kodachi i have two podcasts scheduled on 35 and one on
34i am waiting to hear back from crossing zebras they
interviewed me a couple years ago all my personal data and
some previous fw  low sec experience is in my eve biofly
dangerous former executor templis calsf alliance
still open for questionscomments 
i believe removing the refit ability for triage and all capitals in
general with an aggression timer was a good idea second i think
that lowsec in general cant be prevented from becoming bloc
dominated but it can be hard to run huge empires by making
structures that make money stay vulnerable to small entitles like
moon poses and pocos i think eve is in a middle zone its easier
then ever to be a new player joining the game and its definitely
still a veterans game this is a fine line however

to keep voting for steve or not now that is the real questionso
steve are you going to stand up for keeping the economic
numbers marketdata as it is or are you going to let some
goon with a overactive paranoia whine loud enough so ccp to
takes it away or reduces the accuracy of it 
i have passed the arguments ive seen for keeping the data at
the current accuracy on to ccp in the end its their decision i can
try and influence it and now have but i cant force them
i was wondering if you wouldnt mind answering some
questions1 you indicated you ran an alliance before moving to
providence what type of alliance did you run and why did you
leaveshut it down2 you lead small ship 2040 man gangs have
you ever been involved in entosis warfare and if so what are
your thoughts on the subject3 you indicated that you will
represent all players equally no matter where they come from it
sounds like most of your experience is in null sec do you think
you have enough experience to represent other areas of the
game how much experience do you have in high sec low sec
and wormhole space4 a lot of players perhaps even a majority
dont realize the csm even exists how do you plan on getting
feedback from players5 did you submit your paperwork to get
on the ballot
1 you indicated you ran an alliance before moving to providence
what type of alliance did you run and why did you leaveshut it
downso at the time it was a mainly industrial alliance we were
branching out and doing other things pvp was something we had
started along with our trips into wormholes if i remember right we
even had a corp that had its own wormhole join us in the last few
weeks of the alliance sadly the alliance got shut down due to
disagreements with one of the other main corps about getting our
first citadel and the fact i was going to be raising the isk to buy an
astrahus bpo but fell about a billion short the other corp then left
after thinking that they were putting in all the effort as they had
got build materials together from that point on a lot of us went our
separate ways some of my corps guys folded in with them and
headed off to volt others found other homes i came to provi and
one guy is still keeping the old corp up i would certainly say that i
was inexperienced at the time but we also found problems with
the alliance management ui or therefore lack of it we had been
planning on going it setting up roles and get everything else we
needed to set up sadly we never had at our disposal the stuff to
do any of that so we were frantically trying to setup alternatives2
you lead small ship 2040 man gangs have you ever been
involved in entosis warfare and if so what are your thoughts on
the subjectsadly entosis warfare is not something i have been
directly involved in ive flown in fleets with provi to help defend
systems while the sovholder does there entosis work that said i
have seen both positive and negative attitudes to entosis warfare
and i would say this is certainly one of the areas that is an
example of my willingness to listen to what people have to say i
dont have great experience so im not going to have a bias to one
side or the other3 you indicated that you will represent all
players equally no matter where they come from it sounds like
most of your experience is in null sec do you think you have
enough experience to represent other areas of the game how
much experience do you have in high sec low sec and wormhole
spacerecent experience is in null sec however before that i
spent a lot of time up in highsec running an industrial lifestyle
along with my alliance that i lead at the time we also had some
great guys that took us into wormholes for daytrips to run sites
and huff gas a few times i took some small gangs out into low
sec to find some fights sadly where we went it was uncommon to
find people around however fun was had when we did find them
and i also have some funny stories from when i didnt know the
mechanics all too well 4 a lot of players perhaps even a
majority dont realize the csm even exists how do you plan on
getting feedback from playersnaturally that is a hard one due to
the fact they dont know it exists personally i would be making
pushes on as many forms of social media as possible to reach out
to them also using reddit and the forums however to get to those
that dont use that stuff i would personally like to see some
ingame notifications done to some extent something like hey the
csm are looking for player feedback on activity please help them
out that way you can try and draw more people into the fold of at
least knowing it exists from there you can get them
communicating if they hadnt already started5 did you submit
your paperwork to get on the ballotyes i had that issue the first
time where it didnt go through but huge props to ccp guard for
clearing that upthank you for the questions  hope you enjoy the
answers
csm is more like a sounding board or a board made up of interest
organisations without decision power than any political entity like
office politics you dont decide by voteif you think lying is a
wanted part of politics youre probably unfit for office and if you
think the csm can decide ccps priorities you need a reality check
kind of like cq got come to think of it
could not think of a better dude to be on the csm

stay tuned for interview with matteralalso debate this weekend
how did the first interview go link
first off ive known the judge for years nowas far as i remember
hes always been present for people inside of our alliance or
people outside of our alliance as head diplomat and so always
been a kind diplomatmore closely he has ideas and his plans
always been to enhance peoples gameplay and to keep eve
online at its besthis last career as csm member has shown that
he followed for what he said and continuously brought feedbacks
presence ideas and to ccp and to its communityhes got all my
votes for the following years
i was wondering if you would answer some questions1 you say
you run incursions do you fly with one of the communities on a
regular basis also do you think the payout for incursions is too
high too low or just right2 you say that youve been involved in
factional warfare which faction and was it more as a plex farmer
or were you involved in combat3 it sounds like you have a
separate character for each area of the game you participate in
do you think that eve requires multiple accounts to play and do
you think that ccp should cater to those with multiple accounts4
you said you have a character in test were you involved in the
catch war last month if so what is your opinion of the current
sov warfare mechanics
1 i think the pay out is good however i do feel that the site
mechanics may be adapted more improved ai the hardship in
incursions is getting the fleets organized and enduring the
endless grind2 in factional warfare i fought for amarr this lead
to both combat as well as plexing i did not find this part of the
game as thrilling as for example null sec warfare or npsi fleets 3
i do not believe that you will need multiple characters to play eve
online i have played the first 3 years without additional
characters it was not untill a friend of mine decided to quit and
give me his character that i started multiboxing however i do
believe that playing the game with more characters really adds
value to the quality of the gameplay in short i wished i start
multiboxing earlierccp should cater people with multiple
accounts like a staffle discount first account 100 second
account 95 or something this way ccp would award loyal
players who have made this game what it is today and reward
players who are looking to invest more time and energy therefor
convincing more players to create more accounts4 i really
dislike the current sov warfare mechanics ccp changed them
because it was supposed to lead to more interaction and combat
however i felt besides the bugs where timers ran out and then
didnt disappear that it became more of an endless grind more
boring then actually the incursion grind ofcourse my sense of
humor moves me to say that it was ofcourse because test
alliance is best alliance and nobody opposes us in catch and
esoteria region extrai also do believe ccp should allow name
changing its one of those things that could not only bring in 
but also add more value to the game for example people who
started out as a joke then got hooked but stuck with a  ass
named character or people who buysell characters and people
who got characters like me cause i really do not like the name
adare darmazaf my test character1 there should be a name
history involved so people can always track them2 searching on
character unique id numbers3 name changing should be
expensive so people wouldnt change names every week or
somore rules could be put up to make sure abuse of this
mechanic would not occurthank you for your interest rosewalker
hopefully this answered some of your questions if you have
anything else do not hesitate to ask

eve i believe she would be positive and productive csm member
im planning to give her a vote from all my accounts

communication in eve is predominately in english and i am
chilean i have learned to play by the teachings of my fellows in
englishi would like to improve the game for spanish speaking

your passport to ccp
edited  23022017
excuse me  cause im pretty new in all that csm stuffdo you have
already prepare ideas for the points what u described or its likeif
you choose me ill take care about it and figure it out something
hey nayethanks for your query i do already have a few ideas
written down from the dot points that i mention in my main post
some ideas are still a workinprogress of course there will be
more ideas to come in the future and i am always open to ideas
from the player community as the csm are meant to be a bridge
between the community and ccp i feel that a lot of these ideas
would need to be discussed with ccp first before coming up with a
solid plan to tackle the improvements or feedback suggested by
players some ideas suggested by players might already be
something that ccp is working on so there is a possibility that
there is a working plan in place for some of these ideas as a csm
i cannot promise to take care of things for you but i will do my
very best to allow your voice to be heard by ccpthanksviktor
introductionwelcome prospective disciples of the rorqual while i
normally would begin with a lengthy sermon as to why the rorqual
is the finest ship in eve and that all capsuleers should aspire to fly
one im pretty late in posting this as it is first think about these
questionsare you satisfied with flying a single ishtar for your dank
ratting ticks or do you find it necessary to afk five of them on all
the havens in the system do you hate hisec incursion community
voice comms so much that you have or will build an incursion fleet
to clear sites all by yourself do you believe proper solo pvp is
baiting svipuls into medium plexes where your five recon alts are
happily orbiting the beacon do you like to drop 10 or more
bombers on hapless provi ratters or afk freighter pilots do you
believe that unless youre making more than 1bn iskhr youre
playing like a casual if your answer to any of the above
questions are yes or at least maybe keep readingplatformdo you
enjoy multiboxing i do a lot and there have been a lot of
changes and new restrictions on multiboxing over the past few
years  such as no broadcasting and partial window overlays
some of these changes are fair and i have zero intent on trying to
change the current eula however there is a stigma that
sometimes comes to multiboxers  a belief that they may be
botting or skirting the rules suicide gank multibox pilots getting
banned for nebulous reasons who on the csm have stood for and
defended multiboxers how many times was multiboxing
referenced in the last csm summit well if you vote for me ill
stand for youabout mei started out in euni doing the normal new
player things and eventually joined mercenary coalition to
participate in my first large scale conflict since starting to play eve
but it wasnt enough just being a single dps or logistics pilot in
fleets i needed to do more whether this was bringing in alt links
spreading out cynos readying a capital alt  i wanted to do more
than just f1 it was around the middle of last year i saw a post on
reve claiming that you could make 12b an hour multiboxing
vanguard sites welp here i am doing that and a bunch of other
things with far too many accounts ive done regionwide cloaky
camping and salt mining icebelt clearing in one and a half hours
mining praise the rorqual infuriating griffin swarms 165 p0p2
planets yeah that only lasted a month and dropping 10
bombers on snakes ive got a few more things in the cooker as
well the kusions cant have all the fun ive also been involved
with our alliance tournament team in addition to shooting stuff for
profit building api tools using xml through esi happy to share if
requested promoting mining cultural revolutions and battled the
menace that is ess drama so while i can hold the door on
negative impacts to multiboxing i also have enough experience to
discuss other aspects of the game and relate back to the
playerbasewhy i stand outthere are a lot of big names on the
ballot and four fewer spots to fill  i get it ive got my work cut out
for me however if you consider my platform and my
accomplishments some things stand out organizational
capability exposure to a wide range of eve and unadulterated
efficiency i feel these are strong attributes of an effective csm
member and if youve been paying attention i have a ton of
bloody characters im pretty damn invested in this game so its in
my great interest to see it continue to grow and continue to be
engaging this is why i am running for csm and why you should
vote for methank you for readingside note late thread posting
the application was submitted within the deadlinecontactreddit 
elowenn preferreddiscord  solidus1465 personal channel for

reserved as thats the thing to do avoids reserving 10 times per
habit
solidus may be a carebear scrublord but hes our lovable
scrublordyou have my axeand my vote
so key braodcasting isnt likely to return as it opens up a can of
worms for botting and non human controlled input what are your
throughts on thisalso i run 4 accounts in incursions with no
isboxer or anything its easy enough to do without it
1 endorsement
yeah input broadcasting is very close to botting albeit some
mmos allow it currently wow to my knowledge is one of them i
dont intend to advocate for change on that particular aspect
there are methods out there to quickly and efficiently perform
actions on multiple clients legally eveo preview a hotkey that
opens the next window  but the concern i have is that ccp
reviews this activity server side rather than client side what
happens when a multiboxer gets good enough to get those inputs
in on a single or twotick cycle this is what i want to look at
further
so i run 4 of 10 accounts in an incursion now its muscle memory
at this point but its also fair with scroll time and that i rarely if ever
have actions effect more than 1 account per second i think or i
believe their system would be smart enough to see broadcasting
happen serverside as its not easy to hit for instance vanguard
incursions 10 accounts in the same 2 second window i run 4
screens and move the cursor between them doing everything
manualy i feel that this is fair as it falls in the eula as fair game to
do due to the past controversy over isboxer and key broadcasting
what makes you think ccp would be amenable to this change
considering the long term bans people have recieved over it
currently should these people have their accounts reactivated
retroactively
somehow i doubleposted
have you filled out the application form and submitted a
photocopy of your passport to ccp
fact is you were probably not around in eves early yearsfact is
eve grew fastest in the ovuer years and tapered off and then
declined after that fact is for years ccp falcon and others have not
understood why how and what eve was designed as and so
have never understood why it was initially successful and why it
then stagnated when it veered off courselikelihood is given its
early success something relatively rare for mmos launched by
small independents it should have continued to grow even if that
growth was modest but it didnt in business thats called success
declining is called failurethe fact that is most appropriate and
important in terms of your quote above is eve grew fastest at the
time when the devs actively discouraged and denounced
ganking and that was in the first critical years of eve while ovuer
the original lead dev and the person most responsible for it
becoming a reality was at the helm ovuer link on ganking
you clutch to that quote like an orphan might to the last remaining
photograph of their long deceased parents who gazes longingly
at it remembering better times that really only exist in their mind if
you put that quote into a search engine it is apparent that you
have trotted it out multiple times over the years to make a point
that simply isnt true first it doesnt mean what you think it
means oveur said not easily for design intention of pirating he
didnt say that all highsec violence should be impossible or
something like that well pirating is not easy in highsec almost all
transport goes unmolested in highsec and only a small number of
players even attempt it ccp spent years after that quote nerfing
highsec piracy by removing insurance buffing hulls and concord
and the like to make highsec a hard place to be a pirate second
over the years multiple ccp devs have confirmed that suicide
ganking and a not 100 safe highsec is working as intended ive
linked some in this thread already but you also can find
examples in the minutes p 59 or this devblog detailing changes
to suicide ganking which specifically says they want players to be
able to shoot each other in highsec heck if you go through those
search results youll even see your beloved ccp oveur use
phrases like you can pvp anywhere as long as you take the
consequences you are denying the undeniable ccp wants non
consensual pvp to be possible in highsec and ccp intends for it
not to be 100 safe this has always been the case since eve
was just in the conceptual stage all through to today i dont know
why or how you have constructed this alternate reality in your
head which claims that for some reason ccp has been unable to
make highsec safe after all these years even though they really
want it to be or that ccp oveur had some divine claim to the
development of eve online and was doing his best to make
highsec 100 safe but was usurped by ccp falcon and his htfu
crew but you are completely mistaken actually probably more
like completely deluded your alternate history is utterly false and
requires leaps of faith and in logic so large it would do the most
rabid conspiracy theorist credit seriously your bemoaning the
fact the eve online isnt what you want it to be serves no one eve
is what it is and that unambiguously includes an unsafe highsec
where you are indeed at risk to other players and it always has
even back in oveurs days in fact since oveur left highsec has
only been made safer year after year buff after buff and that has
correlated with less logins less activity and less content in
highsec and in the rest of new eden i shudder to think what would
happen if in your alternative universe a ccp oveur was still a lead
developer and was given free reign to implement the carebear
paradise you accuse him of wanting the servers probably would
have been shut off years ago good thing this is all just in your
head
but it isnt just in zionas head the attempts to make hs safer and
safer answering the call of the carebears to nerf wars nerf
ganking is indeed a thing of course ccp does it and it never works
out that is why we keep hearing the whine for more nerfs
i have for the last while been dealing with a lag producing
problem that is the in station advertisments are such that they do
produce lag to a point i can not access my containers to place or
retrieve items i need i have a low end laptop using intergrated
graphics and it literally has to be able to over come this by some
meansso there fore my proposal is thisthat we should have the
option made available to turn off the advertising especially on
lower end systems as mine isthere should be a method through
the menu to do this like you can with the dynamic camera which i
turned off as a result of the lag as well when changing ships
there is no need to create an environment that would force me to
upgrade to a high performance system because of thiswho ever
is responsible for this needs to go and see what can be done to
introduce a method to turn those off and release it to tq makes for
a qol improvementthank you

the live stream available on playback via eve prosper yourube or
twitch channels
new contentan interview in german on evepodcastde
scylus has built ccdm from a 50 man single corp into the biggest
fw alliance in a  militiathe man knows his stuff got my vote for
sure
even though i havent known scylus that long he is a clear
forerunner in the fw space with templis running solidly in the
warzone under his command i think he is the clear choice to
represent the lowsec space he has been in the area for a long
time and understands the dynamic changes that the global
changes have made to our sectors1 for scylus
short friendly interview i did with scylus about his csm run this
evening
so now that youre being evicted are you going to mjd out of your
csm campaign
thank you so much mynxee that means a lot to me
                                                                     1
just curious are you involved in any of the debates i heard are
upcoming
yes i will be in one of the ones that are being hosted by jeffrhivre
on the 5th of march also just completed an interview with
matterall
it depends really  when you use a lot of accounts you want to be
efficient as long as youre not broadcasting you can still get
good enough to get multiple character actions out per tick i
would be able to bring these perspectives to ccp in a more direct
fashion as part of the csm ultimately it is up to ccp to enforce their
eula but if they were to review borderline cases and understand
what could be done legally they could reconsider their choices
csms can only advocate and that would be my plan 
why are we terrible pubbies
of course its in my head  where else would it be i have first hand
knowledge and experience of eve from its inception to launch
over every change and expansion do youoveurs post is trotted
out whenever i read nonesense like your post you are either
deliberately misleading or ignorantly misleading people on the
forums with crap like thatthe post states a number of things and
its from the ultimate source the lead and original eve
developersee next post for details
oveurs post1 piracy  ganking in high sec should be difficult  its
absurdly easy 2 highsec is supposed to be relatively safe
compared to low null its currently the most dangerous space for
various reasons oveur bolded this to emphasize it3 he states
you should need to go to low null for nonconsensual pvpfact is
pvp in eve was always supposed to be nonconsensual war decs
were put into game to allow for pvp in high sec risk was
supposed to be high especially in high sec low risk concord
protected easy ganking with low cost ships is an abberation from
the intended high risk designed pvpnow things have changed no
doubt we have new devs who have lost or never understood the
hardcore philosophy of original eve however if you try to claim it
was always easy and the design was always the way it is now ill
post oveurs statement again to show youre full of it
piracy as a profession is almost impossible in highsec either we
are looking at a different set of facts or you have an
unconventional use of the term the only thing you can make a
profit shooting in highsec is haulers that another player has
chosen to put too much value into mining ships even the most
undertanked ones do not drop enough to allow the suicide
ganker to make a living maybe they can cover the costs in the
best case scooping their own wreck but there is no isk for a
pirate there and the tanked ones it can take a dozen players
and 100m isk loss in ships to shoot it what all for 10m isk in loot
drops mission ships are even more safe and usually have the
protection of a mission gate that makes them 100 safe in there
from outlaws haulers are the only thing that can be shot for
piracy simply because the player gets to determine how much to
put in there no matter how high ccp sets the costs to attack the
hauler can put more goods in the ship thus making themselves a
profitable target for the pirate however ccp has raised the cost to
attack over and over again leaving quite a generous window for
haulers to operate it takes dozens of players and hundreds of
millions in ships to even attempt an attack on a freighter which
can yield nothing if the attack is thwarted by the hauler or her
friends or if the loot fairy is unkind i can get that someone might
claim that suicide ganking isnt hard enough because hey why
not complain that the other guy has it too easy whining is easy
and cheap certainly less difficult than actually playing the game
therefore i can easily just write you off as uninformed or
perhaps more likely in your case a person with an agenda to
make highsec 100 safe because you have brought too much of
your realworld persona and morals into a spaceship shooting
video game what i cant get is how you constructed a narrative in
your head that highsec piracy is somehow easier than it used to
be in oveurs time and that is hurting the game somehow back in
that era ships were flimsier concord took much longer to arrive
and even if you failed a suicide gank the silly people at pend
insurance would reimburse a large fraction of the cost of your
ship at times you could make a living as a pirate just suiciding
your battleship into the side of a station because the insurance
payout was higher than the cost of the ship the reality is
mechanically highsec has never been safer this is undeniable
there have been dozens of changes both direct and indirect to
highsec piracy and with only a few exceptions they have all gone
in the same direction they nerfed it and made it harder just like
oveur said ccp intends and it has worked most people in highsec
have nothing to fear from a pirate  the costs to attack are so high
there is zero profit to be had in the majority of cases the only
reason highsec piracy happens at all is that haulers especially
the most imprudent of them have adjusted to each increase in
safety by hauling more stuff and there are just so many of players
in general attracted by the safety highsec generally offers all the
reasonable metrics like the ones ccp quant provides say that
highsec is indeed the safest space as ccp intends you have the
least chance of losing your ships there by an order or two of
magnitude when compared to the other spaces where there is no
or very little cost to attack another player but as to your point 3
nowhere does he say you should need to go to low null for non
consensual pvp all he says is you should go to lownull if you
want to be a pirate aka make a living from shooting other
peoples spaceships if ccp wanted highsec to be free of non
consensual pvp they could do it tomorrow with a single line of
code preventing us from using the red safety setting further wars
are are a significant source of nonconsensual pvp at least at the
group level which have been there since oveurs time this idea of
yours that ccp or a favoured developer of yours at ccp wants or
wanted a 100 safe nonconsensual pvpfree highsec is
bullocks this was never the case and never will be the case it is
just something you want so much for your own personal reasons
it is clouding your interpretation of reality

its clear from the screenshot hes replying to someone whinging
about concord being beefed up  hes clearly referring to ganking i
back when concord was vastly weaker than it is now and yet
here we are with yet another whinejust one more nerf and all
will be wellnever mind that players logged in are decliningsubs
which are most likely correlated with players logged in are
probably also decliningyes ccp has been clever about
monetizing the remaining player basewhich ironically leads to
more whining about pay to win usually from the likes of
youmight there have been justification for buffing concord back
then maybe but this is now not then so trying to use an
argument from over a decade ago would be like arguing that
because we were in a deep recession 7 years ago we should
pursue counter cyclical economic policies now it is just stupid an
nothing more than an argument from an outdated authority who
probably knows nothing about where the game is nowand
seriously i am so sick of people whining about suicide ganking it
only works now because some moron puts too much stuff in his
freighter turning it into a loot pinata how stupid does one be to
put 7 billion into an antitanked ship that can be taken down by 15
players in 150 million isk worth of ships pretty goddamned
stupid you know what happens with stupid people the rest of us
have to clean up after them i have zero sympathy for a dumbass
that turns his ship into a loot pinata none they were stupid and
they were taught a lesson if they dont like the consequences of
their stupidity well too bad for themand spare me the
consequences for the gankers they paid the consequences for
their actions their ships were destroyed yes an alt or buddy
scooped the loot and in the end they profitedbut only because
some other moron was too stupid to realize he was creating a
suicide ganking opportunityseriously grow up take responsibility
for your actions stop wanting others to do what you need to do for
yourself goddamn child
i dont lose sleep over ganking either im simply refuting dark
pedros incorrect statement that ganking was intended and
encoragedearly on in eve devs didnt like it and they initially
worked hard to reduce it
who gives a  if it was intended or not eve is a game of
emergence or spontaneous orderie we will get things nobody
intended that is the goddamned point of the game to get things
nobody intendsdid ccp intend pipe bombs probably not did they
intend the false pos probably not did they intend rental
empires did they intend something like red frog did they intend
coalitions there are lots of things in game that ccp did not
intendthat is the nature of the gameso your observation is
pretty uselesskind of like you
let me ask thisdid ccp intend for the rise of professional
freighter ganking organizations well with all their nerfing that is
what those dingbats got whether they intended it or nothere is a
hint for dimbulbs like you when you have a system of
spontaneous order and emergencetrying to control it to direct
itit often blows up in your faceedit unless you control it so
much you throttle the life out of itwhich look ccp seems to be
doing a fine jobccp employees should come into work every day
and look at eve offline then spend 2 hours on their resumes then
do their days work they are busy working on putting themselves
out of work
it was misinformation why make  up
my point is who cares whether it was intended or notit is what
they got with an open classless system with few rulesie a
sandboxso maybe they thought it was a bit too much or too easy
and they ratcheted up the difficult levelno need to take it past 11
and break the goddamn game hs content sucks pve is boring hs
pvp is all but gone mass war decs and freighter ganking and a
band of terrorists being subsidized to attack miners thats it
oveur clearly uses the term piracy even if you interpret his use
of piracy to mean all nonconsensual pvp he says ccp intends for
piracy to be not easy in highsec he didnt say impossible or
not allowed or whatever you seem to be interpreting that as ccp
has always intended for pvp both consensual and non
consensual to be possible in highsec as long as you accept the
consequences that has always been how it works and how it was
intended to work your version of reality does not exist feel free to
make the case that nonconsensual pvp is currently too easy in
highsec but claiming that highsec was intended to be 100 free
of nonconsensual pvp even by your beloved ccp oveur is a
pure fabrication of yours
got my support thank you for the convo last night
scylus black numbah one
i was wondering if you would answer a couple of questions1 i
get the impression you are an fc what type of fleets do you like to
take out2 your alliance currently lives in malpais do you do a
lot of mining and industry3 you would like ccp to address moon
goo is that from personal experience moon mining andor running
reaction farms or due to something else4 what are the things
about citadels that you would like to see changed5 living in
malpais you are surrounded by the brothers of tangra a rental
alliance what are your thoughts on rental empires
hmmm nah
while it is nice seeing somebody running on a faction warfare
platform i dont believe you are the best candidate for this simply
because of your attitude in game today there was a fight between
siege green and dhsj and even after your fc called good fight and
content is content you instead resorted to wishing the other side
contracted aids and wished that that would get hit and maimed
by a bus
um can u not copy me
such abhorrent behavior should not be tolerated more so from a
csm candidate if you are so easily angered by someone calling
out a welp that you would resort to wanting physical harm inflicted
upon him how can we as a community trust your decisions to do
right by the community you will not have my vote and i will
campaign so that others also reject your submission
gday everyoneif youre interested in hearing my aussie accent
and getting to know a bit more about me then feel free to have a
listen to the talking in stations podcast interview hosted by
materrall here is a link to the my interview
please explain your ideas around improvements to war dec
mechanics
hey natural clonekillerthanks for your query there have been
many suggestions brought to me in regards to making
improvements to war dec mechanices a lot of these suggestions
would require further investigation but i can let you know of one
idea that has been suggested to methere could be a way for a
corporation to pay a fee to concord in order to have their war dec
removed early or to prevent it from happening this would please
a lot of those smaller corps who get war dec and dont really
engage in warfare it really hurts the game in general if people
just go offline for two weeks because they are war dec opposed
to giving them an opportunity to continue playing by offering a
system to pay off the war dec i realize that there will be people
who are on the other side of this argument who enjoy using the
current war dec mechanic and i am open to suggestions from
those people who have ideas for war dec mechanics thats just
one of the suggestions that has been brought to me of course its
not going to be a simple process but i just wanted to respond to
your query with an examplethanks for your timeviktor koraka

meine stimme hast du prima welche dinge du angehen willst
i was wondering if you could answer some questions1 what area
of the game do you play2 do you pvp or are you more industry
focused3 you mentioned something called the eve an hour
campaign what is that for those like me who have never heard of
it before and is it still active your mention of it leaves a lot of
questions4 have you ever been in a corp or alliance leadership
position if so what challenges dodid face that ccp could help
with by changing features in the game
1 not many the most complex tool i released was skynet which
was the first fleet manager made using the crest fleet endpoints
it primarily provided a more user friendly overview of the data
available in the ingame fleet composition window but complaints
about the limitations imposed by the api endpoints on ccps side
and a general lack of interest caused me to stop active
development and further versions werent publicly releasedon
the bright side i heard that several people found my code useful
as a guide to using the fleet endpoints which were
undocumented at the time though i did manage to write up the
documentation eventually and proceeded to make fleet
managersassistants of their ownmoving on to simpler tools i
made this lp store browser which pulls its data live from tq and
this structure browser which is just a quick thing i made for
checking when your citadel runs out of fuelother than that all
other tools i made are for internal use only for now2 i
maintained interest but as my corp already has many people
involved in those activities i stopped participating in them as to
leave me with more time for other activities and them with less
competition 3 there are a lot of provibloc candidates this year
and im really glad to see them getting involved what sets me
apart from them im more focused on the information
management in eve than some specific areas you could say that
its what really drives the game and all the spaceship violence is
just a fortunate side effect of it aside from that id say most of us
provi candidates are similarly aligned with respect to eves more
tangible issues4 i consider the ingame map to be the worst
offender here as it offers tons of free intel on every kspace
system however information blackout is currently the domain of
wspace and that intel is relied on by many people so any
changes or removal of it would be a rather complicated matteras
i said in my blog knowing when to stop with the amount of
information available over apis is important and i also take issue
with various game mechanics which leak information convo
someone to check if theyre online for example5 im fairly
satisfied with the progress so far integrating the documentation
process into the development process is by far the biggest
improvement and the architecture changes should allow for
better performance and introduction of features which used to be
impossiblewhile ccp is making progress on it faster than i
expected it is still coming along very slowly and reliability issues
are preventing some people from switching to esi6 discordslack
bots and the such
well thank you for stopping by my threadnot really sure i
understood what you were getting at here of course making it fun
for high sec players is a very important thing i do not agree with
you there but then i have written about that on previous posts
and my blogthere is a long thread on the eve forums about
bumping have you read itas you quite rightly say i was indeed
quite rightthere are many things that one could change in war
decs to make the system more workable changing the relations
between allies is one of them especially with the large number
of small corporations that might have to band together as if that
would ever happen the population of high sec will probably
never change in this respect i think that we are still in the
relatively early days of citadels but over the years i expect we
will reach some sort of equilibrium thanks for taking the time to
write
1 i get the impression you are an fc what type of fleets do you
like to take outi can fc but smaller groups i prefer alpha boats
or rlml swarms at present i much prefer to sit and wait for roams
to come to me than go out looking for fights you surprisingly get
more fights some days  2 your alliance currently lives in
malpais do you do a lot of mining and industryyes fusion has
had a strong industrial past but we have decent level of pvper to
protect our industry we used to do a lot of mining but the rorqual
changes have polarised many miners into its either rorqual or
nothing and with the speed wh gangs are rolling wh while hunting
for rorquals it has put a lot of miners off even bothering to
undock 3 you would like ccp to address moon goo is that from
personal experience moon mining andor running reaction farms
or due to something elsein the past our corp has had money
moons at the peak 11 tech moons when tech was 220k pu the
problem with goo moons is either you get them handed to you or
its not isk worth trying to take them from others the usual fight
over a goo tower will cost 20b in order to take the moon which
is multiple months roi making it kinda pointless attacking it in the
first place if you have the towers odds are your not going to lose
the income from themi would like to see goo moved off of moons
and moved to anomalies that spawn like data sites gas sites in
order to keep the present levels you would need to have 2 or 3
sites per moon of goo spawn with 3 or 4 days worth of goo to
harvest also having a site spawn elsewhere once one is deleted
would remove the dowmtime rush gas mining would make it
more accessible to everyone it would also help move some
miners from ore to goo hunting and it would encourage full use of
all systems in regions with people looking for the goo sites 4
what are the things about citadels that you would like to see
changedmain thing would be the anchoring exploit people are
using at present inorder to get 21 days invul after first anchoring
it second thing would be the ability to have an overview when
viewing outside if you presently stick your head out of some
structures you really cannot see anything smaller than a capital
5 living in malpais you are surrounded by the brothers of tangra
a rental alliance what are your thoughts on rental empiresrental
empires are both good and bad they give the opportunity for
small industrialpve corps to try out null without joining a big
blocdownside is they fund the big alliances to get bigger making
it harder for new people to the scene to take space
does my reddit shitposting also countshitposting is shitposting

unrelated
i had a really nice chat with matterall for the talking in stations
podcast my first interview evercheck it out here
how wouldnt be horde without kalibur
nice resume simple questions for youhow much do you answer to
the upper ranks of pl and others and how much are you your

ive been lucky enough to catch both ashterothi from crossing
zebras and matterall from imperium news network if youd like
to listen to some more casual discussion from me take a listen
pve landing padssay you are sent out on a delivery by your
favorite agent instead of going thru the entire docking sequence
and such make landing pads onaround the stations players can
select the station and click on the landing pad to have the ship
war if at range and automatically begin landing on an available
pad after some time has passed the delivery shows as complete
and you can depart the landing pad and be on your mary way if
all landing pads are busy then you can just do a normal dock
into the station and continue as normalthis option could also be
used when deliveringpicking up contracts from players
i will be hosting a ustz and an eutz ama on reddit this week i will
see if theres a way i can do aurutz as well but thats pretty hard
for me because of being 12 hours apart if theres any aurutz
people who want to contact me you can feel free to contact me in
game jonn duune
removed an offtopic post
might have some questions for your ama just wondering when
youre gonna have it so do you have a date and time or
something dont really like any of the other wh candidates ive
seen so far
having flown with this pilot before his community statement would
be more accurate if it were thisi support the community when it
has the same views as myself if someone has differing views to
my own i will go out of my way to berate speak over down to and
make personal threats against those other line members
due to various personal threats made by this pilot i wish to state
that a vote for this candidate will do nothing but further damage
the public brand image of the csm while stellan is a very
passionate and enthusiastic player these types of people should
not be considered for csm members

i recognise that there has been issues in the past and
iUFFFDll admit my doing then i apologise for the issues
thereUFFFDs been water under the bridge since
im not sure thats only for you to decide you mention several
community structures in your op i agree that the community is
what makes this game so great does community and working
together go so far as trying to white knight a corp or leaking apis
when you dont get your way i recognize that these actions and
many others are completely valid and acceptable forms of eve
gameplay but theyre hardly actions that would promote and
encourage discussion andor change for good wouldnt you think
how would this translate to being an effective voice within the
csm
please note this is not a troll post this is purely a clarification of
factsyou made personal threats against other players indicating
physical harm out of game this is not a quality trait of someone
who should be considered a representative of the community and
the community should be aware of this
1youll always have my vote keep those reforms coming
well here i am ive been playing eve since october 2008 ive
literally been to every corner of the game and have been in almost
every major conflict since i started im running for csm cause i
believe i know what the players want i think i know enough
players from all facets of eve and have made enough friends to
have a good knowledge of what the players want so anyways
figured id throw my hat in the ring and see what hapened
ever heard of world war beewwbkillah bee was essentially the
project manager for such a feat tasked to coordinate dozens of
entities totaling over 40000 characters to engage a similar sized
entrenched foe not only did killah bee display great team
management skills he also surpassed all communication
expectations effectively coordinating advanced war tactics
through multiple time zones in various languageskillah bee is well
cultured in the eve universe having acquired experience in many
different disciplines voting killah bee onto the csm would not only
benefit every pilot in eve but it would also benefit the csm every
csm member is expected to communicate with the panel and ccp
with an effective communicator and natural leader such as killah
bee on the panel progress is sure to be madeif you support
killah bees platform be sure to cast a vote his direction rest
assured these causes will be carefully prepared and adequately
delivered
dancul deserves more visibility for the platform he is running on
definitely a solid candidate for all of eve
the thing youve described is just another symptom the disease is
a csm itself
added youtube link for matterall interview
having known jin since he were a podling it has been a pleasure
to see him grow and develop into the great young fella he is
todayhe has demonstrated that he can bring consistancy and
transparancy where possible to not just the csm but also to the
relationship between the csm and ccp he has also evidenced
what he has done and where he has helped to make an impact in
the gamethus he will certainly get my votewith respectmaxoh
and i may be the one responsible for introducing him to tequila
and whisky chasers i would say can you remember the notts
meet but we know how that ended for youbad max bad 
approved candidacy by ccp for the 4th year check the full list
lorelei you have a 100 chance of walking away from most
ganks  if youre prepared to take some precautions and to use
the tools with which ccp has provided youif youre implying that
ganking is too easy ie needs to be nerfed then you should
really come out and say so citing whatever evidence you can
produce i think youll struggle there to be franki think you might
more usefully describe yourself as the highsec carebearing
candidate and have done with it you obviously wont be able
honestly to represent the pvpers and pirates who daily bring
content to the regionim working my way down the list of
candidates hoping that someone from highsec will take on the
challenging task of stopping the dripdripdrip of nerfs to our
playstyle and get those carebears actually involved in the game
its an mmo not a multisingleplayeronline rpgbut i realise that
expecting a lone candidate to represent the interests of such a
broad constituency may be just too much
thanks for stopping by my thread sasha ive listened to several of
you recordings i think they are nicei dont think ganking is too
easy did you read the discussions at the time in my last two
campaign threads i think what i think was quite well talked
aboutdid you see my post about my ideas for concord
adjustments 201508concordhtml what do you think about what
i said in my opening post about making changes to local chati do
for example definitely think that just adding more ehp to mining
barges is not the right way to go about adjusting thingsreally i
think i could represent pvpers and pirates of course more pvp
and pirate oriented players would have to tell me what they
thinkfeel but that is what communication would be for if i were
to be elected i would be spending more time talking to people and
less time flying around niarja what do you think pvpers an pirates
want and what do you think a member of the csm can actually
dogetting carebears more involved in the game would be a great
thing and that is why it is important for ccp to keep tweaking and
developing the npe i would be very interested to see information
about where in the npe the majority of new players stop and quit
eve see summit minutes last year your alliance supported
xenuria probably you will be doing it again that is not necessarily
a bad thing just not a high sec thingi know i do not think i ever
said anything about wanting to make soloplay easier i am also in
favour of increasing the possibilities to be social and interact with
other players  and my thoughts about social player corporations
have not changed over the last couple of yearsnoone can do
everything but high sec needs voices and high sec is worth
fighting for

serves me right for being lazy  pushed for timei was called out
about wardecs i do not know much about war deccing not really
having done it in any great way but i am aware that war dec in
high sec and also the bounty mechanics are very much broken
so much so that war decs just do not impact my play in any way
in case of dec drop corps and reform or wait it out in fact in my
original campaign war decs were 4 on the list4 wardecsthe
war dec mechanic is broken there have already been
talkssuggestions about enabling player groups that are not
eligible for war deccing but also not eligible to put up pos or
pocos this is a central theme to new player retention and not to
be ignored i am also quite prepared to representpush issues that
other high sec carebears have even if i have not mentioned them
above i think it is allimportant that high sec gathers behind a
candidate even if it is not me so that our interests do not get
swept under the table by the massedorganised nullsec
coalitions
very excited just got word that i am on the ballot thank you all for
getting in the mix i still have more podcasts coming up talking in
stations lounge  scylus black former executor templis calsf

a couple of questionscapital ships size are wrong any fix for
them  force auxiliary are too big carriers are too small ship
bumping mechanics are so weird a frig can bump a titan any
change or modificationspanish language supportgood luck ncc
1709 o7
language support well thats in ccps best interest to arrange for
as many languages as possible but unlike most other games
eve contains thousands of words a large selection of which are
not easily translatable to multiple languages what i would like to
see integrated into the ingame chats would be the option to
translate a section of a chat window by highlighting and right click
ship sizes have been off for many years the most obvious
example of this is the macherial i believe it is still in the original
size scale of most ships before their rerender size reductionit
would be nice to see them all resized relative to their list size
which would cause most ships to be reduced in size rather than
increased bumping thats a different kettle of fish the mass ratio
of capitals relative to their size is too low if a capital has speed it
should shrug off a bump from a lower mass ship with ease but
due to the squiffy mass equations used the capital ships tend to
react to the bump when the bump should be a smear on the
windscreen while it would be nice to see some effort put into
fixing this i dont see it making much difference to bumping within
eve its self if it requires more people to bumps them more
people will be usedif collision damage is added then the odds
are it would be abused in some unforseen way but i would still
like to see collision mechanics fixed
with any luck im going to do 2 im thinking an eutz one sometime
around 18001900 on wednesday and a ustz one around 0100 on
saturday but because of my propensity to bring out salt im going
to ask the reddit mods to be present and strictly moderating any
offtopic threads
ive had a few questions rolling around in my head for quite a
while with c4 site payouts failing to match the iskhr of c3 sites
as well as access to kspace being limited by statics what is your
proposition for bringing c4 sites in line with the difficulty of their
pve content i know that the obvious answer is to grab a c4 with a
3 or a 5 as a static maybe even both got one of these a few days
ago and just run sites in there for smoother iskhr but this
leaves a large portion of c4 space with very poor options for
making isk long uncomfortable chains are inevitable in
wormholes but are especially prevalent in c4 highways where the
only residents are russians doing pi lifting the amount of available
isk in c4s will go a long way towards encouraging residency in
the deeper wormholes without kspace statics for now c2
wormholes remain the most desired for their access to k and
jspace the kind of flexibility that only this class of wormhole
offers i think this is creating a poor environment for wspace
leaning towards an increase in evictions as opposed to residents
nothing wrong with evictions but when one of the perceived
issues in wspace is a lack of content and population it wouldnt
hurt to begin slowly increasing the incentives for c4 residents
denizens of middleclass wormholes live in a frustrating
environment but i think the answer is to give them a bit more
reward rather than alter the dynamic of c4 with the pair of jspace
statics your corp info states that you also reside in a c4 which
gives me hope that these will be the kinds of issues you will
spend time on other c4 corps have stated this as one of the most
serious issues for middleclass but nobody has really come
forward to offer a solution uniformity in wormhole classes isnt
exciting but neither is imbalance in isk availability per unit time
looking forward to your response as well as your ustz ama

stellan crendraven realmente eres dominicano vives en la
republica dominicana pues por lo que veo en tu canal de
youtube y todo el contenido que aparece de ti no hay nada en
espaUFFFDol es mas por lo que veo aparentarias mas ser
nordico que caribeUFFFDoi dont thing stellan crendraven is
from the dominican republic nor that he lives here i may be wrong
but i did some reserch on the guy and no content in spanish and
his youtube channel
no this was a mistake on my part and have asked ccp to correct
it i apologise for the confusion hopefully the error will be fixed
soon
since this mistake led me to youendorse the cause
quieroeveenespaUFFFDol we need a localize spanish
client 400 million people speak the second most spoken
language in the world yet in new eden it is just a whisperif want to
have my vote and tons of eve players that speak spanish do this
we are growing in eve faster than any other culturallanguage
base with dozens of countries all over the globe after the alpha
clone patch ran its time for ccp to act on thisUFFFDwe need
the support of the csm on this
yes eve should also come en espaUFFFDol i was actually
surprised that ccp chose french over spanish as their latest
localisation effort when the spanish speaking community is
several times larger than the french one i support this initiative
after listening to you on podcasts and interviews i have a few
questionson podcasts you seem to be a bit of a wall flower from
what ive seen you have often been unable to follow a continuous
train of thought and have hearing issues im aware youre
disabled do you think you would you be able overcome this in a
business setting you havent had much to say and fall back on
the gamer girl act a lot the cutesy act only gets you so
farlooking back at your past candidacies i also noticed a few
things one of those being that you had to record your csm watch
interview for csm 10 twice due to having a panic attack in the
middle of the interview is your nervousness and awkwardness
around people something that would be an issue working with the
community and ccp being that this is a very public positioni also
noticed you are part of b4r as a moderator i asked around since i
dont spend a lot of time in those communities and was told that
you love virtual hugs kisses and cookies i also heard of more
than one instance that you have banned people from there for
using bad words is this something you stand by given eve is
such a dark gameyou said in your talking in stations interview
that you want to give back to the community since people have
been so nice and helpful to you you mention you feel youd be
good at it do you think that is enough of a reason it feels like
you could have done other things with the time youve put into
your csm candidacies that would have been more useful than
running over and over im trying to work out why you keep
running what are you going to be able to effect on ccps road map
since they never change the whole road map because a csm
asks for itim not a hater and im sorry if this came off as that im
just piecing things together and not seeing a very good picture at
the moment as someone who did vote for you last year id like to
hear your answers id probably be more interested to hear your
reasoning with these questions in voice rather than in text which
you have said you would rather people use primarily which
mainly gives you time to think and rethink your answersedit to
be more friendly
thank you for your questionsto first point out about the gamer
girl bit i want to clear this i do not like the term gamer girl  and
when you hear my talking in stations interview i actually cringed
when materall brought it up asking how me being a girl effected
me  but i answered anyways because im not wanting to turn
down a question i also mentioned in the interview how i dislike
the term to me it doesnt matter if you are male of female we all
play together as a whole i do admit that during interviews i do get
a little bit giggly but that is also my nervousness and anxiety
kicking in this happens to me irl as well  it is a hurdle that i have
to try to overcome  but i can assure that once i am over that
hurdle of interviews  its a whole other ballgame and i am a very
hard worker and focusedthis is the same for the csm watch
interviews  anxiety and panic came over me on top of hearing
difficulties  it was pretty much a disaster and i wish it would have
went better so i have nothing really much to say on that bit other
than jumping over that hurdle to overcome this despite the
anxiety and panic ridden interviews i am 100 confident that
once i can get past the interviewsdebatesect i will have no
issues working with ccp and doing the job at hand i am hearing
impaired however i do not feel that will hinder me from being
able to still do the work  i just may have to ask someone to repeat
sometimes if i dont catch somethingi am a moderator for b4r
yes but i also do a lot more than just virtual hugs and cookies  a
lot of my time on there is also spent listening to people and just
being there for people who need it there is a lot more to that in
regards to banning i first have to say on the note of b4r it is a
channel that is held to a higher standard because of the nature of
the community but with that said however it takes a lot more
than a few bad words for me to actually ban someone  and
anyone who knows me can vouch for me on that regardsthe
reason i keep running because this is something that i want to
do yes i want to give back to the community being a part of the
community has helped me so much  from when i first joined and
having people taking the time to help me out to being able to
actually open up more before i came to eve i was basically a
hermit  i would never talk on voice unless absolutely needed
because i used to get anxious just at the idea of speaking  but
being with this community has dome something for me  its
changed me for the better i cant explain it i went from being a
quiet fly on the wall to being someone that sometimes my own
corp mates have to tell me to shut up so yes i want to give back
to the community that has done so much for me  and having this
opportunity to be able to do this as a voice for the community that
i love would mean a lot to me so this is why i will keep running
and wont give up despite the hurdles that i have to go through i
also feel that my reason is good enough  i feel that i am
knowledgeable about the game to be able to provide the feedback
to ccp i also look at things differently and by that meaning
accessibility i go over in my head how things can be improved or
worked on to better be accessible to other players of other walks
of life i feel that this type of mindset would be very valuable  its
also a area that has never had any real representation i also feel
this answer goes over how i would be able to provide constructive
feedback for ccp as they progress through the roadmapi am
also more than willing to talk on voice and i also frequent eve
radios public ts at voicegamingradionet if you wish to join to get
to know me a little bit morethank you
if youre still as soapopera level pitiful as i remember you being
then i would be absolutely floored if you could slam your
honeybaked ham hands against the keyboard into microsoft
notepad somehow congealing your whining derivativeauthority
rambling manifestos into a single coherent thoughti would rather
vote republican
the reason this trash should never be anywhere near cfcsm of
ccplget lost 

just to save people a read orca platypus is somewhat sore that
bubbles have gained killmails and an expiry timer
just to save people a vote the murder of a change passed with
this shitcandidates full blessingi think you have been ruining eve
long enough steve time for you to quit
i believe the appropriate comeback is u mad bro or possibly its
only game why you have to be madbubbling a constellationisnt
something which should be quick and easy especially not to the
point that people are blinded when they enter a system which
happens
reserved
judging by other time someone tried to go to csm as a multiboxer
supporter it didnt go wellunless you have mc vote brigading you
maybe you have a chance then you have my vote then
who are you and why did you steal my name
1 amazing guy hardworking smart and just generally really
nice also he has a strong killer instinct so he ha the best combo
of pve and pvp knowledge and hes super driven so yeah defo
has my vote
the reason this trash should never be anywhere near cfcsm of
ccpltrash like him on csm is the reason 1 to boycott election
entirelyhey ccpl can we get a vote against the csm entirely
you mentioned citadels need to be looked atwhat about citadels
do you feel needs to be addressed and what is your opinion on
the dps cap on citadels
at that point perhaps asking if any of what they are working on
can coincide with working on pi ill be honest i dont code nor
know how to but i can only imagine that there are things even if
little and non time consuming that could be done at the same
time with little to no loss in productivity on the primary project
well in my experience the squeaky wheel gets the grease so
with that being said if it gets brought up enough times something
will happen either they say nope not going to work on it or they
say they will the best way to get things done is for it to be on the
forefront of thought looking forward if elected i will push at every
opportunity possible to excel these points though at the same
time having the understanding that it may not be within the first
week or month it may take 3 months or more but it would be
something that i would bring up consistently
youve got my vote sir
you read that rightevery player wants a deeper experience in the
game it is my goal to encourage that to become a reality i want
to work towards making all aspects of eve more challenging and
more rewarding pve players want more content industrial players
want more complexity and more options pvp players want to be
able to expand their fitting prowess lets work to expand the
sandbox1 lets make the higher tier industrial aspects of the
game more complex2 increase the risk in pve dread anoms
titan anoms make it a challenge3 bring proper equity to the
mining ships 14b isk ships should be bringing in the same ratio of
ore that a 25m isk ship doesiUFFFDm not afraid to speak up
and say whatUFFFDs on everyones mind iUFFFDm not
intimidated by anyone and i think that whatUFFFDs right and
in the best interest of the game and the player base is what is
most important i donUFFFDt believe that one person or group
is more important than another but i also believe that the game
should not be modified because someone has found a way to
effectively excel at the gamelets talk about what you want eve to
become for you and get to work making it a reality
dancul has raised very interesting points and i for one am sure
that hes the right man for the job
the reason this trash should never be anywhere near cfcsm of
ccpldo not vote for this piece of snip people boycott cfcsm
election entirely until even ccpl realizes something is wrong
is there a candidate anywhere in known space that can speak for

they are  and shouldnt speak so
several of them
ill be back
