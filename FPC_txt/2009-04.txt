just wanted to give a big thank you to ankh for setting this all up this is a genuinely useful site for when i want to check out what the csm has done in the past and is probably the best csm information page going  oddly in some ways its even a lot better than the actual csm forums themselves i hope it continues effectivelywhether on your site evelopedia or somewhere else for a very long time
800  2  1600 so your arguement is my maelstrom is fine cos i have hg crystals great one almost as good as ccp thinking every vaga pilot had hg slaves with domi nanos and mwd

waves hey there im rather new but after a very lengthy discussion about this in an ooc channel i feel that if chribba is going to use his big massive ship for nothing more than mining d they by all means go right ahead i approve the move
agreed
jolly good idea there chap
maybe have a tab system like the overview so that we can also have different orbits for different shipsedit forgot to support
its one of those things were so used to but theyre annoying and not logical adding more options is a good thing
this would be really usefulin fact why not just make the whole list editablewith the obvious exception of orbit at current distance
look several posts above and you will see why active scanning is not a good solution short answer server loadunless you want to reduce active scanning targets the filters almost certainly change what is shown not what is detected by the scan and that hypothesis is with a 220 cpu probe launcher put that in every ship if you can
perfect on the same vein you have no right to attack me against my will same logicso you get your little instance with all the people that will refuse local and play with them
local change will not simply help small scale pvp or give attackers all benefits and no drawbackslocal change will change pvp in eve completelysay i go out for a solo roam sure on the one hand i am better off as ratters dont instawarp to poses when i enter system on the other hand if i catch a ratting raven i cant be sure that theres no cloaked arazufalcona couple of black ops sitting just a few kilometers from it small gangs just as any other gangs set up scouts and scram if the local spikes well guess what  if the local does not spike who would inform you that 4 of your sorry hacbutts are in for a world of pain because 20 gang has entered the system to bring it no one thats whoi cant say if i am for or against local removal because it would just change too much we would all have to learn pvp again not that it would be something done the first time by ccp  cap ship introduction taught us new pvp nanonerf taught us new pvp titans taught us new pvp just dont expect boost or nerf to you current play style there will be no current playstyle anymorei think we need to see how pvp in wspace goes if it would be too hectic or it would be just about right type of hectic then well talk
it can be modifiedstreamlined yes
the solution hit me remove player lists in local place them in constellation instead you then know exactly who is in the constellation but not in your local system
id buy a titan just to dd small gangs as i bait them with a ratting raven
proposed and struck down in fact it came so close to implementation that we still have const chat in game be it delayedno this will again do nothing but provide an instant and free intel tool for the defender
btw as i understand concord provides information about gate activation thus local intel for all they control gates so it sounds reasonable to me wormholes on the other hand are not under concord control so get rid of free intel about wspacekspace travelersi think jumping from wspace into kspace should not result in instant local update this would make kspace a little bit spicier without general removing of local
are you high if there wasnt a magical inteltool for the alliances controlling their massive swaths of land i would spend almost all of my time in 00localspy is ridiculous and illogical the gate defense doesnt work either since concord wouldnt bother reporting data from gates in systems they dont even have control overthe only people who are in opposition to this are those who want instant intel
reducing the informations two times one removing local the other nerfing active scanning you seem to love the thought of nerfing active scanningmaybe you missed it totally but most ships under the bs class would be crippled putting in a extended probe launcheryou think all ships need a increase in cpu by 220 points
yep pretty sure this would attract more people out therewould also fix riskreward for blobbing powerblocs
oh so making it not completely counterproof or balancing ie making you be seen easier by active scanning the advantage of which gives you a better scani seeno the idea of ships having to constantly scan hell every ship being wary those that dont risk being caught unawaremaybe that involves having someone in gang constantly probing they could give him a name you know like a member of a crew whats that name of those people that you know watch radar or sonar to make sure no hostiles are around but to you having someone do that is asking too muchyou either want to have an excuse not to play eve outside of beginner mode or youre trollingi never thought people were so lazy theat theyd fight tooth and nail to keep thier precious instantintel magic tool
take that one step further  i accept that i have no right to attack you against your will but when you enter low sec and 00 space you willfully consent that you allow people to attack you you will still fight them of course but the fact that you came to the pvp space on purpose willingly gives everyone permission to start a fight with you
nice now you want people to move always in group and always have a guy playing picket ship with a cov ops to scan for possible hostiles i want wow stile raiding too mandatory mass operationsthis game is meant to be playable even alone so why you are trying to impose group playing btw you are putting the lie to your words believe me when i say im not offended and also when i say my ideas have flaws i even state several posts above that any ideas of mine have issues and need to be fleshed out a bit every time i point the flaws in your ideas you resort to ad hominem attacks grow a bit
that sounds like something only the most carebear people would think of doingthe type of people who really want to keep local chatbtw i play alone most of the time and i really want some kind o nerf to local chat
ad hominem attacks because by your posts you have implied1 you prefer solo in an mmorpg2 you dislike pvp3 you see the removal of local as a severe threat to your safety and are thus against itso when i thus imply that your resistance to either removing or creating delayed local is due to the fact that you want it not for any reasons specified by yourself but because of your own personal preference regarding your general fear and unwillingness to even have a possibility of pvpad hominem no im not attacking you im attacking your real reasons behind this debate as you first said of me how i just want easy ganks which was the first attack anyway without realizing im a hisec miner who bears 90 of the timeas such you take things such as how you replied to me and instead are resorting to straw man arguementsbut ill bite this one timeyes there should be one person scanning constantly standing guard being vigilant in unsafe territory you can refuse to do it at your peril
step 1 have friend with large wallet step 2 have friend officerfit a ship step 3 pop ship due to known bug step 4 grab loot step 5 petition loss step 6 gm dupes loot for you step 7 step 8 profitim not talking about standard suicide ganking which im aware is a mediocre profession at best in terms of actually earning income per unit time especially with recent changes im talking about intentional exploitation of a hp bug and this proposed reimbursement policy which would in essence allow players to earn fantastically large sums of money via exploits in a short period of time with a minimal chance of getting caught there is a reason that reimbursement works the way it does  if it worked like op is proposing you would have exploits galore it doesnt need to be a repeatable exploit if you make billions per use
if you find a way to reproduce this bug on demand please let us know hell ill even pay 50 mil if i successfully reproduce it with your instructionshowever i firmly believe that there must be no item duping im sure ccp feels same way
i give up your ego is out of control and blinding you to actually have to respond to any criticism i could not possibly care less about you or tri god forbid i actually question what someone says on an internet forumthe only way to give you back dropped items is to dupe items or dupe isk and in doing so have a very good chance at giving said player twice the value of what he just lostit would be nice if you got back all of your modules when dying to a bug however not getting your dropped modules back is a unfortunate consequence of having loot drop for pvp this is not something ccp can look into this is something that they cannot accomplish without duping items and causing more trouble and screwing over more people in the processi would gladly support this but it just isnt possible without adding terrible mechanics like locking items or abusive mechanics like duping iskitems
i dont know that it can be or even that it exists personally ive never seen it however were not talking about a shortterm thing here were talking about a permanent change to reimbursement policy if there is ever at any time a bug that makes ship losses reimburseableand iirc there have been several in the past and is at least slightly predictable then this change to reimbursement policy will result in an easy exploit for billions of isk youre right that nobody wants duping  not you not me not ccp thats the reason for the current policy  destroyed items get reimbursed dropped items do not because then youre duping them that is why i oppose this change  op is at root asking for the gms to start duping items its being requested with honest intentions but thats still the proposal on the table here hence i oppose it its not a function of one particular bug or one particular issue its the principle that an item that drops once should not be on two ships even if ccp screws up somewhere in the middle
i know how it is losing a expensive ship to a known bug goes i lose a carrier to desync and was given the finger as well then sevral days later lost a sub cap to the same issue and got it back within 24h something needs to be done about the reimbursement system needs a rework just thinking about the length of that petition makes me angry
this kronosonly one that i saw not seeing zealots some im just a little confused
this onei like the policy how it is
agreedeven though i believe a ship reimbursement should include all the modules it was fitted with i would settle for a firm and public policy on the matter at least then you would know where you stand and everyone would be treated the same wayat the moment it seems to be the individual gms choice how to reimburse a loss but there should be guidelines for different scenarios and these should be publicly availablein this particular instance your ship was loss was down to a severe bug and therefore i believe you should have been reimbursed entirely
yeahand no the empire loss one was legitimate they had a falcon perma jamming me but there was no bugs involved so i didnt petition
sounds good to mesigned
i started playing this game over 3 years ago and have always flown caldari and have always wandered why i never had any launchers showing on my shipssadly my ships still look like they are weaponless i totally support this change
i support this i can just imagine watching a ravens missile ports opening up from the sides and missiles flying out
been thinking this since april 2004lets do this
this has been brought up in an older thread though i couldnt find it due to the horrifying search engineessentially while they have upgraded the ships stations and many static objects the planets moons and the stars themselves are still lacking quite a biti know that changes are in the works i was just hoping maybe by starting a new thread on the subject we can either get an update or a confirmation by the csm to push for graphical overhauls in the general space departmentthe best idea ive heard was for static gas clouds and the such so that you were not constantly immersed in a rainbow there would be more black space and you could actually tell where you were based on your surroundingsnote im only talking about nonwormhole space wormhole space has some new snazzy effects and even some binary systemsanyhow supporting my own topic to reraise the issue and provide a spot for ideas flame and discuss
supported
no it accomplishes that objective most of the time if you want to train a new skill it does not i started a new alt a couple days ago and had to waste 3 hours training learning 4 without the benefit of logic 3 because the skill finished 3 hours before i woke up i had to train the wrong skill because i wasnt online to switch into the right one last i checked this is exactly what the skill queue is supposed to avoid finish the job put the queue into effect properly and let us inject skills even if we dont have the reqs pop up a warning or whatever but let us train properly there should never be any bs associated with this fundamental a part of the game  it should be utterly flawless in terms of letting the player do whatever they want within the rules and presently there is a large and rather gaping flaw that still exists its not as large as the planetsucking black hole of fail that was the queueless system but its still worthy of an improvement
you know ive looked at this four or five times and it finally hit me whats wrong with thiswe can move great hulking battleships lightyears in a flash of light and a couple of seconds and we still have to put stuff down on paper really especially since according to the storylines of eve training is by direct injection of knowledge into the brain at least call them like datachips or some crap books honestly we have laser guns and we still put vital knowledge down on easily destroyed paperfor that matter even in the modern world we can send the contents of a book tens of thousands of miles without actually moving the physical book itself yet in the era of ftl transport and communication we have to actually ship the physical vessel of knowledge itselfwtf
it would be like letting you fit mods to your ship that you didnt have the skills for i mean you wouldnt be able to undock so it should be fineif this is allowed in any way shape or form which i hope its not then it should have to be only via the queue system and fit within the 24hrsstill not supported
could be useful and to prevent too much skillbook injection why not just only allow skillbooks that only have 1 missing prereq to be injected or something like that so you cant just inject a whole bunch up the ladder  like t2 large gunnery skills without having any of the lower skillsthen you could pick up a few useful bits eg you start training small spec blasters and once thats started you can inject the medium spec blasters skill even tho you cant start it but you cant inject the large spec skillbookthat kinda thing
actually if the devs wanted to implement the ability to fit mods you cant use with the caveat that you cant undock until you have the skills for them id probably support that itd let you prebuild ships for contracting test fits you havent skilled into without needing to install eft and do all sorts of other nifty things its far lower priority than this change because itd likely be harder to implement and it has less overall utility but yes i would be in favour of that why is it the games job to make things hard everything should be as easy as possible subject to the caveat that everyone has to live within the same rules and you cant cheat on actual gameplay theres no reason i ought to have to be online to add a skill and injectwithoutprereqs is as easy a way of implementing that as any to be honest i dont really care how they implement this feature  add a physical book to the queue preinjection get the book out of your hangar put isk into the queue and itll market buy for all i care the point here is that skilling should be effortless on the players part  you figure out what you want tell it to the game and the game does it for you without screwing you around moving skillbooks and alarmclock skill training arent fun theyre a stupid unnecessary burden its ccps job to get rid of that crap and let us play eve instead of having to fight with the client to advance our characters they have a great game they just need to get all the hilariously bad interface issues out of the way and let us play it
yes please
well if you follow that logic to its end why bother with skill books at all why doesnt the skill just get added to your skill tree the moment you buy it and just sit there until you train itthey need a physical object for it to work in the games economy thats why you might also ask why you can trade dirt hookers and cigarettes but you canim outspoken on this though so ill just give up on this one
im struggling to get what this has to do with the discussion information while it can be rendered in a physical medium doesnt have to be physical ancient civilizations got by without writing anything down for thousands of years dirt on the other hand isnt really very useful unless its a real physical object consider thisif i showed you pictures of the pages of a book they have the same value as if i had shown the same pages in a real book if i showed you pictures of dirtwellyeah youd have pictures of dirt not much you can do with thoseanyway back to the booksthe only point i can see to have a skill object is if there are skills that are only available as loot drops or for transport into nullsec where there are no npc salesmen and for that matter you dont even really need them then just have the skill store part of the neocom  works no matter where you are as long as youre not inside a wh buy a skill viola instantly added to your skill listthats like saying you cant buy musicinformation unless you actually sell records the physical incarnation of that information which itunes proves on a daily basis is dead wrong
well that would be an interesting idea but thats not whats being proposed here also the other items i mentioned were to illustrate that even with light travel humans are stupid enough to smokethats like saying you cant buy musicinformation unless you actually sell records the physical incarnation of that information which itunes proves on a daily basis is dead wrongim not ed i specified the games economy the current eve economy operates without any nonphysical objects even plexes can be looted from wrecks so while your ideas of digital mediums in game are very interesting im struggling to see how this is relevant since the proposal at hand is injecting physical skills into your body before you have the prerequisites to even learn the information i dont support it i feel like the skill queue is enoughhowever if you propose the neocom based skill trade system i will support it de
actually the eve economy is based on a nonphysical object  the isk you dont need to move it it doesnt sit in a hangar theres no fort knox to hold all your gold you just have it you can be 10 wormholes out from deepest 00 and still transfer isk to a loggedoff player in jita without jumping through any hoops whatsoever why cant this be the model for more things
no support this change would break sanity check of the whole training system
this proposal came from another thread on the forumsimply put it seems silly to me and to some others that in order to acquire a new skill in this age of ftl communications you have to actually fly to somewhere where the skill is stored in a physical form purchase said physical entity and then use iteven with the current technology on planet earth we can move information far more efficiently that this its akin to have to fly to england to find out who the current ruling monarch ismy proposal then is to add a skill store to the neocom you can open it anywhere you happen to be even in space purchase a skill and have it immediately added to your skill list skills you cant train yet could be designated in some way to indicate you dont meet all the requirements both in the store front and in the skill listi would say that it should not work if youre in a wormhole simply because the ftl communications network doesnt extend that farnow given this is definately not a requirement having to fly somewhere to buy a skill doesnt offend me or otherwise make the game less enjoyable for me but i can think of some instances where its useful  what if youre stuck on gatecamp duty out in the middle of 00 and you suddenly realize you need a skill you dont currently have a few seconds later crisis averted you can resume shooting hapless victims as they jump through your gatethe same argument can be applied for just about every other profession in the game the only profession that problably see much benefit from it are traders since they spend so much time in trade hubs anywaythe point behind it is it gets rid of this antiquated need to identify information with a physical mediumdrawbackthere is only one real drawback that i can see and that is that there may be skills which i am unfamiliar with that are only available as loot drops or mission rewards if that is the case then i could see a modified version of this proposal that would allow you to have those particular skills show up as an object say a datachip not a book that could either be uploaded injected into the skill list or sold via contracts edited for clarification on selling
this is a simple support  dont support questionif you wish to get into detail please add to the ongoing discussion here in a constructive mannerit is assumed that the current bomber would need to be range nerfed and tweaked towards hitting smaller targets to fit in to ccps current visionif you have made comments in the above thread please dont repost them here this is a vote about the most commonly asked for thing in said discussion thread
totally agree with op
i think the 2 bomber idea is a good one 
do we now create a topic for people who want to have the option of cruise or torps on the same bomberas ive stated in the other bomber threads here and here i am pro choice for setups instead of putting ships into a very narrow focussed rolei would prefer one hull with the option of cruise or torp for maximum flexibility however if creating a second bomber type would allow me to retain the current cruise bomber as a support harassment tool then i support the ideai dont care about the covops cloak either way
i support
i dont agreethey are already to much advantage with the missile
agree
agreed we have the force recon and the combat recon1 for stealth and long range 2nd for close range and full powerthis should be introduced to the bombersforce recon and a combatforce recon for the cruise and range and stealthcombat for close range torped full dmg wtfpwnage bomber
agree
this not two ships just allow the use of torpcruise missiles on the same ship
leave the user free to choose between torps or cruise both bonus cant be used at the same time that makes the ship not more powerful but more flexible
total agreement on this issue as someone who has used stealth bombers successfully in the past a new additional frig bomber type makes a lot more sense than the current were just radically changing it option
meh you are misleading your post states a nerf to the current bomber change your platform to add new type of stealth bomber leave old as is to coincide with your topic thread
most definately ccp simply must delay this change until they have resources to create the 2nd hull if thats why existing hull is being rewamped
sure dude
how about they just let the player choose whether to fit siege or cruise if youre really insistent on making the new ship an option split the tohit bonus 1667 cruise explosion radius and 20 siege explosion speed per level but let players use both nobody objects to the cocd but the removal of cruises is crazy but yes given the choice between the platform switch and just adding a new class of ships i want the new class over this proposal
we dont need a new ship the fix is dead simple just bonus sbs to reverse the cruise missile nerf let them warp cloaked without a ed 30 second recloak delay and a little boost to cloaked speed would be spiffy whats so terrible about that the only people who think the result would be a horrifyingly overpowered solo pwnmobile of pure helldeath have obviously never flown a stealth bomber
no support we have enough stealth in gamejust fix whats broken dont destroy what isnt broken
it makes perfect sense since the new stealth bomber represents significant departure from current one
this idea also makes sense but the only chance you have to make it happen is to push thru the idea that stealth bomber changes will be applied to a new ship not current oneonce ccp changes the current ship the door for more changes will be closed get your foot in the door preserve old model first so it can be fixed later or it will be wiped out
ow yes would be sweet
agree we need it
oh yes
agree

you appear to be basing you calcs on the hulk mining fulltime an intensive refinery can handle the load of about 1618 hulkhours a day that could very well be 4 hulks running for 4 hours if you are trying to mine more than that my suggestion would be to do it somewhere where there is the support you need or with a rorqual to compress it up for you compressed ore makes the refineries 20 to 40 times faster if you insist on mining in wspace accept the limitations the reducednonexistent infrastructure presents
please allow covert cynosural fields to be generate in 05 and aboveyou cant jump caps to them anyway so i can see no real reason not to be able to use black ops jump drive in highsec i think it would increase the use of this ship both for wardecs and also for general mobility
before they made blockade runners jumpable i might have gone for this at present though i cant  it makes highsec transportation far far too easy
i really am tornwhile blocade runners could brake high end transportation its a lot of skills for not much m3actually i say do it it may shake up empire pvp a bit
good points i think its an interesting way for corps involved in empire wars to spice things up blockade runners cargo holds arent that big i dont see this affecting traditional trade in a big way ive been wrong before thoughso long as it remains an enforceable exploit to avoid concord using this mechanism sounds like something thats at least worth talking about
i would be okay with this if it couldnt be used to jump freighters and haulersas someone already pointed out transporting logistics is ridiculously safe in eve already we dont want to make this game too carebear
afaik you cant use them for jf
a recon blockade runner and black ops to move 6k m3 thats a lot of skills  ships  fuel  accounts to move not a lot of stuff
this is all about changes that were implemented in eve for a past 2 yearsand in my part  about stealth bombers changeslink for the interested
this is not nearly as bad as the nanonerf its like comparing madrid bombings to the holocaust1000 times worse and the people just stood and watched i cant forgive the people responsible for that atrocity against game design
id be happy with a choice torps or cruise pretty much the devs are screwing us out of a good ship
not that it will do the slightest bit of good because ccp devs dont seem to play the game the way we do there is more than sniper bs fleets and pos takedowns guysas ive stated in the game dev thread one of the best features of eve is the ability to customise the fitting of a ship and finding new ways to use a ship that some other people write off as uselessany policy change from ccp to make ships have very focussed single roles which break the options that players have is to be avoided almost every ship in the game has the option for short or long range weapons currently the bomber has cruise and bombs though they are somewhat brokenso far many people have claimed that bombers are useless as is and need to be changed others like myself would welcome the option of torps or cruise because it opens up new situational tacticshowever ccp seem to be slamming the door in our faces on this and would rather take a frigate which is very useful in small roaming gangs and turn it into an anti battleship platform without the damage or survivability for that role how can a bomber be expected to survive within point and heavy neut range next to a battleship fielding dronesrange was the key to keeping a bomber alive and even then a single ceptor could get on top of a bomber with reasonable ease meaning the bomber having to warp out and back all the time and even with these issues people found a use for themis the current bomber overpowered it certainly cannot be described as a solo pwnmobile whilst it can lob cruise out to 150km they take so long to arrive that unless the target is tackled they will never kill anythingwill we adapt to the proposed changes should they be pushed to tq probablyshould ccp give options instead of trying to focus ships into a single role setup yes
yeah theyre doing silly things with a bad ship that will probably make it worse in the end who the hell wants a 3torp sb to kill a battleship when you can just use a 6torp raven the cocd is nice and the ability to use torps is fine but taking away cruise and the ability to hit light stuff i just dont understand these ships do not need nerfing oh please i seem to recall 1600 people voting against it when it was proposed just because the devs did it anyways doesnt mean people were silent also comparing game design decisions to the holocaust always in bad tasteedit why do we need quotes in our url tags stupid crappy forums
i make that comparision because it is strong enough to express how i feel
op is not talking about speed reduction nerf however drastic this was hes talking about the complete destruction of a ship class the only point of which is to enable ccp to use the existing platform for an entirely new role
ill vote for whichever csm representative runs on the platform of bringing a meat cleaver to their meeting in iceland with the intention of redesigning the game dev responsible for this abortion of an idea
agreedleave the bombers as they are a support harassment platformfrigate vs battleship is failfrigate vs cruiser is winfrigate vs blob is lolcruise missiles were perfect for this balanceretain them boost explosion velocity a tad though
do i want to see the current bomber removed from the game  nodo i want to see a cloaky torp bomber introduced  yesdoes fire out ccp game designers rebalancing stealth bombers address either of these issues  noplease delete this thread as it is an emo attack on the devs and replace it with a useful poll like the new bomber should be introduced as a new ship not replace the old one emo rage not supported
sorry to ruin your day but youre nowhere near the sb pilot if you saying thati were lobbing the co cloak for bombers too but with recent game changes not only gameplay but also the technical part i can see what sb is and how it could be used properly without a co cloakive run tests both in space and on paper to see how it performing co cloak on actual combat boat is a fail of game balancechoosing between current sb as they are and proposed changes  i choose no changes at alli can live with half damage to the ships of my size but i cant live with zero damageand 10 paper ships attacking a bs without a chance to hide from its guns is a faili disagree with the way this tipic was present but issue itself should be addressed sb need love not raping
new constructive thread started herecan a mod please lock one of these 2 threads to prevent obscene amounts of double posting thx
i dont particularly like that theyre switching weapon platforms from cruise to torps this doesnt seem fair to anyone thats not caldari whos trained for cruise specifically for sbs but i dont agree with the ops suggestions either1 id like to see the current sb contiune to use cruise missiles get the explosion radius bonus so it can better attack smaller ships and be able to use the covert ops cloak2 i dont think there should be a 30 second reactivation delay since if anyone whos ever flown one will agree with uncloaking will most likely result in your death making most attacks a suicide mission 3 i do think they should release a heavy stealth bomber class of frigs that use torps and are specifically designed to fight battleships 4 i think they should introduce a special new launcher for sbs that loads the regular cruisetorp whichever it may be plus also can load a bomb that way sbs can tactically decide in battle which platform they want to use bombs build cost should be reduced drastically down to maybe 1milunit the current cost makes them impractical for any real pvp they should fly a greater distance faster before they explode and ideally some sort of tactical overlaydisplay to better judge where the explosion will take place instead of just guesswork so basicly keep the current sb introduce a new ship class for the torp version remove or greatly reduce recloak delay and give some major love to bombs i cant offer my support to the ops proposal its too much of an attack then a serious proposal
i vote that somebody forces chronitis to actually fly a stealth bomber for a week then he can tell us all about how a ship made of damp tissue used in the main for its alpha strike against small targets at long range and not its long term dps should be shooting battleships at 30km its like hunting moose with a paintball gun ffsthe fix is so damn simple remember how you nerfed cruise missiles sbs use only cruise missiles bombs ya right do you see a mothering problem there bonus the ship to fix the nerf and if you could bring yourself to providing a little bit of extra fun let them actually be stealthy by warping cloaked and give them a speed boost when cloaked still not any sort of solo pwnmobile nothing unbalanced to worry your little head over just a fun ship with a very limited use still very easily killed by anything still a ton of countermeasures to the ship whats wrong with thatwhats wrong with giving the players what they want once in a while why do you have to be such stingy bastards wheres the fun ye gads if chronitis is any indication can you imagine a ccp christmas exchange everybody gets a pair of socks
2 months at least and even then itd be not enough were flying them for our lives at the very least hell be flying just to fly
let ccp make their new stealth bomber idea into a new ship so wed have 2 stealth bomber classes  one with cruise one with torps
double effectiveness is a very nice throwin id wager especially given that nos income is doubled without neut costs going up and the curse has enough high slots to reasonably fit a mixed group really i think the problem with these ships traces its way back to the nos nerf  they likely made a lot more sense before then and now theyre left with bonuses that dont make nearly as much sense the nos nerf made sense for a dominix but on a pilgrim it was just a bit weird in what it did now that neuts are generally better double effect isnt as powerful since it doesnt fuel your ship this leaves the pilgrim in an odd place  you cant just fly in close pull a free cap booster out of your high slots and use that to feed everything else and drain the enemy besides you now have to actually run a cap which places a serious pinch on everything else you do im sure the pilgrim ran just fine prenerf but the nerf hit it rather uniquely  it cant easily switch to neuts because the enemy can evade them and it doesnt have much else going for it  its just an arbitrator that can warp cloaked i know this is a bit at odds with my opnions on ecm changeswhich im still mulling over slightly but the tldr is rook kitsune and maybe widow as the only ships with ecm range bonuses and ecm base ranges getting gimped significantly with some other bonuses instead but the difference is based on the magic number of 24km inside 24 kmbarring hic gallente recon officer scram etc combat is forced outside it is not losing range outside 24 km is less relevant than losing the ability to use your weapons against anything holding a point on you the range bonus on the curse boosts it well above 24km meaning that it can apply 5 neuts to anything that can point it which is enough to turn off half the weapons in the game as well as mwds and scrams the lack of that range bonus on the pilgrim means that it cant smack down a ceptor at 20 km whereas it could if it had the range bonus instead conversely while the range bonus on an ecm ship matters greatly for fleet combat for smallgang work where the scram is the key point the difference between 40km and 250km isnt as big id still rather have longer range of course but its not crippling to lack it since you can still sit safely at brave sir robin ranges and have an impact on the fight also the pilgrims primary dps weapon is the drone which has a 50km range for most people furthermore one of its ewar types is also suited to this range having a 6070 km optimal with average skills why is its third weapon type limited to 13km that just doesnt fit with the rest of the ship im not asking for 50km neuts but the 3238 that the curse gets would at least make more sense i guess i have to ask your question in exactly the opposite direction  nosneut range is short enough that a range bonus is the better bonus for anything that isnt a gallentestyle mwdblaster ship why would i bother flying the pilgrim without it it doesnt have enough high slots to be the primary neut ship for your gang anywaysonly 3 once you fit the cocd so you might as well let it use the three it does have effectively an extra 36 wont cripple anybody fast enough to matter too much but an extra 25km gives you a mass of extra tactical options that a simple strength bonus does not
switching the bonuses instead of adding one would still leave the curse with a role its a tougher ship would have a neut amount bonus still plus in normal fits it has onboard dps the pilgrim would still be weaker and have only dronebased dps which can be killed which is a fair tradeoff for a covops cloakso it would bring the amarr recons inline with the other three where the noncloaky one is more effective at the expense of not being able to warp while cloaked
leave my pilgrim alone as a pilgrim pilot i do not support this change
leave my pilgrim alonei love the pilgrim its one of the better ships out there if you know what you are doingedit haha just noticed the guy right above me no its not my alt
thiscompared with other force recons pilgrim is a fine solo ship its not a solo pwnmobile but still good
never had an issue getting a pod out unless there is a bubble or massive lagif there is lag having new shortcuts wont help
in my case the issue isnt so much lag as graphics settings when im for example involved in a smallscale mining op in lowsec i dont have my graphics settings down at their minimums because sitting in a belt or site mining my nottopnotch graphics card can handle whats on its plate pretty well and i can appreciate the lovely graphics the game has if suddenly a dozen pirates warp onto us and i need to warp out asap my frame rate falls through the floor and i cant navigate through the overview andor contextual menus fast enoughif you think i should keep my graphics settings lower well you have a point there but i dont see how making warptozero for whatever object is currently selected a keystroke is any more controversial than keystrokes for activating modulesstill supported
i always get podded as well
this needs to come back as per some other replies sometimes people arent away from the game because they want to be but because of rl circumstances
this 
i wrote the proof of concept code
im sure eve bank is greathow can anything lvv did be bad but i cant write contracts or market orders where the isk flows into or out of my eve bank wallet automatically speaking personally id love to have one wallet for my direct incomemissions pvp loot etc and one for my indirect incomeresearch manufacturing etc but the game mechanics dont allow that without use of a corp wallet or funneling everything through an alt neither of which is especially convenient in any case however that isnt the topic of this thread so ill drop it until such time as i think i have a sensible enough proposal to be worth a thread of its own ops idea is still a mediocre one imo and i still dont intend to support it without some sort of concrete reason why i ought to
there are taxes and booking fees i dont see a reason why there should be no bank actually it makes no sense that there is none you would have risk vs reward a secure bank with small payouts or a player driven bank with larger interest outcome but chance of being scammedalso being able to have more then one wallet on one character would be great
wallet divsions  yespassive unearned income with zero risk nothere is already a zero risk place to keep your isk in your wallet
thats two people in support ill make a topic
theres no reason you cant have both really t2 destroyers that focus on combat probes speed and tackle for pvp probing and t2 bcs that focus on coreds probes gank and tank for pve probing are both entirely feasible ships leave covops the ones with the best strength bonus10 per level instead of the 5 per level the others would get and the only one that can warp cloaked so that they dont lose their niche now thats probably way too many probing ships but it could quite reasonably be done other than that concern as for the op i generally support another class of scanning ships not sure whether the dd or bc hull is best but this is a perfectly reasonable addition thatd make a lot of scanners lives a lot easier not urgent but it could be a good idea for the next major expansion of ship classes
an idea worth looking at
nowhy is this needed a specialist job should require a specialist ship to do well you can fit an expanded probe launcher on any other ship it just wont be as goodas far as but i want to fly a combat shipif you dont like flying them find someone who does
thank you for the feedback i will answer your questions and suggestionscritique herei have to disagree with your idea as it basicly would eliminate the covert ops from being useful and would make plexing too easy as you have an all in 1 ship for exploration which basicly takes away any challenge of getting your combat ship back without getting yourself killed especially in 00on a second note fotm can be easily avoided by giving it negative and positive sides such as no cloak and a low base speed this makes people think a 2nd time before flying iti feel that if you base my idea around a bc class that it will not work the ship i have in mind is supposed to be a small searchhold vessel based around having bonuses for combat scanner probes which no ship has atm a battlecruiser type would be too big sacrificing things such as agiliy locking speed etcand this is exactly what i am suggesting it should be a specialist ship one designed to searchhold the target for a minute or two until the main fleet arrives it should not on any occasion be a solo ship sure you can fit an expanded probe launcher on any ship but i can assure you that you will not find anythingthe problem is no sane person would want to sacrifice their pvp ship just for scanning duty since most people think they are not going to make much of a difference in a gang the covert ops is also not designed around the idea of a ship with combat scanning bonuses one issue i think should be adressedthis would be a buff to small roaming gang pvp yes one i think is not for the worstastrometrics 5 is maybe a good suggestion but i think it should stay covert ops 4 as this is more in line with the interdictor which has the interceptor 4 skill i believe it should stick in line with an interdictor and make people actually wanting to train this
qft
theyre two different ships the destroyer would be intended to scan and tackle player ships and pin them down long enough for reinforcements to arrive  itd do next to no dps but be at least a little bit survivable the battlecruiser would be intended to be capable of fighting npcs seriously probably at about the combat level of a l3 mission bc the only thing they would have in common is the scan strength bonus and even then there could be differenceseg the destroyer getting a bigger bonus but only to scanning out players you cannot mix the two roles  implement one the other or even both but youre right that a tackler bc would be silly and similarly a plexing dd would be useless
the bc version is already available pick a normal bc add a sister core probe launcher sister probes and some gravity capacitor upgrade et voilUFFFD you have a bc with a good increase in scanning strength and capable of tanking most exploration sites with the introduction of the core probe launcher any ship can probe complexesabout the frigatedestroyer version i have some misgiving about the balancing of ithow large will be his cpu 220 for the extended probe launcher plus another 120 for the weapons and tankabout 5060 as power grid assault shipdestroyer leveli am no eft warrior at all but what can be placed in a ship with that values if you drop the extended probe launchers
i think that it should not receive ungodly amounts of cpu im not going to give you any numbers without meanings here just give it a bonus in cpu decrease like the preapochrypa cpu decrease on the covert ops and it should be fine while still keeping it balanced
just declare war and wait 24 hours or go to one of the 90 of systems in the game where there is no concord protectionevading concord is a monumentally bad idea
can you imagine anyone in a cloaked tackler sitting around hisec on the offchance that a black ops will show up and try some funny business can you imagine a bigger waste of time for that pilotthe rules we have are fine the rules we have work if its not broke dont fix italso correct me on this if im wrong but if the black ops in this scenario were concorded wouldnt it still be illegal for anyone else to loot his wreck
my reaction exactly
i pondered this in another thread here about npc banksconcept you should be able to split the isk in your wallet up into multiple piles certain piles could be password protected be shown to the corp or alliance in a new wallet interface or simply be labelled for easy organization of assetsreasonsorganisation of assetssafeguard your isk  small protection against being scammed if you use the system correctly ie be smart password protected locks would provide a small bit of ingame protection against having your account looted by a hackereasy recording of purchases to help keep track i purchased 10 thoraxes using my ship pile this month and 104 damage control iis with my fittings pile for example this would require a small amount of coding but i could imagine it will make the more fussyminded market pvpers or even the purchasing lackey for a corps life a bit easier
i currently give my money to one alt for savings one alt for trade and one alt for pvp spending cashit would be nice to have personal wallet divisions with divisions reachable by all three toons on one account
id like it just so i can set aside a certain amount of money as my crap i got podded replacement fund so i know what i can afford to lose
this would make it way easier to track what i earn from various types of pew pew versus what i earn from manufacturing right now its a bit of a hash trying to figure out just how much im making off manufacturing without loading excel and inputting a pile of data to sort out what ive made shorn of bounties and loot drops to see if that halfbillion wallet bump was because i made a profit on manufactured goods or because i spent last weekend missioning the code to do this already exists from corp wallet divisions so this should be fairly easy and this thread certainly indicates that theres a lot of ways it could be used
great idea nice organizational tool

hi 1 pos es me off no end anything you could do to make it better simply makes the game better imo2 i dont npc much read ever and im not really interested in sov stuff but judging by what you said in 1 you get my vote here too3 touches a nerve there shouldnt be lvl 4 agents in high sec get them moved and pvp riskreward all the modules should survive in 04 space moar loot this candidate gets my vote for the next csm term
i support this candidate idea andor product
because i am not an alt nor is fried an alt of minei am one of the lowest if not the lowest skill point players in foom with only 20 mil skill points give or take i have one alt industry based and my main happy who is pvp spec being around experienced players has given me a rather good perspective and lots of experience on various aspects of the game that folks with my level of skill points dont normally havei have knowledge regarding true 00 from pos operations to large scale fleets including multiple capital ship battles experience in npc 00 experience in low sec faction warfare empire wars experience with eve logistics pvp mining missions construction of t1 t2 and now t3 materials and products about the only thing i really lack is the experience of living in empire for long periods of time along with the pirate lifestyle with the low sec status that goes with it my industry alt has a jump freighter and someday i will do a respec and push him into the carrier and dread as i already have the jump skills although to be honest they dont particularly interest me at this time i prefer to stay with my command ships and below and am just starting on my 2nd race of ships right now overall i believe myself to be well balanced and knowledgeable regarding eve if elected i hope that i can help ccp to improve the game for all players
sorry if i got that wrong we found a leaked bruce forum during our brief recent war with foom that indicated that happy joymaker was a fried alt if i can find the link ill post itno matter the more candidates is better while happy was a spy in our alliance briefly for the alliance tourny our members liked him and he did seem to know what he was talking about so like ruri dant who i cant promise to vote for and will vigorously run against im happy to see happy in the race even though i wont support or vote for himwelcome to the race happyissler
its always best to check the veracity of random spy reports accepting things at face value can result in looking somewhat foolish
certainly good advice this wasnt a random spy report however it was a verified released of the contents of the foom forums when bruce broke up i hope i can find it again it was a fun read issler
also please dont be doing this for a free trip to iceland as for your wife you will be expected to be heads down for most of the time there if you want to be a tourist with your wife plan on extending the trip for some free timemy advice is go to fan fest with the wife youll have a much better time the csm trip is work not funissler
fixed the linkfound itbruce  foom trash talk in forumsin that thread leaked from fooms own forums we find this fried quote so i have concerns about honesty based on happyfrieds answer to my first question friedhappy had no issues with revealing my alts although my alts are not a secret during the pvp tourny not sure why happy as a fried alt has to remain a secret are you worried about political issues you might have lurking post bruce friedissler
this post inspires me to think about how much better eve would be if the help file was in jiveimagine aura talking jivei could relate to thatabulurd bonifaceme meceo
unfortunately they decided to remove the system scanning array from the game instead of making it usable in the last patch so i expect this suggestion will fail not a bad idea and ive heard variants on it elsewhere but youre late to the party id say also jita park is for discussions about the csm elections and such if you want to make proposals assembly hall is the forum youre looking for

unbalanced huge boost for attackers bad for defenderswhile i will admit the localintel aspect is an ongoing issue simply removing it is not the answer
no just removing it without an improved scanner would be bad i believe most agree with thisimproving the scanner or having an option to actively or passively scan is an option
thats fear talking right now when an attacker comes into local the first they they see is a list menu of potential targets in that system taking away the menu is good for the meat and potatoes not the guy trying to find something to eat
ok from what i understand gates transport specific information to a subspace beacon in the system which relays to local communications of a ship the only way that i could support this would be through the following1 subspace beacons used to relay local should be a destructible object that must be probed to be located2 subspace beacons should have an upgradeable defense structure that can be directly related to sovereignty level of an alliance that owns it ie sov 1  5 level i sentries max sov 2  10 level ii sentries max sov 3  15 level iii sentries max etc3 subspace beacons should have hps that increase with the sovereignty level4 destructible subspace beacons should only exist in 00  they should not be destructible in empire space5 beacons would be automatically sent from empire to replace any beacons destroyed this would take approximately 12 hours and local would take that much time to show player in local6 beacons would change location after being destroyedyou can expand on this all you want or just plain hate it its just a fair method to allow players to bring more tactics into 00 and not just a horrid blob vs blob basically it gives players the ability to blind local and make 00 a little more dangerous and realistici wont support an absence of local entirely unless there is a well thought out method of implementing it and mine doesnt necessarily need to be the one
i dont preferr but i play solo too not only as part of a blob and i wanto to be able to play solo even in the futureinexact i found most of it incredibly boring some small action if fun but most of it is big group with ista win for one side or the other and so no fun at all i see the removal of local without a workable alternative as a big threat all your alternatives are not workablei every post i replied to your suggestions thhat was a further comment on your kind of repliessure but that is not you were sayingyou where saying that having the need to put a 220 cpu module on a ship to scan the system was finethat rule out as solo ship almost any ship below bs and will degrade performance for almost all ships ask people that want to do small groupsolo pvp what they think of the need of having a 220 cpu extended scanner as an indispensable piece of equipment if local is removed every ship should have the possibility to check for hostile in a timely and efficen mannerthe current directional scanner is not a solution because it will be an excessive burden for the server but your solutions to that always include nerfing it into uselessness so at the end we return always to the same point you want local removed and dont want any form of alternative working information gathering system
and do you want to have the extended probe scanner as a mandatory piece of equipmentlook the above post for the reason of this question
venkul please read both my posts here before spouting another logical fallacyso your chances of not being blobbed by people in a system because of you announcing your presence is increased or decreased by nerfing local you tell me so pvp is boring there are no surprises its just insta win or no ever been in a ceptor duel try itbut i digress nerfing local will make pvp or in any regard lowsec and nullsec much more adrenaline pumping even when not engagedyou should read my posts more in every post i replied to your suggestions thhat was a further comment on your kind of repliesno you take one thing i say and have done nothing but develop irrelevant conclusions an example will be shown below you sir brought out using the 220 prober as a scan tool it was your idea not mine i said yes to actively scanning i said yes to having a person dedicated to keeping an eye outi said yes to the following example put out by you not once did i disagree with you there its part of enhancing the ships base scanneryou suddenly come out with using the combat probe launcher out of thin air and from that point on run away with itfrom the very first post in which i addressed you in this thread i politely asked you to read what i wrote you instead wish to push an argument with a position against what you stated you wanted yourself
part iii believe i addressed this enough if local is removed every ship should have the possibility to check for hostile in a timely and efficen mannerare you telling me that in lowsec and nullsec every unknown ship should be treated with caution we cant have that here that would be too sensible my suggestions have been1 enhance an active scanner2 add an additional ui scanner to essentially replace where people place the local window giving at a glance information regarding thier surroundings i have in addition opened these options to criticism and suggestion from you i received first an ad hominem attack and second a complete dismissal with nothing constructive this is the third logical fallacy youve thrown out surely you can do better than this ive stated several ideas ive said if local is nerfed or removed mind you ive already stated delayed local is ok for me that there would need to be scanner enhancementswhat i have also said though is that there should not be a catch all instant intel tool to be exploited by both attackers and defendersive been mostly on the defensive side in 00 using locala while back in a nowdead alliance wed happily carebear in our barges with an alt parked up the pipe and use local to know when to dock from local we would have the ability to see who was coming thier standings and thier intent we would either blob or dock both of those we agree are detrimental to pvpwhen attacking we would use local to find targets we would just breeze through systems if local was empty wed just push onsee thats the thing nerfing local makes things harder for the attacker they have to actually search for targets sure it may mean they have to drop a probe in every system which seems easy enough but as you said not every ship can fit a combat scanner or if it does it would need to be a dedicated prober welcome to eve where ships work together as a team you cant take because of falcon into a fight solo but with a gang its just super you often need a tackler even with smaller ships you may want to have a rr gang relying on each other for tank so you want to fly solo get a t3 cruiser with the new 4th subsystem and now you have a dedicated hunter ship combat probes cruiser size and still an offensivedefensive subsystem to spareif you want to solo in an af or inty youre fast enough to use the on board scanner ive hunted down targets with it often to great success but it was in wh space with nerfed local
your suggestionsie exchange a system range passive tool local with a 3 au range passive tool passive scan 50 range maybe even limited to cov ops you arent much clear herethis is agreeing with my example in post 71 for you agreeing with a suggestion mean saing stop wanting to play the game on easy modeand again reducing the range ad hominem attack not the first but at least you seem to accept the idea that the passive scan should have a good range and suggest that it will give range to detected items a horrible suggestion ghost images and false signals and a suggestion about detecting cloakers one of the few good thing from removing local would be the enhancement to cloakers and you want it removed
and here we see where the discussion about the probe launcher started you put emphasis on that yes and beautiful argument about running gang and not going around solo as the system to cover the drawbacks of the extended probe launcher links perfectly with your precedent posts where you depict a nearsighted passive scan and a so so active
id say that one guy in the gang being required to be in a dedicated probing ship would be a fantastic addition to the game  more jobs to do and learn to be good at it would also nerf safespotters who dont cloak up more
then your last poststhat clash with your precedent replyi see a large yes to force people to use the extender probe launcherand your yes was to me it seem a no
but to work it require a gang so you thing that running around in a gang should be mandatory in low sec00
it wouldnt require a gang any more than operations do now is there benefit to working with a group  yes  and there always will be i wouldnt hesitate to solo rat in 00 with local nerfed id feel a lot better about it because if someone comes into system they wont immediately know im in there
why did you leave this outno i was fleshing out ideas it doesnt have to be 50 it could be 75 it could be 50 of 99au or 75 of 25 au you assumed that i had some concrete solution this is a discussion not a proposal thats where you come in you can be constructive or not youve chosen the latter by choosing to debate over things that arent even near a finalized thought yes its agreeing with you you stated before being against the local nerf that the scanner ui would need to be buffed i agreed i included two types of scan modes passive and active i gave you your buffed scanner the only difference is that with each time the scan is made either manually or an automatic scan time it shows your presence to both passive and active scannerspassive scanners will not show on others doing passive scans unless they are within the lower range i dont know how to make this any more clear to you yesa horrible suggestion ghost images and false signals and a suggestion about detecting cloakers one of the few good thing from removing local would be the enhancement to cloakers and you want it removedthe only issue and reason i threw this out there was because if cloaks do not show on scan and there is no local it will turn into eve cloaked onlineit was an idea to preemptively prevent covops from becoming too powerful blockade runners would be unstoppable even though with jfs its already bad but thats another subject
were both wrong in this i accept blame for my part because i was posting on my blackberry and the topic of that had spread over 2 pagesit seems as though you took that as every ship in a gang should have a prober to scan even solo pilots the obvious thing i should have said and havent is that it doesnt happen now it doesnt happen in wh space it happens with roaming gangs it does not happen with solo roams unless they shoose to fit oneif they want to fit a combat probe launcher on there and sacrifice the fitting let them if it doesnt solve the marco problem oh well yes apparently you dont actually do roaming pvp much right now if you did youd notice its completely based on local and thats secondary to just grabbing a wolfpack and heading to a known populated systemhell in c30yd wed have those roaming gangs come in and fight all the time they knew we were here we knew theyd comebut if you want to have the ability to quickly scan down targets anywhere in a system get someone to probe for your gang or do it yourselfagain there is no reason to have a ship that does everything great in fact thats completely the opposite of what ccp wants in evequotelinks perfectly with your precedent posts where you depict a nearsighted passive scan and a so so active i stand by my idea of having both a passive scan on the bottom right of the ui or wherever and the buffed active scanthere is no reason youve given against it other than the fact that you feel 3au is too short however ive even stated it could be 14au i dont care it is viable and would need to be fleshed out with testingbut an active buffed scan should signal the defenders or in some cases it would signal the attackerseither way by having your ops protected being aware and being smart it would make unsec much more interesting
short version of all our discussions what you see as a buff to the scanner to replace local i see as a very weak and unworkable solution what i see as workable solution for you is too powerful what i see as criticism to point out the flaws of your arguments you see as arguing for the sake of arguing only an example of the last partyou were suggesting a range i pointed out that for me it is too short for you that is destructive criticism so what there is to constructively discuss for you the idea of the passive scanner commenting on the range and not commenting against the idea implies that the idea is at least accepted if not explicitly supported if this is a discussion commenting pro and against the proposed change is what it is there for but probably then it should be moved to the features and ideas discussion forum if it is only a way to gather votes pro the change our whole discussion is moot
sighive already went over this if you wish to discuss semantics we can do it in oopeand that hypothesis is with a 220 cpu probe launcher put that in every ship if you can who said that me or you 01 isk says not me my god this is getting annoyingi say i want a buffed scanneri say i want local nerfedi say i want a ui passive scanner that is not as strong as the active scanneri say i want the active scanner to show an active scan on passive scannersi say if you want instant intel get a buddy in a covops frig or whateveri say yes venkul a buffed scanner would be necessary i then say i do not want a scanner so strong it tells me everything about whats in a system and what is going on i do not want to know standings based on the scan results i do not want to know if that ship is moving at 300ms or 3000ms let it involve some guesswork tactics sweat fear i can use smaller words but honestly if i need to spell it out anymore im going to go all eom nutty gf
right your reply to that was only a bigyes
im impressed you managed to make ratting even more mindnumbingly boring a feat i thought would be near impossible and at the same time make it even less valuable compared to just doing missions good stuff
id rat away in 00 with no local relying on my trusty directional scanner to spot incomming hostiles any day of the year before id ever consider running missions to each thier own i suppose
the point lost somewhere on page 2 is that the current scanning system cant be supported by the server if every guy in 00 and low sec hit the scan button every 4 secondson the other hand nerfing too much the scanner and removing local will remove all risk control from the and of the players all the argument between grimes and me is what is too much nerfing and what informations are indispensable and useful when you remove local while this post dont explicitly say that the directional scanner alone will degrade server performance i think that it can be taken as a granted
gaines
in 00 you should be in a gang or have friends to back you up at short notice i dont recall ever saying that removing local from lowsec would be a good idea
your opinion im inclined to disagree he was talking about actual deployed scanning devices not improved onboard scannersother than the performance answer which can only be answered by ccp i havent seen a valid argument against it sofar
ive seen this ship in action the regulars in pure blind know darknesss kronos as the big teaser and while jumping into a camp just to say nyah nyah nyah and jump out might seem a bit lame when youre putting 5bn isk on the line each time you have to respect that watching it tank a moderate hac fleet is pretty coolhowever the only bug i am aware of that relates to this type of situation is the killmail bug recently ive seen many killmails where ships are just missing from the km and damage is flat out wrong i wouldnt trust the km to represent the engagement i dont think you were ddd and i dont think youd be using a broken km as an excuse to get reimbursed in any case on the basis that ccp agreed it was an unfair loss and this replaced the ship yes there is no reason to penalise the player by not reimbursing the items supported the potential for intentional item duplication would rely on being able to convince a gm that the bug was at fault and youd expect that if this policy was changed gms would become even more reluctant to agree to reimbursements but assuming gms know what theyre doing and the logs are adequate to determine whether the game play was as intended then ccp should be able to reimburse correctly agreed that the volume would have negligible economic impacti hope you are able to replace the parts and come trolling around pure blind again soon
i believe that darknesss position is correct that losses the direct result of a serious bug should be complete as in all modules returned it is unfair to excessively punish the player who experienced this bug by not returning billions in modules that they wouldnt of lost if the bug didnt exist the flipside is that this could be exploited discovering a serious bug like this before its patched would allow people to purposefully have a friend destroy their ship and then file a reimbursement and duplicating some of the mods such exploiting should carry a punishment of being banned for all involved parties i doubt it would take much investigation to determine if the players are doing this or not of course you couldnt eliminate all the people who could take advantage of this with remote aquantices in enemy alliancescorps but just the threat of banning for trying it should deter most peoplei dont think the remote offchance risk of people exploiting this policy change is enough to justify not reimbursing the loss of the modules to a serious bugthis isnt about tri or darkness or if this was the result of a bug or not or even anything about his situation this is about the general policy for reimbursement being changed for losses from serious bugs such bugs become quickly public knowledge and are quickly patched
no valid reason they shouldnt add themedit i fail at typing
would be nice to see wat they come up with for designe of the launcherssupported
i like the idea would be neat to have more stars in the background such as the ones we can travel to as well as space objects op is talking about
well they had discussed having other stars visible in space that you could set destinations to that would cause way too much lag but having them visible and having the clouds static and stationary would be nice right now they are just varying versions of the same hubble pics kind of needs an updateedit  adding support because of stupid forum glitch

yes to new backgrounds i have been loving the wormhole backgrounds so far so the normal systems really need some love
assuming rare skills and existing skill books are transitioned into datachip format  and yes there are a lot of droponly or nolongerseeded skills  this seems reasonable the whole concept of skill hubs has always seemed weird to me its not a matter of benefiting people its a matter of reducing player workload
on the rp side of the house this is technically a bad idea allowing direct access to your brain over a communications network seems foolish at best and down right suicidal at worst anything that could get into your brain through such methods is just opening doors to hackers of the mindon the non rp side of this no go take the time to pick up your skills just like everything else
bad idea noisaac
excellent idea reduces hassle
giving support as promised
and rpwise plugging in an implant is saferwhy youre doing exactly the same thingsince i already said that i didnt have an issue with picking up my skill books here the nonrp argument you offered really doesnt make much sense frankly the whole idea is that from a game immersion point of view it makes zero sense that you cant transmit information as efficiently if not more so 20000 years in the future than you can today
on the rp side of the house you already do plug your brain into a network or the cloning operation wouldnt work you also learn the skills via injections directly into your brainthe only reason skill books are physical is because thats just how the initial economy was structured theres no reason that there can not be a seperate neocom based store to buy your skills i think its a novel idea anyway
agreeing to a certain pointbut another ship wouldnt hurt although this old cruise bomber shouldnt use cov up cloaks since it is way out of reach and out of dangour
i think the change would be great for a black ops boost but i dont really use the bomber for much anything else so i am not sure exactly how this is going to affect other applications of this shipso i am not entirely sure how to vote given i have not explored all possibilites of the bomber
jesus christ you people are dumbccp are merely throwing out ideas and will then test them on their internal servers and then on sisi and then make concrete decisions we should be very grateful that ccp is allowing us into their balancedevelopment process and not overreact and start petitions and useless threads when ccp hasnt announced any final changes yetif you want to keep a version of the old bombers then do so by giving feedback in the correct thread ah is not for emofilled threadnaughts go to shc if you want to emorage
new ship while giving the old one a boost to explosion velocity as stated in the 15 page thread in the assembly hall from people who actually fly the boatotherwise please refund all the points put into frigate v covops and cruise missiles for all the pilots who ask for it theres quite a few pilots who trained these skills solely for the stealth bomber they will now be as worthless as training multitasking
changing the sbs is a joke a little used ship will be used even less offer us a choice or is ccp changing its mind about eve being a sandbox
i agree and support this although i still want my cov ops cloak without a recloak nerf
most definitely
local spam doesnt increase lag never has
okay so say you fit 3x damage mods 1 dcu then what about everything else is strictly inferior to a midslot version the nanonerf all those lowslot nano mods no longer worth fitting unfortunately broke lowmid slot balance as a sideeffect
refining arrays have one purpose to refine ice a bunch of small ones on a large tower can refine insane amounts of ice quickly at 100 efficiency for ore theyve never been worth it if any decent system with highend ores was way to far to fly hauling as you go to a station then a new outpost was built there with the crazy amount of loss 25 i think is crazy for the intensive one and the mind boggling 65 loss on the small one coupled how slow they are make them never in the past and even now a viable way to refine ore personally id love to see poss get some serious love redesigned from scratch with the flogging a dead horse design idea a unified corp hanger mods just increase size of it and refining array mods that you can add that will get you 100 refine ability at some serious cost like doubling or more the fuel costs of the towerin reality this the whole pos system needs scrapped and redone just trying to repurpose refining arrays for wspace poss isnt really something id want them to waste time on id love to see the next fall 09 expansion to be entirely about sov mechanics outpost and pos redesign guess i went off topic there
i spend a couple hours a day digging through the market posting buy and sell orders etc its nothing different than thousands of other players do everyday however as the years have passed there is one improvement that stood out in my mind that could be made that would truly streamline market interaction idea  add an option under market settings that allows us to highlight our own buysell ordershalf of the time i spend going through the market is spent finding my own orders and making comparisons if my own orders could be highlighted then visually parsing all the info would be magnitudes easier
nothing wrong and sure would be convinient
i expected to flame this for crossposting in market discussions however i have to agree with the op
this is a fantastic idea
signed
supported and i would add let us modify it by right clicking on the very same market screen instead of being forced to open walletorders this would help mitigate most cases of squizofrenia on new eden traders
id like to see the following improvements to faction warfare to make the system more fun and less not funa  less plexes that are worth more this makes plexes more valuable and more relevant to fight over you dont want to cause blob warfare to occur so you have to balance this with other issuesb  more difficult plexes with less plexes and more difficult plexes they will take longer to contend overc  harder defense plexing defensive plexing is too easy it requires no skill and can be done by an alt account whats the meaning of this sitting 1020 minutes doing nothing by making plexes more valuable you bring more contention to them meaning that its harder to defend because offense will be looking for more of them to do also defense plexing is worth more than offense plexing 1 defensive plex is equal to at least 15 offensive plexes taken what sense does this make for the system offense is impossible if you just wanted open warfare remove the dam stupid plexes you wanted spots of contention not centered around stargates however you didnt create anything of interest to fight over i think that there should be invading opposing npcs that join in combat when a player is defense plexing so that they get the same challenge that offensive combat gets also make defensive and offensive plexing equal in value you have only made things frustrating not entertaining you want people to move on from faction warfare but you present to them nothing more than absolute boredom as a first opportunity to experience pvp and the game try againsorry really stupid game design here you literally made fw boring on purpose great game design ya brilliant ill be sure to buy the next hot boring game on the shelf when im in a game stored  escalating plexes have plexes escalate from minor plexes at the start of the contention process and work up to major plexes at the height of the contention process rather than total randomness this allows players to guage better the contention of the system and to bring more forces to bear on the more valuable plexes and still lets new players feel more valuable working the plexes to the higher contention levels while veterans work on building up for the heavy battlese  allow multiple entrances into plexes to allow for combat variety camping an accel gate then a warp in point to a plex to try and catch targets is just dumb it allows for no variation in strategy or engagement theres no opportunity to assemble other strategies rather than warp to 0km and pray for the best if you create fewer more relevant plexes then you can allow for multiple warp in beacons on a plex that allow for fleets to pick different entry points to create better combat strategiesf  make it fun try that instead
especially agreed with the defensive plexing problem
a rigged occator gets over 10k and you can also use a dozen of them with one black opsrecon pair as easily as a single one i can easily see someone setting up an instantmovement business between say jita and rens for anyone with a blockade runner and some isk that is not something that ought to exist
first occators cant just to a covert cyno viators can and they get 10k m3 rigger and expannded although 10k m3 of trit isnt alot in isk 10k m3 off snake omegas is ok not the best example but you get my drift its not nessaserily the volume of the goods that makes it valuablei however think its a good idea but i just wanna speed up the occasional hauling i do p
youre right that was a typo i meant the viator i remembered it being at the top of the list in eft when i checked it so i assumed it was the one that was alphabetically first  i dont fly transports myself and i can never remember which is which the occator can get 35k but cant bridgehowever name issues aside the number was correct  10k m3 per ship bridging people wont be bothered for pure trit but for reasonable itemsnamed goods say then theres more than enough money to be made to justify the transport costs and its money that can be made far too easily
yes i will grant you that its a possibility but im sure ccp can code around preventing highsec covert cynos being usable by transport shipsadditionally moving highvalue stuff at the moment is pretty safe transport ships are damn near uncatchable as it is plus if you want to move larger quantities of valuable stuff you can put it in the corp hanger on an orca which neither shows up on cargo scan or drops if you are killed and is considerably more hp to suicide gank
i dont see the problem of the trading shortcuts which seem to be the main issue a black ops jump bridge has such little tiny really range that you probably never be able to jump from one trade hub to another and that while using expensive fuelthe one problem i see here is that you can avoid lowsec gate campssay you are delivering something in a system 3 jumps into lowsec and you have a black ops in a high sec system and one in a lowsec system you can make an easy jump bridge between the two and get all of your add expensive mod in i guess you can already do this or out there without any risk especially if you make this bridge near a station or posi like the idea but i think the above method i stated removes risk from lowsec way too easily
considering the extreme short range and insane training time it takes for covert cynos i cant see this as unreasonablewell obviously nobody will be bringing the black ops into pvp so worst case youre moving other ships around and suchpff wardecs are so broken and such i cant see why you even bother tbh
blockade runners can get through bubble camps easy let alone empire they also dont really haul much so essentially speaking the insanely short range jumpbridge and fuel costs pretty well balances that idearight now to basically go from oursulaert to amarr using a sin itd take roughly 6 jumpsthats alot of fuel because of how short range the black ops are all for blockade runner sized cargoon top of that its going to take 1000m3 of fuel just for the black ops add in the blockade runners and you have to pigyback a few blockade runners for fuelif someone wants to do this and be competitive on the market ya right
no no cynos whatsoever in highsec i see no reason nor purpose for this use isaac
wait until ccp finalizes their bo changes they are going to make bridging easierand anyway no more boosts to logistics it is too easy and safe now if anything it should be nerfed no cov ops cloaks on transports reduce jump freighter range increase pos jump bridge costs 10x force people to actually fly thru the damn gates and maybe just maybe well see people organize escort duty which would provide fun for everyoneif you played this game since 2004 youd know what im talking about
if you were around in 04 then you know good and well you didnt need an escort in 00 or anywhere players were rare to see in 00 and you should know that so dont bring up your silly bullpeople dont need to fly and use gates all the damn time thats why the jump bridge was made past that having them in highsec would be no issue as they cant move any large ammount anyway it was be much easer to move the stuff with the trasnport to a lowsec system 3 jumps out and jump to a different lowsec system near the other hub use your brain
i think this would bring an interesting dynamic to highsec wars also increase demand for these ships since highsec corpsalliances would find them useful and not restrict their customer base to just 00 dwellers prosmore options for fighting 00 warsincrease the customer base for black ops thus increase sell volume and price good for producers theyre already very nearly unprofitable to inventconsmight make transport of megavalue cargo safe in highsec but as already pointed out putting cargo in an orcas corp hanger makes it 100 safe since it cant be scanned or looted from if this is trueso for a con that isnt really a con because already exists ways to move megahighvalue cargo 100 safe in empire over making empire wars more interesting and possibly making a nearly unprofitable and nearly unused shipclass more profitable and usedall i can see is win with this proposal
since just treating all 00lowsec local like wspace local would likely be unfeasible without some serious uiscanner changes to replace that functionality i propose that we just make it so stealth ships not show up in local if they are cloakedthis will only apply to the following ship types covert ops stealth bombers black ops force recons and blockade runners this will apply to all kspace systems null low and highsec they only appear in local if theyre uncloaked what this means is they will flash in local when they switch from the just entered system cloak to their active cloak module giving people a chance if theyre really watching to see them for a second before they dissapear off local again these classes of ships should be suited to such stealth approchambush methods it will change aspects of pvp but it wouldnt be as gamechanging as every ship not showing in local like wspace discuss
not supported the change to local should be for all ships in all 00 space better scanning tools would be nice but i do not consider them necessary for this change to happen the directional scanner works well when used properly
until massive changes happen to the current scanning system im not supporting this isaacps and yes even i fly 34ths of those ships
ccp has expressed great desire to remove locals intel value at some point i get the impression that no matter what they do or change a subset of the population is not going to support it and throw a fit this proposal only increases risk in so much as a setup trap you cant be sure if that ratter has support cloaked next to it or not youd think carebears would like the proposal i made as it standsif your paying attention to local youll see the quick decloakrecloak flash extend that to maybe a full second or maybe two seconds of someone entering the system so you get prewarning to safe up it will also greatly increse the risk factor for roaming gangs wanting to gank rattersminers since they cant be sure its not a trapall this proposal will do is bring i think a very interesting new dynamic to 00 small gang warfare if anything it will increase the safety of rattersminers
i am only support this because i want a cov ops cloak without a recloak timer thats it no more and i will damn sure not be happy with anything less the whole torp suggestion is way out of line i seriously believe that these guys in charge have never really played this game yet they are the ones providing all the changes if they want a heavy bomber in the anti bs role make a t2 tier 2 bc heavy bomber and  that up give me my untainted cov ops cloak and leaf meh be
id rather ccp accidentally delete all database entries for stealth bombers and accidentally delete them from the backups
not supportedi think the last two years have been the most improvement to the mechanic in the entire eve history and the most improvement to balance issuesand the new bomber will be as it was supposed to be a class cannon with stealth that you need to fint the correct targets forhave you actually tested it out i have and i think it is out preforming the old bomber on every turn
no support the stealth bomber has had no real role up till now now that ccp has finally declared one i see why its such a good idea think of it in a real world setting oh noes he put it in real world settings no we have stealth bombers that come in stealthily delievers a big payload and then gets out of there have you ever seen a bomber stick around after hitting its targetthis role seems good and im willing to give it a try isaac
you think a volly thats 34 of that of a raven as a big payloaddude
sigh this is a frigate and once again comparing it to a battleshipseriously you all are too drunk on the original idea of the stealth bomber kpwning all the frigates to be honest the original had a pretty bad role at least now they have set a role for it and then we can improve on it which is a hell of a lot better than a nonrole now you have a very agile and mobile dps monster that can cloak and surprise people which is a pretty decent role no you wont be able to singlehandedly destroy ships and never die which imo was stupid in the first place now you are at least viable in a gang more small gang than large gang i suppose btw while were comparing the frigate to battleships we should buff all hacs so they do more damage than a battleship me end sarcasm see how stupid that comparison isisaac
there has been huge arguments over ninja salvaging and i think we need to settle itas it is now when you salvage not loot but salvage someone elses wreck you do it without consequence and there is little to nothing the victim can donow as a fan of eves dark side i even say this isnt right it is plain outright stealingwhat i propose is that when you salvage someones wreck it gives you the same aggro timer countdown to the victim and his corp as if you were to steal their cargo container the corp can shoot you for 15 minutesthe main argument by the salvagers is that a wreck is space junk and isnt worth anything well if it is junk why do you want it so badly and what concord may see as junk can be seen by the pod pilot as treasure and if enough people sign a petition then that junk will be defend able from thievessign below if you want salvaging to give people cargocontainer style aggro
i support salvaging giving you aggro
lmao this has been discussed for ages and i dont support itu want to be sure u keep the salvage profits u get rid of 12 high slots for a salvager and a tractor beam
bump supporting own topic
iirc the grid is 250km not 100 km so there is no reason you shouldnt be able to look at anything on grid
i disagreeif you go to a busy market street you are bombarded by people selling their wares at the top of their voices and competing with eachotherthis is the way i look at jita it is a busy market full of people selling their wares some scamming some selling bargains but all plying their trades in their own way local chat was not designed for everybody to use as a sell channel the fact that you are trying to compete with many others is just a fact of life you will have to live with yes the only think you can do is block the spammersso i suggest you do what everyone else does in eve create contracts sell on the markets and if you make your prices competative you will sell your stockgrz
no no no you have failed to apply the whatwouldgoonswarmdo with this feature test
this as well as the fact that i cant take any proposal too seriously coming from someone named taco torpedosorry but there arent any viable solutions offered here
would be nice with a real in game bank although there would be a huge problem when some one deposits 1 trillion isk and you can just think of the interest this will generate 
we dont need to counter the few isk sinks we have by isk generators should not ever happen
this if you want to earn money without work then buy shares of corporations and hope they do well
true core launchers make this a lot easier and as such the bc model is far less relevant than it used to be im used to it obviously being a good idea to add but i suppose with the addition of core launchers its a lot less relevant as for the destroyer i imagine itd have even less offensive capability than an average destroyer  probably 45 turrets maybe a couple utility highs and an increase in mid slotsand maybe some low to compensate this would be intended more or less as a ceptor that trades a bunch of its speed for scanning and just uses a dd hull that woudnt take all that much grid and i dont know what exactly a frigate could fit even with a whole lot of cpu thatd be really scary remember itd have to be a better combat ship than an af or a ceptor to be even a little bit broken i dont see that happening
sorry a ship that fulfills the role of tackler and proberscout is not a specialist shipyou already can hold a target down with a covert ops you wont last long true but you shouldnt in a damn probing ship problem lies between keyboard and chair i love probingscouting for gangs no i dont get to wave my epeen by showing off my epic killboard statz but its a useful and fulfilling role in any good gangyou not wanting to probe does not not mean that theres a problemno its a buff to lazy players who cant be assed to get a covops
may i suggest a recon ship fit a probe launcher and you can probe and pvp brilliance granted most recons have the dps of a wet kitten but its the utility they bring not the dps that is important
and how is this not a specialized ship it should be designed to search people and hold them down for a limited amount of time with no capability of really killing the target with added bonuses specifically set to combat probes it is fully designed around searching and holdingi never stated that i dont want to probe i love probing its the main reason i have taken up exploration as a main profession with the new scanning mechanics i love it even more since i am actually doing something while scanning and not going afk for a minutealso whenever i scout for a gang i grab my trust cov ops why well so i can scan down people for a gang and i cant be arsed myself about killboard stats if it were up to me killmails would have been removed a long time agoso stop accusing me of false facts thank you very muchand how is that you still need this certain ship dont you the added benefit of it is that it can hold targets down for a limited time this ship would be an expansion to the cov ops line up also the increased size would mean it is more expensive than a cov ops risk vs reward rightalso if you have read my main post properly it states that it has to give up cloaking this removes one of the benefits of cov ops ships and in exchange it gains anotherwhat brilliance i am in awe probably didnt think about the fact that if you take up 220 cpu about 50 you will end up in a instantly destroyed ship because you had no space for the tank which is paper for most recons already
well its a party in the sense that an individual can only run twice for csm and after that its over i did not want my experience to be lost and thus used the network i had built from my terms on the csm to find a replacement candidate to pass on my knowledgewe all know how important continuity is and it was sad to see that the second csm had to learn everything from scratch to prevent this i will be personally travelling to berlin this weekend to inform erik and make sure hell be good to go right from the startits an open structure and not a party or clique as political parties are in the real world i personally dont think politics have any place on the csm after all were all supposed to serve the players
he gets my vote d
due all respect i suggest you do your homeworkwe already have had ccp commit to revamping the sov system diversitydiversitydiversitydiv wait thats what i have been saying all along what do you suggest is done then the csm is already working on looking into the loot gathered from missions we have also discussed the isk faucets and how they work what can you do to make a differenceplease dont take offense if my tone is harsh i think that you are qualified given your history however i think you might have missed a few things
okay i have not found much specific except for we are looking into it and will change it soon however most of eve wants this changed asap not next yearthis is like saying that ecm is balanced because it is so diverse compared to other ew this is like saying that the gankageddon was balanced because it was so diverse compared to other battleshipsthis is like saying that 12000 ms vagabonds was balanced because it was so diverse compared to other ships this is bal wait three out of four of the above is nerfed one is pending for one reward should be balanced to risk making insane amount of isk in high security is really unacceptable you want to make isk safely than it should take you more effort than mission farmingi am straightforward and allergic to bull good qualities to have when you want something done bad if you want to please the masses i can make a difference with just being myself with no lies or facets simple realistic and very straightforward either you like it or you dont
i doubt that it will be next year but i have no control over that not really because the problem you were all about was diversity again i beg to differ by using that argument you ignore the problem once again i get the feeling you got me entirely wrongi think everybody agrees with that but you dont exactly put any good solutions to the table even ccp knows that theres a problem so just saying that to them is a waste of timecome up with clever solutions it will serve you and everybody else much better
what exactly did you mean mate because to me it sounded like youre just sayingoh some things regions ships mechanics are worse than others for diversityand diversity  that sounds completely intentional so from what youre saying i extrapolate that you mean some things are intentionally unbalanced for diversity which is completely bonkers in my opinion and obviously also that of iceblock
the universe was generated using a simulator so everything we see is supposedly how the creation of an universe would take place in the real worldeverything is generated by random too moon resources etc is by random tooso because of the diversity of regions you do have unequal regions for instance kia settled into geminate because it has crap moons making it safer for them that makes space more interesting you have regions which are fought a lot for because they are worth a lot and some to a less degree i think thats fine because else space would be static and all the samein regards to ships i laughed a bit when you mentioned ships during my time on the csm people have tried to tell me that the pilgrim is awful and should be buffed it just so happens that i more or less fly a pilgrim only as of the last 6 months i think its the most awesome ship out thereits extremely subjective what is good and what is bad because of the diversity of bonuses and the options you have with it you naturally have ships which are worse than others on a subjective level you cant define whats good and whats not because it comes down to playstylethe exact same goes for the kia example they wanted a quiet region where people wouldnt try to take their space thats their playstyle they just wanted space where they could settle in and have a bit of fun for a large alliance who wants to become rich thats not desirable but that doesnt mean its bad spacetldr its extremely subjective you cant define whats good and what is bad
i dont really like what you stand for so you wont be getting my vote your just a clone of most alliance jerks who think they own eve i dont care for 00 space its full of alliance jerks if you have something positive to say about us carebears who like empire then maybe i will check out your campaign in more detail until then my vote goes some other place but good luck ing ccp off that on the other hand does get my vote
i am from the soon era sceptical to anything without a date the problem is that the diversity you speak of is not really diversity it is imbalancethat may be in my eyes there is nothing clever about it just make it so plain and simple change a few attributes and it is done whinage may commence after thisdiversity does not equal two rich and poor regions i want depth and meaning more than just this region is poor and people do not want it if a region is poor it should have other attractions besides people does not want ita car salesmen does not advertise a car with this car is slow and people do not want to steal it i would not be particularly interested even then i at least want an air conditioning and decent mpg else i would want the seller to show me something inbetween a lada and a mercedes slr surely there must be a good spacy car with good mpg if i sacrifice accelerationi guess one could call me a jerki dont care for high security space its full of carebear jerks mocking aside i have nothing against carebears they are a part of the game however i have much against total security and safe havens
at the risk of stating the obvious a car salesman is trying to get money off you by selling you a car ccp arent trying to sell a region to you thats not their job an alliance might want to rent out or sell space but then its desirability or lack of is that alliances problem having both good regions that everyone wants and poor undesirable regions is a good thing because it produces rivalries and competition if every 00 region was of more or less equal value there would be very little point in waging war with others to take their territory off them just to get more of the same and 00 would quickly stagnate into lots of compact isolationist empires quietly minding their own businessesthere already are a number of variables in the value of regions  some are good for ratting and mining some for r64 moons some with useful npc hubs some because of their proximity to empire or their strategic location or because their low mooncount makes them easily defended some for several of the above and a couple are terrible for everything  and thats a far better situation than having all regions balanced into uniform blandness thats not to say that new mechanics couldnt be added which introduced more variety random example off the top of my head planetary mining for tech 4 materials and that might have the sideeffect of making some previously undesirable territory more valuable but that should be a random side effect of introducing a new fun system not a calculated effort to make all the regions fair
i woke up all happy and twinkly id and what do i see thiz now i am all deprezzed
good delegate was pleasure working with michelle in csm 2 and i hope we will continue our work together in csm 3
it was a tough decision to run again knowing this would upset you stuff i think with some counciling and a keyboard with a healthy z key you can get through this largely intactissler
ok ill play but i dont do bake sales do i need to find my copy of roberts rules now i kid
so i should have a web page and forums up some time this weekendissler
everyone in foom is a fried althe gave all of us a cap ship to joinand we all get free lollipops on fridaysand he promised to paint our space ships with a hello kitty pattern when it was availableso learn to love us issler isnt that the kind of eve you are looking for
a balance of judgement member who fails to deny the deception and attempts to derail the situation with a stupid comments that dont address the issue at handso i think it is significant when someone that was high profile with all the good and bad that implies runs for the csm as an alt then denies it when someone calls them on it it goes the issue of trust i would have been happy to see freed run out in the open as a candidate he was the head of one of the biggest alliances and would have valuable insight he could add to the csminstead we see voting for happyfreed is voting for the sneaky liar spy failed assasin alliance backstabbing candidate since there are already crime and punishment candidates i expect happyfreed was late to the game to garner that segement of votersstill with his all his alts and his 150ish member alliance he might have enough votes to get a seat if the voter participation is lowso to potential voters ask yourself if you can believe anything this candidate tells youissler
i think you better check your sources again that post doesnt say who made it in fact i can assure you it was not made by fried besides if fried were running wed have spammed the living crap out of this thread by now with our supportive drivel and silliness its all part of being in the cult we dont get our scheduled beatings if we dont comply
i think readers can go to the link i provided and make up their own minds besides the csm rl identities are posted on the csm pages and it should be pretty easy to prove they are the both characters of the same person since freed was anything but shy about who he is in rlif someone wants to come forward and say who happy is an alt of if not freed since it is clear from the quote in the leaked forums happy is an alt of someone else maybe that would clear things up at any rate it is clear happy was not the primary of the person running for csm appears to be an alt of freed based on the leaked forums posts and this bit of sneakiness makes me wonder what is trying to be keep behind the curtainlooks to be a fun electionissler
so i went back and reread that leaked forums several times before i posted the link i think when you look the person that linked the posts made it pretty clear when the quoted person posting wasnt freed also anyone but freed saying the stuff in that post wouldnt make much sense coming from someone elseso again the voters can go to the link and read for themselves then decideissler
already seeking to discredit another candidate with spurious statements it certainly didnt take much time for this to happen again
well if you read it a few times and still feel the same way then you must be right of course you arent which is what makes it so funny its also kind of funny what you think is appropriate to be said by fried and people who arent fried within foom i think you are letting your own delusions cloud your judgmentin the end if happy wins you will ultimately be proven wrong when you see the csm profile you spoke of in the meantime thank you for displaying your brilliant powers of deduction out here in the open where the voters can see it
you should read the fixed link and then explain how it doesnt say what i say it says because it doesagain niskin statements with no references to support your positionissler
due all respect id argue that theres a difference between stating facts for the benefit of the public and then judging peopleits easy to see when either is the casein this case its obvious to see that the former is the case
every post by fried is attributed to him at the start of the quote the section in question is the only quote on that page not attributed to anyone the section in question was indirectly attributed to somebody other than fried simply by following a quote which was attributed to somebody elseyou said that they were pretty clear about attributing things that werent fried to the proper person but what you are missing is that they were even clearer about attributing things to fried only when they actually came from him so following the format of the thread anything not directly attributed to fried is actually not from himim trying to save you from yourself here but apparently thats a futile exercise there is even a clue in the paragraph itself which answers the question of who owns the happy character id give you the answer but honestly its much more fun to watch the train wreck that is your thought process
happy is not an alt of frieds frieds alts are rather easy to pick out even for issler when it comes to foom leaving bruce the corps left behind of whom i was a member at the time did not really have alot of issues with foom after bruce eventually folded alot of ppl went to foom welcomed with open arms there was no animosity what so ever
i stand corrected it looks to be that spacey cadet was at one time happys main sad really having freed with his cult behind him would have been more funissler
you are really funny to say there was no animosity is some of the best revisionist history in eve ever do you read the forums wowissler
not from my corp no
really i dont think this is the place for such things coad is that way 
can i get a rap to english translation pleasethank you
no need to translate hope and change is a universal language
certainly im opposed to that too what we love about eve is that its all one big universe
first off the people saying that t2 bpo owners make bpcs and sell them know nothing about t2 production or production in general so any opinion they may have on this is pointless second when your paying billions tens of billions for some for a single print i think you deserve to make a little better profit per run after all your one print can only produce a finite amount of productday and a single inventor can easily out pace you in profitday with inventionall the people crying out for t2 bpos to be deleted fall into one of the following categoriesa ignorant about how t2 production actually worksb wants what they perceive they cant have likely because of a
not sure if its an issue or whatever so going to slap this up here what happened to the corp shop i couldnt of been the only one that was actually looking forward to this new feature managing corp contracts is a nightmare that are beyond evil and is a poor substitute to an actual corp market so i guess my question is was this feature swept under the carpet along with other broken dreams and tears of the developers or is this still a work in progress
moved to  features  ideas discussion
groovy but no responces 
yeah why was this movedits a valid concern which belongs in the assembly hall or the jita speakers corner
well it seems this the corp storefront feature has been turned into an idea so i guess fi is an appropriate fit
seeing as ccp already has most of the code for it how can it then be just an idea
well if it wasnt an idea it would be a feature duh
im still waiting for system wide asteroid belts ffs take a number and get in line
corp store would not be in game until ambulationccp have always said it would be part of ambulation and not apocrphia
to this i rage at least have longer corp contracts in the interim i say again i rage look at me rage
if i remember right corp contracts where a corp member sends a contract to another corp member does not expire even after the expiry date passes it is still good
i am reasonably certain that is not the case as our corp shop mother tried the corp contract technique recently and emo raged after the 2 weeks were up and decided that technique was not valid it also wasnt the case in my last corp when i tried the contract system luckily i am but a peon in invicta and thus dont have to deal with the functionalities of such a system anymore but the corp shop made me more excited than the introduction of t3 by far and now i am a sad emo
the    needs to be looked at too it looks like a g in game
fixed and supported
yep needs to be changed

totally agree the old visuals made me go omfg capitals now im just like oh rightthose guys are here now
heh something must be done with mini bs even if only boost projectile ammo and still will be something how can a ship like typhoon847 slots to have more shield hp then armor hp how come even dominix have a greater loking range than the tempest maelstrom is the only bs than can compete with other races bs atm that need to change or minmatar will become an extint race lol
i support this
i agree just for lulz
definately
this would be awesome
i fully support the veldatar being moved to amarr the man has veldspar written on his flesh he deserves it
i approve
is this the thread where we ask for favouritism from ccp if so i as a member of the now homeless former gbc humbly request that ccp ban goonswarm from eve and give every member of the fgbc 10000000000 isk thankyou
and i as a member of a nonprick alliance would humbly request that ccp ban goonswarm and the former gbc so that we can all be rid of them trolling forums and necroing old threads
veldatar to amarr
i am zach hepp and i approve of this message
to be honest this is what the poss should have been like from the startwhilst i am happy the ccp implimented the starbases back in the day rather than holding it until something like this sugestion was possible we are now a long way down the line and given that pos mechanics are being looked at and there are the homesteads oh god i want these on the long term list can this all not just be rolled up togetheri guess the issue is how do you change something that is out there in such heavy useso how about a reboot of the pos system by implimenting the new ideas as a whole new system along with the changes to pos machanics and some candy so that the playerbase would naturaly move over from one to the other then retire the old system some time lateranyway just wanted to add my support to an idea that is fundemental win on so many levelscj
missile nerfing was a direct result of nanonerfing not suported
the devs really do need to take a second look at missile you have a weapon system that has too many negatives sig speed etc etc and the only positive is it always hits
losing half my damage to a bs going at base speed is getting very annoying i mean most things about missiles are fine but someone screwed up on the explosion velocity of the bigger varieties
the missile nerf was heavy handed and clumsily made to cater to whiners if not repeal it then alteast revise it
change the nerf it fails and just cuases missionrunners to earn less isk and destorys a whole combat system
failnerf fix it ffs
quick everyone make amarrminmatargallente alts
all these changes to these ships any word on the nag yet
as a naglfar pilot i would very much welcome any changes that fixes the flaws it hasit is a sweet looking ship shame it is lacking in comparison to the otherssigned
signed
supported i originally wanted a nag but its just not worth the effort as things stand learning another race as a result and thats just sad
yup they sucknot 100 sure the ops ideas are perfect but they are ideas at least supporting because minmatar caps do need some attentionoh and make the phoenix go vertical when it goes into siege 
deffo a good ideai think an expire day and time on the skills page would be good  under the birth date perhapsalso when you login and it loads up your ship in station or where ever a pop up message like the downtime alert might be a better way to alert someonegiving them 7 days warning of account expiry  something like it will expire in xxxx on xxxxxx at xxxx the same was as the dt message says you have 45mins until downtime if you login during that 1 hour period etc
nice idea simple clean solution no drawbacks sold
o
i have been screwed a few times times with gettng the ship back but no droped modules but i understand the ccp povwhen you drop those billions of isk mods into your ship you knew that if a bug got you you would not recieve reinbursement for themyou made the choice to equip as we all do i see no reason to change things
the fact that this thread has so few supports and so many replies proves to me that this is a whine thread with a little extra glitterdo not fly what you can not afford to lose that is supposed to be the cardinal rule in eve whether you lost your ship in a fair fight or somewhere in that fight your ship exploded it doesnt matter you should be able to recoup the loss they replaced the ops ship i dont know what all the fuss is about
i have no doubts that darknesss can afford to replace that ship 3 times overthe point is he shouldnt have to he lost it because of a bug no bad piloting or enemy fire
examplesolo roamer in a hurricane comes to our home space this morning he roams about a bit and we respond soon as he sees more than two in local he logs then uses the ctrl q repeatedly to get a postion with eyes on the gate we are camping with bubbles he logs againwe move to the other side of the gate and wait he logs back in he jumps he ctrl qs againpvp has gotten so lame i think even wow is looking good nowzos
supportedfor the ones who are scared of pvp in a game that is made for pvp just quit or grow a pair
see my signature for a way to gank the next ship that pulls that
the more i think about it the more i like the original idea if you are agroed then you die you do not warp away you do not collect 200 how is it even logical to think that pilot can log off and simply does not exist anymore to the players that are still logged in even entire fleetseve is not a compassionate game you die you lose everything so why should we allow this type of thing to happen just because people are scared to play the game
good call mate
i like the idea of showing some attention to the backgrounds
never been to a wormholei still support anyway i grow weary of the same designs
scan one down and pop in with a cloaking frigate its worth just seeing the moment you go through you feel like youre in another galaxythanks to the new backgrounds
mr sir substance  i totally aggree with you on thiswar dec mechanics needs to be changed it should be possible to say no to a war dec or maby it should not be possible to war dec corps with less than 10 membersthose of us enjoying manufacturing should have equal oppertunity to set up a pos if we want to  without having to engage in pvp not fun
possible solutions to the war dec fix effortstill a newb so bare with me if i mix things up1 cost  this should directly be related to the size of the alliance and increase the further along the wardec goes a scale based  100 members less than yours  400 cost near equal number  normal cost 100 members more  400 cost b length  each week add 102 get the military  a corp that has been wardec by another corp should be allowed to hire the local policemilitary within the systems they wish to operate this can be npc policemilitary or player corpsthis would work 2 fold the aggressor would be able to challenge any corp they wish but pay a penalty if the corps differ in size no small corps getting picked on by large corpsthe aggressed would be able to protect themselfs by paying the local policemilitary on a size basis paying premmium to an npc policemilitary would provide npc gate camps and station protection where if your cheap you may get onetwo npcs per gate the hired npcplayers would become red to wt and the wt would be red to the npcsthis would allow aggressed corps that may not care for pvp to still operate and it would allow aggressor corps to to still do what they like to doin short both corps have to pay to do what they want to do
ever since the new patch forcing the new shaders my trusty computer at work has slowed down to a crawl while dockedall i do is change skills look at the market etc and i find this is much faster out in space at a moon or planet zoomed all the way out i find it rather silly that while docked the interface slows down to a crawl and while in space its moving along at normal speedsi am requesting the readd of the option load station environment have it checked as default however if its not checked it simple loads a screen shot of the station and doesnt render anythingim in highsec so i dont have to worry about being ganked in a empty ship orbiting nothing out in space but i find it annoying that the one speedy station environment has been removed and replaced with something that deliberately slows down the interface
supporting my own thread
since after the first few weeks of gaming you never actually look at the station environment at all while fitting browsing market ect i fully support this i dont have station lag often but it happens sometimes
i personally dont have this problem but it doesnt mean others are in the same boat anything that makes the game less resource dependant when it doesnt need it should at the very least be an option
there much like anti aliasing used to be an option that did this that for some ridiculous reason was removed there used to be an option load station environment that if you unchecked it would render a single frame and display that statically as the backdropremoving anti aliasing was an even worse feature nerf
another option that would help would be disable space background seriously how often do you have to move the camera about to see ui elements because of the shiny nebula plastered everywhere
fully supported i couldnt care less about station backgrounds but i care quite a lot about how slow my computer is at the best of times with eve running
i install the game on comps at school when im at the university and the station background option is what let me run the game on any computer it needs to come back supported
yes pleasehell i would even like to see a toggle to disable the space enviroment i dont need to see all them non interactive static background graphics slowing down my machine
signmy machine is quite as a mouse in space running missions making pew pewin station the fans rev up and it sounds like its trying to take of
yeah this would be a nice readdition
how is that even relevant to my post plugging in an implant is not the same thing as transferring information directly to my brain for a long distance outside network the best comparison would be betwen cctv and wireless network camerascctvs require direct manualphysical access to the network such as directly injecting a skill into your brain or directly plugging an implant into your brain wireless networks only require anyone who can pick up the datastream and break into it between the originating data and the target data ie your brain and this global databank youre trying to get skills from making your brain susceptible to outsider intrusionthe pod network argument is also moot the cloning process only takes effect during a pod breach ie the moment of your death only then could the data be intercepted between it being sent from your failing pod to your medical station otherwise any sort of hacks into your brain would have to come from someome basically cracking into the neural network of your ship while youre controlling it but something physical like that again cctv reference would be noticed by you since theyd have to manually breach a physical part of the ship such as a node or other device
and what stops some malicious employee at the implant factory from adding code to the implant to wipe your brain or something you plug in the implant and splatfor that matter discussing your analogy of the cctv network those arent really that hard to disrupt either especially if you have a malicious helper on the inside you dont even need to disrupt the network  you can use the network against itself by looping video back to the monitorthe fact of the matter is no form of security is perfect but that doesnt stop people from using the internet to make purchases or do their banking and somehow with 20000 years to work on it im guessing theyve made them somewhat more secure you think
the issue is there are large sections of space that there isnt a school a couple jumps from you if all of eve consisted of highsec space then youd have a point but when you can be 2030 jumps away from the nearest school you shouldnt get instant access to new skillsthe rp reasoning can be quite simple the skill isnt just pure data but a physical object that one must insert into your brainpod computer or whatever just as any other physical object in eve you have to physically transport it skills being this way is this way for a reason transporting books to deep 00 is a money making opportunity and one that lives in deep space needs to plan accordingly and buy books ahead use jump clones putting you a full 24 out of commission or find some other way to get their skills or work on something else until they caneve isnt about conveniences its a hard game to play and that means physical travel if you hug empire your travel time is brief to the nearest school so its a mild inconvenience

agreed would be very useful being able to modify our order from the market detail screen would be extremely useful
its been asked before but why not put it forth againsupported
yup
yes i mentioned this a while back your orders should be highlighted blue
would be very useful thumbs upmost importantly it would prevent me from doing dumb things like beating my own offersdemands when i have more than one and am tired
this would be a lifesaver not sure what the technical side of it looks like and it seems like the type of thing ccp may deny us but i want this and i want to see a reasonable attempt made to get us thisedit this too
an obvious ui improvement especially with rightclick  modify added to ones own orders on the market details screen
if im not mistaken we already discussed this once or twiceand its not possible
ifiled that proposal years ago no result yetatm i need 2 screens open when doing market work changing the own orders in the market screen would reduce the load on the server 300 permanently open constantly updating wallets in jita are some loadsecond proposal make it so that the change order and cancel order buttons in the ordercontext menue are a little more separated i quite often hit the cancel order button accidently
i highly doubt its not possible might take a lot of work and be inconvienienti support it 
supported
gr8 idea also add choice of doing the same for buysell orders for corp alliance and people with highlow standings
would be much more useful than having to sort by price in order to do comparisons
genius
tbh i dont think this is the best idea ever its pretty obvious which buy and sell order is mine maybe because i like to work with numbers so i can easily identify my numbers
tbh i dont think this is the best idea ever its pretty obvious which buy and sell order is mine maybe because i like to work with numbers so i can easily identify my numbers
id one up that sorted by price you could have a drag and drop structure that allowed you to move your order higherlower by a penny isk than the one abovebelow itthis would be idealexamplebuy orders look like this320013200019057 mine19000180001000i drag mine to the top of the list the little modify orders prompt appears with the price of 3200101 already in the price line i confirm this is what i want by clicking ok or enter a different price if theres a mistakethis would be most powerful when reviewing orders of different ranges as you might decide to move your 5 jump order up to a point but maybe not up to competing directly with the motsu station order etc
well la vista vista is former csm and pretty good with coding so i dunnovista can you elaborate
would be nice
even if thats what you were told its a ludicrous claim and it should be reconsideredat worst from a serverimpact perspective the current market details window would have to additionally gather all the data that is currently selected for the orders window since active traders today have no choice but to work with both windows at present if they switched to one window pulling the same data this wouldnt actually add any data selectionand you can already see for yourself that the key to matching the data on the market details screen with the data on the orders screen is already being selected orderid is in both types of exported tables
its not safety im concerned about its speed this would be a tremendous multiplier in how fast things can be moved and thats not something i want more of
i haveand i couldnt give a toss about transport ships quite happy for them to be excluded or even the jump portal altogether i just want to be able to use blackops in empire wars
unsupportedi feel with no programming knowledge that adding in specific code to filter local based on not only shiptype but state of such shiptype might be even harder to add in than just making a better ui
lolyeah it is realy humanly possible to pay attention to local constantly and never leave it with your eyes even for a sec only bots will be able to do that just like now  huge advantage for macroers not good for ordinary rattersminersit wont realy increase the risk factor for roaming gangs do you think a small recon fleet would just wait for an enemy roaming gang to show up and watch one of their members killing the npcs sounds very boring to mewhat i think would be cloakers would be in most systems waiting for ganking lone ratters
nope  there hasnt been an arguement there has been a clear statement of intent from the game designers stating that this is how it is supposed to work and a bunch of whining from people who dont like it creating a new post doesnt change it and it doesnt make this thread any different than the previous threads on this topic and  not supported
ccp has stated before it should not draw aggrosalvage is just that salvage
technically if you want to get right down to it the wreck should belong to the same corporation as the pilot flying it when it blew up i mean if some drunk guy runs my car off the road he doesnt get my car even if i do die it goes to my next of kinso if you look at it from a certain point of view all salvagers are thievesdont you just loooove semantics
im kinda new to this game but isnt this what this forum is for i thought the idea was for people to raise issues of importance to them regardless of what might have been posted in the past or what ccps current policies arejust sayin
no the csm is a way for the playerbase society of eve to bring forth issues pertaining to ccpit is not the forum for whiny arrogant carebear pricks to whine and tell ccp what the rules for their own game should besalvage is for everyone this is how ccp deisgned it and intended it to be if you dont like it then go play hello kitty onlinebtw welcome to eveo always remember if you dont like it then you can gtfo
you know its funny how many insults fly around this issue being a carebear myself while im not fond of the fact that salvaging doesnt flag ppl i prefer not to rant on something thats relatively minor since ccp has stated that its by design i think ppl should be flagged because it would encourage pvp a stated intent of eve as a whole i guess ccp doesnt want to deal with ppl crying about getting ganked by the fleet a salvage thief may have waiting for the salvager to get aggressed and i think the ppl who get attitudes every time this is brought up are mostly ppl who wouldnt have such a fleet available if someone takes the time to scan down a mission im running solo more power to them they made an effort and its paying off if they scan down a mission that im running in fleet then its a race cause we usually have someone salvaging as we go i really dont see why ppl get so worked up about this issue time after time i dont really care which way it goes so for the moment ill just agree with ccp on this one sorry to my fellow carebears for not feeling this is worth supporting
working as designed and i see no reason it ought to be changed its less annoying than a whole lot of other game mechanics out there and with better reason and more effective possible countermeasures
no
no it is junk you want it so badly salvage it first
no
i think it should that way those salvagers actually have to fight for what they want yes it is junk but if there is a ship in the area you should have the option to engage them since when did adding more pvp to a pvp game become a bad thingif you notice its not the pveers who are against this its the thieves who are not willing to fight and just want easy isk i say make them fight for it just like looting a wreck salvaging should give agro
try not running your missions in highsecas to the proposal no
 this  just in case anyone misunderstood my first response
there are two counters to ninja salvagers1 get a friend to salvage for you2 kill the wrecks if someone appears in your missionno need to nerf ninja salvaging when there are easy counters to it thumbs down
ill support this only if at the same time they also addif im mining an asteroid in space and someone else comes along and starts mining it they become agro to me allowing me to attack them without concord interventionyou manager to get that passed and ill support agro from salvaging
interesting that so called ninja salvaging is allegedly intended by the developers yet i dont think theres actually a mechanic for scanning out wrecks other than scanning down the guy doing the mission i could be wrong
3 fly a ship with utility highsdominix raven marauder and salvage as you go
not supportedthis keeps coming up and keeps coming up and keeps coming up look salvage is meant as a miniprofession in order to generate the raw materials to create rigs lets think through what would happen if you introduce salvage aggro1 pirates will bait mission runners much the same way they bait miners and the next thing you know the same mission runners will be complaining about how pirates are baiting them and blowing them up and boohoo make it so only the wreck owner can salvage2 the risk associated with ninja salvaging will increase resulting in an increase to the value of salvage resulting in an increase in rig prices which you will all then complain aboutseriously get over it mission in a less crowded area salvage your own wrecks as you go i have seen plenty of mission runners do this and i generally leave them alone bring someone along to salvage for you there are 3 solutions to your problem that do not involve screwing up the entire salvagerig marketedited for clarity
i forgot counter 3 dangit
i run missions in high sec and i say no to aggro from salvaging the wrecks from other charsi like the way it is now so the salvaged parts go to who gets to them first
im not following are you saying that ninja salvagers will stop ninja salvaging if theres a chance they could get banged up in the mission and then youre saying that theres enough ninja salvagers that will actually stop the behavior that rig prices will sky rocket
iirc i read somewhere once that the eve online salvage system is based around the real world naval salvage in international waters the first person to get a chain around the wreck gets to claim it as salvagehowever if you do that to a military vessel you will most likely be shot
right but like you said do that to a military ship and youre likely going to have a tough time i think i get why you cant just scan down a wreck with a combat probeas theres probably a good chance that there could potentially be so profitable that everybody and there brother would be dong it although i dont understand that other thing where somehow associating risk with ninja salvaging will cause mass market hysteria
because additional risk means i have to compensate for that risk by increasing my prices right now salvage is cheap because there is essentially no risk associated with obtaining it if we implement a new aggro mechanic i am now risking my ship when i go out to salvage i have to have some way of offsetting that risk so i increase my prices to cover my potential lossesim not saying ninjas will stop im saying they will increase their prices
there already is riskthe only reason you think there is no risk is because you mission in highsec if you want to make more money anyway you will have to run missions in lowsecthis doesnt take much brain power to understand if you want to shoot at people  leave highsec if you want the safer but cheaper end of the verse you stay in highsecthis isnt an argument its a lack of understanding on your partedit also stop posting under your alt
thank you efrim this actually proves my point look at how much more expensive t2 rigs are this is because t2 salvage is extremely valuable due to the risk associated with obtaining it what you are suggesting will bring this risk to t1 salvage thereby increasing t1 rig prices
what youre pointing out about the rigs is true but to me this thread belies a deeper stupidity between the ops keyboard and chair high security space is high security space this thread smacks of a whine by someone who has never run missions in lowsec or 00
thread
agreed currently hisec missioning is way too safe this change would bring dozens  if not hundreds  of eager pirates into hisec each working full time to try and tempt missioners with juicy factionofficer fits into fighting this would add some much needed risk to balance the high rewards just as happens with minersmeanwhile the large increase in ninja salvaging would drop the price of rigs so that they are more affordable to the average player double win
rigs would get much more expensive90 of pvpers couldnt care less about salvagenot supported
yup
we all know shield tanking is quite limited in pvp cause the shield tanking modules share slots with important other onesnow buffer shield tanking sometimes somehow works but what about active one the introduction of rigs made active tanking a bit easier but armorshield buffer tanks are mostly superior especially when more pilots come into the fightthe idea is now introduce a weaker shield boost amp 10 t1 16 t2 as a low slot module additionally to the mid slot one we already have something similar the shield power relay and the shield recharger both improving shield recharge one more one less and i dont see why not doing some math you will realize that xlarge  16 low slot amp would be a bit below dual large armor rep setup performancewe dont actually need a new module you can modify the old one maybe instead of adding a low slot mod you could just modify the shield boost amp that you if you fit it in a low slots it gives 20 lessbest regardsediti dont think it is even when it comes to tankingyou get more ehp with armor buffer tanks more base resist and you have more slots for tanking in general on shield tanking ships if you are gonna active tank it you have 2 epic slots left for your tank if you are fitting your ship for serious pvp and not for comedy killmails adding a 16 t2 version low slot amp would actualy bring active shield tanking a bit below active armor tanking for pvpsome numberscommon pvp setup has 2 mid slots left for tanking using resist rigs invul xlarge booster and a imaginary 16 low slot amp you can tank shooop da woop 375dpsyou get 193 hpcap pointnow a 3 slot dual large amor rep tank with armor rigs tanks 400 dps and gives 2hpper cap point
btw i support my own idea 
i dont know about pilgrim but guristas faction ship bonuses are broken atm giving a turet bonus to a ship that dont have the powergreed to fit those turets that is incontestably broken
yeah the guristas ships are horrible split bonuses but no split weapon system and no pgcpu to support it anyway urgh the rattlesnake is just a raven with a few more hp and an extra lowslot pointlessgive it a proper 44 split weapon system and the fittings to fit torps and blasters then give it a decent 175 m3 drone bay and a drone bonus now thats a proper gallcal hybrid skillintensive yeah but worth it
i had this idea halfway through watching clear skiessay we have a new agent added to almost all stations called charter board speaking to this pseudoagent would bring up an interface similar to the market details subwindow it would contain a list of randomized npcs with level pay jumps cargo and time limit columnsiename  level  pay  jumps  cargo  time limitmr smith  0  12k  1  01m3  15 minutesright clicking on an entry will give only one option the only one this interface would ever need accept charter when that is clicked 50 of the pay is added to your wallet as a charter prepayment and two items appear in your hangar a placeholder for mr smith and a sealed cargo container mr smiths cargoincase youre thinking wait so its nearly exactly the same as a courier mission it isnt level 0 would basically just be something for new players short distance and no risk unless its not in highsec at level 1 some risk is introduced at each stargate you warp to after accepting the charter there is a chance that hostile npcs will spawn naturally level 1 would be nothing more than a couple of frigates but each one will warp scram and trigger a session change timer when you encounter thembut wont the gate guns concord faction npcs and other players take them outno these npcs will only be hostile to the person that accepted the charter and anyone else in fleet corp or alliance with them in effect you taking the charter made you a war target for these npcs and vice versanow obviously youd have a choice about how to handle the situation you can kill these npcs or you can tankkite them until the session timer runs out and you can jump they will use two point scrams so it wont be as easy as strapping a mwd on a quick frigate thoughthe emphasis for these npcs will be that they have no bounty drop no loot and only give scrap metal from salvaging so farming charters like you can missions wouldnt happen even at level 4 there will be no more than 3 npcs at level 3 and higher the ships they use will be identical to the ships available to players and fitted similarlywhen you arrive at the destination station the placeholder for the npc and their cargo will be automatically removed the charter postpayment will appear in your wallet also the other 50 of the pay it would cause next to no overhead to have a simple check run once when a player docks to do thisif playeridchartertrueif playeridlocationplayeridcharterdestinationset playeridcharter falseinsert however removing itemsadding isk to a wallet is done herethats a single call to check a boolean variable fun fact the average computer can do millions of these checks in a second upon docking if the player doesnt have a charter openi think i covered everything even need for speed compliance  let me know if theres any gaping holes my mouth doesnt countwalledit from a coding aspect a single dev could do the whole thing no content would need to be created for the game it could all be randomized and parented to the owner of the charter
i like this idea its kinda like a courier  kill mission but without the mission if these were available at every station i could imagine doing a bunch of these in a chain leading you on a journey this seems better than the whole grab mission do mission turn in mission repeat having to drop back to the mission hub creating congestion this would allow players to choose where they want to go next in the chain of charterssupported

thank you tesseract 
hi allive been playing eve for sometime now and the one thing that has frustrated me the most is the logging out in enermy space and in combatbasically id like to see a change here for if eve is to call itself a pvp game it must address this issuei propose any pilot in space lower than 05 that logs out oris disconected are ejected from their ship leaving it behind pod can then warp off and disappearthis would give a more realistic feel to the game more consequence for actionsif some is disconected in a bad spot say in combat well then at least the implants are safeif a pilot is in a capital at a pos then that ship will stay at the pos under its protectionps instead of players having to petition that someone has ninja logged id like to see this turned around the ship stays no matter what it is boarded or blowen up the kill is logged if there was a actually link dead then pitition is laid and ccp replaces it is not the killers fault you disconectedwent link deadpss force recons should be able to turn off cynos whenever they want
so when i rat in 00 i ofc have to be in a pos or docked you do know most corpsalliances with pos have a rule that ships have to be left at sma doing this would overload the smanot supporting
really what would the point to this be all it would do is cause frustation with players who cant get to a station or have to do someing irl and do not have the time to fly to a station and i do not see how this would be realistic in the least bit who would want to fly though eve in a pod no guns not much protection better to stay with the ship if you canthumbs down
no way not everyone plays the same way i fly with a nomadic crew we almost never end up in a system where we can dock so we log off in space the way others log off in stations were not avoiding combat were just logging out at the end of our flying time this is a completely imbalanced and not well thoughtout idea
please use your brain before posting ideas
because you know how eve cant call itself a pvp game until your little issue is addressed the way you want it
noi lose enough drones due to my flaky internet connection im not going to start losing ships because of it too
lol are you seriouswhat about at down time when everyone is forced to leave the game oh sorry you where not in a station docked up you lose your shipif this forum had a  i would never support this idea  option everyone thought out eve would check it
i think its a good idea as long as it only happens if you use the client option to log out ie escape quit or log offyou can still close the instance of eve from the operating system but that would be the only way to do it i dont see the difference in logging off while you are being attacked and logging off right before you are going to be attacked because think about it the only reason youre going to log in a situation like that is because you are going to lose cry some morethe only reason i can see why people would complain is because they are lazy or they dont really want 2 sided pvp ninja logging is very one sided to the person who only wants pvp on their own terms as far as rl issues preventing you from docking or getting safe thats your problem buy a cloaker or dont go into enemy territory if ya cant get back outi agree with op i support pvp
my strong disagreement with this idea has nothing at all to do with pvp some pilots roam all over the galaxy  this means sometimes being many many jumps from a place where we are able to dock what happens when we want to log out for the night what happens to ships who are exploring in wspace without a poseveryone just loses thier ships at the end of the day
so what youre saying is that in your opinion ctrlaltdel is a good gameplay mechanic if you make people log off via os theyll just do it that way  youre left with present mechanics and an obnoxiously bad ui this is a terrible idea
big no if i get disconnected from the game because of something my internet provider did i dont feel like paying for a new shipi got to say this is an idea that was not thought out very well
no its not a good idea it would be the only way to work around it ccp cant stop people from opening up task manager and stopping eve without installing a keylogger  which is illegal i however do not support ninja logging in any way even for explorers bottom line is eve has risks and if you dont like them then maybe its not for you regardless of your career choice within the game
to those complaining about my idea please do come up with something better or modify my idea to fit ninja logging is rife loging off alts in enermy territory is a common strategy by some alliances i have seen many times a hostile roaming fleet all log off to avoid capture rat ai does not have to inclued blowing up unoccupied ships and uncontroled dronesif you are disconected for a short time then once back in the game your pod warps back 1 au to your ship you board and carry on perhaps a 2 min invul peroid can initiated for all disconects either way your ship remainsif you like to roam and log off in space then those are the consequences perhaps you need to take an extra small pos with you perhaps small poss only take 5 mins to set upperhaps in space you can do a camp out procedure that takes 5 mins so that your ship will dissappear with your podninja logging is badps cloaking should negate power regen thus you can only cloak for as long as your power holds out
you log off in the safety and comfort of your pos or station on a daily basis i log off in the deep space of an unexplored system you stick close to home so you can always be back home in time for dinner and bed i roam for months at a time through hostile 00 and now wspace who is clinging to safety who is avoiding risk i fully agree that eve should never be nonrisky i completely agree that logging off to avoid combat is weak and if log off mechanics can be legitmately fixed to punish abusers of the logofski the fix should be implimented i dont agree at all with this proposal that would force us all to tuck our ships safely into a dock at night
anyone who has ever scouted knows this all too wellscout hey the enemies are speeding up i think they are aligningfc where are they aligning toscout i dunno i am 250km away and they have bubbles up i cant look and zoom in on themfc so you are telling me you are looking at the enemies but cant tell me where they are going because you cant look at them awesomesupport
yeah this has bothered me a lot too
grid size is quite a bit larger than that max locking distance is 250kmsetting max look range to the same as target range would be great trying to find online pos mods in a cluster from 100km is a massive pain especially how the incappedonline note is so helpfully offset from the actual mod 
100km limit is completely unnecessary and a pain in the ass
fixed that for you
alright im a man with many ships for example i have 2 drakes  1 for pvp and 1 for ratting now how about making it so you could add little notes to the ships without having anything to do with names and notes only you can see  that way i dont have to worry about the name of it or constantly entering the wrong one get my idea  it was just a quick idea maybe you have a better idea on how to add those notes etc etc
i dont know there is this feature called the notepad in evebut thats totally not what your talking about right ps it is no change necessaryisaacppss please dont post here unless you have an actual changesuggestion you would like to add to this forum
eveo thread
was not so forumsavvy at the time you first served but good lucki like your fix empire wardec standpoint
this thread has 3000 reads the most of any so and so for csm thread on the front page or secondi hope this is being noted by ccp
i thought that was obvious when i wrote my post arguing about the very same thingbut thanks for writing it out so that everybody understands it
just to be clear to somebody who knows nothing about sov which part of sov allows this pos grinding and what was the original intent for the mechanics that had this unwanted effect of pos grindingalso how would you remove this what would be the effect of removing this how are these effects good instead of bad and what mechanics should be introduced to offset any of the bad stuff
i think that iceblock means here that he wants uniqueness of each region diversity without some 00 regions seriously suckingin my opinion the same problem exists in empire
admiral iceblock campaign poster
lmao admiral iceblock the allamericannorwegian hero
pos grinding means one have to farm pos for sovreignity some systems have hundreds of moons ggmy ideas and discussion is located in the thread in my original postfor the rest shinnen described my intentions correctly i am foreign kid on the block
was going to write a attacking post but you are not worth the text so in shortfailedpvper runs for the pvp csmanyone who ever came in contact with these know what i meansigh
so what do the carebears you represent not have that you and your party think they should and why are these things important for eve to be more fun while being profitable as opposed to just simply making life easier in general note im not saying making life easier is bad just that its the fun and opportunities thats important and not the lowering of risk in general
carebears dont need anything specific mainly because they get everything that everybody else gets they just choose to avoid the many risks that are available in the game heck sometimes i go carebear for a month or so and putz around in empire with almost no risk the difference is that when something is on the line like a reinforced pos or an offensive operation i do my best to be there what is the point of making money and buying ships if they just sit in a hangar for a rainy day that never comesof course everybody is free to play how they want to but if people are going to avoid portions of the game then i dont think it gives them a well rounded opinion that is conducive to giving input on improvements i like the idea of political parties but i think a carebear party is going to be about as popular as well carebears
so it isnt always about not having something currently it is often about making sure what exists remains ccp is buried in the shouts of hundreds of different views of what eve should become this party seeks to make sure the voice of the carebear is clearly heard by ccp as they shape our futuresthanks for the questionissler
lots of folks like to think carebears wont fight if they are attacked i know that isnt true many of them can defend themselves they just choose not to be agressive towards other pilots in a combat sense now many of those same carebears will smack around other players in the markets without blinking which is a whole other discussion its funny you imply carebears arent popular maybe not among the vocal minority that posts here in the forums but carebears are the majority in eve something folks tend to ignoreissler
i really cant fathom why their is so much resistance to this idea from people who i assume wouldnt be part of the represented demographic anyhow
to which i would ask what is the point of making money and buying ships if its just a 1 to your hangar i can see stocking supplies for the random empire war dec situation but otherwise its just more stuff they spent time earning and have no use for weve discussed that before market pvp might provide some excitement and definitely is good for making cash but in the end it goes back to my first point what good is having 10b or 50b when the end result is the equivalent of being all dressed up with nowhere to goits possible they could be the majority but its also possible they are all in a coma from boredom and thats why they dont post here this thread has been particularly quiet after allso let me ask it directly why do carebears play this game anyway what are they getting out of it i mean if all i ever did was mine and mission id go crazy it would be the same if all i did was pvp its not about one or the other but that one supports the other i mine and mission to buy ships to pvp with then i lose them and repeat the process
niskinyou trolled the last thread issler was active in for quite some time and had all the room to ask as many philosophical questions as you wanted therei do not believe it is isslers role to explain her definition of the people who will support her whether a carebear describes themselves as industrialist high sec dweller or simply someone who refuses to pvp does not matterall that matters is there are those with whom isslers words resonate they may choose to vote for her as we know you shall notif you have a specific issue with something issler has pushed forth to ccp raise it by all means if she has done anything contradictory in her term to what she said she would do while running bring that up as well i see no reason for anyone to waste their time convincing someone who disagrees with them that one way or another is right
niskin you show clearly why there needs to be someone that is the voice of carebears in eve the fact you cant imagine how someone could enjoy eve in some manner other than how you enjoy makes my point lots of folks find life in eve wonderful doing all those things you cant appreciate so i want to make sure they get to continue enjoying what they enjoy and just as importantly that you get to continue to enjoy what it is you enjoythanks for the civil discussion of important questions hopefully others will take the time to offer opinions or pose questions about points already madeissler
because their ideas are more likely to prevail if they can suppress another demographic which is likely to oppose them
because at some point isslar said something about suppressing those who oppose them
uhm no i have never suggested suppressing anyones voice i think what max is trying to say is the folks that would not be represented by the voice of reason party are commenting negatively about the idea of a party as an attempt to suppress the voice of the members of the partyissler
ok ill rephrase then what are the things that you are afraid people will try to take away from youall im saying is that i cant possibly understand how somebody who just ice mines all the time doesnt go mad with boredom not that im saying you do or anything thats just an example ive continuously stated that i dont have a problem with said ice miner doing so to hisher hearts contentim simply asking you to explain what you plan to accomplish with this party more specifically than to protect the carebears
qftissler please go back to your own campaign thread this should be about csm elections not something that happened over a year ago and the only people who are even vocal about it any longer are the leaches we gladly left behindget a grip take your meds stop taking crack or whatever your issue is pleasei want to hear about the issues in this election not your delusions
technically happy made his sneak in to our alliance as a spy and try to assasinate me in the pvp tourny fail recently planning with freed so i think any issue i might have with happy could be described as recent events seems to me it is the ghosts of bruce that seemingly couldnt leave things in the pastif happy actually has a position to run on he could certainly be taking some time to post more about it as i said my direct experience with happy makes me think he would be part of the folks from the crime and punishment parts of eve there are already several better imho  candidates representing that portion of eve i nm certainly within my rights to comment on what i believe are issues of character in the context of any campaign thread issler
issler has lost my vote
ya well she just doesnt get itglad to see that your eyes have been opened hope more folks get the same oppurtunity
issler dainze bringing stoopid to eve since foreverhappy gets my voteissler was much more of a spy from what i remember of bruce backstabbing was also quite common from her bad feedback seller does not do as it says on the tin avoid at all costs vovgo happy o
oh noos more people not voting for me that never would have voted for me anywaysme a spy what a crack up id love you to provide any support for that statement i think you are getting that backwards since bruce puts spies in my corp not the other way around freed philisteen put the p in paranoidissler
heh well it seems this unknown alt of a known player has his followers stillbut to get back on topic can you write a little more about your csm plansthe main post is a bit vagueoh and stop with your attacks on issler she did good her csm2 period
what are your specialities
sorry i lost my decoder ring
aight dawg ask a dawg question here gonan make mad viode respons on 3 top question an dawgs will kno a dawg for real dig rere posse reel deel be safe
could i get some clarification on what you mean by opportunities in some contextill give an exampleit is lowsec there is one miner one hauler and a generic combat ship at a belt they take precautions against being found there are two or three small gangs of pirates all independent in the constellation looking for a fight all ships are out to gain profit for the smallest amounts of loss1 do you believe that it should be easier to get into a fight than to stay out of a fight2 do you believe that since there are more pirates than miners in this hypothetical situation that the game mecahnics should allow a greater chance for them to fight each other3 once in a fight do you believe that warping away should be possiblediffucult given necessary precautions are taken should there be ways around these precautions should there be actions that can be taken as a precaution against these ways4 do you believe that once somebody has escaped from a fight that it should be easier to find them again compared to the amount of effort needed to find them the first time5 say two of the pirate gangs found each other how should they react and how should the game mechanics be changed to facilitate this6 same as 5 except pirates vs miners7 same as 5 except pirates vs pirates vs miners if there are more ships such as if there are two groups in a battle should it be easier to find themedit one final thing i realised i was trying to get ask this one thing with my above questions what are the ideal probabilities for the game mechanics used to find a fight
get action on ccps promise to provide opportunities for solo and small group pvp opportunities for them to fight it out with each other instead of getting swamped by giant blob fleetsyes can you elaborate on thisdo you mean like a wow battleground deali kind of like it as it is there should always be a bigger fishlone frig jumped by small fleet jumped by bigger fleet gets mothershipdropped pif you could get ccp to raise the lure of lowsec to get more targerr players there iUFFFDd vote for ya
lol yes
anyone ever consider the idea of fonts based on race sounds neat
free minmatars lol mini bs and caps need some love its been some time now since versatility has become sinonim with faill today eve is based on ships with specific rolles and mini faill to deliveroh but yea they are versatile
supported even though i think ccp are too busy making stupid features like combat simulator wtf and ambulation
it might not equate to removing or replacing the current pos  but id still fully support ccp introducing a modular station systemc
heh next time when most of you ppl ask for a nerf remember this missile are fine like they are now no need that raven to become a solopawnmobile or how it was vaga called not suported
and how again would you accomplis that with the old missiles the torps are the only thing making a raven usefull in pvp right now 
a nice simple answer to the annoying problem that i suspect we have all dealt with from time to time bravo
well this proposal has just entered the realm of silliness by becoming something that it wasntscanning might have some problems but it worksroaming is a fast job no time for complex probe work unless one scout in the gang likes to do it and does it fastnow the ratters and miners and wanderers have a huge advantage over the rest that is they are not in warpso you have to use the directional scanner pray for the tackling ship not to be a covopsrecon that you will not see comingthis local change might make you have to be always rattingminingwhatever in a mixed gang of scoutspvpersfarmers no lolfits allowed and basically make survival a question of teamwork much more than it was beforesoloing will be for the brave a strong hearted individualsit opens up a new awesome amount of possibilities for having fun socializing with your corpiesallys be it you are the pray or the hunter and i sincerely cant see the problem with thatplease leave the scanning whines and problemsideas to threads where that may belong this is for supporting the removal of localin the end people just forgets about local and carries on what what they are doing i know that because ive been in wspace a few times
removing local just to replace him with somthing much more complicatedthx but no thxthis will just result in most of the ppls moving alts to mission runing in already crowded empire hubsnothing elsethere is a word if somthing works fine fix it or not
yeah and he got it back from ccp so why are we on page 45 of this whinefest
lots people people not reading posts properly and adding their own takecrapagendatrolling per usual it really comes down to this if the pilot is reimbursed because of a hickupbugwhatever ccp deemed to be reimbursable that means the player lost the ship to an issue he had no control over that means the player should get the whole ship back not just the empty casco that would be the same as the insurance company replacing your car but leaving out the engine as that had bits stolen from by bystanders when the crash happenedi do understand the possible exploitation of this and the fact that giving back modules without removing them from the new owners inject goodsisk into the economy but this is not the concern of the petitioner he lost a ship which ccp deemed to be replaced so he should get the whole shipany aftermath is ccps problem not the petitioners
issue was raised by csm and voted for
signed and championed at the next csm meeting not the one in less than 48 hours but a future one

dont need it dont use it but its a valid request and theres no reason to had it removed in the first place
dont really consider skill books as book but a very precisely programmed set of nanobots that write the skill into your brain the book represents the controllercpu of said nanos i would not want them controlled by remote control as then my brain would be at the mercy of interference in the transmission a corrupted transmission in say heavy missiles might mean that id be in combat and suddenly wondering why my own missiles are hitting me the corrupted skill means that at the critical juncture of setting the target for the missiles i punch in a bunch of garbage commands tht in that particular fight i targetted myself that example is a bit convoluted but you get the idea modules failing every time you use them reactor explosions the whats this button do accidental self destruct if your ship skill is corrupted
if skills are removed as physical transportable items that are sold on the market system then theres several effectseg in gallente space the school stations do not sell many of the missile skillsif you want those skills you either have to buy from a player that transported them or travel to regions that sell themthis creates player choices and opportunities spend money to save time or spend time to save money as well as the opportunities to buy and sell for profitif the skills are moved off the market system so as to be available from anywhere then that removes that decision from the players  skills will always be available at base npc prices there is no choice between money or timeif skills that you need are not available where you are then you have to ask why your corporation does not have a system in place for this sort of eventuality theres a personnel manager role for corps it should be their responsibility to ensure that the corps players can develop their skills as best they can
making things easier  making things better not supported
this is actually something i was unaware of i had always thought the npc stations were all more or less the same with a few minor exceptions it never occurred to me that there were entire regions where these skills werent seeded as a matter of coursethat does change my perceptions slightlyill have to give that some more thoughtas for the youre making it too easy argument people keep espousing that really isnt swaying anyone making things harder doesnt always make them better either you know frankly what i am aiming for is an immersive game experience and paperbacks in the 200th century seem to be very out of place to me
because having your brain coupled to a public network would garenteed that you would get hacked and your brain properly destroyid and the data stolenso thats why you need to take it in its fysical form and set it in in a closed network where no one would be able to get acces too thereby you would need to get it in the hand to insure that the package where not sniffedalthered or in any other way messed with before inserting it to your brain data
nothing but every implant is trippelbillion tjekket to insure it is perfect since you are selling it to the most importent people in the universe and ing this up because you didnt recheck everything is not something that would happenbut sending it over any kind of public network and you would have no garenteed some one didnt mess with it loled dude how would you even bring the network to 00 it is lawless space nothing from npc empire comes out there not even the law so start praying for a school from the empire to give its services to you

i posted the following in the suggestions thread and im getting good support and it was suggested that i put my idea to the csmsthread link linkage
thumbs up
im for this it sounds good and flavourful one caveat i have though  make sure that theyre all in a single overview group so that people who dont care can remove the lot of from their overview them trivially other than that go for it

in response to an earlier post about cynos and blobing and limiting a cyno to a certain amount of caps entering local this is what i thinklink to previous post 
worst ideas evercry more
in addition to this corps that dont want their assets attacked can declare themselves as industrial class corpsalliances and no matter where they live low sec 00 etc you cannot war dec them or attack anything they own this seems to go hand in hand with your idea quite nicelysarcasmon a more serious note this is just another whine thread about capital blobs high sec corpsalliances have no protection against lowsec deccing corpsalliances and low security should have no protection from the 00 entitys otherwise youre just gonna  off kenny whose original aspirations were to control the entire eve galaxy 00 low and high via wardecs and system lockdowns it is not a broken mechanic and its just a matter of blobbers getting hit by an even bigger blob of ships
for a person who claims to have no relation to the involved parties you sure know a whole lot about the history and what is going on obv troll and if you want to continue to  about it dont hide behind your alt
dear jim  id like to be able to gank carebears without fear of repercussions can you fix cynos so only 10 capitals can jump in because thats all we have left can you fix it for me love devilofthehell
this is in no way shape or form a whine but a simple response to a previous post furthermore nham looking at kill boards didnt you get your self spanked by nex a few weeks ago and used to be in nex no wonder your response is btchysecond you cannot compare this to high sec as in high sec capitals are not allowed plus if you choose to live in low sec some danger needs to be there hence why its low sec as for war declarations you can simply surrender to end all forms of fighting which means no more danger in high sec for people wishhinf not to fight
have you looked at kill boards posts and other sources its all very easy to accesshowever i will admit i am in favour of nex in this post as they live in low sec and a victim of what i am describing
so your just taking a special interest in this then ehyour not making a strong case for yourselflike i said beforepost with your main
in other wordsits perfectly acceptable for a bully to push the little guy around but its not fair for that bully to get his butt handed to him by someone biggerwe are an industrial corp  we do not harass our neighbors but we will defend ourselves call me whatever names you want but your statement boils down to this  you can dish it out but you cant take it you dont seem to have a problem calling in all your pals to constantly harass us so why is it wrong for us to call in friendspardon me if i dont believe your statement about no relation to the parties above and your simply getting this info from the killboards i on the other hand was there and i saw all the pilot bailouts from the mighty warriors of the hun attacking fleet when pl jumped in and showed them what time of day it was they did not even try to fight back they simply started self destructing so we were outwitted huh
heh no personally i didnt ive never lost a single ship to nex and its hard to fight them in a war when a majority of them wont undock in their home systems when its 9v2as for your comment about capitals in high sec its irrelevant because the only point of this post is huge alliance shouldnt be able to pick on medium alliance but medium alliance should be allowed to pick on small alliance that is the end result of your suggestionsyou also forget to factor in coalition forces most of omega wasis part of the gbc and therefore because of their affiliations shouldnt be allowed to use siege either you cant put a limit on a group of players just to force them to do it with alts or petsand your surrender option doesnt work unless the war declarer accepts the surrender its a two way street
before help yes secondly have yu people never researched anything no the bigger can still bully the medium as can the medium still bully the small but not in the outragous way as the 00 elite are doing its called balancing game play
you could always retain a little dignity here and just accept that noone realy cares enough about youre losses to unbalance the game in such a way quit with the whine threads itll never happen think this thread is goin off topic now maybe time it was locked
just as a statement from me personallythe wardec against vva was a retaliation against them destroying an offline pos tower which was bugged and unanchorable wed tried to unanchor it several weeks before the tower was subsequently reimbursed the wardec went well we suffered one loss an afk guy whod been ill and fell asleep at his compnexs engagements against ie are not random there is a goalinvolving a particular moon the drop by pl was no less than expected wed seen them in abath with approx 20 caps prior to the engagement we knew they were in the area and all capital pilots knew the risks before deploying my dread itself was insured when i undocked it just 40mins beforewe made the decision to deploy i made the decision on behalf of my pilots after and i quote if we are going to do this then well commit to it if you wanna get things done then go the whole hog we knew what was coming as we saw them 3 jumps away but tried to go down fighting primarying one of the enemy naglfars i was primaried first overloaded hardeners and shield booster my shield was stable as the first dread started shooting i popped less than 10 seconds afteri can confirm that the alt sugar rush is not an alt of nex eternus youll have to take my word on thatid also like to clarify i have no personal issue with nnamuachs or his corporation while his corp differs greatly from my own hes a good guy that just has different ways of achieving his goals to the way me and my corporation dochanges are needed to the way capitals are deployed the thread came at a bad time for us publically as it does make it look like a whine nonetheless changes are needed as yet however i have no answer as to how it should be doneplease let that be the end of discussion on my alliances activities and politics i have no wish to keep writing sermons for atheistsedit  bd concerning the self destructs the self destructs were to deny them kills youll find that we were shooting back in cap fights when its 70 vs 15 you dont have much of a chance we did all we couldregardsrx
it was raised on csm 20 meeting on iceland you can read it in meeting minutesthere were lot of ideas floating around but sadly not solid solution tho ccp showed desire to solve this issue
system doesnt need to be fixed mechanics are ingame already for fixing this issueand on top of all that the only excuse for reserving a moon in highsec really is only a lack of moons theres no reason you need to reserve a moon in hopes of being able to mine it in the future as its basically certain they will never let us minelol whatwar is like 2mil you retract soon as the objective has been completed easy youre suiciding cans in highsec lolz
if youre right on the doorstep of your supplier sure try living in paragon soul or omist and importing a months supply of pos fuel for 100 or more towers or the amount of lowend minerals needed to keep supercap production running and then see if you agree that logistics is too easy and needs nerfingi remember freighter escort ops between detorid and empire 40 or so jumps each way in the days before jump bridges and fun isnt exactly the word id use escort duty is rarely exciting because by its very nature youre moving something youre not willing to lose and so either you have a big enough escort to scare away wouldbe gankers or the hostile gang is too big to safely get past and so you ctrlq your valuable freighters until they leave
yeah  thats why its called highsecurity spacehigh  security spaceseriously the rewards arent as high as lowsec and 00 no balancing neededdouble fail if ninja salvaging acquired aggro  that would put the salvagers in danger as well ie they would be less inclined to ninja salvage what crack pipe have you been smoking
no
correct me if im mistaken but the game of salvaging is a game of chance what loot lies in the holds of the wrecks is actually there i dont think the same can be said about the notyet salvaged materials from ravaged remains of ones enemies if something doesnt certainly exist how can you say that it has been stolen
this discussion can go round and round and round with the lot of you whiners but anyone who understands eves game design has to admit that wrecks need to cause aggro if salvaged by someone other than who created the wreck both missioneers and carebear pirates dont want this both sides but that is how this game was designed high sec is supposed to be secure allowing pve players a place to enjoy the game without harassment low sec and nullsec is where the pirates are supposed to hide salvaging has bridged the gap allowing carebear pirates to harass players without consequence this must stop this game was designed to allow for consequences so ccp saying this is intended is a contradictionwe already have enough troubles with carebear pirates can trapping newbs in high sec space do we really want to do everything we can to scare off new players obviously those of you that like to make me people mad wont care but quit being a bunch of richards and think about eve not your epeen
everyone who understands eves game design except apparently the designers of eve you mean
lets take a poll of all of the employees at ccp shall we instead of the one dude sitting behind a desk that puts checkmarks in boxes
dont like this idea
is this about salvaging npc wrecksor player wreckscos if its only about player wrecks then thats a lot more interesting a proposal
it was a dark day in ccps history  the day they left harrold the boxchecker dude in charge of the salvage design all of the employees of ccp wanted salvaging to work just like looting cans but harrold had other ideas he secretly plotted in the dank celler of the ccp offices to thwart the grand design and one day he got his chance while the rest of the staff took a lunch break he acted he checked the box oh how the other employees rued the day they decided to go out for pizza though ccp has now instigated a rule that no more than half of the staff may leave for lunch at any one time and despite several highlevel developer meetings the damage cannot be undone the design team is at a total loss no one can figure out how to uncheck the box
never had a real job have you people do disagree with corporate policy that is often decided by one or maybe a handful of people ive already stated why this policy contradicts previous ideas presented by ccp in the form of eve content its ok for them to be wrong
you might just be the single most pompous ass ive ever seen on the eve forums  and thats not an easy feat plenty of people myself included have accused ccp of variously being lazy not understanding how normal people play the game or just generally screwing the pooch i dont think ive ever seen any who insisted that they knew the games design principles better than the people who actually designed the game before though it takes a special kind of ego to make claims like that
you do realise how overpowered shield tanks would become in both pvp and pve rightbut i am all for this new module a module for shield that is in low slots and one for armour that is in the medslots and 1015  decrease in shield and armour booster durationthis would make you have a effective higher dmg socked but at the same time keep the balance since your cap would die 1015  faster which would in effect have a upside and a downsidealthough i think for this too stil not be too overpowered it would also need to decrease the maximum amount of cap by 5  75 since looking on some ship and with cap injectors they would be able to tank 3k dps for around 10min  which would be a insane amount of dmg sockedthis stil doesnt solve the problem in fleet though since even if you could tank 5k dps in a fleet where you are alphered and killed by 1 hit kill it wouldnt matter and it would properly quickly become too overpowered in small gang warfare
no shield tanks are already too strong more effective than armor tanks by a long shot no supportisaac
they already have modules that decrease cycle time on reppers  nanobot accelerator and core defence operational solidifier rigs theres no need to add another offslot one besides active shield tanks work way better than active armor tanks asis trying to improve them more is unnecessary
what are you smoking 3kdps tank for 10minutes show me a pvp tank with webdisruptorcap booster shield booster hardeners and a low slot 16 amp t2 fit that can tank 3k dps for 10 minutes on a sub capital ship also to alpha a buffer tanked bs you would need more than 150 bs and you realize that there are also smaller gang fights have you actually read the title can you tell me how it would make active shield tanking more effective with a low slot module that does not stack with its 36 counterpart and can you show me your super duper active tank setup that has all its mandatory slots for pvp and still is effective oh wait you cant 
active shield tanking in pvp is very strong albeit expensive to do properly crystalsyou get a stonger tank at the expense of not having midslots for other things seems perfectly balanced to me thereforenot supportededit typos
cosmic the problem here is that youre assuming that everybody has to fit a solo pvp setup youre right if you solo there arent a lot of ships that can fit an active shield tank effectively if youre in a gang that has tacklers however you dont need tackle gear on your battleships and can fit a pretty good shield tank  724 on a mael or 720 on a rokh both of which have a mwd and large cap booster fit that increases to 1091 and 1076 if you fly with a full crystal set which means that youre fully tanking a decent gank battleship and thats a fourslot tank  if you drop the mwd and add a third invuln you add another 150ish tank or 220ish with crystals if you start adding shield rigs it gets even sillier  a mael can tank 2112 dps for over two minutes if you fly with full crystal and take off the mwd admittedly thats a hyperfocused setup and unlikely to be good in actual pvp but its something that is simply impossible for armor tanks  a hyperion can only hit 1103 dps tanked with a full 6slot tank and rigs compared to 1392 for a maelstrom armor does buffer tanks and tackle better shield does active tanks and damage mods better that seems like its balanced just fine to me
pretty much what he saidisaac
should limit the cynos max 10 capital can passing trough cynofield in lowsec to prevent blobbing
lawl 810props i didnt even think of this one firstinstead cynos in low sec should be jumpable by anyone so what might be only 15 capships jumping 50 might lock on and jump inlow sec needs way more capships get rid of these annoying cynoship poppers today i traded a cynoheron for an arby it is just so silly
seals never die
heh devil are you posting this because of that pl fleet that hotdropped you guys yesterday
to quote devilofthehell bring a bigger blob seems what you are realy saying is that you think you should be the only ones who are allowed to blob vs carebears might i add  and often with capital faildrops double standards are not an endeering character trait mind you neither is the disgusting way you talk in local youre smacktalk and whining is like a lamp to a moth ps most gratefull to all the guys who took it upon themselves to help a peacefull aliance you made me lol so hard my face aches helping the little guy  mucho khudos
i got a better ideemaking the station centry just so smart like the sleeper drones so they attack drones and fighters firstit would contrebute in gameply and reduce the lamenes of camping low sec stations using a carrier or mothership
thisand boost the sentry guns dps to around 1500 dps per gun 6 guns 9k dps all in all making them focus fire if tanked more then 15 secunds
just shut up carebear go back to hisec
meh i think its reasonable but i dont reckon having cynos lockable by anyone is a good idea just dosent work and only stupid people would jump thru them anywayalso nnam why wardec a 00 alliannce  sorry couldnt resist
careful what games you want to play why wardec nex edit also lock this thread its a whine thread thats already getting derailed lol
just shut up carebear go back to hisecgot only this to say about it piocasi live in a democratie en that says that there is one absolute and unconditional freedom of speechand why is it if i check your char ingame the your in a npc corp even your poseble alt
ok so basically if you selfdestruct your ship it makes it so u drop nothing all modules and stuff dies coolkillmails on the otherhand should be accessible everyone who dealt damage to the nyx should get the killmail or even have the killmail available via apihaving no killmail isnt good
so this should only apply to the nyx and no other ships interesting ideaanyways no self destruct deprives the killers of their most valued prize the killmail
pretty much what he said there is no reason to change current mechanicisaac
we discussed this with ccp and while i argued in favor of granting killmails the general consensus was that it was working as intended and that no changes to the game mechanics should happen just for epeen reasons
it really isnt that big a change tbh why should there be killmails at all if theres no real consistencyalso in 1st post i didnt mean just nyx
if we want it to be consitent then the pilot who dies and the pilot who got final blow should be the only ones to get the km in this case that would be the same guy i agree with this idea just to hear people having to go cap in hand to the guy they just failed to kill in time for the km
well since selfdestruction is a deliberate attempt to rob the enemy of intel and the spoils of war and a valid tactic i might add i feel the killmail would go against this the killmail is often used as an intel tool to determine a pilots fitting habits self destruct should prevent this intel and as such is working as it should now if they did hand out killmails without the destroyeddropped section i guess i can see it but seems a big change for not a whole lot of gain
this
as discussed elsewhere in the forums a significant portion of users are unhappy with the current ingame font as several characters are quite indistinguishable from each other so a simple option in the game settings to change the font to something better would be really great feature and shouldnt take too long to implement and test
theres a thread on the front page called the eve font please dont make duplicate threads
while the balance team would have to look at this under a microscope i see no reason why it couldnt exist the variation in missions would be a welcome change and running couriers in combat fitted ships would be a great concept supported and championed
sounds good ill have a closer look and some further thoughs on this later
hi guys thanks for the support i will be updating my blog with my thoughts on the upcoming changes etc and my plans shortly
please enjoy this image as a break from politicsmiss jessica alba

any questionscomments regarding my candidacy
this is why this game is being run by carebears and npcers all the guys like gamorah do not have the will to set aside ancient i have the longest competitions even when its about tryin to talk about making a more enjoyable game i wont even go in debating ingame who has the longest here as i am focused only on discussing creative comments on improvements on gameplay and mechanicsso please gamorah if you have something useful to say id be happy to talk about it
lol ruri
hi
fair question niskin so the party would in theory provide continuity in csm representation over time as the specific goals of the party think about ccp development as a big piece of pie we all like pie the party will try and make sure that the constituency of the party continues to get a reasonable piece of the feature pieas to the not going crazy thing carebears have lots of things to keep them busy and happy mining building trade exploration missions pos management ratting role playing being stuck in jita ok not a good thing running corporations the list goes on my favorite is bantam ballissler
in eve war is three dimensional not just 1someone can carebear hardcore for months and then use the proceeds to hire mercs to grief your corppeople who are too stupid to understand concepts like the pen is mightier than the sword really dont belong in eve imo they belong in some jacka game like wow where only buttonmashing matterseve is hyped as some kind of intellectual shangrila but there are so many low iq mouthbreathers here who dont understand the first thing about the relationship between war business and industryto me being gordon gekko is cool in rl i am fascinated by economics i love business i love small business i love big business i love ipos and i love watching jim kramer on cnbccan i get a booya jimmy favorite developer is dr eyjo and my fondest wish is for some kind of stock marketi know some informal stock markets exist but i want a real ingame one maybe some kind of commodity trading where the price of commodities changes every dt like maybe some planet had a drought and they need water so the price of water goes up stuff like thati wanna be like the main character in lord of war where theres 18000 people fighting over a region and im the guy selling them ammoor maybe the marketing guy that does the recruiting posters like uncle sam needs you enlist today sending fresh meat into delve at 10 mil isk per headand having the guy i sent over buy ammo from me and using the proceeds to buy more stock and using the dividends to hire mercs to grief people i dont likeyou call that boring i call that the ultimate gaming experience
i like how you think cipher7issler
i found this to be vague could you elaborate more i have some questions that might help you fill in the gaps for the rest of us on where you standwhat perspective will you bring from what i can tell you have an industry alt and a pvp main i presume you would be biased for the later your main being the character you play with most being pvp speccan you elaborate on freedom to play the game in as many ways as possible does this include carebears despite lack of a better word for a casual playercan you tell us you wont have a bias against other professions in the gamethe average character age in eve is about 6 months that said how fresh is your perspective and why should we choose someone with less than 2 years experience versus someone with 3 or morewhich initiatives by ccp would you follow up with as i understand it not everything can be done at once things need to be prioritized want to give us a list of important things several csm candidates have a webpage to assist in communicating their ideas perhaps this would be a worthy project
i am running for round 3 of csm and will be glad to be interviewed
this could be a very nice feature eg you will probably use way different window configurations for just chatting highsec market operations mining in low sec pvp and here very different for interceptors drone ships or say ecm vessels having these at the click of a button would save some hassle with the uicould be quite tricky to implement eg you have a policy issue on how this works  what is done to all the windows that are open when the settings are recorded and to all of the windows when a setting is selected initially id think they could be sort of an archetype  you record the settings as a minimal configuration  close all the windows you dont want to touch and it records everything you have open at the moment when you activate this recorded setting it will make sure that you have all those windows open with the recorded tabs positions and sizes  leaving the rest you might have open as they areperhaps this should be copied to one of the ideas forums

i have lowgrades and no omega which costs all of 250m if you want to fly a buffer tank then fly a ship that is built for one dont go and try to change one of the few great active tanking ships and ruin the game for those of us who enjoy flying themhere are the changes i would like to see for mini bs1 increase base emp and phased plasma damage to hybridlaser equivalents and also nerf the longrange projectile ammo accordingly2 change maelstrom bonus from rof to damage3 increase damage mod on all large projectile weapons by 7 dps stays the same on the mael but the phoon and tempest a little bit 4 change tempest to an 847 slot layout 5 change phoon to 856 layout or maybe 865 and change turret and missile hardpoints to 5 each a small shield buffer and massive gank would make this ship interesting to fly imo 6 remove optimal range penalty on hail and remove tracking penalty on all t2 shortrange turretshortrange ammo

i already posted some responses in support of the idea but i want to add some examples of how local is bad from the last few days  hostile roam comes to defended space their scout sees our defense gang enter local 1 jump away and they all log  hostile fleet is hitting a tower we and our allies form up and when we are one jump out the hostile fleet safes up and logs i appreciate that in this instance they will have agression however unless we have a several probers we will not catch many  hostile roam enters one of our dead end systems we jump in to hold the gate hostile fleet logsinstant local in 00 is turning this into logoff online at an alarmingly fast rate removing instant local in 00 will dramatically reduce this problem as for ideas on what to do in its absence there are many suggestions in the thread including a couple of my ownlocal is available to the alliance holding sov in the system update is from a modified system scanner anchored on a pos this gives some security to mining ops for people operating in their home space this does of course place attackers at a significant disadvantage if it is instant so perhaps making the delay a couple of minutes would help this would place some importance on an alliance using its occupied space for the purpose of reporting intel as hostiles move through tracking the hostiles would be possible but require the use of active scouts for current information rather than delayed the hostile gang can evade being tracked via local so long as they move fast again placing the emphasis on using a fast and capable scoutend result more nonconsensual pvp and less logging offzos
allrighthere is my proposaldont remove local globally atleast without supplementing it with something that acts as a comparable early warning system or threat detector otherwise some very unfair situations will present themselvesinstead introduce new kspace regions with no local this way the current alliances will keep the early warning networks but they will have to be clever for these spaces of course youll have to supplement this with some form of detection or warning system anywaysquite put without local there is literally no way to know if there is hostiles save for scanning them downscan probes and if there out of range in a large system you will never be safe again do not remove local but create a new localess region perhaps with tactile environments
00 and lowsecor at the very least have local act as the constellation channel that is to say everyone in the constelation in localor combined local for 2 jumps in every direction
people need to read the posts badly rather than assuming that its a whine for mods replacement hes not asking for any reimbursement but rather a change in policyi support
the problem is what if the petitioner got the loot himself and then got duplicate fittings back he could have made billions honestly there can never be a fair solution to this problem it sucks but thats life
at present its possible to get to a point where your standings with a faction simply cannot be recovered if youre 10 to the caldari state and everyone who they like and youve used some of the onetimeonly tag offers already you cannot ever recover under current game mechanics this is an even bigger problem with pirate factions which do not i believe have similar tag offers and are thus simply unrecoverable there have been a lot of ideas brought up in the past for how to fix this problem but the recent addition of epic mission arcs has brought up one that seems more satisfactory than most of the others for each faction have an epic mission arc based in lowsecfor empire factions or 00for pirate factions that has as its overall reward a 25 boost to faction standings enough to recover from 10 base to a missionable 2 with diplomacy 5 trained and make it so that there is no standing requirement whatsoever to do the missions this will of course produce penalties to opposed faction standings just like any normal storyline mission it will require an investment of time roughly equal to the time required to rat yourself from 10 sec status to 2 and with smaller cash rewards ideally these will also be highly dispersed missions perhaps even randomly located so that they cant simply be camped also it should not simply be a succession of l4 combat missions i want to see manufacturing mining courier and combat at a minimum with it starting with lowtrust missionsobscene collateral on couriers manufacturing missions where they give you next to nothing so you cant just steal it etc and then working up to the point where they actually might trust you a little bit the exact issues of plot and mission construction can be left up to the devs but that is what im thinking of when i propose this i believe that this will both expand the rather nifty idea of epic mission arcs to a point where more people will make use of them and it will allow players to recover serious negative standings as has been requested for a very long time in a way that is reasonable both in terms of game mechanics and storyline
would this not mean that certain alliances would have complete and utter control over that recovery option if you control xy space you practically control the xy epic recovery mission as well since almost nobody would be able to run lots of high level missions on your turf without getting ganked over and over and over again even if the missions are spread out you will still have to go to some specific agents sooner or later
youre right that this is a genuine concern but i think it can be addressed for one the most popular of these missions will be the ones for the four empires and those will be in lowsec which nobody exercises effective control over large swathes of  the only groups that even come close the fw fleets will presumably not object to people trying to improve their standing with their empire of choice for pirate factions this is more of an issue but remember that pirateowned 00 regions where these epic arcs would be taking place are not playerowned and thus dont tend to attract nearly as much fire from alliances also that would be where youd have to go in order to use those high standings  if you cant get into curse to run the angel epic arc then where exactly are you going to run your angel missions if someone controls the region with all the agents then they control the ability to use standings controlling the ability to recover standings is minor by comparison people who dont like you controlling the space where the missions need to be run will be a problem of course i dont think it will be an unmanageable problem but it will be difficult at times that said recovering standings is currently impossible  even if it is difficult after this change thats still a lot easier than at present i dont want it being too easy i just want it to be a possibility and this seems the right way of getting there
with a little trouble i located the original idea thread that sparked this postenjoy and add your support we need a more cohesive universe
agreedand ad the option for a black background just stars
dont have problems with it
it runs smooth on my pc but when looking videos or something else while in station it wont work smoothly i used to turn off the station rendering when i needed some juice for something else now that wont work anymore got to undock meh
atm due to disappearing ships and gates  this thread  ill be sitting in station until i get a new pc and since even station interiors are broken i definitely second this
yes this would make the game more immesersive
dead universe is dead making it more lively makes it more fun
oehw shiney
eyecandy for the people
thumbs upexcellent idea perhaps even have some capitals in the factions home systemsie a titan in the new caldari systemwould be excellent for players who may never see one to get a glimpsenot only that but seeing a faction fleet in formation would be nice 
excellent idea
i suggested it so heres my support give us more people in space

i absolutely support this ideaplexes are sometimes seen as a hotspot for fights but ive seen more fights happening around gates stations or on the acceleration gates into the plexes themselves if factional warfare is really about taking territory should we not have most of the fights happening in plexeslove the idea of escalating contested status work from t1 frigates and be forced to bring an entire battleship gang to defendattack a vulnerable system to take it oversigned
this i especially like c though it has been proposed before d and e
lawlactually i commented on this before any of it happened the devs said no no no they didnt want to make the plexes hard the other militias are there to defend them and make them hardpretty sure this is wrong unless it has changed since empyrean though true its much easier to just sit there and defend as you have rats as defense then again when they blob u the rats dont mattermaybe no escalation mechanics but surely its already there t1 frigsdessies only to open endedthat smartbomb deal was pretty funny and kind expected to happen what i want to know is how many vagabond pilots fly from the gate to deadspace for these t1frig plexes then camp the entrance ought to be pretty good stuffanyway failwarfare is fail you fail for doing it failwarfare has nothing at all to do with anything factional or pve
what he said
this doesnt even make senseif they want to make low sec more populated they arent going to say to 00 people that they cant go there that makes no sense at allalso how are you even going to get to 00 theres all of like 2 highsec to 00 bridges unless you suggest we are allowed to keep titans in highsec nowso what your capital fleet suddenly sits in a holding corp outside the alliance from now on just so they have the optionnoseriously though it isnt hard to screw around in low sec and be completely safe im a 1 man corp with capship logistics and i have never had any trouble yet
or you could just use something called scouts when deploying caps in low sec even when you know you have the biggest cap fleet in the neighbourhood seriusly im just in intrepid because they seem to attrack a delicius amount of wardecs saves a bit on the corp walletbut i could still see the pl drop comming miles away even though i didnt know a thing in advance and stil dont know whether they where just out having fun or where helping some friends in the allianceyou seem to want to have the rules tailor made for your current circumstances rather then acutally playing smart
from time to time there are reports about npc corporation activities in particular their financial status agms etc what if we could take part in this and buy their shares that are tradeable on market the price history in the market tabs could serve as a stock chartindex by buying those npc corporation shares or getting them in another way we could participate in their wellbeing and their times of crisis by not getting dividends when they stumble financiallythe dividends theyd pay could be either random or depend on how much isk the corporations generated at their outpost part of the trading repair cloning and reprocessing fees when there are news that a corporation of our faction is in financial needs we could help them by massive investments using their stations buying their products doing missions for them etc or caring in another way for the corporation that we invest our isk insince shares already exist in game ishukone for example has 19893328259 shares and the voting and dividend payment mechanics are already implemented as well this shouldnt be too much work but could result in level of market realism that has been never seen before in a mmorpg
would be a cool idea if someone figured out a way to do it supported
the difficult part of this proposal is having computergenerated share price fluctuations that feel real while not being overpowered as an investment tool i dont want a ccp employee to have to create fake financials for a hundred npc corps and i dont want a rate of return that beggars the player banks if it can be implemented well im for it but id rather not have it at all than have a mediocre implementation
when you open a saved fit in game which maybe your friend or corpie sent to you i think there should be a button buy fit which would attempt to buy the fit from the market all at oncethis would save a lot of time
supporting my thread
its not a horrible idea although i wouldnt use it in case they cheapest neutron blaster cannon ii on the market has been put up for 5bsupporting nonetheless
it could before you press buy pull the price info for the market from you or pop up a warning message with all prices on itsomething along those lines shouldnt be to hard to make
this idea just need a bit of tweaking into a new and highly useful toolhave hotpad work more like fittings or bookmarks with the option to inject multiple buyorders at once using these presetswith a nice ui this would make a nice upgrade to easy order placements and grant the mentioned feature using presaved settings
something along these lines would be nice yes hit buy have a popup saying this fit will cost you 12345678910 isk  are you sure you want to buy and then get the stuff
that sums it up very nicely thank you
i was going to suggest this
you do realize that the fitting bought this way will almost always be prized weirdly and most importantly scattered all over the regionhow exactly should that be limitedthere is almost no single place in the whole of eve where diverse fittings can be bought so the only things this would do is increase the importance of psychedelic trade hubs like jita even more any concepts how that should be avoided after all once you need to check everything manually anyway the concept is useless how do you know whether or not you are buying grossly over price youd likely check the most important items manuallyalso i have never seen any fitting so complex that it would save that much time to buy it manually get the stuff and fit it compared to what this suggestion would likely doif you can actually think of a way that this could work reasonably im all ears
jita ammar agil are 3 that i use where you can buy a fit for any subcap shipyou could limit it to system if it makes you feel like less of a laggenerator
your post was broken i fixed it
nah if i was going to start swearing at him id do it right i try to avoid doing that in cases where im looking to win arguments though  its fun but not very effective
thats ok herschel ill let you win the argument im just the cheerleader

the high security areas are a safe place to start until you are ready to venture into the more aggressive areas of the game  from official eve helpsitealso your little sideways rant about canflipping doesnt prove any point at all since salvage isnt stealing something you tagged onto the end of your soapbox speechanyway its a moot point because multiple devs have very clearly said that salvage is owned by the guy who creates it from the wreck not by the guy who creates the wreckexactly its not a controversial topic its something that ccp acknowledged with the introduction of salvagingpoint is moot
well whatever since the op isnt going to get what he wants it hardly matters
you got it all wrong what they must do is nerf blobs how do you do this diminishing damage per increasing hits like a stacking penalty on damagerandom number for example8 guns hitting you  100 damage16 guns hitting you  75 damage32 guns hitting you  50 damage64 guns hitting you  20 damage72 guns hitting you  5 damageetcthis way you fix blobs increase tactics and reitnroduce skills and active tanking may be an option again
ie make titans immune to sub capital guns and any ship immune to a group of ships that use weapons 2 tiers lower than the class of the ship brutix  drones  12 weapons alone nerfed to 75 damagedrake  drones  12 weapons alone nerfed to 75 damagetotal 24 weapons nerfed to the equivalent of 12 against a bs
this
facepalmso you can tank a bs if you fit your ship for it and use expensive implants and really that is all you can do than experts are calling this an epic fail argument oh well then lets nerf guns and other things because you are only allowed to do one thing on a ship i guess this is the kind of zombie braindead stupidness that made ccp to nerf falcons
oh hi mr bitter caldari you lost your overpowered falcon so now you want other overpowered ships right noand just to make this clear a rokh can fit a tank better than most armour tanking ships while doing blaster dps at 20km name one armour tanking ship which can match this
you are missing many points there like capacitor problems and lack of tackling ability there not to mention missing damage bonus and drones average hyperion or megathron will pretty much kick ass against rokh in most cases that will of course depend on fitting but stillanyway shield tank itself isnt so bad but its weak against neutralizersnos heavy capacitor usage and you cannot really fit proper tackling modules or sensor boosters etc while shield tanking thats the real problem which has been there like forever and hard to see any changes about it really
off course is not as simple and a lot of things should be taken into account probably makign certain classes more vulnerable etc what i mean is the underlying problem with active tanking and there is no difference with armor tanking are blobs so if you want to fix somethign fix acumulative damage dont artifically add unbalancing mods
no you can active shield tank a bs more effectively than you can active armor tank a bs even without the expensive implants also note that the mael tank was 5 slots while the hype tank was 6 and the mael still tanked more the use of crystal implants just raises it from being 20 better to being 80 better also since when is the common damage modifier not an essential piece of pvp gear armor tank ships have to gimp their dps to fit a tank anywhere within a mile of what a shieldtanker can fit in a mixed gang you can outsource your tackling to frigates but the damage mods need to go on the battleships try to fit up a hyperion with a 34slot tank once you fit the 23 damage mods you need to make a blaster ship anything other than a bad joke and youll see that the rep bonus is for missioners only since 375 on a single lar omnitanking is a rounding error yeah you can fit all that pretty tackle gear on your resident slowmoving slowlocking tub but your tank is hilariously awful which is why armor tankers just go for a buffer you cant fit and run enough lar to make a difference but you can run enough 1600mm plates to give you a fighting chance which is why armor tanks are all buffer tanks and of the activetank types you say its shield tanking that needs work please
considering there are vids of maelstroms tanking loads of guys gettings lots of kills and getting away i just cant see why you need to improve shield tankingthe reality is that neuts are fairly common meaning active tanking anything is just bad somewhat
a bit of over complex but needed i might add allowing adjustment to drone orbit distance out to max controlable distance it might come in handy to catch a cloaked ship if drones proximity can decloak a ship as well
it would appear that a lot of people like the pilgrim the way it is fair enoughhowever we appear to have a consensus on the guristas ships

since i know ccp do not listen from previous expirences i will try here this post is aimed proposing a sequence of changes for the dreadnaught i have tried to ballance my changes with other game aspectssiege module625 damage increaseno comment75 scan resolutionpointless negitive bonus whats the point of delaying the enevitable2 max lock target increase this number to 1 no even better increase it to 0 when it takes 1 12 mins to lock something without sensor boosters who the hell cares chances are your team mates have killed it before you get on the killmail right and even then chances are your going to miss every shot100 shield bonus 50 to shield activation  100 to armor 50 activation remove the 100 armor  shield bonuscapital ships some time ago received an incredible bonus to existing armor and shield sizes the fact that a dreadnaught can repair so much armor in a short space of time makes 1v1 dread fighting irrelevant as in large dread scale fighting the bonus is once again doesnt do much i would propose removing one of the 2 bonuses from each shield and armorimmune to ewremove this affect on dreads more to follow let them be scrambled jammed dampened whatever there is a greater flexibility for the defender carriers will then have a role of also remote repairing dreads giving carriers a more definitive role in small fleets and more flexibility large scale fleetsno movement allowed no jumping no warping remove these affects on the ship if a dreadnaught is in siege mode and it can move jump or warp there is huge flexibility for an aggressor i personally believe this to be the underlining factor to why people do not use dreads in smaller amounts vs larger targets unless youre a caldari dreadnaught chances are you will not be able to jump because of capacitor constraints also take into account the new cap neuting pos module this will also open up more long range bombardment options off poses to snipe out deffensive modules and then move closer also range is a tool vs loging on dictor pilots and the allsorted options available in the eve environment92 tracking speedif the ew bonus is removed remote target speed enhancer modules would need to be looked into i dont see how it should be allowed that 625 damage enhancement and awesome tracking should be allowed on any battlefield everyone would fly pure fleets of dreads and it would become a ship that does a great deal in current eve mechanicspos modulesthe pos started off as a dream idea of being a tech2 essential component a dream that turned into a quick way for alliances to secure space so that these large alliances could have stability form economy whatever person made this idea i hope they got fired stability is in militant force and presence not ones ability to shove fuel in a tower and shout im better than you because im rich and can afford to run 20 poses all this for the good of eve so that we could all carebear in peace and harmony then came the sov leveling system and it just goes to pot land conquering warfayre turns into a job and not a game for most people but its a matter of perspective i guessif a dread can be jammed damped or whatever else pos modules should in turn be jamable poss do have ew modules so there should be no complaints really if an attacking fleet can jam pos modules as well as deal with the enemy aggressor fleet there is allot of flexibility now between the aggressors and the defendersthe defender fleet will be able to delay sieging dreads whilst killing the enemy on poses whilst the attacking fleet focus on killing off the enemy fleet and jamming pos modules or enemy ew that may be jamming your dreads it would be a new challenge which would generate more fun for everyone and new game dynamics will ultimatly form from this
the changes might make people think twice about loading a pos with pure fireneut power and maybe people willinvest in ew modules meaning that the removing of the tanking bonus is negated by the proposed change in pos dynamicsfleets vs cyno jammersit is a stupid concept that you need a ed size fleet to be able to attack a pos in a jammed system when you have 1 eve freak sitting with his 5 accounts on 1 pos manning 10 large guns having a hell of a time instapoping your fleet while an fc is powerless to do jack about it and not to mention even more hardcore eve freaks sitting there with there double titan accounts pressing the i win buttons when your fleet enters the grid and dies in a ball of lag being able to jam pos modules should make the game very interesting an enemy would need to invest more then a few titans to actually defend a system you would need a proper fleet to defenddesired outcomes of changesincrease team play and create a secondry viable being timely pos shooting hit and run role for dreads remember that dreads will still need there own logistics even in hit and run tactics so this isnt a i win tactic by any meansincrease flexibility for small time capital corps as well as giving the larger alliances more ability to attack a cyno jammed system and change certain aspects of capital fighting which may make certain alliances more elite then others players in eve need to be judged by there skill levels and abilities not to be a sitting duck on a battlefield with no ability to utilize the wide range of available fleet support to there advantage in todays fleet fightsopen potential for 1v1 dreadnaught fighting ie not sitting there both for 30 mins running out of siege mode then saying hold on mate just going to jump back to empire and grab some ammo or something stupidempire noobs need to see more capital action ccp advertises this capital fleet action crap everywhere over the internet noobs generally stick close to empire there may be more opertunity available to pirates to hit and run random poses and anoy people but more importantly the noob stands a chance at getting in on some capital action at a younger eve age maybethe economy of eve has grown to a point where it can produce a great deal more then it could there are clearly to few true combat capital classes in eve or maybe it is finally time to develop a capital destroyer type ship 8 turret points normal capital weapons call them gun boats or flak ships or ship o death lots of hell ye die fun basically
having read your idea i now understand why ccp ddint listen to youtldr  no
i dont fight in 00 myself but i certainly try to listen to those who do and try to get an idea of how 00 combat actually works what about it is good and what about it is bad and from what ive heard one of the few parts of 00 warfare that is actually working exactly correctly and is in no need of change whatsoever is the siege module you get damage but its damage that is only useful against poses and capitals and youre prevented from jumping or living inside an unkillable ball of rr the siege module brokers fights provides interesting tactical decisions and makes it so that capital ships can in practice actually die and furthermore the numbers are balanced nicely your suggestions on the other hand seem entirely based in a worldview not particularly wellgrounded in any form of reality the immunity to remote rep is an essential part of dreadnought balance for that matter youre not even internally consistent  a scan resolution penalty is pointless and should be removed but then you say who the hell cares about extra targets because it takes too long to lock and all this why  so that capital ships which are explicitly designed to require a support fleet can get into a 1v1 youre destroying a wellbalanced part of this game in service of a role that not only does not exist but that could never ever conceivably exist its people like you that make the csm necessary as a way to filter out this sort of garbage from needing to actually be considered by ccp
wow this is so horible you might as well throw out the siege module all together with your changes you destroyed it anyway no support lock thread and ban thebold for being an idiotisaac
worst ideas ever
never post again
um because otherwise dreads would have like no dps and would be inferior to bsso that sieged dreads cant randomly snipe gates easily drop t2 large bubble siege dread on gate lock fairly easily with sensor booster  bs before they can do anythingfor the purposes of dreads its plentybecause otherwise theyd have like no tank at all dread without siege tanks like 1500 dps in siege like 50006000dpstbh i can see motherships getting the ability to remote rep dreads but not carriers lol and scrambled they are sieged and cant go anywhere and dampedecm you already whine about having 2 targets and bad sensor resi cant even bother continuing to read
supported
we need a search function at least as good as that of eve search
do we even have to ask for this
we already did over 6 months ago
i supportits a brilliant idea
this is for all those of us who frequently use the market  but dont make massive spreadsheet analysisi would like to request the following5 day running average graph for traded volume like we have a 5day graph for average pricethe histogram is rather annoying yet turning it off is not a option if you are trying to spot a trend or change in trendsa 5 day average graph would greatly increase the readability and provide sufficient resolution for all but those who export the data and make their own dataanalysis and graphs anywaycoding effort required very minimaldata is already present read from the histogram data and plotting it should be extremely trivialvote
minor but could be handy
im running heres the thread i cant be arsed with a website
i am also running website will be running soon and will be posting my eveo page shortlyshatana csm thread
deadline to register was april 1st
my eveo thread 
it shouldnt be a surprise that i will be standing again for the 3rd csm session its been a great pleasure to be chairman of the council and respresent eves playerbase over the last 4 months despite all the hard work i fully intend to continue that hard work into the next session which is set to be the most critical csm session for the 00 endgame in years to comei know many eve players are convinced that the csm is simply a ccp marketing tool or a sham designed to appease for their past mistakes it isnt so they have been deadly serious about treating the csm as a key link to eves community and have listened properly to us even if sometimes theyre forced into comprises by other factors i wouldnt still be putting so much time into the csm if this wasnt the caseit was particularly impressivea the way the csm was included in the handling of the starbase exploitb the effect our input had on the apocrypha expansion this is largely under nda but trust me we squashed some big wouldbe mistakesc the key role ccp is giving the csm in the 00sov focused winter expansionmy policies remain1 customer support timely consistent and unbiased desicions on petitions and reimbursements2 00 warfare problems overhauling sovereignty and starbase warfare3 supercapitals doomsdays titans and mothershipsdetails of all are here in my original candidacy thread candidacy for csm 20i will again be representing 00 players and more importantly those who aspire to 00 but find the barriers too high theres a very real opportunity to open up nullsec gameplay to a wider audience in the next expansion and i will do my best to make that happen

vote for vuk
i pledge my vote for vuk
vuk lau for president win win
we need a person who will be the voice of the 00 crowd and who better then vuk
tell me what hard work are you referring to you have only raised three issues and the only 00 issue you have slightly been involved with was raised by darius in addition youve assumed the mantle of chairmanship without putting it to democratic vote and i think this has done the csm more harm than goodso how exactly do you plan to represent 00 when youve done nothing in the last half year and why exactly should people vote for you
if you read any of meeting minutes both from regular or iceland meetings you will notice the work of all csm delegates i am not lonely in my work but share more or less equal ammount of it with all other csm delegates beside regular issues csm was heavily involved into discussions about apocrypha features and even more into upcoming 00 expansion for the winter when it come to raised issues it is true that csm 20 raised less issues then csm 10 and it was discussed internaly there are two main reasons for this first is that sometimes there is really not good issues and 2nd is that there is already like 2030 or even more issues that passed csm and went to ccp but are waiting for future times to be implemented its much better to have 5 good and important issues implemented then to bombard ccp with hundreds of semigood ones just for the sake for being active csm 20 and myself included still have more then month and i fully intend to keep all promises i made at the start of my csm 20 campaign i am personaly not happy it had to wait but regardless of priority i am giving to my csm duties i had both real life to take care off and carebear alliance of 27k people to leadwhen it comes to chairman position by rules ccp made the person with most votes gets it i dont see why should i throw all the votes i got by giving chair to someone else also i cant see how 8 other delegates can decide who should be the chairman there is not similar case in real world elections so it shouldnt be here aswellfor the end next time when you want to troll atleast grow cohones to post with your main and not 1day altthank you
down with the kapitalist mahshine vote 4 vuk
vuk vuk vuk vuk 
vuk the best vote vuk
yeh vik luk gets my approval
vote vuk for a bright future
vikvukvik
vuk has much experience about the 00 warface and will support ccp well in the next candidature periodevote for vuk
you got my wote vi vuk lau
trolling removed navigator
dont know much about history dont know much about biology dont know much about a science book dont know much about the french i took but i do know that i love vikand he loves me cause i have big shipsbtw vote for vuk lau
as said beforevuk lau is one of the players in eve you could trust in a man of integrity that will do his out most to ensure that all player issues will be raised and discussed with ccp he also has extensive knowledge about the game mechanics of eve knowledge that are imperative for being a csm im absolutely sure that vuk is your man to vote on if you want not only your questions raised but raised in way and with the follow up knowledge that would make it heardits one thing to be a csm theres a totally different thing to be a competent csm vuk is a very competent csm and im sure it will be reflected even more on his next upcoming termof course as i am a member of his humble care bearing and role playing alliance it sort of throwing a rock in a glasshouse or whatever the right english word for that is but take my word as it is it comes from the hearthedited minor typos
i like him he likes banjaluchi chevap and vanilice i will vote for him
obvious troll is obvious that said i find it impressive how the people who claim its a free vacation tend to be the ones who not only have never been but who dont even know very much about those who did go everyone who actually looks at the business transacted and has the slightest clue about how meetings function knows that they werent at a club med ive been at a lot bigger and more respectable events with a lot less demanding a schedule than the ones set for the ccpcsm meetings theres been one other alliance leader of an alliance of comparable size on the csm and darius has brought up like two issues in the last year and zero of any importance the other alliance heads have been smaller by a huge margin  star fraction hun reloaded and honda accord are all 100150 ministry of information is under 20 and while the alliances hardin has led probably number in the tens of thousands i doubt that really counts none of the others have led alliances the last chairman didnt step down and allow a vote either to be fair personally i think that the chair should be determined by an internal vote and not an external one to make sure that the person running the meetings is mutually agreeable and can do things with a minimum of fussie i dont want to see what happened with jade in charge happen again that said vuks position is a perfectly reasonable one  we disagree but i dont think its at all undemocratic or evil to think that the voters should determine the csm chair no acting like a jackass towards someone who doesnt deserve it on a dayold alt is trolling
vuk lau for presidentin my experience with vuk lau he has always gone out of his way to help all the capsuleers around him he helpedsaved me on numerous occasions he especially makes sure that it is easy for all of us to have what we need in 00and besides i heard somewhere he has nudiepics on the interwebz hes got to be greati approve this messagegv
personal friend i would share my bed with if the need occurslast term was the first time i felt csm can do something other then waste everyones time vuk is the man to continue this job you got my votes
he smells like freshly baking cookiesvuk is a responsible and dedicated person and still maintains a high level of fun in the game these key attributes from my time with his alter ego in the game make him a wonderful asset to the csm for all players

hi my name is shatana fulfairas and i want to be your representative on the council of stellar management to represent more of the commerce and industry side of eve onlinei have many reasons i am playing this game i love the game and ive been playing for almost 5 years ive seen many parts of the game from living and working in empire to being in a major alliance working and fighting to keep a home winning and losing throughout many fun timesfor the last year or so ive been working back into empire been running some missions mining building etc i like to see all the way people live and survive in empire as it has the most amount of playerssince the most recent expansion apocrypha ive been playing around with the scanning for wormholes gravametrics etc on them being in the wormholes fighting sometimes with success and finding out how nasty they can be losing 2 battleships from the fleet in less than 22 secsi mine build do some research ive played many roles since starting the game and would love to be apart to make some changes that benifit everyonei see an important part of eve is its industry without this backbone to eve pvp wouldnt take place in eve without their ships and modules from the smallest frigates to the mighty titans and stations are all built by the players of the the games some take the cooperation of all member corps of an alliance to build and other who are on their first steps to building bigger and betterto get the ships to play in we all need the basics to go into it which comes from the mining the one ship i am pleased about is the orca it does work very nicely in its role which can be varied not just a carebear ship but the probelm with empire is its over mined and access to 00 for some is still a long wayoff i hope in the future we see good changes where you dont have a 6 member corp holding nearly entire regions so it will give the smaller allinces a chance to live and work in 00i am putting myself forward as a candidate for the following reasonsi believe in fair discussion and i am always ready to listen to opinions that may be completely opposite to my owni have played many aspects of the game and understand the effects a change in one area makes on otherscommerce and industry seems to be a neglected area of expansion  if slightly more influence was placed upon it this would enhance the game for all playersi see a lot of imbalances in eve online and would use my time on the council to help the player base to show up all the pros and cons of all the issues that seems to bug every playerfactions should not play a part in any decision or recommendation made by the council the council is elected by and for the players and all members should be completely impartial i believe that i am the right person to do thisi believe in fair discussion and i am always ready to listen to opinions that may be complete opposite to my own it all needs a fair and impartial ear to listen to it within this i would like to represent more of the commerce and industry side of the game as this seems an area that ccp have fewer resources to apply to it and my belief is if there was more time and effort placed here it would improve the gaming experience for many of those playersas i mentioned earlier i have played my part in many fights and battles over the time they have been played from small roaming gangs to huge fleet battles where you have more than 1200 people in a system fighting each other and ive enjoyed them both equally this is known that the developers of eve put a lot of emphasis on this part of the game and it is why many people play in the larger alliances or in smaller pirate corporations or as some say the bane of low sector playing but most of the time it is all in good fun and many battles are enjoyedin conclusion to this i will say i love this game and love the community surrounding the game and i see in years to come the scope and grandeur of the game extending an bringing in more of a player base and i hope to be a part of it within the eve council as a representative for you the player to those at ccpshatana fulfairashonour and servecandidate for csm

i would just like to say that this is just a sneakpeak top three that i will mostly focus on if you guys vote me as csm i picked the three to be more real and not to drown you with walls of text with all kinds of rubbish where you have to read several pages to actually see what i stand forso to make a standpoint i picked the ones that are the most important to me and as i feel it the eve community but mind you i stand for and against much much more
good day id like to announce that im running for csm this term id also like to announce something elsei hate the vast majority of youmy platform for this election will be primarily geared toward serving the interests of griefers pirates spies and thieves in eve online it will also be geared toward serving my own interests just because if elected i will strive to implement measures to make the lives of carebears in eve online a living screaming hellsome of my campaign ideas include proposing an ingame ransom mechanic for pirates something like when target is down to 25 or 50 hull you get the option to send them a window requesting a ransom determined by the pirate no more carebears trying to be clever by sending 10 million when the ransom was 100 if its paid through the window your lock breaks and the victim is given a small window of escape giving pilots the ability to jettison their modules this way a pilot who is hopelessly scrambled can bargain with any faction gear hes got fitted as ransom  now pirates dont have to worry about that gist xtype xl shield booster blowing up when they murder a filthy missionrunning navy raven introducing corrupt concord officials who can be bribed to fix your security status the lower it is the more you pay introducing events where the security level of certain populated star systems is randomly reduced to 04 for a day due to concord logistical problems preventing the deployment of law enforcement to the system asteroids will now scream in pain when mined as well as beg for mercy this will cause a horrible moral dilemma in the minds of carebears throughout eve causing many to contemplate suicide the implementation of badass pirate modules and gear obtainable only via pirate factions carebears get mining lasers and cargo expanders its time we got something cool for pirates ideas include exotic gear restricted to players with a 25 or lower corp sec rating items such as ecm burst missiles minefields not mines i know they caused lag im thinking of something new  think warp bubble except it hurts and shiptoship tractor beams for dragging fleeing prey back into bubbles and such really fun stuff addressing the blaster imbalance ive always considered these to be piratey weapons under my cruel lordship the csm will see to it that blasters become the most terrifying shortrange weapon in eve what i want to do is boost the tracking to a point where missing becomes highly unlikely at any range even against targets one class smaller if youre getting that close there better be serious benefits to the risk involved destroyed ships will eject more corpses these corpses will become a valuable resource in my proposed generation of booster drugs as pilots are encouraged to harvest thousands of vacuumblasted dead and rend them down into exciting new narcotics and boosters in bizarre chemical vats the carebears got their salvaging profession its time pirates got something similar for a little extra payout better ship destruction effects im getting sick of the current deal where all we get is a blue flash and some particle effects i want to see whole decks blowing out i want to see explosions rocking the length of the ship before it blows up the empyrean age video of jamyl blowing up the minmatar fleet is exactly what i want to see when a ship diesof course i have no idea how many of these are feasible but you should consider these suggestions as an idea of my mindset rather than concrete plans i want to see implemented my supreme goal is to hurt as many carebears as possible and i am a rather creative individual  if elected you can be sure i will find a wayvote shogaatsu in 09
i endorse this
this guy is an ass he thinks very highly of himself and wont blink at stealing doublecrossing or selling his grandmother hes also likely out of touch with game mechanics and will only drive for the things he cares about  things he may lose interest in a week afterwards as a new shiny thing turns up this man is a murdering bastard and a magpie that said if you want someone who can write long sentences and is at home with polysyllabic construction hes definitely your man a verbose criminal if you will
hear hear
got my votes tbh
interesting candidateim looking forward to seeing how this will turn out
ive heard enoughim voting
vote for istvaan or else
im voting for istvaan because hell make the csm less terrible and boring also hes famous 3
intrestingistvaan are you really prepared to release you real life name to the eve public as a whole i suspect a fair few of your past victims would use such information as your rl name and location to return a favor or twonot speaking for myself since i have never been knowingly directly affected by you or your corps activites i just wonder if you had considered the ramifications of going public with your rl credentialsbtw as a self confessed carebear myself i would enjoy seeing many of the ideas you put forth in your intial post introduced to the game
you still owe me money istvaan
his names also in most eon issues and the credits section in the manual people got when they bought the original box set oplus he goes to eve meets in toronto and has been to fanfest in the pastghsc isnt really about keeping a low profile

my specialty in game is corporate and alliance management basedi know most of the eve players are not directly involved with this part of the game and so think this is not an importantinteresting part to vote forcorptheft mailsystem communication security issues sovereignty and so on are topics that you need a csm for that have a long time experience and know how with the game during my period as 1st alternate csm in the 2nd council i showed i can also discuss and vote for general issues currently populair are empire industrial and new player issuesand on a sidenotethe coucil should represent a mix of the total players community currently i think around 70 of the csm 30 candidates want to represent the new players that is not a good development in case they all would be in the next csm 3 therefore its important to vote for me an allround and experienced player able to represent the total community

when a ships assembled from repacked things of sortsbe it in a hangar or in other forms of portsthen you tell the game to make an object from an object classand repacking it removes it and makes items you can stackso in theory what your asking could be done but its a shamecause the database one which eve lives would be in such a painand for sales well the market would become much more insaneto the point that if the list loaded the speed would be quite lameso the next solution would then be to repack something newmake that object from a class with the same rigs installed toomake the object match the base size and im sure itd be a sinchthat your fully rigged up domi could use up less per square inchbut the problem is in planning did that domi cost a lotdid your corp andor alliance get kicked from the space they gotid be angry ed in theory that my domi has to rotbecause then for all my effort i have not for what i bought but then all the strategy and consideration toowould be quickly stripped away if i could make a repackstewand set it up on jump freighters and send it all that dayjust so i can hop aboard the ship 40 jumps awayno im happy with the place were at and thats how i feel mateits a consequence for actions that even small guys can relatethat if a corp or alliance loses their space to fatethen that ship is getting contracted which to be honest i hatebut thats just how the cookie crumbles thats how we pay our duesif you rig a ship and need it moved youre gonna sing the bluesdr seuraph

omg i agree so much fraps of cap ships kinda sucks now its meh at best how many cases of beer must we as an eve community send to get this sorted
support absolutelythe gallente recon ships used to have a role and actual usefulness prior to the rsd nerf that came with ewar balancing this probably needed to be done as the op mentions rsds were being used in all sorts of ridiculous places however  the arazu and lachesis in particular are not even pale ghosts compared to the other races recon ships the falcon is the ubiquitous pvp condom and even with nerfs the rook will likely take up its position in most fleets the minmatar ships ill admit i dont see much of then i dont see many minmatar ships buff webbing perhaps one of the most useful game mechanics there is the pilgrim and curse are simply vicious little ships that for their size and price are nearly without equalthe arazu and lachesis  why even fly them

great idea i was thinking about that the other daylet us edit what the pulldown orbit ranges are in a series of text boxes through the escape menu and setup hotkeys to use them
unupdated clones hurt whonewbs who dont have a cluedo i want the game randomly updating my clone for me not reallybut how about if i try to undock from a medical station without an updated clone it gives me a warningi get a warning if im trying to goto low sec aka risk how about a warning for unupdated clone
no
i could support an evemail notification of clone expiry to allow the player to better make their own decision about what to do i cannot support the game spending what can be a fairly large sum of moneyat least to a poor player automatically without the players action or knowledge i personally dont care if 8m disappears from my walletlike it did yesterday actually but i know enough people for whom that would seriously screw up their finances that i dont want an automatic upgrade option to be the solution proposed here
subcaps need to be smaller so capital pilots can get more epeen
or at the very least and for a start enable black and covops ships to not show up on local these ships were supposedly designed to go behind the lines hell it may even spur some smaller fleet fights
the current system is fine as it provides both options for 00 inhabitants if you like local go live in known 00 if you dont go live in a wormholeben
thats not quite fair if you want to make even options then make half of the 00 regions with local and half without then people go real options 00 npc regions should be split as welltho id prefer to wait until ccp finally makes a step toward nerfing all of local in non high sec empire i think theyll come around eventually as is the the most logical step forward in evolving game design
totally in with this low sec is a lot more risk then 00 atm out side of a main war zone anyway as for the cloaky stuffmake them detectable but you cant get a 100 lock  you just get a spot within a 100150km range of them but not allined to them so you cant just fly forward to find themits also really hard to get that lock when scanning ect taking maybe 10mins on average lots more u could do to rebalance the issue but that is for another topic
first off the premise in the op is flawed wormhole space is a completely different arena to new eden space sleepers are designed to encourage loosely speaking pvpesque fittings and small gang work to take them on which means in theory a sleeper ratting group that gets jumped by gankers has at least some chance of getting out alive or fighting back the fittings required to run l4 missions or rat 00 belts let alone mining ships are completely different from pvpsleeper setups and leave the pilot a sitting duck to any ganking ship that finds them saying that not having local works fine in wormholes so it would work in new eden too is like saying not having concord works fine in 00 so we should get rid of concord in empire they are different environments with different requirementssecond why are you all so insistent on ccp spending development time reinventing the wheel to get us right back where we started hey guys lets get rid of local hey guys lets rewrite the scanning system to emulate the effects of local we already have a system which emulates the effects of local its called local and for the most part it works finethird the solo and small gang advocates in this thread seem not to realise that they rely as much on local to find things to shoot as their targets use it to look out for things shooting them ive done my share of scouting for both small gangs and full fleets insert lol blobbing goon nubs no skills no honour comments here and being able at a glance to see that a system is empty and i can move on is the only thing that allows a roaming group to cover a decent amount of ground quickly imagine if on your next roaming op you had to wait several minutes on every single jump while your scout warped around scanning to see if anyone was even present rather than just jumping in and saying ok noone in local here system is clear guys jump in and get to the next gate removing local is a token gesture which merely creates the perception of lowsec and 00 being places where youll be suddenly and unavoidably ganked if you undock and so scares all the ratters and miners back to highsec to lag out the mission hubs even more and leaves fewer things for the rest of us to shoot it has little effect on the ratter with his 6 accounts and macro programs set up to autoscan constantly for new signals and ctrlq at the first sign of anything coming in its most significant actual consequences for the most part would be to obliterate the reconnaissance and intelligence gathering side of the game vastly increase the power of cloaking ships and login traps and cripple the ability of pvp groups to find targets because it takes them an hour or so to check and move through 20 systems the net result small to mid scale combat consists entirely of recon gangs stumbling around blindly in the darkness and occasionally bumping accidentally into each other
ehhh i would say noif you ed a state off so much that any citazen of that state would beat you  you  on you kill you and  your dead body then there is no way in hell you should be able to recover that standing if you made that choice in the game you shouldnt change your mindeditand getting 10 to a state is actually a hell lot of work so you cant say i didnt know what i was doing i am just a noob
their is only a very few stations which cannot be player owned in the different pirate areas and around themand effectively they are owned since if you got bad standing to whatever faction and need to improve it you will need a station to dock and the only stations you could dock with your standing well they are now player owned 
angels 4 corps each with 1020 systems settled in curse and fountainblood 13 systems settled in delveguristas 7 systems settled in venalsanshas 2 corps each with 30 systems settled in stainserpentis 16 systems settled in curse and fountainto the best of my knowledge of the game mechanics you can always dock at these stations even if youre at 10 to the owners theyre still npc stations not outposts blood and guristas will be hard  blood because youre right in the middle ofactive shall we say space and guristas because theyre genuinely short on stations angel sanshas and serpentis will be just fine though as will the important ones  amarr caldari gallente and minmatar and if youre blocked from blood and guristas by whatever difficulties their space provides you do have the option to use sanshas as a workaround  stain is a lot more open and you can run your sanshas standings up without having to mission in the middle of the delve war again im not sure how it helps you to have good blood standing if youre not willing to mission in delve but if you really want it thats a way to get it at the end of the day though pirate faction standings are secondary yes there are people wholl want to run up serpentis standings and get snakes for their lp there are a lot more people who spent a year missioning in dodixieor who were intending to balance their standings but ran one too many missions for one faction and lost access to the others realized that now they cant fly in the good half of highsec and would really like a way out of their hole this proposal is aimed mostly at them as for the you shouldnt be able to recover if they hate you that much i have a few things to say one i said in my original suggestion that it should start out with truly bad missions  couriers with collateral 10x the value of the goods manufacturing missions where they tell you to go buy a blueprint and give them stuff and the like in rp terms youre working your way back into their trust and it should be long and painful to do so two this is a game and hard limits on things tend to really annoy people who play games never is a word you should try not to use  actions having consequences is fine actions having unfixable consequences is less fine three this sort of thing is hardly unprecedented even in real life  go look up people like alcibiades talleyrand or von braunto pick three of many if youre useful enough and pod pilots are quite useful former enemies will forgive you a truly great amount
i think its a well thought out solution to the standings problem and i support it
and the abillity to remove almost everything in the background why does my dark vast nothingness need to be coulorfull as a freaking rainbow in every mission i need to turn the cam around untill i find a dark spot i can stare on so my eyes aint annoyid by all the annoying background stuff 
well the point is if they implement static backgrounds you would mainly have a black background with different colored stars there would be gas clouds but not one that envelops every single systemi agree though there should be an option to turn off complex backgrounds
do this naow
we can assign a hotkey to attack and to return and orbit but we dont have one for launching drones it seems pretty obvious this should be included with it
supported for drone boats id like to see options to launch drones by group with by hotkey
hell yeah
i assume we dont have it because theres more than one drone group on many ships that said having the ability to set a default launch group for the hotkey would fix this just fine supported
i barely ever use drones im hard core caldari but even i think this would be an incredibly convenient feature
yup
supportedi was wondering why i couldnt find it and then realized that there wasnt one stupid me
yes
as a dedicated drone specced gallente i fully support this ideai do wonder though which drone group the hotkey would launch can you change that group and so on
excellent ideawould be easy to implement into the ship interface with group icons around the shield or something each button would show the name of your respective group awesome idea
id like to see two separate bombers1st old good stealthies able to fight small ships could be done just with a little boost to old bonusmap expl speed or expl radius2nd the new bombers on destroyers hull 6 siege launchers etc
i too would like to see a new bomber heavy bomber etc can fit 23 bomb launchers also make bombers have their own tab to seperate them from the cov ops
signed
yes
when ambulation arrives i want to be able to ride on one of those cruise ships that or board it and rob the passengers whichever i am in the mood for great idea
could be fun
but isnt it the whole point of eve that its cold and dark
why not have some fluffy weak npc ships floating around the galaxysounds like perfect cannon fodder for a 10 sec player
ill support only if i can kill them without getting concorded
hell yeah
nobody cares about rpingunless they can be killed for loot or something 
make them fluffy
helloi could not find this so here i gomany times i find myself just whanting to sell stuff to avarage market value or have them slightly over or under avarage price this lead to alot of clicking wich i feel can be avoided therefore i like to see a function that you can sell a bunch of items at the same time and with just one click i like to see the following optionssell all things to equal or x procent over or under average priceall the stuff that dont have a buyer at avarage or x procent over or under according to settings will be put on the market for x procent above or under the avarage priceoption to save the above in diffrent present with one user set default to speed up the selling proccessyou should ofcource still be able to sell stuff one buy onei am aware of the problems this can generate if someone for instance tweak a bit and make a macro trader however i still feel this is something ccp should look into to implement and am comfortable that they can minimize the risks and make the selling experiance alot easier for people thank yoump337
so highlight a bunch of items get a mass sell option on the rightclick menu and then have a sellordertype window pop up and give you the choice of selling to buy orders or selling at x of regional average i can dig it wouldnt use itim too much of a pennypincher but i know quite a lot of people who would and all of them would absolutely love this
siiiiiiiiiiiiiigneeeeeeeeeeeet pyer would love this d takes forever as it is now although i would like it lined up as the reprocessing window telling me how much i will get for each item so i can click it off if the price is rediculess due to no other buyers or sellersbut then it would be perfectd
sure would be nice 
me like
never really got the point of factional warfare what again is the reward that i should fight to get oodont think you should wasted the devs time with such thing although they already wasted time with a unfinished and bad result
it would apear that the particular consortium of corporations based in irmalin are indeed wanting to change the rules to suit themselves this maybe because despite their loud and abusive smacktalk in localpropaganda and seemingly overwhelming numbers since the loss of their capital blob  theyre actualy losing a lot more ships to said carebears recently go iea take the ball and run with it although the attempt at attitude adjustment seems to be working in some cases i wonder if maybe more mature leadership from hun reloaded and friends maybe the answer for all their membersand the other residents of the khanid region answers on a postcard pls
research the kms check  nexfriends is still missing several cap losses on their failboard you count hun kills why not hun lossesterrorized not hardly sure an industrial corp is going to have pilots who fail to recognize the threat of war and lose an orca what you dont see is that corp or its alliance whining about it on the boards fail whine is epic though and makes that spanking you all took all the sweeter thanks suger 
i lold
yes an appropriate implementation is very important in this field but i think most of the required components are already in game as mentioned in the op the share system voting dividends etc is already in game although only for player corporations so far the amount of outposts a npc corporation have the number of shares the isk paid by capsuleers in those outposts are known as well the price history window serves perfectly as a stock index the market system the auctions contracts all that are components that already exist and have to be put togetherthe shares could be given out in ipos if ccp decides that it needs an isk sinks buy market orders or contract auctions or in trade for loyalty points for tags or other things poksu mineral group could give a share to a person of good standing for 10000 units of veldspar for example unlike other new things it wouldnt require a lot of extra work just a good economical balancing but i think ccp has qualified people who can do this properly thinking of dr eyjog here in particular while many other mmorpgs have auctions and item markets a stock market and playerowned npc entities are afaik unprecedented in the mmorpg genre and suit perfectly into the eve philosophy of a playerdriven marketjust imagine what new aspects this might bring to eve if for example people can have some basic influence on corporate policy by voting eg 1 vote per share on things like small changes in tax rates hiringfiring agents etc this could motivate corporations or alliances to strife for supremacy within the corporation buying all available shares in order to become a major shareholder and getting the share price up manipulating the market etc
not supportedthe hostile shown in local is very nervous to residents this is a part of sthealhops harrasmentsand as shown above this will make imbalanced hit to the iskgaining process
it is interesting sov pilots are so defensive about this topic more interesting is sov pilots who are too  to follow me into w spacegasp  something less than a blob fight i think sov pilots dont support this because they need the local crutchsupported for black ops and covops ships only in null sec
true so here is a solution to that when they cloak to vanish from local they remain showing in local for a few minutesto make tracking them even harder maybe have this echo remain when they leave system so you cant be sure if they cloaked logged or left
theres still some people flying non cloaking ships we must end thisno
its something youd do in jita youre right that its not useful too many other placesthough if the message was this will cost you x isk missing items a b 2x c itd be useful in some other hubs too but when youre in one of those hubs itd be a lifesaver especially midafternoon on a sunday if you dont care what the buy orders or the overpriced sell orders are at then this will reduce database calls and just get you the bit you care about its lowpriority for the reasons you identify but itd still have some use
yer although a window with the prices should come up so you could decide which of the items would be too overpriced at the station and click them off
almost supportedbefore the deal the popup should show the pricing table with summary it wouldnt be hard to code that
generally supported but rather than mindlessly buy just add view market details to the context menu for fitted module and maybe have a button to add all fittings to your market hotbar a way to search assets for modules used by a saved fitting would be nice too
could just have a popup come up withmissing module 1 x x  quick buy x  view detailedmissing module 2 x x  quick buy x  view detailedmissing module 3 x x  quick buy x  view detailedtotal  quick buyhave it autorefresh with any market transactions while the window is open would make it pretty easy to avoid a bad purchase and still get everything efficiently
in my mind it will tell you the prices and locations of each item you are about to buy
as the title saysas it is now the drone tracking is rediculesly high compared to their size a large gunned drone heavy drone have no problem tracking a frigate sized shipthis should be rebalanced to get in line with the weapon size tracking of all close range turrets
the main disadvantage of the larger drones is less flight speed and ease to get hit themselvesregardless of size even the largest drones are still tiny compared to a frigate it makes no sense to compare a hammerhead to a medium turret or an ogre to a large one the drone speed already takes care of a good deal of that try shooting down an interceptor with ogres for an extreme example doesnt change that much with an as on ab
this try actually using heavy drones on a frigate and youll find that lights kill it faster that seems like tracking is balanced just fine seriously crest i dont know where you get some of your truly strange ideas about game design from an ogre is not a blaster cannon any more than a torpedo launcher is the weapon classes are different and should be viewed accordingly
i thought this thread was suggesting a skill that boosts tracking for drones i guess op is just ignorant
the main problem with drone speed is that they dont mwd all the time when trying to catch fast target a large drone moving 15k is not slow when it is designed to hit bssand comparing it too a large turret is more then elegible since the drone is actually just a mwd with turrets and if you look at it its turrets aint really small at allit is more then silly that their dmg which is balanced on a bs tank can be laid upon a frigate orbitting the bs with 1k speed and it will kill of the frig very fastthese are bs weapons and would as so be balanced as suchalthough i know this is not a tread that will be supported much by the players since it will be a nerf to every one except dedicated frigate pilots it is a much needed balance issue which should be corrected even if people dont like losing the pwnage of doom
just because your caldari and dont use drones the opposite actually most of the times its drones that kill you sono
try orbiting the ogre drone next time and it wont hit you just like the bs cant hit you when you orbit ithowever now that youre orbiting something else the bs can track you and shoot you with its bssized gunsjust because youre orbitting one object at 1kms doesnt mean you have high transversal with everything on the battlefield no support
people seem to post all kinds of things in local wich should usually be encoragedhowever if people post a link to a contract a website or something else in local they are advertizing in my opinion advertizing should cost iskso i suggest a simple isk payment to post a contract link in local for a fee i think the fee should be in relation to the contract amount or starting bid something like 1 for contract links and a flat fee for website and other links perhaps the amount should be ajusted for the amount of people in local the confirmation box for this isk fee should of course have a disable warning option and perhaps as it seems to be included elsewhere a seperate warning for excessive feesto me a modest fee to post an advertizement link to a contract in a public channel does not seem unreasoneblei think this would cut down on unwanted spam in trade hubs language channels and elsewhere in eve especially if the fees are scaled based on population numbersdo not forget a fresh alt only starts with 10k even a very modest fee would limit them to s single post with such a link and posts without links are not taxed so most players playstyles would not be hampered
an interesting suggestion but i think itll result in too many false positives and not enough actual impact on jita local
i do not understand what you mean with false positiveseve links are always recognized and typed as such becoming yellow in locali admit that ocasionally after linking something for your own use the chat box tries to link whatever you type to what you linked before but that is easy to avoid if you want toif you hide a link to avoid the fee then the ad will become less usefull as people will have to make an effort to resolve the link mauallyto be honest i think the people hit hardest with this proposal would be isk sellers and contract scammersit does not prevent them from doing it but it would reduce their amount of spam in local and other public channelsin addition it could work as a tiny isk sink if the fee is chosen correctlyof course i support my own proposal
youre right i should be clearer about what i mean by false positive heres the sort of thing i meannoob system local chatnoob  hey its telling me i dont have enough cpu on my ship how do i fix that vet  train the electronics skill or fit a linkcoprocessor ilinkhelp channelnoob  my agent is offering me the mission worlds collide and ive heard its hard what should i expect to facevet  visit
if were talking about the primary bombers role as a terrorist actor that lives in the enemys deep rear lines hunts haulers and other shiptypes so the bomber should be able to perform a solo action the current sisi bonuses allows solohunting haulers only i dont see the way to kill even cruiser the old bombers did allow frigcruiserbcs solohuntingif were talking about the antibattleship only role then bombers definitely should gain the real devastating firepower because 15 seconds recloaking delay makes impossible to hide after the decloaking what means death in 5 seconds after being targeted for example current bonuses on sisi shows me that manticore needs 30 volleys to kill fleetsnipe megathron this is epic failprobably as was offered in one of the already closed discussions bombers should hit directly the structure ignoring the shield and armor in this way they will definitely become the nightmare for the battleshipsupd all this was wrote down to make clear that stealth gang of 5 bombers still isnt such effective as gang of 5 cloaking hacs against any shiptype even with all the penalties gained from the cloaking devices give people the reason to fly stealthies
the scarcest resource in combat is the pilot a bomber takes one pilot a raven takes one pilot the secondscarcest resource is cash and after insurance it costs more to lose a bomber than a raven and for all that the bomber does less damage and dies about a billion times faster people fly hacs because hacs do things that battleships cant  speed and agility mostly make bombers able to do something that battleships cantlike applying battleshipsized dps to frigatesized targets to pick an example completely at random and people will fly them when they want to do that thing when you make them a pale pink imitation of a battleship people will just use a real battleship im not saying a bomber should always be better but it should be better under some reasonable circumstances i cant see what those circumstances would be for the proposed torpedo bomber
why i flew the purifier before it was nerfedgood damage in a frigate package and now thats being upgradedhas the ability to cloak and now thats being upgradedis very agile and quick and thats being slightly upgraded and downgraded oh well ill livemakes a decent scout and thats being upgraded slightlycould surprise my enemies thats being upgradedpretty explosions even better loland now with the upgrades this only makes me want to use the stealth bomber more now that it can be used with the black ops better that just makes the class better the battleship cloaking not including the bo idea simply doesnt compare to the stealth bomber you lose lock time and speed oh and the it doesnt do different damage than the bs is simply bs lol we already have frigatesized frigate killers assault frigates why do we need another platform for one my 2centsisaac
sweet jesus the umpteen millionth thread on thisif you use the search function youd see that making another freaking thread about this isnt going to helpplease stop cluttering assembly hally jpsc forums with these
oh rly i bet i can make a hype setup that outtanks and outdmgs any active shield tanking ship and complaining about not have not enough low slots on a ship with only 6 is fail because that is the point not enough slots and you have other armor tankign ships with more slots shield tanking ships have a maximum of 6 slots of which 34 are used for mandatory pvp stuff  yeah armor tanking bs buffer tank because it is better in most situations but shield tanking ships also cant do this rly wellin short shield tanking ships are baits nothing else typhoon anyone awesome dps out to 20kmalso i cant fly falcons but i enjoy having some in my gang 
you simply dont get it but ill give this one more try hyperion 2 lar dcu 2 eanm explo hardener 2 nanobot accelerator aux nano pump 1103 dps tanked 862 dealt rokh xlsb sba 2 invuln 3 solidifier 1140 dps tanked 1078 dealt now that hyperion is better in some ways  the cap lasts a bit longer its a bit faster a ship etc but the rokh has somewhat more tank and noticeably more gank or maybe you want to compare it to other ships well the abaddon gets a slightly worse bonus for active tanking but has a seventh low slot and sure enough it gets a touch more tank  1165 specifically  but it only does 653 dps the armageddon loses the tanking bonus altogether but gains an eighth low slot and this puts it in a worse place overall  967 tank and its not even capable of fitting a full rack of battleshipsized guns its not about not having enough slots  ive yet to see any ship that couldnt be made better with more slots  its about the fact that there are important modules to fit both low and mid and they both place a pinch on their respective form of tanking so what exactly is this mythical armor tank setup that results in you having an active tank that makes the ship better as an activetanking pvp ship than a rokh i dont want i bet i can i want an actual fit again youre making the mistake of assuming that your shieldtanking battleship is flying solo and fitting all the mandatory gear that implies yes if you do it that way your tank is going to suck  i cant seriously suggest an active shield tank on a solo pvp battleship short of a factionfit golem or nightmare or something but for smallgang work where you can have a ceptor beside you to do the tackling then your shield tank kicks the crap out of an active armor tank without even trying drop the whole mandatory concept from your head and try to build a functioning gang without preconceptions a typhoon with no damage mods and the massive pinch on pg imposed by fitting 2 lar actually doesnt do that much dps  only 910 and it tanks 762 and it has 28k less hp than the rokh moves at half the speed and is in some ways even more rangedependent because one of its weapon types is a falloffbased weapon the typhoon is the worst active tanker of the lot
i think that the point is that if the answer to how do i make a viable solo pvp fit for my shield tanker is fly an armour tanker then theres something wrong this would at first sight seem to support cosmics argument  but theres a key point thats missing and ultimately why this isnt supported by me and this is from the point of view of having a real soft spot for ships like the drake  just dont ask me why  eve is not a solo game every stage is designed to encourage you to team up with other maladjusted societal rejects like the rest of us and go forth and multiply your iskfunganks in that spirit having ships that require teamwork in order to be effective fits perfectly within that paradigm the conclusion must therefore be works as intended
i disagree but im glad to see someone here at least arguing rationally the answer to how do i make a viable solo pvp fit for my shield tanker is to fit a buffer tank just like the armor pilots do you can get a raven up to 1206 dps on 100k ehp while fitting a mwd disruptor and web its not quite as buffered as a megathron doing the same dps but it has a 20km range instead of a 5km range and you can also adjust damage types it also fits a second medium neut and is much less capdependant both of which are nice features a solo rokh can fit 1078 dps on 129k ehp while fitting a mwd cap booster and scram the solo torp raven is a perfectly viable pvp battleship and the rokh isnt bad eitherinferior to a mega but not dramatically so i just didnt mention these before now because this is a thread about active tanks and thus i was trying to tell him that active tanks are fine if used the right way if hes a solo pilot though the buffer tank will almost always be better just like it is with pretty much every other ship going
proposal is an adjustment to the damage formula for cruise missiles torpedos and citadel torpedos these classes do lackluster damage against nonstationary targets they were designed to hit and should be adjusted to bring them in line with other weapons systems this could be achieved with a boost to their respective explosion velocities but ill leave the implementation details to ccp the boost should be done in a manner that preserves the survivability of smaller ships against these weapon platformsheavy missiles assault missiles light missiles and rockets are fine in their current iteration and neednt be adjusted
i agree the missile nerf for cruise missiles needs to be adjusted
must agree the missles have seemed to have been overly nerfed some type of adjustment would be a welcome change
agreed please examine the heavier missile mechanics as they are way out of alignment
yes it would seem to be out of alignment
actually all missiles need revising in real world antiaircraft missiles uses very advanced explosives that almost eliminates the targets velocity factor but target can use missiledefence systems and antimissiles maneuvers to avoid the hitid like to see missile damage variator doing almost the same job as tracking variable for the guns in spite of actual absence of the antimissile maneuvers in the game it is could be a special variable for missile explosion cloud hitting which actually would present the effect of such maneuvering this could place some real logic in missile combatupd but please dont forget about delayed damage delivery
no support op lacks actual suggestions to change mechanics isaac
i agree with op that the mechanics are overly nerfed i disagree however with the above post saying no support because of no suggestion on how to fix the mechanics there are im sure dozens of variables we as players wont know the full impact of those mechanics but it is fairly obvious to us that something isnt right
unnerf my babys 
i think missile nerf for the cruise missiles and torps is a little harsh as other posters have said these missiles are designed to hit a target hard and do alot of damageother weapons platforms can still do far more damage then the larger missiles even with target painters and various rigs to increase the damage
signedmissiles desperately need an unnerf
judging by the title of your thread and half of your post revolves around citadel torpedos i detect that what you really want is to drop a caldari dread into seige mode and start insta popping bss
signed on one condisiondrones wouldnt be able to attack anything that you havent targetedthe whole idea with drones being able to hit any size ship and auto attack without you being able to target is just so out of bound and should be balanced firstbesides that awesome idea
they already do that at least mine do maybe they turned rogue already
hmm noo not really wanted or needed maybe a rebalance in pg though
id rather like to see a 10 range 10 strength bonus on the pilgrim sounds about right
what are you basing that on are you a pilgrim pilot
lets go with that pilgrim
pilgrim is fine dont touch itpirate faction ships in general need a lot of work so ill support that the ashimmu is completely useless since you cant fit anything worthwhile on it
pilgrim is one of the most perfect ships in space suggestions to change it are based on ignorance or envy leave my pilgrim alone
burn eden terrorized irmalin station with two nyxesnow pls give me my reward
only solution i see to the cap problem is removing all bpos for titan and motherships and removing the abillity or extremely nerfing the siege module and tri module for carriers being able to tank 20k dps  is just plain stupid and silly and totally out of balance compared to any other ship on the battlefield

vuk for csm
vuk lau is a great person in general he has great leadership skills3 vuk
honestly anyone that can run an alliance and even have even a little time to do csm is incredible the work and dedication that it takes to do both is a huge investment to have some on the board that is truly apart of the 00 community in more then the i went to 00 once its scary crowd is pretty crucialvote for vuk hate him love him doesnt matter he makes a damn fine leader
me supports vuk laus candidacy for csm 30i know being in vuk laus alliance may seem like its biased support for him but i am spending a bit more time ok 30 more seconds than clicking a button voting yesreasons i support him he has done well in collecting feedback on improvement ideas through the use of forums he does know a lot about 00 warfare problems being the leader of a major alliance in 00 its my first post in eveo forums ever so it was important enough for me to spend the effort to support himcyche
vuk lau for president
awesome work vuk thanks
vuk lau for great justice

vuk likes nice woman i like nice woman vuk for president
outstanding performance this term so it would be a shame if he couldnt continue his work
go vukgreat genuine guy who has the players cause at heart and nice pics
vuk makes sure that what does not roll does not stay vuk all the way
i voted last time for you brosef and going to do the same since i believe the winter expansion will fix alot of the sov problem or hope so one thing i can say is the csm transparency needs to be announced so the players are more in the know
vic luc for president againvoted for him before and will do so again happilyalso when do we get to see pictures of his wife

what if you have sound turned off
everyone benefits from successful and honored ransoms othey are instruments of love and convenience  however if you want to be all dishonorable and kill the victim anyway then all you need is a second tackler and the victim not to realize two different ships have him scrambled

amendment to suggestion asteroids will scream in pain when mined as well as bleed profusely they will also make angry forum posts
wait a second do carebears scream in pain when shot as well as bleed profusely maybe the first but not the lattereither youll make carebears thirst for blood with this or outright quit whichever happens in the sake of balance i think editoutlawsedit should get rickrolled everytime they shoot someone with a higher sec than them

in addition to individually corrupt concord officials would it not be possible for large amounts of money of course to be able to bribe the concord commander of certain highsec systems thusly gaining free reign to attack certain targets within a certain timeframe kind of like how the mob would pay policemen to not be near a certain store at a certain time no questions asked

yeah it does sound a bit boring but then i see how it would be exciting to people who are interested in that stuff the part i was looking for was what do you do with the resulting pile of money to which you answered hire mercs to grief people i dont like i dont see a problem with that it completes the cycle you are using your money to cause ships to explode which feeds the economy and keeps it goingthe reason i asked originally and in this thread specifically is that issler takes a more noncombative approach so i was curious what the point of having all that money was from her perspective
ok thats a little more descriptive but i still see an issue in your list of things to do to not go crazy only one of them is exclusive to carebears bantam ball in addition to that i dont see much on that list that is actually fun in a repeatable sense role playing could be a genuine source of fun so could bantam ball but those other activities will get more boring with each execution running a mission or two is fun running 10 gets old fast the same goes for all that other stuff most people do them to make money to do something else with that moneythats kind of a tangent though not the actual point here the point is that there should be no fear of any of those activities being messed with by ccp because those are things everybody has to do to existsurvive in eve that is what im trying to point out to you we all participate in those activities and then take the money and do something with it i buy ships that guy above buys merc contracts im still trying to understand what you do with yoursmaybe you truly love mining or managing poss maybe the money means nothing to you you just like delivering fuel and dragging oreice into a can every few minutes ill say it right here i cant understand how but maybe you dosee im back on the tangent again because it is actually that unfathomable
i beg to differ i also dare you to try and find any political movement or party or organisation that has ever existed irl or has ever been concieved of in a piece of fiction of any format that does not have a clear definition of its goals and what constitutes the parameters within which one needs to be to be considered part of that partymovementideology i think youll have a very hard time of it if issler desires to form a psuedopolitical bloc amongst the eve community then she needs to provide a manifesto of its aims and what constitutes the limits of its membership it is also utterly irrelevant who is right in an argument regarding political ideologyissler stated she wants to give carebears a voice or words to that effect to mediate the disproportionate influence of the pvpers on the eveo forums for fear of said voice having a negative influence on the noncombative aspects of eve life as such what we need from her if we and she are gonna be able to post constructively or act constructively is a working definition and plan of what she intends to do how she intends to work and what exact qualities she is looking to provide a representative body forimho the group of people im assuming she refers to as carebears do not need any kind of political representation beyond a voice regarding the economic aspects of eve say for example petitioning to balance certain market forces which damage the experience of eve as a whole wouldnt know what they are myself as im not an industrialist this idea i have no problem with as bearing is essential to the way eve works without miners and industrialists this game would be deader than aristotle for want of isk flow and material as it is right now that view wont change simply because issler and you have not as of yet provided enough meat on the bones of your idea for me to make an informed opinion
feel free to ask her specific questions if you want to make a more informed decision i believe she said a website was in progress and she has a voting record out there already from csm 20also her voice of reason party is not all that far fetched because i believe most reasonable people whom she wishes to represent hold reasonable complaints with most other candidatestake for example the overwhelming trend this time around for every cp celebrity to try and run promoting game breaking mechanics oftena small exampleistvaanasteroids bleeding bribing concord this doesnt get much more one sided and if looking through isslers voting history has told me anything its that not only does she have an interest for people who arnt cp regulars she also has a clear idea of good game mechanics for everyonei see a problem with forcing definitions on people if you dont mine more than 20 hours a week youre not a carebear  or is it if more than 50 of your time is spent in high sec  or if you havnt collected 20 killmails in the last week  the definition is meaningless when the goal of the party is to protect a wide range of activities what activities exactlyi believe if you refer to post 1 point 3 she asked for collaboration on exactly what these core ideas could be
for csm my plan is fairly simple i intend on having only two areas of significant focus while i am on the csm first is the ability to keep the sandbox as open as possible this is harder than it seams as often one style of play conflicts with another style i would like to work with ccp on maintaining a balance so that many players can experience the game in ways that they enjoy additionally i would like to work with ccp to make sure that they dont inadvertently close off a style of play though the introduction of new content without at least realizing what they are doing why they are doing it and what if any new types of play can be made to help replace those that may have been altered eve is and should remain a constantly evolving game keeping and maintaining the sandbox style options open so that many different players can enjoy the game is important to eve as a wholethe second area i wish to focus on is in emphasizing to ccp that they have a lot of content in the game that is incomplete or underutilized i have quite a bit of experience in faction warfare which in my opinion never went beyond the 80 complete stage ccps failure to complete the system and balance it out has resulted in a system that is experiencing significant decline and within the year i expect it to be a virtually dead game mechanic this is in my opinion a gross over site on ccps part that needs to be addressed of secondary import are such things as cosmos missions that were terribly implemented and have such potential that is in essence wasted in this regards i would ask ccp to dedicate resources towards rectifying these areas of the game from small things such as the ui hmmm why dont i put the turn off this pos button right next to manage the pos button ya thats a great idea to medium size cosmos to large issues faction war from my perspective ccp tends to release content at 75 complete balance it to 80 about 13 weeks later with a small patch then drop it off their radar completely
what is your position on gold farmer ganking would you bring at least bring it up with all the nerfs to suicide ganking and other mining boons you cant steal or kill these guys the way you used too today i saw 70 mackinaw farmers having at an ice belt and there isnt a damned thing i can do about it anymores
bigger pleaseim not 18 anymore i have a kid who is 18ive been using these eyes over 4 decades have mercy
im not sure if it would be possible from a technical perspective but it would be great if ttf could be supported then we could use any font of any size as neededim looking forward to an 18pt courier new on my screen
that would be a cool option  it would give a different look to the interface of ships of different races i think the variants like khanid ships should also get additional font options
im often running running on 2048x1536 but ive not had font issues but if you all say its a problem then lets bring it up
this
its pretty obvious when calling out system names in 00 or reading off wh names over ventts that this is a real problem
supported
i agree give the old one back or a better new one
the old nerf was needed no argument but without a boost especially to the gal recons they just became too weak compared to their counterparts more range and actual effectiveness would be ideal
yea
y not alow this happen 
i have to agree with thisits rediculous that my apoc is about the same size as my chimera and thisll take time away from the designers not a lot i think and not the programmers
support
agreed
supportednot mechanically important but for a game that pays so much attention to very little details this is a good idea
supported however i dont think its very feasiblethink about what a pain it is to maneuver capitals around each other now and then imagine trying to fit your cap fleet in a pos bubble when all the ships are 510x biggertitans wouldnt fit in a pos bubble period if they were properly scaledid love to see properly scaled ships and planets but i just dont think itll happen without breaking the game a bit
any time devoted to redesigning eves ship models better include missile hardpoints 
edit nm misread the op and thought he was asking for something sensible
thats a crutch leaned on by many pilots ive done a lot of ratting in 00 over the past few years and i learned a long time ago to make a pvp fit work for ratting because i didnt want to be a sitting duck what you mean to say is an optimized i dont have to worry about pvp because i can warp away when someone shows up in local ratting fit doesnt work for pvp if youd said that youd have been correct
well wormhole space is 00 as well but seriously would the differences between wormhole space as it is now and known 00 with the same delayed local mechanic be so greatben
yes because its much easier to resupply and much easier to roam and you know where your targets will bewithout local you will have some of those multiple account people sitting in cloaked ships for weeks effectively locking down systems from ratting as there is simply no way you can defend against it the attacker has all the advantages as he can decide when to attack the defender have to fight against boredom
one of the rules of war is know where your enemy isnot supported
i was gonna say that this is so far the dumbest post in this thread and tell you that you are a dumbsht but then i remembered that children also play this gameyou see knowing where your enemy is is indeed one of the most important pieces of info to have during a war which is all the more reason why this info shouldnt be provided for no effort instantly and at infinite range this is because you always have to work to get something thats worth anything i hope thats clear enoughit is also important to note that those who propose a delayed local also propose that the ships onboard directional scanner gets additional features to mitigate the issues that a delayed local would create such issues include the lack of autoupdate function in the current scanner and the need for additional functionality to replace the current local
supported greatly
good idea long overdue
i cant believe im playing without this feature
supported would be more easy for drone users like me
supportedsuggestion of implimentation allow people to put drone groups into their high activation slots
heh that would be nice
how would the system know which drones to launch
i think having a choice on the same stealth bomber so well they get battleship launchers or bomb launcher is a nifty idea i dont understand why theyre taking away the ability to use cruises on them for the torpedoes
sure why not
id love to see more stuff in spaceif the devs are always saying theres all this room to grow then where is all the growth
i dont use it but why not
seems a simple and useful idea although id suggest the colour green as it would stand out more against the default colour scheme and keep up the whole green  your corp theme
factional warfare is already dying minmatar are hardly putting up any resistance anymore the minmatar count is 2568 the amarr count is 2572 thats a sad decline from when amarr was outnumbered 21pretty sad state from what i heard was meant to be
we didnt need the rules when the war started but when pl jumps in and takes down your cap blob you start in about capsnice whine
sorry why should 00 alliances not have an influence on low secterrible ideas x up for low sec pos takedown sorry my dread only works in 00
on a strictly common senserp basis i can support this covert cynos are just that covert so why should the empires be able to block them that being said they need to be able to get around cyno jammers as well perhaps in the same change high isk items would be able to be moved easier that is true but do you honestly expect the npc corps in eve to not have pushed for this ability from the empires as soon as it was available it would seem this is a reasonable request
tbh this thread is just about black ops basically which has nothing to do with logistics its about moving the glass cannon defenseless crap shipsi disagree i think blockade runners are perfect the way they arejumpfreighters are frighteningly long jumpers they can survive a nerf thats for damn sure jumpbridges im not so sure about i like how pods are essentially free to move around on the otherhand i dont know how much fuel is used relative to other ships though generally speaking those pos are very sensitive a blue could keep jumping back and forth and get that pos busted up not to mention you require sov 3 so i think you deserve that sort of deal
the caod forum is pretty ridiculous you try to read any posts or topics and it ends up nothing but 20 pages of goonswarm trying to show off their 12 year old epeen i propose a simple forum jammer which will allow forum users to place certain alliancescorpsmembers on auto jam call it the forum falcon or something but i think its pretty clear there needs to be some moderation in there caod is absolutely useless when every post turns into 20 pages of useless goondribblebtw i have nothing to do with the whole goonbob thing i just like to read the forum to keep up with what goes on with all the big alliances im quite sure im not the only one that is tired of reading all the useless posts that the caod has become because of 2 or 3 alliances
has my supportim all for goons fighting bob and vice versa and i wish either side the best of luck but constantly seeing the same crap repeated over and over and over and over by goonswarm its just painfulwhen they finally have to deal with peoples complaints theyre always like bob did the same x amount of years ago and we didnt see you complain about that first of all wowwhat a kindergarden argument second of all yes people did complain thirdly be as that may they dont do it anymore see the difference
what i support is a block feature so you can choose to block people yourself i dont support having the mods banning or whateverps i cant post in nor do i read caod
yea thats all im talking about just thought id be cleaver and call it a forum falcon the tech ii version could block whole corps or alliances to make it easier
supported
i like it would be cool supported
i like it but what happens to pilots who buy shares while thier standings are high and them lose said standings i also think there would have to be a limit on the number of shares players could own in any one corporation also no voting as i dont want to deal with an npc corp that has been effectively taken over by a player corpalliance and you know some of the alliances in game would attempt to do so just to try and screw over the highsec players edit forgot to support
there was a news thingie once with share prices of an npc corp in it and the whole corps worth was around 10 bil or something in that area i cant remember the details but it was interesting regardlesswhat if an invididual buys out allmajority of the shares or will only small parts of the shares get circulatedanyway i like the idea and the details can be let to ccp
heh cloak favoritism anyone i think a better change to make is to change local for any ships that dont enter system through the jump gates the whole point of a covert cyno is to jump in undetected i believe so why would any group thats gone to the effort to cov cyno in then announce their presence to the system its like we are getting permission first and then the ppl we ask are telling everyone that we are sneaking around so its like concord is ratting out anyone that jumps in system all the time i think a better change is a modified local that only adds players who are on the same grid as a gate station or pos at most someone entering a system by non standard methods should show up as unknown in local until they approach one of the aformentioned structures after all why would you turn your transponders on if youre cloaked you also shouldnt recieve fleet bonuses while cloaked since the whole point of cloaking is to have zero detectable emissions how would the fleet transmissions continue without giving away your location
id be just as happy if you didnt show up in local at all anywhere until you said something and then you showed up for 5 minutes after your last post or something like thatbut then i only use local to watch for blinky red things anyway i appreciate that the interstellar communication bandwidth exists to advise me when people i can shoot are close by
im just doing some thinking right now and i believe that black ops ships would be incredibly more useful if they could get the same kind of recon ship bonuses like the caldari black ops ship widow why not apply the same to the rest of bos i think that would give a whole new level to this class of shipswtb comments 
not really it would make them dry and dull and overlypriced force recons or combat recons in this caseno supportisaac
theyre already dry and dull overpriced ship jumpers why not give them a new functionality that would make much more sense just like assault ships  hacs  command ships  marauders which all have the same function to deal damage have electronic attack ships  recon ships  black ops all following the same kind of bonuses at least they would be dry and dull overpriced ship jumpersbetter recon ships im just seeing one conflict of ships here between what the redeemer would turn into and what the bhaalgorn is altho the frigate and cruiser class pirate ships that follow the same path as the bhaalgorn also have a conflict with the sentinel and curse but i still think this idea is viablethis thread needs moar comments dedit i approve of my own idea
the fix to black ops in my opinion would have to revolve more around black ops but this is impossible until the ingame intel system is changed local nerfs black ops and thats just ridiculous
except that black ops do not connect to easrecon ships in any way its a class of its own until ccp changes its role isaac
it will be more easy to just buy the whole fit from the market because it will save alot of time by not serching the whole market for the things you need for the fitsupported
i would support it for just that reason alone
yeah we might see a whole new breed of market warriors because of it 
if you reinforce a tower that holds a cyno jammer the cynojammer continues to run this must changecynojammers are why 00 is so unchanging at least give the cynojammer cpu requirements such that if the tower is reinforced it goes offlineproblem incap the jammer bring in dreads reinforce the tower enemy force reps up the jammer quickly and easily as it has fairly low hp relative to the pos also can be repped up at any time as opposed to reinforced timer disallowing repfix incapacitated arrays that get repped up will come back as offline
correct me if im wrongbut isnt it easier just to shoot the jammer and then reinforce the tower no supportisaac
ok i see you lack reading comprehension so let me explain it1st incap the jammerthis means we shot the jammer2nd bring in dreads reinforce the towerthis means afterwe shot the jammer we reinforced the tower you are wrong this is exactly what we didthe tower remains reinforced thusly not repairable also all cpu modules are offlinethey repaired the jammer which is fairly easy also they cant repair the tower so essentially this creates a situation that people with sov 3 can easily keep out most people from their space unless you camp them 237 which isnt plausible for any alliance except the largest of them
and i still see no reason to change current game mechanics they could just as easily setup a new pos with a cynojammer your change changes nothing youll still have to camp the system 237 also your statement that it takes a really big alliance to take down sov3 depends on who your shooting if your trying to kill bobgoonswarmrzretc then yes it will take quite a bit of firepower to take them down this will never change get used to itisaacps nice stealth blobwhine
you are ignorant of game mechanicscynosuralsystemjammermax anchoring amount per solar system1 they cannot unanchor due to reinforced therefore they cannot anchor a new one
i like the knowledge you bring to discussio oh waitseriously these arent threads to trolli support the op cynojammers should go offline if they are on a reinforced pos
unfortunately hes right many alliances use the pos guns to pop incapacitated cyno jammers and then anchor new ones as it is quicker and easier than repping it
catching up i read the most recent notes from the csm meeting and came across the pos subject the issue being abandoned and offline pos having an effect towards sov and also taking up space and resourceswhy not add a small npc scouting operation to moons if they come across an active defended pos they would simply be destroyed if they come across an abandoned or offline pos they could destroy it the owners if there still are any could be alerted their offline pos is under npc attack and they would have to turn up to defend it
i would be much happier if offline pos were tied into the same 30d counter that anchored cans are now if not onlined for 30days they just goo poofccp has been made aware of this idea and have indicated they are mulling it over
i noticed there is a features and ideas discussion forum and also this forumi did not see sticky regarding rules for this forum and would just like clarification because i proposed an idea in the ideas and features forum which has garnered a lot of support and several people who have had the same or similar idea even before methere has been no negative feedback on it and i think it really is something that the devs would benefit from hearing not a nerf or buff idea either
features and ideas is more to get the idea to mature and gather feedback once the idea is more or less final you can bring it here and we may then raise it to ccp
thank you for the explination is there any specific format the posting should be in such as links to the ideas and forums discussion votes anything like that
why shouldnt a drone be able to track more rapidly than a ships turrets it can surely turn a lot faster since its a very small and b doesnt have to worry about pulping the crew with a ludicrously highg maneuver so even if the turret tracking is actually the same the effective tracking will be higher because the drone can turn the entire weapon platform more rapidly
as with every other similar proposal thats crossed this forum unread by anyone in a position that could even try to do anything about itnone of them much careanyway we should all have a little button available when we click on a persons name in chatthe spam button when you click the spam button that person is blocked to you while you remain in that systemif enough people click the spam button in a certain time say 15 or 30 mins that person suddenly finds themselves gagged for say an hour or two if theyre gagged more than x number of times in a day theyll recieve a temp ban of say a day or two if this happens enough they get a long term ban that ccp will have to investigate to unlock or permaban
i know what your saying in heart but i cant support what your proposing
as much as i agree that jita local needs a good cleansing im still pushing my supernova idea id be hard pressed to support this for a lot of the same reasons that herschel illustrates in his own post
i say make a new class for there rebalanced bomber
change it so supercaps have a sensor strength of 9001
just my two cents on the matter if you think about it the opportunity for hisec pirates and griefers to go after mission runners is already there they just need to steal from the mission wrecks like they steal from the miners and wait for the desired response as for the impact of salvage aggro on the market since the salvage is sold at the end anyway the only difference is who gets paid for it either way the some kind of salvage is going to be sold most guys doing this are smart enough to not pick a fight if theres several ships in a mission they arent going to risk losing a ship over some contaminated nantite a more balanced idea would be making it more difficult to track ships in deadspace zones to me there is a difference between salvaging a wreck in open space near a gate asteroid belt or station and scanning down a guy to rob him in the middle of a missionthank you

oh hell yes
how about a local comms scrambler which would allow a 5 minute window where you dont appear in local giving time to scanprobe out your target not sure how the mechanics would cope with a module that gets deployed before you jump in unless it would need an alt or gang member in sytem to do it maybe balanced out by your or your gangs location appearing as an icon in space when the timer expires so you have to get out or fight or even it could mean getting stuck for 1 minute like what happens in a cyno skill level could determie amount of time you can scramble local and reduce amount of time you get stuckvoting for you just cos it will make thing interesting if you get inrev
gogo mighty moanin shogaatsu
well i think youre an immoral evil bastard and i shant be voting for you good sir
whats funny is that i wanted to make a yes we can poster for this tried to then gave up after about 4 minutes
i like the cut of this guys jib he has my vote
you have my voteheres my suggestionintroduce a npc that for the right price will hack a corporations or alliances friend or foe indicator by changing their respective standing towards your corp these changes will last up to 24 hours or until the victim changes their standings manually the modification to the standings will fool pos defenses stations and some of its services and potentially give you the jump on your enemiesfeel free to use that idea but i expect a cushy cabinet position in your administration
why do you say fracture and i hope that my voter isnt only considering what happens and who talks on cp as the only source for constructive arguments about many many ideas the idea behind my candidacy is to represent not pirates or cp or antipirates or carebears but to focus my efforts to make pvp better for everyone
i would say that istvaan in no way represents pvpers to my understanding the vast majority of pvp is alliancefw level wether it be small gangs or multiple fleet engagements the likes of which where seen during the max campaign and the 2 assaults on delve dine in nol and all that what the likes of istvaan represent are piratesgriefers etc which afaik are a small proportion of the pvp community i also doubt very much that istvaan is in any way serious about applying to the csmand ultimately i would still disagree on the definition thing not only is it infact necessary as i said you cannot have a political bloc without definition even the politically apathetic can be defined as not giving a damn but its an innate mode of human understanding we define and limit and construct opinions almost before we consider the object of that definitionand as a complete aside i would think a voice of reason party would in honesty be looking to create a mediated political organisation representing all different views as equally as possible but that would be horrifyingly democratic so i wont go there
are there any ideas suggestions or ccp plans to deal with the minor attention topics
no kuzims have taken the presidential oath the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace yet every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms at these moments eve has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office but because we the pod pilots have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers and true to our founding documentsso it has been so it must be with this generation of citizensthat we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood our universe is at war against a farreaching network of violence and hatred our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare eve for a new age regions have been lost pets shed alliances shuttered tech ii is too costly our clones fail too many and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use veldspar strengthen our adversaries and threaten our solar systemsi ask you kuzim blakyall what can you do to fix these problems
notes what was brought up
please be patient we are migrating from ankh wiki to evelopedia and secretaries are doing the biggest chunk of the work
100 agree
i also hate the new cyno effect make if the old one or coolerus capital pilots want the attention when we jump in
10
hmmmm how many devs does it take to screw up a game  the answer is one how many devs does it take to fix it  the answer is zero caus ccp dosent give a ing rats arse about the people like us who pay for this game every month with our own money goddammit how much longer will this go on for before they stop taking away from this game and start giving  speed nerf anyone lols what does ccp have some kind of ometer first on the list speed second became cyno effects and i wonder whats next

needs another bump
ccp mentioned a year or so ago that they plan to redistribute agents and add more at some point with that in mind there are a few factions that could use some improvementsagent problemsmordus legion only has agents in one system in 00 pure blind suggestion put some in placid after all the caldari occupied intaki and pure blind is next door should be the safetynet for amarrcaldari faction as the standing profile has a lot in common with soesisters of eve general lack of highsec agents only 2x l3 and 3x l4 half of them in solitude andor with lowsec around theminterbus still needs storyline agentsociety of concious thought no agents at alljove empire only one storyline agentore general lack of agents 3x l3 2x l4level 5 agents most of the factions dont have them the larger pirate factions really shouldstanding problemsthukker tribe liked by two factions hated by 13 factionsblood raiders  sansha  guristas unable to recover standingpirate factions  concord pirate factions lower concord faction standing inability to raise concord faction standinggeneral wishes for an amarrgallente and minmatarcaldari thukker aligned factiongoals encourage players to spread out more improve roleplaying opportunities improve standing recovery options more interest in the nonempire factions
as this is a wish list addbetter balanced high sechigh quality agents between the factionsone of the reason why most of the mission runners play in caldari space is that the largest concentration of high level kill mission agents present in space is of the caldari factionsimilarly the number of level 4 kill mission agents present in high sec members of the caldari faction is larger that the sum of high sec level 4 kill missions agents of minatar and gallente
caldari also have the benefit of a l5 agent next to two highsec systems guess where 90 of the l5 missionrunning happens
its fine soe have some valuable unique lp store items its one of the few incentives to mission in lowsecthey dont want people getting standing with all factions at once
i wouldnt mind low quality agents and nonpirate lowsec00 missioning in general could be somewhat betteractually thats not the reason ccp has already sorta agreed to add an interbus station it just needs to be implemented thats why its on the listand with the extremely low caps 025 with amarr its not like people will get any significant faction standing its more of a last resort standing recovery safety net as using it for getting empire standing is extremely slowthere are far better alternatives if you want to get high standing with everyone just look at mine im positive with everyone except minmatar and even that is being fixed as we speak i certainly wouldnt use interbus for that reason
somewhat you think that people who risk expensive ships should only get somewhat better rewards no lowsec rewards should outstrip hisec rewards by a largemargin
running for the pirate factions can earn 6080m an hour im told not too shabby
ignoring the fact that thats still not nearly enough relative to hisec there are no pirate factions in lowsec

totally agree with this missiles in pvp combat are now useless
this was a topic that generated considerable support especially in the rp community it was discussed with ccp on several occasions and ccps response was that alliances would be allowed into fw in some form probably by allowing individual corps to join fw without leaving their alliance and that this issue would be addressed in the first quarter of 2009its now april  and assuming ive not missed an anouncement somewhere ccp seems to have entirely forgotten this issue and as near as i can tell so has the csm this is incredibly disappointing to those of us who actually care about the backstory of eve and are interested in the rp potential of the mmorpgdont let this issue die
i havent forgottenbut its ccp that said its the first thing we put in empyrean age 11err sorry not 11 well later this year okayyes well patch it into quantum risewe got the game mechanics sorted wont be long january 2009 itll be inright were busy with apocrypha but please wait a little longer q1 2009 promisei personally asked them about this in iceland and they were like uhhh  yes we still have to do that too but we really have more important things to do and dont care about itthen again i dont see why you guys want to join fw in the deplorable state it is in but mehedit with q1 2009 expired ive raised this issue for the third time
moved to  assembly hall 
because theyre rpersmeh supporting just because ccp said they would and it doesnt matter to me
yes yes yes yes yes yes yesyes
i agree here maybe it wouldnt have been a good idea to let alliances in at the beginning when we had like double the numbers in militias compared to today 8k in the caldari militia at one point for example in a time where our militia was having 150 man fleets on a daily basis the whole region was sufficiently populated there were enough targets and fights at any given time during the daytoday the activity is only a fraction of that an increase in participants would benefit everyone i dont see a reason anymore to deny alliances entering this roleplaying aspect of eve they cant use their titans doomsdays to erase militia fleets nor are capital fleets particularly suitable for plexing or dynamic lowsec fights as they are roleplayers this could have a positive effect on the plexing instead since capturing systems determines who wins the war in the region wed have some more legitimate plexing wars going on compared to only pvp and the attitude that plexing doesnt mean anything when nonroleplayers dominate the scene
i disagree with the adding alliances to fw idea all i can ever see is super alliances just coming in and steamrolling everyone for lols also we dont need another place for these alliances to have their warzones the lag is bad enough lets face it fw is supposed to be the stepping stone before going into 00 it shouldnt be the other way no support isaac
ccp plans to add a pretty hefty standing requirement to entry thus just steamrolling over things for lolz wouldnt be easy this feature would be mostly intended for roleplaying alliances cva ushrakhan etc
if this is the case then thumbs up
well as long as ccp wants this to be a vote then ill add my vote in favoras to the questions raised above if the goons wanted to mess with fw they could do so at any time with or without this change and while i cant think of any other megaalliances that would care this goes for them toothe alliances that might care include for example ushrakhan em vv cva and other like us we want to participate in fw not because the mechanics are great they arent and dramatically so but because we enjoy the rp of eve and have involved ourselves in the faction war lowercased since before faction war was even thought of by the devs and despite the fact that the largest proponents of the faction war concept were these same rp alliances ccp in their wisdom locked us out of fw thus making a mechanic that had a great deal of potential into little more than a means for legitimizing piracy oh and a new sort of complex that nobody cares about except for the handful of diehard rpers who left alliances to pursue our rp wari realize that fw has a great many weaknesses and i wish i believed that ccp was motivated to work on improving it even so its unreasonable to lock rpers out of the mechanics designed to reflect the rp war
i would love to see this being possible for those alliances who have a long history of supporting one empire or the other to be able to show their support in this way
continuing to support this very important topic the arguments have been made the suggestions have been raised to ccp in csm 1  ccp have accepted the principle and promised to implement this for faction warfare it was also highlighted as something that is vital for the continued health and growth of the faction warfare concept at fanfest round tables last november this is no longer a question of debating the principle  its about asking ccp to do what they have the technical capability of implementing right now we were told at fanfest that the technical fix is ready to go and just requires a simple implementation to rollout lets make it so
sure while i think the organizational options character corp alliance should be looked at and depth added fx character corp megacorp alliancefaction coalition allowing the player alliances that have been fighting faction based wars since their forming to take part in the part of the game designed for it just makes sense
i think the whole clone sploss concept is outdatedit never really worked and it doesnt work any more at allit is obvious what the intention of the clone system was however the older eve becomes the more it turns into a total gerontocracy this is part due to the training times of the highend skills and the almost non existing risk of losing them if a player is careful he will never ever lose a single skillpoint to this there is also no real choice in it as there is nothing to be gained by not having an uptodate clone the amounts of money involved are of no significance compared to the amounts we constantly lose in the form of ships and implants those with so many skillpoints that it would really affect them financially would have to be totally incompetent if they had any trouble at all to raise that trivial amount of moneythe whole clone level concept could be dismissed completely and nothing would really be lost to the gamein fact i can think of more things that could be gained players that dont get frustrated due to an outdated and disfunctional game mechanism for examplethus any mechanism that compensates for this shortcoming is something id welcome if this useless mechanism remains out of misplaced feeling of tradition any improvement to it would be a gain
not supported if you forget to update your clone and get poded its your own dam fault
why not have them offer a clone subscriptionif you know youre going to die a lot in the next two weeks pay a fee up front and youll get a new cloneat full cost of course every time you die  within a time limitchoice is still there as well as an additional isk sink and those who want to automate the clone process can do so
there also doesnt seem to be any real reason why i am limited to 1 clone why cant i just buy 2 or 5 or a dozen or hundreds if i likebackground wise the clone is just the container all my skills and memories and so on are transfered the moment i actually die just one clone has to be hooked up to the system all the time but there is no reason why i should not have the spare clone in the shelf right next to it
now this makes good sense
i think thats intentional

while that is funny ccp has an entire art department sitting on their hands i think it would be worth taking the 20 minutes or so of programming to make the ships sync up with their masses and volumesmaybe im just crazy
its time they started putting some real effort into fixing all the odd errors they seem to hang around forever in eve sure its graphical and doesnt ahve to do with game play but at the same time i spent good money on hardware and want my pretty lights
hahaha im serious thoughideai think it would be cool if you where able to cusomize the color of your ship draw on it andor have the corpalliance logo on itbasicly just make my ship not look like everyone elses p
i can go with corp andor allaince logos but hell no to custom paint jobsi dont want to see a bunch of neon green trimmed checkboard with alternating nipple pink and powder baby blue squares shipsbesides it would just be more data the server would have to send to the client each time you load a grid imagine how much laggier busy systems and fleet battles will become thentldr  no
would be cool if you can paint ur titan as a shark to scare ppl a titan scares ppl anywaysupported
maybe not actual custom paint jobs but changing colours would be nice also stops the lol lag whiners as the server just needs to send colour1  000000 etc also if your pc fails that hard just add an option that lets you disable it on your client
there is no reason you couldnt offer a small selection of colors emblems and a small area for logos warhammer does this to great fanfare honestly if its from a small selection of colors it wouldnt add anything to server load and it would add a greater feeling of customization to ship building the paintjobs themselves could also offer a small isk sinkbut no matter thats not whats being proposed here and so i wont support
having a preset range of colors yesapplying corp or alliance logo yesfreeform customization ie pink and yellow ravens no
i would definatley support applying the corp andor alliance logo to the shipi might even go so far as to support something like homeworld where you have a main color and a trim color that can be set independently from a fixed selection of colors black with black trim for that stealth lookbut fully customizeble paint schemes  no sorry i just cant take any ship that looks like an explosion at a crayon factory seriously
this is what i was talking about games like homeworld or warhammer let you choose from base colors you cant go ipaint on the hull or anythingthis would be acceptable and the lack of randomization would make it easy to program
no since the game designers were too lazy to create more models for the t2 ships this painting would eliminate the visual appearande of t2 shipas at all
of course 00 carebears and blobers wont suport this idea
they get get rid of local as soon as poses in sov holding systems can track enemies ie if you own the space you can actively see who is in your spacelike current local if not you have to probe or scout the old fashioned way
that skews the balance too much in favor of defenders and mega alliances  they already have a lot of advantages the local nerf should primarily benefit the small guyit does make sense to let pos modules that improve intel but it shouldnt be just like current local and those pos modules shouldnt be hiding in pos shields
i think we all should have to scout the old fashioned way if a mega alliance cant field one dedicated scoutwatchmen per system then you fools deserve to lose themend of story
im not sure if this has been brought up already i havent browesed this forum oftenidea only cov ops recons and black ops can fit a modual that can detect cloaked ships with in 100k distance or solike when activated it brings up an infrared box overlay that can see the ships heat output that is cloakedand thats it it cannot lock on to the ship it can only see it
not a terrible suggestion but still every fleet would have one of these making cloaked scouts much less useful not supported
great idea supported
finallysupported
yes
okay rather short idea but why notit would be nice if there was some pirate npc demand for illicit goods drugs slaves ectoplasm toxic waste etc in the empire space where they are outlawed either through some semirandom missions or repeatable cosmos like structures succesful completion could eventually translate in a standing gain thus giving players the opportunity to repair pirate standingsit would be nice if exposing contraband with a cargoscanner would allow players to shoot the smugglers even in highsec
im going to add a random brainfart here maybe there should be a way of people preventing hotdrops im thinking some kind of cynofield disruption devicechance based and with severe penalties perhapse can only be used on heavy interdictors 30 second cylce time cannot be reused for 5 minutesremoves all capacator power for said 30 seconds very short range say 1500m prevents all movement and uses ozone like a cyno field possibly blooms sig by 500 or such like a mwd would and as i said has a chance of jamming a cyno maybe should also have very high fitting costs so as to gimp youre tank also basicly it would alow a last ditchnear suicidal attempt to prevent cap drops temporarily at least thoughts please even whine threads can be food for thought i guess
how about to actually play the multiplayer gamelet the towers unanchor at first dt they have met offline simple solution obvious and straightforward less junk in space  less lags for everyonemy support
we already discussed this with ccp they think this situation is undesirableconcord not protecting offline poses was discussed as well as hacking
no one remember why the capacity of cyno jumping from high sec to low sec was removedescaping concord is not allowed being capable of cyno jumping from high sec was allowing that i doubt ccp will make it possible again
if you want to check out if youve encountered certain peoplecorpsalliances before youll have to manually search the whole combat log which doesnt update all the info first time you open the page either why not have a simple search function so you can check on name corp alliance or whatever you wantsure you could post all kms on a killboard and search there but this shouldnt be neccesary im proposing a simple search function doesnt have to be fancy in any way as long as it does its job
my what a good idea i think ill support this

i find it frustrating to have to warp out of an exploration site for one reason or another and then return only to find it completely goneif i go afk for an hour i can understand if i warp out rep up a bit then find the site completely barren after having been away for less than a minute thats ridiculous and needs to be fixed

gravimetric and unknown sites and i believe ladar disappear eithera 72 hours  time until downtime after the first warpin orb when fully mined outclearedmagnetometric and radar sites disappear after you warp out only if you hack one of cans firstgiven that magnetometric and radar sites are both intentionally very easy combatwise id say its fine id more look into your ship fitting
for me they do not disappear properly namely mag and anomaly sites
i think someone made a greasemonkey script to do just that 1 sec ill look for itcaod cleaneredit to make it work you need to change the urls at the start to be

its just sad that it has come so far that someone actually made a tool for that
apparently the mods agree with you since they apparently arent bothering
solution is simple  allow thread posters to moderate their own threadsif a troll makes his own thread  thus allowing other trolls to post then that is handled by ccp mods
caods always been pretty bad but since ccp kicked crc to the curb its been a sewer
maybe the share fluctuations could be based on fw happenings
thats an interesting thought in fw news there is an announcement related to this colonists flock to wartorn sectorreported by isd aberlaine tepis  20090403 181359saisio  amid stillraging hostilies between militia forces caldari interests are looking forward to harvesting the riches of the black rise region kaalakiota lai dai and other megacorporations within the state announced largescale projects last week followed by equally determined independent ventures so if we secure the space help our corporations to settle down they might reward us with stocks  or at least their stock price could rise apart from that militia corporation stocks and their profits could rise the more systems are occupied by the militia only problem i see here is that the opposite faction could buy those stock and then lose on purpose in order to make a profit like in those boxing movies
i can speak to the buying out of shares the way many corps in the real world do it is they have reserve shares or shares that are worth more voting rights than others different classes hence they never make more that 50 control available for buyingin this case an npc corp could make 49 of the shares open for purchase and retain 51 accordingly somebody could become a major investor but actual control would never be lost
yeah i support this people in ships with activated covert ops cloaks shouldnt show up in local unless they talk
there is currently a thread in fi about the black ops

this just in admiral iceblocks real csm portraitthe real iceblock
if every 00 region is worth made up figure 100bn a month it doesnt really matter whether that value is from ratting or moon minerals or mining or whatever it still removes an incentive to compete for a particular regionthe current war in delve and querious is a good example  nobody in their right mind would simply abandon all the regions that goonswarm previously occupied in the south east in order to occupy delve let alone drop geminate and scalding pass as we did last year if every region had the same value the fact that delve is one of the crown jewels of 00 and worth as much as 4 or 5 other regions combined is one of the major catalysts behind that conflict and for that matter having that wealth concentrated into a small area is probably the key reason why bob was a major power in the last 3 years or so
ill have to disagree this war is because of bob not because of delve being superiori am not saying that every region should be worth the same but every 00 region should be better than anything in empire space at least diverity and uniqeness should be applied to all the regions just random idea out of my arse different agent missions in each region more agents more difference in ore larger difference in moon materials larger difference in system looks larger difference in complexes etc etc a lot could be done to make each and every region in eve truly unique and better than empire spacefor example take a high security agent starsystem it can host and support hundreds of players doing lvl4 agents making isk most 00 regions can not host and support hundreds of players making isk
a man for the real working classyou sir have my vote
i really like this idea one viable way to do this would be to allow ships to carry more pods or pilots internally cruiser 2 bc 3 bs 4 and so forth but anyhow yeh the idea of using corpses as a raw material is a good one only problem is its quite easy to create corpses perhaps the materials gained from a corpse could be based on the sp and the cost of implants installed
i like that it gives extra incentive to find out whos wearing what implants killing vets would thus become more profitable than killing useless alts and newbies
you good sir have both my vote and my forum signature
lets please keep this on track i am not here to hijack this thread and i dont intend on helping anyone else do so eitherthe bottom line is issler represents a point of view which many people appreciate she opened up this thread to suggestions and discussions attacking her for not defining specifics at this point seems counter productive to her own currently defined goals of open discussion
yes there is grab a few friends in smartbombing bs and go and disco them you still have the tools at your disposal ccp made things harder for the casual ganker but if youre determined then you can deal with itedit i will add that without these brave legions of chinamen and southern cross alliance members we would probably see a spike in the cost of pos and cap fuel which may or may not be a good thing currently ice mining is not worth it for real people and if you eliminate macrosfarmers then there might not be the slack in the production chain to keep supply going at even a reasonable level for some time like it or not a lot of us dont like these farmers but right now we probably need them i would say the bigger threat to the economy is the mass number of farmer ravens in mission hubs throughout new eden
im a bit meh about this proposal although i do probably around 80 of my fighting on gates taking sentries i still believe that you shouldnt be able to engage with small ships in order to give the little guy or the wily player a chance to get away by all means scale down the dps for sub 04 systems but by no means should it be scaled up

lavista wanted it noted that just because ccp burnt their fingers on the recent issue it doesnt justify the need to change something as fundamental as what ccp is suggesting to him it is clear that this is a move to compensate for a mistake that was made nobody asked for it and it is a bad ideaomber was worried that with the ability to change names exploiting names could be possibleccp xhagen wanted to bring the discussion back to discussing the internal exception that was sent to csm to look at he wanted to know if that rule was considered fairthe internal rulewe have had an unofficial rule that we will change names less than a week old since quite many players come out of the charactercorporationalliance creation process with a misspelled name secondly regarding the possibility of a renaming feature this discussion was to see what the reaction to it would be there has been no technical feasibility tests done if the csm thought it was a good thing they can move on to seeing if it is possibletusko was worried about the reputation side of things people keep name and shame type lists and he is afraid that if people or organizations can change their names at will it will be extremely difficult to track he would only allow name changes for very new entities maybe in the first week or so but not later on maybe also the possibility of allowing changes to people that have lost names due to policiesissler didnt think there should be a time limit or other criteria something tied to a fee makes more sense a good idea for a name today could be something horrible in the future as an idea why not do it in way similar to the real world where there is a public notice about itomber thought that if the internal rule was made an official rule he would be happy with the naming policy as isvuk wanted grimmi to answer his question about who was responsible for the name changeankhe echoed vuks request and also noted that having name changes available for everyone an example given was traded charactersgm grimmi answered that the change was debated for a long time and was then decided by the lead gm as well as many others it was not a unanimous decisionissler wanted to know why ccp still didnt understand that they cant just do things like this involving bob the csm exists largely to keep things like that happeningtusko wanted to know that if they a consensus among the gms why they backed off so easilyankhe answered issler that bob doesnt deserve special treatment in a negative way either she also noted that the backflip was the most damaging aspect of this and wanted to know why it happenedextreme wanted to stress that the policy should be kept simple or people wouldnt understand itomber wanted to know what the basis was for changing the name in the first place as it seemed to go against both the public and internal naming policygm grimmi responded that three really wasnt much more to say than what was said on the forums it was a human error that proves once again that assumption is the mother of all fupsomber wanted it to be made clear that the gms as a group decided that they should ignore their naming policy and then thought there would be no backlashcontinued next post
a small off topic discussion followed about what is and isnt game mechanicsccp xhagen noted that what they were trying to say is that a mistake was made with the renaming a mistake that was corrected for better or worse he felt that from the discussion that the naming policy is good following it is now the important part he also thinks that csm could forsee a name changing mechanism within eve however it would always keep a public record of those changes he wanted to know if ccp should move forward in assessing whether it was technically possible to do thisthe csm generally agreed to ccp seeing if it was technically possibleand because ccp xhagen asked and hes scarythis is a check of technicality nothing has been decided about actually implementing anything2 right click  repair

ask oppenheimer how he felt about exploring the technicality of a thing essentially this idea would devastate part of what makes eve online unique that being identity in a single server environmenti am hawkblade i am not hawkblade server8 or hawkblade server42 i am not sometimes hawkblade but also known as honestscammerguy1205 nor am i anything but the toon known as hawkbladeeve has enough troubles with alt neurosis and the rampant paranoia that has spread from it is it not enough alreadyi could be coy but im not going to be this is a very very bad and clueless idea dumb evenps im actually shar tegral add that to the confusion of the matter and youll start to get an idea of how bad this further destruction of identity may damage eve online
regarding the name changei support being able to change names 100 but so would you if you had my name i honestly selected this name in an attempt to mock the person who suggested i start playing the game and then i got hooked now i am stuck with this ridiculous namei would gladly pay into an isk faucet or even us to be able to change my name im not trying to obfuscate anything and support an identy tracking system but this shame is a heavy burden to bear
this was a topic that generated considerable support especially in the rp community it was discussed with ccp on several occasions and ccps response was that alliances would be allowed into fw in some form probably by allowing individual corps to join fw without leaving their alliance and that this issue would be addressed in the first quarter of 2009its now april  and assuming ive not missed an anouncement somewhere ccp seems to have entirely forgotten this issue and as near as i can tell so has the csm this is incredibly disappointing to those of us who actually care about the backstory of eve and are interested in the rp potential of the mmorpgdont let this issue die
i havent forgottenbut its ccp that said its the first thing we put in empyrean age 11err sorry not 11 well later this year okayyes well patch it into quantum risewe got the game mechanics sorted wont be long january 2009 itll be inright were busy with apocrypha but please wait a little longer q1 2009 promisei personally asked them about this in iceland and they were like uhhh  yes we still have to do that too but we really have more important things to do and dont care about itthen again i dont see why you guys want to join fw in the deplorable state it is in but mehedit with q1 2009 expired ive raised this issue for the third time
moved to  assembly hall 
because theyre rpersmeh supporting just because ccp said they would and it doesnt matter to me
yes yes yes yes yes yes yesyes
i agree here maybe it wouldnt have been a good idea to let alliances in at the beginning when we had like double the numbers in militias compared to today 8k in the caldari militia at one point for example in a time where our militia was having 150 man fleets on a daily basis the whole region was sufficiently populated there were enough targets and fights at any given time during the daytoday the activity is only a fraction of that an increase in participants would benefit everyone i dont see a reason anymore to deny alliances entering this roleplaying aspect of eve they cant use their titans doomsdays to erase militia fleets nor are capital fleets particularly suitable for plexing or dynamic lowsec fights as they are roleplayers this could have a positive effect on the plexing instead since capturing systems determines who wins the war in the region wed have some more legitimate plexing wars going on compared to only pvp and the attitude that plexing doesnt mean anything when nonroleplayers dominate the scene
i disagree with the adding alliances to fw idea all i can ever see is super alliances just coming in and steamrolling everyone for lols also we dont need another place for these alliances to have their warzones the lag is bad enough lets face it fw is supposed to be the stepping stone before going into 00 it shouldnt be the other way no support isaac
ccp plans to add a pretty hefty standing requirement to entry thus just steamrolling over things for lolz wouldnt be easy this feature would be mostly intended for roleplaying alliances cva ushrakhan etc
if this is the case then thumbs up
well as long as ccp wants this to be a vote then ill add my vote in favoras to the questions raised above if the goons wanted to mess with fw they could do so at any time with or without this change and while i cant think of any other megaalliances that would care this goes for them toothe alliances that might care include for example ushrakhan em vv cva and other like us we want to participate in fw not because the mechanics are great they arent and dramatically so but because we enjoy the rp of eve and have involved ourselves in the faction war lowercased since before faction war was even thought of by the devs and despite the fact that the largest proponents of the faction war concept were these same rp alliances ccp in their wisdom locked us out of fw thus making a mechanic that had a great deal of potential into little more than a means for legitimizing piracy oh and a new sort of complex that nobody cares about except for the handful of diehard rpers who left alliances to pursue our rp wari realize that fw has a great many weaknesses and i wish i believed that ccp was motivated to work on improving it even so its unreasonable to lock rpers out of the mechanics designed to reflect the rp war
i would love to see this being possible for those alliances who have a long history of supporting one empire or the other to be able to show their support in this way
continuing to support this very important topic the arguments have been made the suggestions have been raised to ccp in csm 1  ccp have accepted the principle and promised to implement this for faction warfare it was also highlighted as something that is vital for the continued health and growth of the faction warfare concept at fanfest round tables last november this is no longer a question of debating the principle  its about asking ccp to do what they have the technical capability of implementing right now we were told at fanfest that the technical fix is ready to go and just requires a simple implementation to rollout lets make it so
sure while i think the organizational options character corp alliance should be looked at and depth added fx character corp megacorp alliancefaction coalition allowing the player alliances that have been fighting faction based wars since their forming to take part in the part of the game designed for it just makes sense

supported
i am definitely for the idea even if i think that some of the details need to be ironed out as with the raising concord standings they used to have agents a long time ago but to many pirates would standings back up quickly with concord the other thing i would like to see is a greater distribution of 00 agents throughout their own factionalso right now the jove like both minmatar and caldari while disliking amarrgallente so if they were to get a storyline agent it would kill two birds with one stone

up you go after a month of slumber
ankhe while the minutes still havent been released where the fk are they xhagen you brought this issue up with ccp in the last meting and they told you it was still in the list of things to do what part of raising this issue again for the 3rd time do you think you are going to accomplish ccp know about this its on their list and you are wasting both their time and ours bringing this issue up againsorry if that sounds a little harsh but as we have a limited amount of time in the next meeting id rather spend it on issues that they dont already know about
could make fw more lively lets see
this topic has my support
supporting this once more
if its as simple as hey guys you promised to do this last time and we were told the technical fix was already designed and just needed to be implemented  well how about implementing it already then its not going to waste much of anyones time how about you schedule this issue on the agenda as a request for a status update and timescale commitment now apocrypha is out of the way and released it must be time for this essential change to make it into coming soon patchwell delivery of promises is important too you know id count it a personal favour from you omber if you can make sure this issue doesnt get forgotten about and ccp keep getting reminded to implement this every meeting up to the point it gets donesometimes you have to push
exactly what jade saidit wouldnt take more than a minute of ccps precious time if they just gave us a status update the last one we got was in januari and the new meeting is scheduled for may  thats four months later if were lucky it will already have been implemented before the meeting if not well then wed better remind them
supporting an important topic
im not on the csm and have no great insight into its inner workings however its nearing a year since fw was implemented and i think about a half year since ccp said that they would address it early 2009 the rp community has been actively agitating for this for closer to a year and a half ever since we were asked to playtest the early prototype  before we were told wed be locked out of the final version of course and really even longer than that since fw as a highlevel concept has been floated for a number of years and the rp community has been pushing the concept since before ccp began laying plansso at the risk of sounding harsh i think we have a right to be just a bit impatient  and given that ccp has given every sign that they are trying very hard to forget about this issue i dont see why the minute spent asking for an updated eta would be a waste of time
you say issue like its a problem there is a very specific reason why alliance are not allowed to join faction warfare that would be like an alliance within an alliance all it would take is one 00 power block to join and the opposite faction has no hope of ever winning anymore the whole idea of faction warfare was to bring pvp to the empire based players who want to ease into pvp allowing alliance to join faction warfare would break that aspect of the game completelyone of the worst suggestions ever brought forwardvoting a giant hell noif you really wanted to get involved then join one giant corp i believe they can hold over two thousand members so stop being lazy if its something you really want to do
spoken as someone whos thought very little on the subject nor read any of the many threads that were posted and that had already decided this issuetell me what do you believe would motivate your hypothetical 00 power block to abandon their holdings to chase complexes in fw space ill answer for you nothing at all if the goons for example wanted to hot drop a capital fleet in to blast noobs in t1 frigates  well whats stopping them as is nothing at all what advantage to joining fw would push them into forcing their entire membership to run missions for months just to get the standings required to do so the vast untold wealth that is showered on every member of the militia the stupendous fame enjoyed by being a part of the few the proud the militia to my knowledge fw is hemorraging active players which makes me wonder just how significant a draw it isunless of course you give a flying excrement about the backstory of eve as we rpers do i understand that the concept of rp in an mmorpg is wildly unpopular with the gankbear crowd but its still an interest to a number of people most of whom are in a relative handful of rp alliances and all of whom were in effect told by ccp to dissolve their alliances or kiss offoh and anyone who thinks that the one giant corp option is feasible has clearly never been in even a small alliance suggest to the alliance formerly known as bob that they should reform into a single corp and see what sort of response you get
yes thank youwe should completely do away with the entire clone system you see its antiquated and silly and requires you to keep track of something that should be done automaticallyall the keeping of clones does is hamper pilots who want to get back in the game anyway so heres my solution if you die in the game you never ever revive seriously you have to start all over make a whole new character clones are freaking dumb anyway and who wants to bother docking for 30 seconds and spending an incredibly insignificant sum to insure against the loss of skills you downloaded anywayam i right supported screw clonesim off to go cry in a corner
not supported
id actually support this it would certainly change the nature of pvp in subtle yet significant ways
supportedi think the scaling should be fixed and i think ships size should be made more obvious it is annoying to me when people think the merlin window is a cockpit window meant for one frigates can hold 25100 people if im not mistaken the only thing that are single person things are fighters eve ships are big and i wish they reflected that more
supported i had written a wall of text about why but windows accadently the whole ting
id be for this if instead of making things bigger ccp instead just made everything subcapital smaller in my mind it makes more sense that one frigate would take up no space coming out of a station but say a titan would be almost the same size the other issue is if ccp remakes the size of everything then lots mission might need to be tweaked depending on how the ships are changed
reviving this with the idea of bombers not stealth bombers not some long range fighter size drone but an actual bomber flies to the target high alpha good for one shot before it has to redock with the msor at least orbit it to simulate reloading and specializes in killing bs or larger obviously the refresh time wouldnt be anything fantastic but the high alpha would make it significantly different from fighters
fully agree
after doing research on minny caps ive pretty much xed out the nag from my training cause theres no point and that is not a good thing however its not that hard to get a permatank eitheror from remotes and cap reps on the nid and im looking forward to playing around with one in game halfassed minmatar ships dont surprise me too much lolthe nag certainly needs work

absolutely not supported whats the downside to the current setup wasted pixels i cannot understand how this is an issue on any level
if only we could have custom filters so if there is a certain personcorpalliance you dont want spamming up the place then you can turn it on and violacoad is in fact turning into goonswarmforumcomnot saying this because i dislike them but because its the truth it is almost impossible to get anything out of it these days without having to scroll thru dozens of goon spam to find an ounce of somethign worthy to read

currently the only way to detect probes combat with the directional scanner is have the use overview settings box unchecked as there is no overview setting for probesthis wasnt a huge issue before the last patch as you could filter out most stuff poses etc by reducing the scan range however the last patch added wrecks and containers when running a exploration site or mission the directional scan now quickly gets swamped with wrecks and probes can easily be missed currectly im popping anything im not interested in to avoid the clutterso im suggesting a probe category be added to the overview settings so that we can filter out wrecks containers poses etc and still be able to tell if we are getting scanned down
wrecks and containers have shown up on the directional scanner for a loooooong time they were just missing when apocrypha went live which was fixed this is nothing new it was new that they were missing for a week doesnt change much about your request of course
it is pretty stupid to wade through all the stuff on the directional scan when what interest you are only the probes supported
ive wanted this for a whileat the very least id like to be able to use letters on the keyboard to skip to the first item in the list beginning with that letter
supported drones need much much loving have been needing it for some time 
agreed
more stuff to make the background interesting is a good thing
more background that is not a colored nebula si good
i like
good idea
eeek dont shoot my drugs muleactually would make smuggling more interesting so im in favour of both parts of your idea one problem with the cargo scanner idea though is standard practice for smuggling involves using a fast aligning ship like a frig and warping manually to 0 at every gate so you probably arent going to get the time to lock and scan
sounds fun d
dunno if this is a good idea or an epic fail but it just came to me one day ive heard a little about the walking in stations thing and yer it might be pretty cool but another little idea which night work i dunno would be to walk around certain ships certain being a new brand of transport ships which could be npc or player flyed instead of warping massive distances sometimes to go and pick something up or setting on autopilot which is horrible anyways lol a new idea could be to have to pay a small fee to be taken aboard these new transport ships and taken to your destination players could take on the idea as a way to make a little isk like what you see in star wars where anakin is accompanying the queen back to naboo if thats how you spell it p and there sitting on the ships having a drink maybe that kinda thing could be introduced as a way to furtur boost the walking around thing and maybe say the ship is going through low sec then the on board people have to get to escape pods or something and then are launced into their pods to make an escape i dunno just a thought that might be worth posting 
i doubt the gaim would gain anything valuable from that concept i am sure it would cost a lot of developer time though that makes it a lossloss dealthat is only about walking on shipsnow what you suggest is more than that you suggest more or less inhabited transports who has any need or use for something like that when was the last time that youve seen large clouds of pods flying from a to b with the players complaining how it would be so much more fun if they could see their avatar during that time instead of just the pod never happens people go from a to b with their ships and unless they are in a fleet they will rarely agree on what a and b actually is so this would have no use at all
not sure if anyone has mentioned unanchoring drones yetyes they havent been added but they are in the databaseand while there are a great many items on the database that arent added to the game yet take a look at your overview settings theres actually a block to display unanchoring drones specifically
supported for hacking of offline poss it should require hacking 5 though and take a very long time think about half an hour maybe implement an advanced codebreaker for hacking poss and make it have a 5 minute cycle time with about a 10 chance of success once hacked the pos would then display an unanchor option only to the person who hacked it and this would take the normal time
wallhax
if anything an offline pos should not have its x million shield hitpoints
i like this idea one thumb up
reason and purpose were given in the thread if you do not see them you have not read the thread and are just being contraryif you disagree with them you should contribute your opinion instead of doing what you dida lot of things in the game exist as attempts to balance the players instead of the game itself not allowing this among other things is ccp trying to herd the players instead of work on the game thus i support this
oh wow okay apparently i need to learn how to read yes i am in favour of this

whats your take on the results so far in regards to what the csm has accomplished in this are
the shootable modules and manable guns are a huge improvement but theres still the issue of only being able to online one module at a time which makes all the logistics people want to shoot themselves in the face i understand its there to prevent instant deathstars but just increasing the onlining time of modules or else add a wait period between onlining the tower and being able to anchor more then one thing at a time would be a much more fun solution to the same balancing problem girls in station

the war itself is because of bob sure but the delve gamble goonswarm abandoning the south east completely to take delve for themselves would be absurd if it wasnt for the fact that delve has the moon mineral worth and high quality ratting space of several regions combined most likely if delve was just another region wed have treated it much as we did geminate in the smash smash campaign  gone in obliterated their capyards and towers handed the region over to whoever wanted it and gone back home to feythabolisplus separating bob and delve as causes of the war is not so simple delves vastly superior wealth compared to most other regions is a big part of what made bob into the power they were in the first place on this part i pretty much agree 00 should be the arena of high risk high reward and the fact that many of its regions are little better than highsec is something that should be fixed as soon as possible my feelings are that the better way to approach this would be to reduce the value of highsec by which i mostly mean l4s but im sceptical that ccp is prepared to stand up to the storm of criticism this would attract from the legions of mission farmers

ankhe while the minutes still havent been released where the fk are they xhagen you brought this issue up with ccp in the last meting and they told you it was still in the list of things to do what part of raising this issue again for the 3rd time do you think you are going to accomplish ccp know about this its on their list and you are wasting both their time and ours bringing this issue up againsorry if that sounds a little harsh but as we have a limited amount of time in the next meeting id rather spend it on issues that they dont already know about
could make fw more lively lets see
this topic has my support
supporting this once more
if its as simple as hey guys you promised to do this last time and we were told the technical fix was already designed and just needed to be implemented  well how about implementing it already then its not going to waste much of anyones time how about you schedule this issue on the agenda as a request for a status update and timescale commitment now apocrypha is out of the way and released it must be time for this essential change to make it into coming soon patchwell delivery of promises is important too you know id count it a personal favour from you omber if you can make sure this issue doesnt get forgotten about and ccp keep getting reminded to implement this every meeting up to the point it gets donesometimes you have to push
exactly what jade saidit wouldnt take more than a minute of ccps precious time if they just gave us a status update the last one we got was in januari and the new meeting is scheduled for may  thats four months later if were lucky it will already have been implemented before the meeting if not well then wed better remind them

yeah it seems odd that everyones highest faction standing should also be one thats virtually impossible to work for sure this sounds intentional  standings to everyone means that they probably wont ever get one this sounds like a lot of work to fix then  youll need to give them a custom lp store probably complete with new faction items you know of anyone desperate to work sct agents and the fluff ive seen on them makes me think theyre not the type to start handing out missions anyways the jove have a storyline agent ore should pick up a pile of mining agents  its agents in other fields are fine but this is a faction that should be built for crazy people who want to run l4 mining missions in 00 agreed yeah thats a bit extreme ive got a solution to this in another thread that i think would help with this problem specifically and some others generically basically create an epic arc for each factionpossibly just each important faction that lets you recover standings up even from 10 concord standing  sec status if you want to raise your concord standing rat you mean in terms of piratefaction ships or in terms of standings the former is nifty but unlikely the latter should already exist id think im for all of these and while i dont agree with everything youve said i agree with enough of it to support this
bump best pos idea in the game imo
has this been taken to ccp by the csmsi looked at the csm wiki and do not see any mention of it perhaps i am missing itwould be a big let down if a 24 page thread that has been opened for a while now seems to be overlooked by the csms
supported
the reason i said no was because it might make it too easy to get extremely high standings with all factionsill run some further calculations on this
you are incorrect and have somewhat missed the boat on the discussion ccp already agreed with csm1 to implement this after we carried the request from an overwhelming proportion of respondants across the rp and fw communities no militias are not alliances they are designed that way with intention wont happen or they wont really be a 00 power block anymore and if it did happen so what this is eve this is the giant political sandbox and such things should be able to potentially happen its against the ethos of the game to railoff and deny involvement to players interested in faction warfare and affairs of npc empiresin any case this issue has already been successfully escalated and presented to ccp during csm1 and we are simply awaiting the implementation promised by ccp
also toss in that gaining occupancy should bring about rewards and hurt the losing factionmake it mean something
this needs to be done
yes please do it just do it
i agree completely there have been a number of fine issues set forth involving improvements to fw including redesigning complexes so that the best tactic involves one or two frigates making occupancy more meaningful in terms of actual game effects adding a system of rewards in such a way that allows the militia to fund itself while pursuing fw goal yet doesnt draw farmers fixing the badly broken complex spawning mechanicsno doubt there are other ideas slipping my mind but theres a few improving fw is a worthy cause  but one that is seperate from this one and will likely require a bit more thought to do right this issue is far more straightforward to fix ccp has indicated that it could require as little as removing an inhibit that currently prevents corps that are in alliances to join fw under the same conditions that must be met by every other corp joining
ive personally raised all of those things some of which repeatedlylarge document has been handed over to ccp a month after fw was released which covered most things then there were two general issues with fw improvements and roundtables at fanfest where the same things were repeated in january we had another of those discussions and recently ive sent an urgent mail about the complex spawning due to the gallentecaldari event againive just brought up the alliance problem for the third time was also mentioned in july 2008 just to indicaterewards and career sustainability was one of the core problems with fwccp is aware of this all and you can see how high a priority fw has fw was the issue i worked hardest for unfortunately my time is almost over vote erik finnegan if you want to continue the strugglenow lets not discuss this further
like making pvp nonexistent
been an idea ive been toying with posting for a while might need a couple of other tweaks to make work but im not entirely certain how things worksimply put add the corp ticker of the trader to the visible parts of the buy and sell orderi believe it could potentially add a little bit more depth to the market trading instead of simply going to the lowest or highest order the reputation of the corp involved might play a part on a buyer or sellers choice this in turn adds the potential for actual advertising or similarcould also add a potential economic impetus for war decs if you can see who the competition is more easily why not wardec the guy cutting heavily into your profits
no it will then create issues with the market as people wont buy from goonscvabobwhoever because they hate them currently market keeps it quiet it also will prevents griefers from attacking corporations due to market activity it will also drastically change the market as it is and just make t2 go up because lets face it t2 is controlled by the super alliancesno support isaac
only if people value their principleshow much they hate super alliances over their isk and how much they want t2 gear rather than t1 the ability to make the choice adds depth to the market i cant see it changing that much the old adage beggars cannot be choosers springs to mindthat was somewhat the point why not jazz it up a bit and create a little bit more interaction with the rest of the corp gamein what sense surely they can tell who is online via local and scans should they wishin fact the name of anyone you buy or sell from turns up in your corp wallet so you can potentially do this anyway if you have isk to burn
why the megathron i buy from one corpperson is the exact same as the one i buy from someone else if they were customized then sure i could see thistraders already purchase 1 unit of the item to determine the seller most people simply use npc corps as the trader thoughi had an idea a long time ago about the ability to tie market orders to standings ie price an item higher to someone that you dont like and give discounts to your allies or even get into trade embargoes i think this could add a whole dimension to the game and take wars to a whole new level but as it is i doubt that it would have any effect as everyone is only looking at the roi  and therefore would probably be complex for ccp to implement and would not be usedi dont see harm in your idea but the points you bring up in support of it i dont agree with either yet
some people might choose to not buy from bobcvagoonssome people might recognise the corp as an ally of the cide ganker that did for their last cnrsome people might not want to buy from an fw corp so as to not support one of the sidesmaybe the buy order was set up by a corp they are at war with and in fact quite possibly consists of the components of their last ship lossa corp someone is at war with might make a good deal of money trading a certain item so undercut them maybe at a loss maybe the economic impact it has upon your wallet is less than the one upon theirslarge scale pvpwar comes down to economics you cripple your opponents ability to buy ships and you winno way round npc corps at current i just dont really see why the identity cannot be known before the purchase is made rather than just after thanks for reading regardless
i support this product andor service
yeah
that would be because nobody posts anything decent to read in the first placehth
and this is the reason from the mittani  ceo of goonswarm written on tentonhammercomit is also possible to ruin a propaganda vector to the point that any hostile messages are lost in the static years ago the primary eve forum was unequivocally dominated by band of brothers and their allied entities until goonswarm ditched the aforementioned forum ban and proceeded to deliberately drag the level of discourse down to that of a flailing mentally deficient fiveyearold the entire outlet was delegitimated and band of brothers lost their dominance amidst a torrent of much like your posting jokes and z0r chainsany battle reports written by bob or anyone else that goons did not care for were intentionally spammed with useless crap therefore intentionally killing the forumyou are correct the forum contains no useful information anymore if its not pro goons it gets spammed to hell it went from we are better then you we killed xxx ships to your mom sucks kablaaaammoooo fofofofofofofof etc with not one bit of useful information

this is missing for a very good reason if you could scan for probes in particular then it would be ridiculously easy to avoid getting caught it would be obvious if you were getting probed down and now that it takes more than 30 seconds to probe someone down it would simply be too easy to escape
want
i like this idea tooas a newb player when i do the missions and get a deadspace encounter theres often floating wrecks or stations and things i always cruise around and take a look because well cos they look so awesomewould be nice to see nonwrecks also around the stations and stuff  adds a bit of reality to the world helps in the immersion into the game

just posting to say ive lost 3mil worth of drones yet again to a dcits a pity devs would more like to see us all squirm and suffer rather than spend five goddamn minutes to implement something as simple as giving drones a return to dronebay order on dcor is this a featurerageedit i feel a ton better now actually edit2 never mind 6mil in drones now cmon 5 dcs in a row someone tell the gms to stop kicking me from the server pretty pleaseedit3 6i find it very odd that im losing connection to the server yet i can still viewpost on the forumsedit4 8 i give up already

voting for mazz because she is evil and has a vagina crew checking in
mazz is a horrible griefer and a bad person you should not vote for her or she will only push the griefer agenda
is this a history question i am pretty sure hardly anything has happened to poses due to the csm this link says assembly arrays got buffed
let me ask another question how much of what the csm has done so far on the possov area have you actually followedits pretty clear that you havent followed it at all i tried to make my questions so bloody obvious that they were almost screaming out the answer alas you did by no means even show that you knew the first thing about the csmif an elected member of the csm has no idea what the previous csms has been doing then they are useless
you have my votes
if you dont vote for mazz you hate your country and betray your troopsalso lavistavistavistastop harassing girls on the internets
1we support her because she has shown us noodz you too can see them once she gets on csmpromise
i am pretty sure recalling past csm actions from memory isnt a function of the csm
i am pretty sure that actually knowing wtf is going on is a function of the csmseeing you clearly havent got much of a clue what the csm has done so far on the subject despite how much i tried to hint at it do you really think that you are the ideal candidate when theres other candidates who actually did their homework before they signed up
knowing what was going on  knowing what is going on
one needs to know the past in order to understand the present
confirming ill vote for someone that doesnt have a clue about the importance of continuityhave you followed what happened after the handover from csm1 to csm2 what have you learned from that yeey lets all be clueless and totally waste the first two months of your term reading up what the hell has happened and how the whole process worksneither is using proper capitalising and punctuation but it sure is quite handy if you want to be taken seriously
all you people who want to run for csm better make sure you know everything there is to know about what has happened with the csm in the past or you are uselessmaz gets my vote btwalso do you have a vagina romale
confirming my vote will go to mazzilliu easily is the best person for the job
this looks a lot like a troll
throwing my bow in
just want to know when will you fix motherships
1 vote for awesomeness on all counts
yes we can
oh sweet jesus it was a jokeall you had to do was snicker not go all wikipedia quoting
minor attention topics will need to beget sponsored by the csm within the csm councili or the sponsoring csm will have to convince the council to get his minor attention topic voted through the councilones voted through the council will present the topic to ccp ccp wil then will seriously investigate the topic and give it priority
do you realize that if you do get elected you will have to work together with these people who are just in it to stroke their epeenmaking a mockery out of the csm is just lame
maybe because were paying customers and would like to thats a pretty legitimate reasonno nobody speaks for everybody sorry to disappoint you the way to do this is that if a player changes their name to something else all previous names are associated with them if you search for any of the names current or previous you will find the correct person along with a list of their names and when they were changedto handle the issue of corps and alliances keeping kos lists and the like ccp could keep a running list of name changes available via the api so those who develop these lists can accommodate name changes and still keep their lists accurate or at least as accurate as they were beforeto deny all eve players this ability because it makes background checks a little harder for the handful of big corporations is silly and before you argue that there are lots of corps doing this how many corps do you think there are that recruit multiple people per day there arent that many compared to the overall number of playersnot to mention anyone who does serious background checks asks for the limited api info and all previous names would clearly be marked there its not like you could easily hide from your past actions simply because you changed your namefinally if we can change our bodies and faces why not our names seems a bit oddin the end it comes down to the convenience of the many outweighs the inconvenience of the few
you are incorrect and have somewhat missed the boat on the discussion ccp already agreed with csm1 to implement this after we carried the request from an overwhelming proportion of respondants across the rp and fw communities no militias are not alliances they are designed that way with intention wont happen or they wont really be a 00 power block anymore and if it did happen so what this is eve this is the giant political sandbox and such things should be able to potentially happen its against the ethos of the game to railoff and deny involvement to players interested in faction warfare and affairs of npc empiresin any case this issue has already been successfully escalated and presented to ccp during csm1 and we are simply awaiting the implementation promised by ccp
also toss in that gaining occupancy should bring about rewards and hurt the losing factionmake it mean something
this needs to be done
yes please do it just do it
i agree completely there have been a number of fine issues set forth involving improvements to fw including redesigning complexes so that the best tactic involves one or two frigates making occupancy more meaningful in terms of actual game effects adding a system of rewards in such a way that allows the militia to fund itself while pursuing fw goal yet doesnt draw farmers fixing the badly broken complex spawning mechanicsno doubt there are other ideas slipping my mind but theres a few improving fw is a worthy cause  but one that is seperate from this one and will likely require a bit more thought to do right this issue is far more straightforward to fix ccp has indicated that it could require as little as removing an inhibit that currently prevents corps that are in alliances to join fw under the same conditions that must be met by every other corp joining
ive personally raised all of those things some of which repeatedlylarge document has been handed over to ccp a month after fw was released which covered most things then there were two general issues with fw improvements and roundtables at fanfest where the same things were repeated in january we had another of those discussions and recently ive sent an urgent mail about the complex spawning due to the gallentecaldari event againive just brought up the alliance problem for the third time was also mentioned in july 2008 just to indicaterewards and career sustainability was one of the core problems with fwccp is aware of this all and you can see how high a priority fw has fw was the issue i worked hardest for unfortunately my time is almost over vote erik finnegan if you want to continue the strugglenow lets not discuss this further
i was away from eve for a couple of months and came back to find the jumpdrive effect had been completely nerfed a capital jump was the single most awesome effect in the game before this happened the reactions of new players seeing one for the first time were always priceless i cant believe anyone thought the new effect was betterbring it back

this is not a tangible in game benefit what your asking is utterly ridiculous and your comparison is illogical thats like one guy saying to his mayorleaderpresidentprime ministercelebrity whatever hey buddy can i take a picture with youthen the other mocks him and says why not just ask for a seat in the cabinet and 100000 dollars while your at it ing favorismit is utterly differentin addition putting it in high sec chribba loses the titan understand this while in high sec it cannot be used for jump bridges dds anything it remains there forever he loses any tangible in game benefit of having a titan a exhumer could mine better and permatank the rats anyway how the hell is that beneficialback in the day and sometimes still now players appear in the news a congratulations for something or some event this will be the same i expect if this happens a news article from amarrian royalty will probably praise chribba for his titan and his great contribution to amarrian industrial might god bless chribba etcbut as i said he loses the titan gone as good as blown up for all the use it is it becomes nothing more than a curiosity and a peace of eve lore where as now its a tactical asset and a major one to boot
you dont quite get this forum you have to look at the supports not the pages 170 supports after 705 replies you losealso 170 players and their alts dont represent the majority of the caldari players its not the missiles that suck its you and  or your skills  ingame 
and most of those support votes come from clueless missionrunners and are fairly worthless
majority of missionrunners is still running missions in their missionrunnerravens
yeah 170 supports after all these pages is not nearly enough missile nerf was needed end of storyisaac
i do agree that missles should be balanced vs other weapon systemsthe key is to look not at positives or negatives but raw dps in as identicle of situations skill sets gear levels etc as far as gunslasersdronesmisseles goit would be nice to see someone crunch alot of math for all these things and figure out the raw dps each weapon system provides on bs vs bs vs cru vs fri etcbtw 170 does not represent all of eve yes but they do represent the vocal part not too many people post or pay attention to the csmmy policy is for every vocal member there is 1050 people who never ever post but think the same thing as that memberas for number of supports vs posts it just shows that their has been a lot of discussion and argument on the topic it does not mean people dont like it they just post and talk more in it

simply displaying the ticker would be a bit of work for not really much gain however the previously proposed idea of sliding prices with standing is what i really like it would add 4 numbers to a market order and require a bit of calcs when sorting the market prices but i think it would be worth it thats what the new ramsans are for anyways 4 new numbers to market ordersmin standingmax standingmin standing pricemax standing pricethe standings are the lister  filler standings the price slides linearly between min and max
these ideas would ruin the highly effective market we haveso thats a no
i personally think adding these in addition would potentially be rather clunky to implement and might well actually seriously damageaffect the balance of the marketselling is effectively automated buying requires actual input from the player and in my honest opinion choices are best made when the player is online and at his keyboard doing something rather than automated by the database in the background
the corp ticker wouldnt acomplish much but other ideas would be good such ascorp only markets  as to only buy from or allow to sell to corp members instead of the annoying contract systemalliance only markets  sames as above but w alliancesell to xx standing and above enables one to sell to only people of your likingjust a thought
this
that is the point that isnt an issue that is a disliked megacorp hiding behind the fact that its name isnt attached to its products basically your argument is that people should be forced to shop at walmart because it is the cheapest even if they dont like walmarts policiesso the fact that a superalliance might have to drop their prices to make up for the fact a large  of their potential customer base dislikes them is going to raise prices on t2lavista vista how about some dicussion on how you think it will ruin what you think is a highly effective market systemi think it would strengthen the market system players might become more inclined to buy from an actual player corporation rather than npc corporation player making the move to a player corporation beneficial it would lead to more pew pew as corporations fight to drive up competitors prices and lower their own it would improve the game and the negative effects of having your name attached to your product would be a good thingif i dont want to buy goon products because i dont like their general philosophy and am ok with spending a bit more on a cva or mm product why shouldnt i be able to see that in a quick look at the market versus having to purchase 1 unit from all the market orders to determine it
well if you dont trust me
dude get a clue thats all im saying this is a freeform market place contracts allow you to buy stuff with full knowledge of who your buying it from why do we need to put it into the market place this allows people to sell their stuff without any bias what your proposing is to allow tycoons to form in the market place this isnt needed we dont need more griefers attacking corporations to drive up competitors prices thats silly and quite honestly will ruin the marketthis is unsupported for a reason use contracts end of storyisaac

agreedi spend a lot of time staring at my mining barge and that brown and gold is ugly  i hate earth tonesit would be great to be able to pick alternate color schemes
already brought to csm once and rejected
it is a frequently suggested idea and it is always considered a pretty low priority in the past i would have agreed its not worth it but now that so many items on the grid are loaded dynamically after it is up and running it might work okay i dont agree with much more than a single accent color selection would basically end up just being like the paint stripes on caldari ships and such plus the corp logo should be standard changing the basic color of the ship i believe would remove a lot of the UFFFDberness from the tech 2 ship appearanceto sum it up i support load accent color and corp logo dynamically as serverclient load permits limit customization to accent color just for some flavor ability to choose nonecorpalliance logo to be displayed on ship
not supported it is a great idea but current tools and battle models do not allow for such changes to occur just yet if ccp gaves us tools to identify which ships in system are actually piloted and which ones are friendly  hostile then yes scanning atm is already boring and annoying enough i certainly dont fell like doing more of it and not to mention that it would make ratting  plexing  minning in 00 nearly impossible as well as too stressful in anticipation of a waiting attackto put it simply more things would have to change then just the local chat to implement thisthumbs down

i agree that an overhaul is in order as a member of a new corp that is about a year old we have been war decd seven times so far it has always been about isk a demand always comes 2 to three days into the war dec do you remember as a new player struggling to make that first million isk well it is the same for new corps if eve is to maintain its player base this part of the game needs to be balanced 2 million to declare war how about 2 million per corp member this will encourage new players to get in corps and encourage corps to actively recruit with the better run corps having more members high sec is where new players learn skills a safe harbor with the threat of several larger fish the current war dec system let the sharks in to the bay and the small fish have no where to go except to leave the gamecome on lets get this fixed
no actually you shouldntunless you think that i should be able to buy stuff that you sell and the base mineral price listed in the database perhaps in which case im fine with it if i cant pvp your ship then you cant pvp my wallet
toss this in with the stealth bomber changes give us something good too make up for something bad
sounds fantastic
would be a nice feature though i would hope they would make the black market trading skill come back into the game and have it work both for npc and player scans also some low slot smuggler holds would be nice decrease cargo volume for decreased scanability
nice idea
more npc interaction opportunities 0also those finding contraband gain standing with the faction whose high sec system it is
nice idea i like it on initial reading at least
300 is a ridiculous amount for pilots flying under nrds fully support the request

op horrible idea stop postinghowever i almost like this idea it would need a lot of refinement but its a good start
i think that would take way too much time besides the jovian technology for getting out of your pod has not been developed fully yet however not a bad idea there are parts in the eve book that tell of a captain in a pod looking at displays of what is happening inside the ship as well as communicating with crew members i would love to see ship interiors especially my megathron but i really dont need to walk about the ship i can control via my mind and it would be hella risky to do so in flight as the backstory says you can only be a demigod in your pod so your mind will be transmitted to your cloan if your ship explodes with you in the cargo pit sorry but your gonethe chronicles and eve book tell of a ships crew that work inside the vessel also so every time you explode you kill people so even screen shots of ship interiors would be challenging as it cant show people working onboard i propose instead having a link on the ships info to screen shots of interior spaces after the ship has been built for example the oasis of the seas cruise ship in usa fl online are screen shots of interior and construction one set will work for every pilots ship of that type and could be available onlinefor everyone to see

i would just like an automatic recall on warp when a warp command is issues have it set the drones to return to drone bay if they make it you get them back if they dont oh well at least its there some times this would work on dc as well by allowing the drones a chance to get back on your emergency warp

so if the program lasts long enough you want them all to turn into csm bureaucrat historians and nothing more logic defeats you bbbbooooossssssshhhhhhhhand there for
logic defeats you too because your logic suxthe csm4 doesnt have to know exactly what csm1 did because its irelevant to their job most likelyhowever with the csm3 csm1 is still relevant because they raised issues which are relevant to what csm3 will be doingfor instance the candidate in this thread wants to talk about pos however we already discussed that on the csm and theres a solution coming up as a result of thatthus its crucial that candidates knows what has been going on for the last years time its extremely obvious who has done their homework and who hasnt dont be one of those guysgirls who havent done their homework
in my humble opinion it the onus of passing knowledge should be on the out going csm part of the job upon exiting if you willto many bureaucratic monstrosities are made from people who concentrate only on what the government before them didi would even venture to say that whatever csm1 talked about matters little at all as its been a year and pos warfare is still the same old grind that it was when you took office and nothing changed after the fact if every csm were to address pos warfare maybe ccp would finally get the picture that it literally is worse than masturbating with a cheese grater
irrelevant in other words what youre saying is that a valid csm candidate should necessarily be aligned to one of the former delegates which in the end will just create csm parties something already happening with the carebearaligned block creating a political oligarchy instead of getting new voices and opinions heardthe socalled problem mentioned by you can be solved by just reading the current documentation and logs left by the csm something im sure mazz will have plenty of time to do in case shes elected or do you expect her or any other new candidate to spend hours reading inane irc logs just to please a eveo forum celebrity
i think it is very important that the experience and work of ankhesentapemkah will be passed on so to speak not long ego i have written a rather complex proposal which would introduce a kind of player controlled lawenforcement system in lowsec by adding both story line and pvp experience while creating more security for lowsec industry etc at the time i knew little about ccps approach to player proposals and initiatives however after a few conversations with ankhe i realized how complex and challenging is the process of introducing even the best of ideas not because ccp is closed to good ideas but because the best and most creative ones require a lot of development work and careful prioritization therefore player proposals can only be taken in small steps this is why continuity of csm ideas is so crucial i realized that the take care partys views are often not so popular with the hardcore pvp players and they are often dismissed as a carebear party regardless our differences as to what the eve experience is all about their effort and dedication to represent different play styles and not their own subjective views is something to be respected if not admired of course the idea of player party automatically implies a certain amount of partiality nevertheless i believe that understanding the importance of a careful compromise and openmindedness is ultimately one of the take care partys strongest attributes which i think they share with the game developers on the surface ccp may seem rather conservative it is only natural that they want to protect their faithful customers however if you watch their leaders and their speeches one can clearly see that at heart they are bold visionaries not afraid of venturing into the unknown slowly but surely this game will evolve into many new directions regardless of what some of the hard core players sayit is my believe that the success of the whole csm concept will ultimately depend on their ability to listen to both players and ccp only in that way their proposals can be balanced so far the record is good and lets hope that it continues this way and not too much politics enters our partiesthank you ankhe for a job well doneenough said erik you will definitely have my vote

if you want to take down a pos or conquer a system you need dreads  tytans can dd and bridge ships around  carrier is used for repairing the pos and using fighters mothershipwell can slightly better perform the same tasks as carrierwith two carriers you can do a better job than with mothership for 112 of the price plus you have the ability to dock to the station give them some sort of a special bonus that would make them much more differentbetter that a regular carrier much better or different than it is nowpeople will stop using them if nothing is going to change they are already dramaticaly loosing popularity

at present this proposal will do nothing but frustrate people and make people spend too much for items this seems to be a littleknown fact but it is literally impossible for you to buy from any order other than the cheapest the game mechanics simply will not allow it you can pay extra but the person getting the money is the one who posted the lowest sell order your proposal is useless  or worse a trap for the unwary  would cause insane lag and wouldnt really solve any problems thats not intended to be harsh mind you i understand why this proposal was made and why it appeals to people but it is a proposal rooted in ignorance it simply doesnt work in eve
which should be changedperformance will be drastically impacted if they display the name and change the broken mechanic of matching any buy order to the lowest sell order regardless of the price paid are they talking about serverdatabase performance the performance of how much is bought and sold it is already loading the buysell orders add another column of informationmy corporation does and was looking forward to storefronts but that was canceled and doesnt appear to be coming backtycoons can already exist in the unbias market place as those with money quickly purchase those underbidding them if they want to maintain a monopoly there is no reason that a monopoly should not exist in eve and likely regional monopolies existit isnt griefing they are playing part of the game and already do so to some extent as a basic example indy a hires merc 1 to attack indy b its local competition indy b hires merc 2 to help defend it cutting into either its profits or causing it to raise its prices a prolonged war may actually also effect indy a especially if the link is determined or merc 1 starts charging moreso perhaps the csm should address getting the functionality into contracts so that they are easy to search and use for everyone such that it actually competes with the marketeither way the basic point is thisindividuals corporations and alliances sell products in eve either via the market or the contract system individuals corporations and alliances have ingame reputations which might cause some consumers to not buy from or sell to them not necessarily linked to their market presence or performance in the market system there is no means to determine the seller before you buy and even if you try to buy from a particular seller you are forced to purchase it from the lowest sellerthis is neither an open or free market system but something else entirelyif ccp wants to protect a market system that simplifies to basic supply  demand so be it but this issue will continue to come up
you already made your own point moot
but this is the place to make the point even if ccp and the csm are going to ignore it
i realize why you are asking this however if people want to support a certain corporation over another then corporations can sell viacontracts i see no reason why a corp cannot do this to add the ticker to the market will ruin the economy and not allow corpsindividuals to sell quietly so until you give me a concrete reason to add a feature that is already in contracts to the market i wont support this idea and neither will many othersisaac

all it needs now is a csm with the balls to take the matter up to ccp in a meeting
pink thorax nah we got that already d
thats the whole point though  we shouldnt instantly know every ship in system who is in it how old they are thier employement history and whether they are friendly or hostile its absolutely awesome in a wspace system when you first pick up and unkown ship on scanner and you have to try to figure out who they are if they have also spotted you and whether they are friend or foe its far more realisticimmersive and has a deep space feel that is lacking when the local window automatically gives you an attendance roster of everyone in system
somehow i think that removing local will hurt the little guy the mostthe mega alliances are the ones that can afford dedicated scout accounts and have the possibility to create big intel systemsthe multi account players can place their iskgenerating chars in empire space and keep their pvpers in 00 like they do now and the few that get their isk from moons wont really care either wayits the alliance grunts and small time players with shock 1 account that actually lives in 00 based on ratting income that will get hurt especially if they are in smaller alliances

with ccp declaring cosmos dead and the epic mission arc system as replacement perhaps it would be nice to have some agents that require dogtags effects and wormhole materials in return for a standing gain or some loyalty pointsthe problem with these items is that there are npc buy orders on the market for them which is an isk faucet in case of the dogtags some handins are broken and give less standing than they should plus they can only be handed in once overseer effects just translates into iskthere should be a player demand for these items and alternative rewards upon handing them in than just plain isk being pumped into the economysome special lp shop would be nice in case of the wh stuff with some items useful to rd and production orientated characters but that is probably too much to ask for datacenterlike agents that award standing with rd corps in case of wh stuff and some lp and faction standing in case of tags and effects might be more realisticadvantage of the epic mission arc system is that the missions can be made repeatable with an x month delay of course creating continuous player demand for these items it might also be yet another way to repair pirate faction standing
in another discussion that is an old one that will continue to arise it was pointed out that ccp would prefer rather than changing the market improvements should be made to the contract system the csm will submit suggestions for this in a future meetingwell an improvement to the contract system that we got to glimpse prior to qr coming to tq was storefronts they however did not get introduced on tq and appear to have fallen by the way sidestorefronts provided an opportunity for corporations to do a number of things more effectively than is currently possible1  brandingyes a raven is a raven is a raven but that doesnt mean playerscharacters dont have a preference of raven construction inc over indyalt123 of sak  even if they are the same price on a larger scale players may have a preference of not buying finished goods from one of the major 00 power blocs and would prefer to fund their competitors ie dont like bob buy from goons or vice a versa2  packagingcontracts allow for more than just single items to be sold and a new market could arise where corporations package together items commonly used together whether this is a particularly effective setup for a mission raven with modules required or all the fuel required for a certain pos to stay on for a week this provides the opportunity for product variance between corporations be it a kestrel with t1 fittings versus a kestrel with named fittings or a navy mega with t2 fit versus faction fit3  consumer choicethis is related to both the above by providing consumers other players with a choice when they are buying goods and who gets the money the current market system most players likely do not try to use the contracts system forces people to buy from the lowest bidder even if it is someone they would rather not support removing choice from the consumerthis was all from the basic functionality we had all of a week to experiment with and does not include such possibilities as integration with igb to allow for player created webpages linking to their stores standings based sales shutting out those you dont like from buying from you secondary player industries related to advertisingso the basic question is when will we see storefronts on tqrequires igb to be fixed so that it doesnt take 5 minutes to load a page may create a second issue concerning igb
and i of course support it
wrong forum your not suggesting anything your asking a question aimed at devs please visit features and ideas discussionisaac
storefronts are related to wis qr did not have walking in stations so it does not have storefronts
so you are saying that trying to get ccp to introduce to tq a mechanic they have worked on and presented on sisi should not be put to the csm which is supposed to address player concerns to ccpthe csm is a means to bring to ccp the devs attention a concern we players have it is not a features  idea they have already demonstrated the feature  idea based on your comment this forum should be dissolved and everything moved to features and ideas one of the threadnaughts in this forum is for ccp to address something in the features  ideas forumi am suggesting that ccp revisit qr storefronts and develop them furtheri am guessing you dont support them addressing ithalf right storefronts as an extension of the current contract system were in an early qr build released to sisi they were later remove i am asking for the csm to bring it to ccps attention and something to raise on their priority of things to do
not sure if ill support raising an issue but ill ask around to see if i can find out more
me approves 300 is way too small
why is it so hard for you people to understand thisit is incredibly relevent to follow a previous csms work because they have extremely limited facetime with ccp running on a platform to do something which was already brought forward to ccp and is in the pipeline not only demonstrates a csm candidate who is wasting ccps time but also shows the unintelligence of those who voted that representative ineither do some homework or run solely on the vote for me im female platform from the looks of this thread you have a pretty good chance either way
its painfully obvious that you havent read a single bit eitherfirst of all we dont use ircsecond the meetings which matter theres no logs for afaik theres 5 pdf files which people should read thats not including the original csm paper which describes how the csm worksif you havent even followed what the csm has been doing even if they were crosslinked in general discussion for an extended period of time then you are wasting peoples timeand if you are running on a platform which is totally obsolete already then its evident that you havent done your homework either
edit  this post is mostly directed at lavistafresh minds fresh thoughtsat this stage of the race its more about what a candidate can bring to the table and less of how technically qualified a person isif you want to parallel your thought and standpoint to the real world you are saying that academics should be the people making choices and that industry should follow their lead the abstraction of towards knowledge vs practicality is extremely important in this case just because you have spent 9000 hours reading forums documents and talking to previous members does not make you any better of a candidate than someone like mazz it almost certainly makes you worse off  as you have a lot more preconceived ideas thoughts on others and an elitist complex like it or not thats exactly how you come offexpecting people commenting on threads to have also read procedural documents before commenting in a thread  why should you expect people to potentially waste 1030 minutes of their life to make a comment this is exactly what csm are not meant to be about i consider my self a good voter i however have never seen one of these linked threads you are speaking about why because in reality a small portion of the player base cares to continually read the forums i am in this general population and you are doing a bad job of identifying with usfor players by players if i can rephrase the razerinterplay mottos  something the csm and a lot of candidates are failing to take to heart players need to identify with you to do this requires good communicationsee  tldr the concept that you are missing you talk of pdfs and threads  but how many players are you communicating with the csm have completely failed to engage players for the most part  we know very little of the developments within or what you are actually doing when not in a meeting how would you address this though i know you will have already disagreed mentally lavista  you might ask why its because i have read your posts and realized you are quite arrogant and inflexible note how reading things has coloured my picture of youin short  dont look like a jackass elitist because you spend a lot of time reading forums and think it somehow makes you entitled to a place on the csm
id tend to agree but when the csm thus far has pushed hard for a new sovpos system and then a person who has no idea about this progress so far comes and wants to the exact same then its a damn waste there needs to be continuity thats because what we do eventually reaches a meeting everything that is done is brought up to a meeting and then passed onto ccpgranted theres lots of playercommunication however the csm has historically not been intrusive in that regards theres a channel where people hang out and talk to us for instancewe cant engage players who dont want to be engaged if we did we would be accused of trying to relevant when we supposedly arenthow we need to spread the word of the csm i talk to people really regularly who never heard of the csm yet are really interested we are working with the wiki team to make things more transparent so that things are easier to find we had a sticky with the latest ccpcsm minutes where we had a full a4 page worth of the future of the sov system in the general discussion forum for instanceim not entitled to a place on the csm because i have been on the csm for a year nowbut i think that in order for you to be entitled to a place on the csm you should have read the minutes from the major meetings thats really no big deal its a small pdf you need to read every 2 months im sorry if you think thats unreasonable to expect but the csm isnt a right its a privilege we have built up so much trust with ccp now that if a whole new council take over and screw up because they didnt do their homework then theres people who has spend a year on the csm who then suddenly have had all that time wasted because of these peoplei can obviously see why you find that extremely elitist and it is to a degree such is politics eventually theres going to be a lot of people whos put their trust in you if you dont even want to put in a small amount of time in advance of you getting elected then you arent fit for the job chances are that you are going to spend at very least 2 hours each sunday on sitting in a meeting thats not even mentioning the people whos going to be convoing you all the time as a result of you being on the csmthe csm isnt a free holiday its hard workpoliticians in real life has to know history too exact same thing goes in eve if you dont know the history of things then you arent fit for the job
so what you took 3 posts to say trying to make mazzilliu look foolish and be an arrogant  was do your homework could have been that easy eh i know maz and she will do her homework and is the kind of person that i would like to see on the csm
im not at all if that was my aim id have done it right off the bati really hoped that for once she would be a candidate who would have done a bit of homework i tried to at least make her read up on what i thought was important for her to know of but that didnt work
there is such a thing as being too serious ankh heck im only running for the free trip to iceland my primary csm agenda is to sleep with as many luscious icelandic women as possible ill frankly be surprised if i attend the csm meeting sober seeing as my mighty canadian dollars will buy a good deal of drink in the shattered icelandic economymazzilliu if i werent running id vote for you perhaps we should form a political party to counter the rising carebear voice of reason powerbloc i propose we call it the call to war party edit my first choice was chainsaw hate party but my political advisor suggested it might not fly with certain demographics
girls with aks are hot 1 for mazz
once again mostly for lavistaso besides not answering the questions  which you pretty much confirmed everything said firstly lets address a key problem you seem to be suffering fromq what would you do about global warminga yesthe above example shows how with simple rules of logic and linguistics the answer falls outside of the domain of applicable replies and is such nonsense when conducting interviews getting feedback or doing research this is a very important thing to look for as it indicates that a person is either not listening to the question or unable to understand it both of which are fair or that they dont have an answer have no opinion on the matter or feel you are probing for a specific answer in the latter case you would have to conclude that the question has not been answered at all  generally bad however sometimes grey so take some times and actually answer the questionssecondly engagement occurs betweem two parties i like examples so here goes im sure you have been in a class or series of lectures where an educator has been unable to engage the class and just conducts hisher performance at the front hoping that you are watching and writing down notes etc then im sure you have had the opposite where an educator has actually engaged and intergrated the classes feedback and while you may not have taken as many notes or stared at the board for as much time you absorbed much more and actually didnt wish you were somewhere else during that time the first is an example of what the csm in its current state is  passive sure you interact with the few people that give an idea but the majority of the class is bored and uninterestedexpecting people to be interested is a design flaw in a resturant your food is not made and then left in the kitchen for you to wander in and find sure after 2 hours you might go busting into the back and find your cold food but by a large margin the resturant would have failed instead they have waitronshow pc of me the faces ands voices of the service different in your case as you have to be less in your face but since the internet offers many different waysmediumslastly you say that the csm has done all this fantastic work on talking to ccp about changes to the pos grind etc in your post and then you go and mention how even a candidate has no clue about it see what im getting at if not read this post againonce again sorry for having to dump this in your thread mazz but i think these concepts and questions are quite important
its like asking how the world started and then expecting a clear answeri see what you are saying but the question thus far has been of a such nature that there is no definite answer just ideasi disagree with the example in a class you are there because of the teacher in the csm only a small minority careshow we can catch the interest of players at large is always a topic for discussion theres a few things which i understand are being worked on in order to address that exact problem but once again theres no definitive answer as for how to fix it the csm cant be intrusive in its approach and thats the fundamental problem the average joe has no clue about the csmas for why you seem to claim that the majority of the class is bored and uninterested well sure a few vocal people have expressed to me their dislike of the csm but im yet to hear from an average joe who could explain why he was bored or uninterested guess whythats exactly why we are always working towards making the csm more visible however it relies a lot on ccp to actually reach out to the average person because the csm as an entity cant do that within reasoni know its vague however theres really not much more to it government entities are always working towards stopping global warming but because of the nature of what is being done its not possible to go out and not seem vague thats just how it is im afraidwell the information and the concept has been widely available for over 2 months if the members of the csm had the csm as a fulltime job then i might have agreed entirely with you but we are volunteers theres a limit to what we can do within reason
you are completely missing the pointalso i really do hope you never answer questions like that during a job interview
what else exactly annoys you i was told to troll you because you are supposed to be an easy target so i think ill refrain from saying that this campaign has just started that i wrote the op in 5 minutes and havent yet had the time to throw out all the points that have already been covered and rejectedbut i will say that you seem to be so wrapped up in bureaucracy that you forget the point of the csm is to fix broken game mechanics getting the average guy interested in it does jack  really its too bad that i dont have your support though it really meant a lot to me that i could get the lavista vista seal of approval and these posts you have been making on the internet are really hurting my self esteem however since you have already been on the csm for two rounds surely you will support my desire to remove term limitsalso since youve been there so long what are the odds i can get ccp to buy my return ticket a couple days later so i can see the countrysidesigned a real life girlplease visit your user settings to reenable images
you and i we must band together and push through issues like the ability to set all entities in eve red by defaultthis helps with station taxes and the entire removal of concordthe only way to defeat the menace of carebearism is through violent revolution i propose burning haulers on the jita undock as a symbolic protest
well my best advice would be to skim trough this and get a sense of what the csm has been doing of importance during the last 4 months the first few issues are the one that is about your fields of interest i see your point but i disagree the csm wont work without the support from the average eve citizen if the average joe isnt involved the csm will become a way for the elite to influence the development of the game the term limit could be damaging in the long run due to the a decreasing amount of candidates as result of the most active candidates having spend their termshowever i couldnt run again for another 3 years anyways but i support the idea of raising the term limit or maybe make a rule that you can only do 2 consecutive terms that should mix it up a biti guess youd have to pay for the extra night at hotels
this isnt real life who are the elite in eve its the people that play the game the most they know what ways the game is broken in the best the average joe are only involved in the process up to the point the candidates are elected beyond that they cant really do anything except offer suggestions the candidates can accept or ignore as they pleasethats like 2 us dollars right i can cope
yeah 88 usdnight
how many stars thats pretty good if its 4 or more
a vote for mazzilliu is a vote against isk farmers also with her unique diplomatic experience and flawless diplomatic style i feel she will be perfect for the csm mazzilliu 09
vuk vuk vukso far all the info from csm is good and response from ccp is great keep up the good work vukso please try to get momi ships a role that is worth all those bills 
hello fellow candidate i come to you with a proposalit is now clear that our opponents in this upcoming senate are allying together into a carebear political party to strengthen their cause to maintain the balance of terror in eve online we who hear the call of blessed grief must also band together into a cruel triad in order to push through our vile agenda what say you
voting for awesomeness and also just to see how the csm turns out with you in it
thanks for your vote i hope many others will realise how important it is and will put their votes on me
the gauntlet has been cast down carebear i shall match the formation of your putrid party with a coalition of cruelty to undermine everything you dogooders strive toward let strife and division mark the dark age brought about by csm 3
nice to see someone who understands this i totally agree with the raven farmers
i agree at least have some kind of light show when capital ship jumps in

when he gets the titan all you need is a donkey load of probers working around the clock catching the moment where he gives the titan to his alt and loggs off in that moment you warp in on to of him pod him andor his alt and what you got there is a titan abandoned in space
whatever you say
supported mining barges dont do the dronescoop ballet very well
no drones and fighters should just automatically get warped into your drone bay when dcingif not scrambled
oh god then theres the drones that fly past your ship when recalled and go dead several km away at the very least recall mechanics need to be looked at
perhaps  an increase bonus to the number of deployed fighters from 3 to 8 per level plus increased bonus to deployed fighters damage from 5 to 10 per levelorif you reach lv5 carrier you can deploy additional 20 fightersit would be like some sort of specialization  like salvaging lv5 i know it looks like a massive increase but then that is how mothership should be like with those bonuses it would make sense to have few of them with you on those massive engagementsanywayi agree that motherships badly need some changes and like someone said in a post before me right now they do suckoh yea  one more thing isaac starstriker you seems to have some opinion about changing the motherships however so far i only read what you dissaprove or dont like about other people suggestions in that particular topic  how about for a change you give us some suggestions  because criticizing everyone elses ideas is an easy way to go but do not help to solve that problem at all
this can be said about any class shipthe mom is more like the t2 version off a carrier2 bss will take out a golem fitted right 2 cruisers will take out a t2 cruiser fitted right 2 frigs will take out a t2 frig fitted right in all cases you are looking at 15 too 125 of the price to out preform the more exspensive ship with more ships although i do agree that there should be some reason for bringing a mom although i dont agree that it should be cost effective to bring just like any other top of the line it would not be cost effective compared to bringing more pilots in cheaper ships
you have a point here but still it is a difference if that is 120 of 60mill or a 17b but like you said it is not about the price onlyit is rather silly to compare bs class of ships or frigates to capital class of ships i dont think you know much about supercaps production and im not saying that to discredit you here because not many players knows about it or even need to know about it to which ship would you then compare the tytan and dread class of ships look  to build a carrier you just need to be in some npc station in 04 system jump away from hi sec  not much stress you can find one 7j from jita  to build a mothership you need pos with capital ship assembley array that itself cost 18b plus what is far harder to achieve your need your ownalliance system with sov3 and if you are into alliance wars then you know how hard it is to get onethen try to transport the minerals thereand what you get for all that trouble a better carrierso you say cost effective part is not important here common pull yourself togetheri also think that mothership was not intend to be a t2 carrier welli agree with you it sort of is right now  well at least i would think it should have some more specialized role that would support the price tag and production effortalso what i think she meant is that even golem with its specific bonuses which are slightly different than normal bs can performe a more specialize roles in some parts of the game for example missionsright now i cannot figure out that specific role for a mothership thats all
this can be said about any class shipthe mom is more like the t2 version off a carrierwell how can u call a mothership t2 verion of carrier its a different class of ship  super capitali agree with my fellow corp m8 motherships should have a little bit more to say on the battlefield than so far it is sad that ccp didnt think about it yetthey love to nerf not to boost
i agree in principle but i cant support this without a concrete proposal of some sort also it ought to be noted that they do have some special things carriers dont get  immunity to ew the projected ecm burst and the clone bay namely they have things carriers dont those things just arent worth the cost of the hull at present
if your going to critique bother to do your research first or kindly leave
bob know people hate them because of they cheat so they use alt corpor alliances to do empire stuff as long as alt corps exists their is no points to put corp ticker on market
 what he saidalso if you want to do this use contractsthe fact that most of eve chooses to use the anonymous market demonstrates that nobody cares
in the real world those are called front companiesorganizations terrorist organized crime syndicates etc use them so if you want to hurt the main organization you will have to do some intelligence gathering to figure out where the front company is getting its goodsso it doesnt remove the point of having a corp ticker next to the market ordersome of us do use contracts to sell our products but we arent asking for this as a product provider but as consumermost of the population chooses to use the market vs contracts because it is currently easier to search moves more volume of goods and is what they are introduced to using to buy things in the first place the tutorial doesnt send you to the contract system to buy something it introduces you to the market it is hard for people to care about it if they dont even realize an alternative existas for it being anonymous this isnt true after you purchase something you know who you purchased it from it is possible to determine who is selling what given sufficient money and who is buying what so the anonymous component only exist until you have made your purchasea real life comparision could be buying a used car only thing is you purchase the car without knowing who it comes from an authorized resaler or some front for offloading stolen cars
updated1 add a jump bridge to motherships but limit it to subbcbs so ms could be used to deploy small gangs into enemy turf2 increase the sma bay size bigger than titans or just enough to fit a small gang of cruisersfrigates insidei just came up with this make them able to transport pods w clones insidebut it really isnt usefull if you have the jb on the mothershipsafter these changes ms jumps into a system bordering enemy territory or is near it inside it its carrying about 510 man gang pods and ships inside it it deploys the ships and the pods outside it people board their ship now cyno alt pops cyno and ms bridges the romaing gang inside enemy territory later this can be upgraded w a special ms module kinda like a triage module making it immobile and transforming it into a mobile base that bridges small gangs inside enemys bellyjust an idea really
ship bay size i do support idk why the titan has such an enormous onebut i do not agree with the jump bridge module keep it on the titan isaac
maybe even a jumb bridge than can only hold a specific number of ships another one available in an hour or soi already put my ideas in another similar topicone thing is for sure motherships are crying for change
sure why not this would reduce the number of titans in game which can only be a good thing
i think someone else also putted that topic into consideration
something does need to be done bring these beasts out of the epeen pos csma lockbox and out into the wild
the biggest imbalance with super caps is that they existi vote for the removal of super caps from the gameso not supported they are already so extremely overpowered and it is only a matter of time before any lowsec00 and wh fight will be in nothing smaller then a capital ship
the biggest imbalance with super caps is that they existi vote for the removal of super caps from the gameso not supported they are already so extremely overpowered and it is only a matter of time before any lowsec00 and wh fight will be in nothing smaller then a capital ship
they said they would look at naglfars in the upcoming capital review dont hold your breath they obviously have more important things to do like walking in stations and implementing ships that suck and no one will ever fly
while i dont feel the nid is as horrible as yorda does the remote armorshield bonus is nothing to sneeze at there is no logical reason to train for it in lieu of the thanatos i dont feel the last change increase from 5 to 10 remote rep is vitally needed but it would present a greater procon compared to the thanatos todaythe naglfars only plus in its favor is its appearance nothing else there may be other ways to fix it but the method proposed here is straightforward and retains the value of having trained both capital weapon systems this is a good approach
its called an overview  learn to use it
i want to place the frozen bodies i have in my hanger on my ships
then it can be brought againthis even more than ambulation is one of the greatest complains with the gamethe lack of any descernable visual customization of your ship kind of hurts the visual style of the game even allowing only a certain number of color variants dark ones for atmosphere or branding by corps just needs to be implemented it wouldnt impact server information too much as the visual data would be only slight variationsthis is a small little detail that would make a whole lot of difference

i support that logoff timers be readdressed however the op is a little excessive a solution i would like to see a simple increase to the timer and a correction of when aggro is received if received after logging you should have the 15 min timer not sure how to correct the multiple logon  logoff issuei have seen highly respected pvp alliances doing this its a little pathetic
stupid solutionthe only change should be to fix where you land when you log back in so that you will end at the gate when logging back in and you will have the 25 sec to lock scramble even if he instant log of again

for the last year or so there has been a serious problem with the value of various ores ores should move up in value as you go from mining in highsec to lowsec to 00 but lowsec ores do not fit this pattern at all right now using mineral base pricesthe prices which were originally used to balance the ore values highsec ores would be worth 60156 per m3 lowsec ores worth 168225 and 00 ores worth 200767 which creates a nice progression in value as you move to less secure space however using market prices highsec ores are worth 66126 lowsec ores are worth 5084 and 00 ores are worth 139410 highsec and 00 are still fine but lowsec is worth half of what it should be this can be fixed by making jaspet hemorphite and hedbergite better than veldspar by introducing new ores or even by doing both given that highsec and 00 both have 6 ores while lowsec only has 3 i believe that the best way to fix this would be to add three new ores to make lowsec mining better than highsec again heres a rough proposal for what these ores could look like subject to further balancing on ccps partore 1 2m3 500 units to refine 15000 trit 1000 mex 300 iso 100 nocx 10 mega  155 iskm3 market value234 baseore 2 2m3 500 units to refine 3000 trit 2500 pyer 2000 mex 20 mega  157 iskm3 market value254 baseore 3 2m3 500 units to refine 2500 trit 500 pyer 500 iso 250 nocx 50 zyd  153 iskm3 market value303 basethese ores are about 25 richer than veldspar at current prices and are still reasonable even if prices shift closer to base value in future this will hardly make lowsec mining the next flavour of the month but it will create a suitably increased level of reward for those who are willing to risk mining in lowsec and will hopefully help draw a few more people into lowsec

current problems with medals deleting a medal from your character sheet just makes it invisible and leads to annoying nag screens when the player changes the permission settings of all other medals player can never receive a deleted medal again corporation that awarded medal cannot make adjustments later if they made an error or want something changed then everyone will have to trash their old one and a new one will have to be made leading to a lot of clutteranything else youd like to see medalwiseability to award medals to non corp members and more ribbonsparts is already on the wishlist so no need to ask for that 
corporations cant delete botched medals either
minor but seems reasonable
no since you should not be able to pay your way around doing the missions
supported
id be interested to understand how much youd want to reduce the mission payouts in order to increase the value of effects etcdo you see these as replacing a significant part of the mission payouts and if so would mission runners really want to increase the variability on their payouts most are in it for steady and easy isk or are we just talking fluff scale
actually most of the players do not run missions that just give dogtags because of the immense standing hits you get with the opposing factionsmost tags come from ratting or factional warfareeffects come from plexesso why are we discussing mission payout this would provide more income and an alternative way to get standing for lowsec00 residents that might not like to run missions
wutlink to where this is stated please
one of the csmccp meetings read minutes not sure which onenow stay on topic please
im looking through your wiki and the forums here and im not seeing anything that says thisplease point me to the correct minutes
look im not going to waste time to look for it especially since this is extremely off topic you can quote me for it so why bother with the original onebasically what was said is that the cosmos system is outdated and with the new epic mission arc tools ccp developed it is much easier to add new content thus ccp will not expand on any type of cosmos missions but instead add new content through epic mission arcs
no need to get snippyyou want opinions on the topic fine but people have to know what youre on about before choosing to support or otherwise a proposalif youd included the sentence about introducing new content in your original post then that would have been greatbut instead you choose to attack someone asking for clarification on something you saidwhy should i support this now
yes i do understand gate camping happens but today i attempted three different wormholes in different systems in all three attempts i reappeared smack dab in the middle of a massive gate camp three for three now turns out im not the only one with wh gate camp horror stories to sharethis is wrong especially for a new advertised feature of the game meant for everyonei propose a change to wh space when going through a wormhole a player should reappear in a random location in the system fleets that enter together must regroup after traveling through a wormhole players must probe and scan down the entrance from which they came or another wormhole entirelywh gate camps can obviously still happen but it would no longer be at the entrances baring everyone looking to experience this new content
im sorry but ive done 10 wormholes and found 0 people cept my corp mates too much whining find a nonhighsec wormholeisaac
i am opposed having to probe the wh each time even if its still stable would be a big painthere are over 2000 wh systems trust me most entrances are not camped if a wh pops up in a major mission or trade hub during prime time then yeah it probably will be camped
op is a terrible whiner send a scout through first if youre worried about camps ffs
and while youre at it could you please just set it so i have to type pvp on before somebody can attack me thanksthis post may have contained hints of sarcasm
i just think this is wrong because it is supposed to be unknown space not just another 00 with changing gates point each day but ccp ed up the mechanic yet again and created thisonly thing they have to do to fix it is letting wh transport you to a random safe spot in the wh when you jump through that would mean no gate camps although they could still scan you down no prob but thats properly how it is supposed to be although it creates wh owners and make it just another 00 type space
you havent done any wh have youquite obviously you havent so why dont you stfuwh are market on the map when you jump through meaning you just drop the probes right on it making it take 10 seconds for you to probe it down uhhh what a extreme time to spend gr
there are already plenty of things in place to make hole camping ineffective you appear within 5km of the hole jump range in case you didnt know and the session change timer is less than the 30 second cloak unless you do something stupid its pretty much impossible to die to a hole campi jumped through one that knew i was coming there was a broadsword and three carriers waiting for me i just held the cloak and when it went down jumped back through simple no threat no fusswhats the problem the systems clearly occupied so you wouldnt want to try to explore there anyway
well i have and i think youre an  if you want to make a logical argument avoid the ad hominems and stay civil you little weasel we have enough bs proposals on here without you wandering in insultinghe is right there are over 2000 new systems added by wormholes and if youre simply going through high sec wormholes or wormholes in very crowded systems this is bound to happen use a scout even if its someone with a jump clone and a cheap frigatethere is absolutely no reason for your proposal this is a matter of bad fleet tactics
i do not want to have to scan my entrance wormhole down to find it because it throws me to some random location in the unknown system ive beent through quite a few wormholes now and have seen very very few other ships pirates are taking advantage of wormhole entrances from highsec now that you know this  plan accordingly wormhole space is for everyone just like 00 space is for everyone just because its open doesnt mean its safe
it is w space and is meant to be dangerous players camping them to kill you is part of the game hire some help to get you through bring friends or dont go in rather than complaining about the camp find a way around or through it instead of trying to ban the enterprising player from sitting there and waiting for you silver platters are no fun
whs expire over time camps have to be broken down and movedget a backbone
this i have no idea how somebody can manage to actually die to a wormhole camp
is ccp even considering or responding to any options for redesign have they even said ya were interested in looking into improving it or are they just brooming the dirt under the carpet and pretending that they never made a seriously poor mistake in creating this aspect of the game
these are the best of your suggestions ill add one more rewardothers have brought up the lack of a tangible reward to some of these plexes and the answer to that seems pretty obvious add rewards for taking systemswork out a simple value system based on where the system is its secstatus its resources and so forththere is a semirespectable payoff if the system is conquered but more importantly the militiamen that stay in that systems plexes guarding it and holding it could get payed a wageyou guys could work out the values but i think its a start there needs to be some actual reward for taking and holding systems like the bounty system for nuking npcs
hello all first off im not aware if this is not the case already or someone already came up with the idea so im gona shootwhy dont ccp give a free attribute remap for all characters traded for isk once the char is in posession of its new ownerthat would definately bring more satisfaction to some part of your customers and it might bring some extra income from those owning 2 acc if they decide to swap chars just to get the free remap we are in a financial crisis ayejust a thought  whats yours edit due my incompetence
that makes the attribute remap function essentially a paid service and puts eve into the situation whereby those with the most rl cash to spend can add yet another benefit to the existing ingame advantages that rl cash brings multiple accounts sell gtc for iskpaying money to circumvent game mechanics is not a good precedent to setif anything characters being sold should reveal when their next attribute remap would be via those skillsheet websites perhaps or the api and prices would change accordingly and it becomes a case for reimbursement if its not as advertisedso my thought is that its not a good idea
ehh gtcs  need you say more hey there i have a ton of rl cash i now have a fully officer fitted titan and i have playid the game 5 days ow wait in 10 days i will have my own mini fleet of 10 dreads 5 carriers and 2 titans  the chars to fly them 100where the  is it that you cant get all the advantage you need from the system as it is right nowif you want to use a fairness argument you need to remove charecter trading and gtc selling firstbut i dont support any of this hate it all there shouldnt be rl cash involved in the game okonomics so remove gtcs and char trading and the abillity to have alts since they all add up into the advantage of having more rl cash to push into the game not the amount of time spendt on the game alts would be okey if you only learned by actually playing but you learn all the time and people having 35 alts it just become silly
if it costs money like 20 to 30 bucks or something i dont have a problem with itif people make it too easy dont go there
unnerf my scanner1 bring back the right click and remove items on scanner from overview2 removed agree scanner is large enough as it is
yes for 1not sure about 2 that scanner window is big enough already
from the quick conversations about this that were had with a few ccp devs the effort required to bring this in in a actually functional state that was required was too much to get in at the time i believe its still in their we do want to do this we just need to figure out a good way to do so pile
lets drag this topic back up since it es me off so much and i just love the sound of carebears whinning the fact that this has even been put to multiple choice is absurd especially when ccp clearly states that noone owns the wreck as another poster put it in a separate forum if the wreck had any ownership at all it would be to the entity that lost the ship in the first place  but it doesnt heres ccp definition of the term wreck

agreed even if only transferring a character to a different account i approve of this idea
characters are already linked to a number in the database the charid translate this to the characters capsuleer license id in game social security number this never changes for the charactername can change all you wantafford right along with the portrait surface intel basic rep can thus be erased scammers thieves etc will benefit so the antiscamming method will have to adapt start tracking the characters cl id along with their known aliasesin the end it is not up to the players or the csm to make the decision beyond walking away from the game and not paying to play so in order to get it in front of the decision makers i support the csm presenting the idea to ccp

all the cool races have a titan standing aroundi mean  caladari minmatar and gallente blow anyways they dont need a titan
support
i know its been tossed around but this specific request is very reasonable and rational enough that im fairly certain that everyone can agreejoe pilot has minmatar industrial ship skill to be completed at level v very soonjoe pilot wants to train transport shipsjoe pilot cant train transport ship until he completes training his skillif the skill is in the queue and will complete it within 24 hours why the hell cant joe pilot inject the next skill in that same 24 hour window so he can immediately train that skill without losing timeif he changes skills the queue can throw an error window saying you got something in your queue blah blah blah tosses skill back into the item hanger baysurely this is something doable rightanother option is have the skill destroyed as a penaltytldr  give us the ability to injectqueue skills that meet prerequisite requirements within the 24 hour window of the skill queue
obviously i dig it
i argued against this proposal initially however it was not this specific yes you should be able to inject skills while training a prerequisite skill i would like a safeguard like if you inject it you then can no longer edit which skill is training until it has completed to avoid abusethats my thought  support
i prefer free injection but this is still better than the status quo if the watereddown version will pass then ill support it
thats why i said it would throw the book back in the item hanger of which it originated
how do you envision this being abused i dont see why it couldnt just be free injection any examples of potential abuse and what harm that abuse would cause that would outweigh the utility of the idea
yes something anything im tired of watching my ogre iis get shredded because i got discod and cant get back to them fast enough or over shoot them with my mwd or the all wonderful glitch where you are sitting 25m from them but eve is responding that they are 10km away
this would save so many drones after discoto prevent exploits make it so that only the last 5 drones you launched can be reconnected to this prevents people launching spare drones or alts supplying you with dronesmake abandoned drones or drones from corp mates tractorable to help clean the mess after battles
throwing my support to this rather than a monetary concern this is just more of an annoyance to have to deal with on top of the original annoyance of being disconnected
read what you wrote apologize and never come backthera are like 3 proposals about it put them all togetheryeap moms need some love
here we goreasoningmotherships need to have some sort of unique use currently to build a mothership you need a safe sov system csaa and parts lots of parts motherships run around 1720 billion isk due to the long process and massive amount of resources need to manufacture one let alone the blueprint copies or originals needed to complete the project you cant dock so a safe sov system where you can plant your garage pos is also a neccessity unless you have a mothership alt for it currently there isnt any real reason to justify fielding motherships except for the fact that you own one and its gathering dust this is a long dedicated investment whether it be by the manufacturer or someone who is purchasing one hopefully through chribbas service for safetyissuesim sure the first thing on everyones list when approaching the issues with motherships is that we dont want to see the invincible lowsec monsters they were before the introduction of hicsfighters need expanding in general motherships are not fielded into fights with cruisers and frigates primarily anti support is always a plus but motherships should have access to heavy hitters of some kind that would be effective on an enemy dread fleet but not on enemy support allowing the ms pilot to adapt to environmentkey questions that need answerswhat should a carrier be primarily used for lets define that should they be on the field to rep dreads and poses with a dash of antisupport in there okay so now we have a super capital carrier the mothership class should it be a better carrier or follow more of a supercap role as a mobile operations platformpersonally i vote for the fleet support role as a mobile station meaning a clone bay that functions more ship capacity defensive ability but not designed to be an offensive weapon still requiring an escort of support but at the same time able if prepared correctly to support its own support pilots either way motherships need to be worth their value at present theres no real justifiable reason to field a nyx over a thanatos or a wyvern over a chimera they currently both do the same job about as effectively but losing the carrier is something you can repeat about 20 times carrier 800milms 18bilwithout insurance before equaling the loss of the mothership

they badly need to upgraded
great idea
limited preset range of colors yescorp  alliance logo yesfree full paintjobs no
logo yespaint shop nobase color noheres why on base color many of the ships in eve t2 are specified but subtle hull modifications as well as their variation ishukone khanid etc even tho for the majority we rely on the type column and the scanner to identify ships seeing a redish thorax means hic seeing a black ferox means nighthawkalso any logo additionscolor changes should remain optional in the client ie if pilot a wants to see the ships based on what has come to be standard known associations heshe should be able to disable pilot bs black vulture from being black
im not sure the specifics are perfect but i like the general idea of the ddd proposal to make it more of a massive debilitating effect instead of just a giant smartbomb also i have been saying for a long time that motherships need to get an even larger sma and either the ability to have pilots dock for jump or rework the clone vat bay so they are a useful instrument for delivering pilots to the ms after a jump so they can board the ships in the sma and the no movement penalty while triaging also sounds nice
colorful posti suggest you just stick to no and spend more time thinking before you reactpersonally i agree but this should only be in npc areas where there is faction sovereignty doesnt make much sense to have this take place in territorial areaspiracy is a concern for sure but thats normal for eve
that would only cover half of the problem as it is most people are not stupid enough to log while they have aggro instead they either jump through a gate or warp around for 15 minutes to clear aggro then log when logging without aggro it needs to take a bit longer so someone who already has probes out and is hunting you has a chance to find you in time reading comprehension for teh winz the problem is not with logging off at a gate but rather at a safe spot
its still an idea and very fresh but i agree that the wardec needs some changes because imo it has no purpose anymoremake the war dec use the victory condition but only in low sec and zero sec only for high sec the war dec has to be agreed for both parties onlyso for low and zero sec since we got sovereignty system thing going on how about mixing it with the wardec systemthis is how it would work if you got sov in a system your pos or outpost or whatever needs fuel will cost less on a second note you would get upgrades to your pos just like the sov level with an outpostoptionaly no sov in a system anchored is allowed but fuel cost more since the upgrades improvements exist for output why not do it with posin other words if you want access to the ressource in that system at low cost of course since its more profitable you would need to setup a pos in there you would need sov in there to do so i know a couple of corps or alliances would kill to do that on the financial side it would make sense for the sov systemim pretty sure lots of corp would go wardec other corps in low sec since its more profitable to do soso that in place theres the victory condition very simple when you war dec a corp in low sec you put your conditions which will not be easy i suppose in order to win just like factional warfarewell the basic principe behind it you need to win multiple times in order to change sov to your corp or alliance just like fw for the victory conditions mhh not sure on that part but it must not be easyor way too hard could be dynamic though perhaps on number of corp members or such like the more members you have the more ships isk value or kills or pod kill you need to get or something although it should be in relation to the sov level of the system and number of members of defending corp or alliancelike i said dynamicfor high sec give them a break its already freakin boring in high sec anyway just missions mining and such all static liniar stuff isk can be made but not like low or zero sec so with that in mind both parties have to agree to fight seems fair if you stay in high just rot with your poor ship anywaythis would seems to be more balance that way if you ask meof course its just an idea it can be tweaked this one gives a whole new meaning to the word wardecpros goals objective based wardec system reward system upgrades low fuel costetccons no more war decing a corp or alliance in highsec since both have to agree less freedom cost more fuel or resource if you dont have sov in low sec and you got a pos in there
i support this 100 as well bump for corpmate
signedbut my problem with this is not the speed at which im in the station but rather the time to undock and dockits way too long unless im impatient either find a way to speed it up or let me speak to an agent whicle outside the station
bunyip has already put this on the agenda for next sunday
its a good idea
the restriction is extremely annoying but also necessary to preserve the role of the jump freighter maybe there is an alternative solution that solves both problems a while back they put in a check so that if you have one pilot with higher skill load up a ships hold then have another pilot get in the ship and can not hold all the cargo with his skills you can not enter warp perhaps something like this could be done with smas this way you can have a spare module or three that you find convenient to keep on hand in your ship and get it in the sma but if you try to fully load an iteron 5 with cargo once there is no pilot inside it will be overloaded and thus prevent the carrier from jumpingwarping with it in the sma
agreed there is no point whatsoever in using dsps now when cores are just as good and it is absolutely absurd that the faction variant is no betterthey should have fixed the horrible deviation to work properly so you could not get an accurate warp to even with 100 str rather than nerfing the str this would allow you to quickly identify what sites were there and approximately where they were before switching to cores
even if every ccp dev was uber rich in game it doesnt matter because there are many many many many many many many more players with loads of isk not to mention that the people that really swing the market generally only play the game for the market many of the players ive spoken with over the years in this area or profession of the game generally dont have much they can spend their isk on anyway you can only lose so many ships or sink so much isk into something before it becomes boringlook at eve as it stands even in my own situation isk is not difficult to save up especially if you know what kind of person you are as an example i fly hulks mackinaws orcas viators freighters ishtars and a kronos i understand that to be entertained in this game i do not need to have large amounts of isk but the way in which i make that isk needs to be varied or i begin to lose my mind get bored and play lessthis is all because i understand that 90 of eve is the process of making isk 10 of eve is spending that isk if you have unlimited isk everything loses its value and becomes stale and boring if you have the ability to fly every ship none feel like the right fit anymoreso all of this leads up toccp devs most likely do not cheat or act inappropriately because1 ia is watching this is a stated fact2 after t20 im sure ccp wont be very tolerant of any other shenanigans3 they would lose interest after a short period of timeever played a game enabled the god mode and then suddenly realized the game was no longer entertainingedit also eve is about the people you play with if you play by yourself all the time youre missing the majority of the game the best aspects of the game are done through team play be it pvp exploration manufacturing or anything isk does not equal good people to play the game with
theyre not allowed to do that or have any major roles in player corporations if they get caught the characters are deleted and theyre reprimandedso your whole scenario is extremely unlikely
the problem with ores atm is that there isnt a harmonious balance doing what you propose doesnt fix the problem it actually compounds it youre basing your statistics off a static price but by inflating the amount of isogen or nox mined youre actually making their price drop thus reducing your calculated profitswhat needs to happen is an increase in the rarity of ores like isogen nocxium and mexalon by reducing them by 20 30 40 in rocks this would ultimately create more demand due to their scarcity which would drive prices up more than the actual reduction in oresat the same time trit needs to be increased in these same rocks the problem with trit right now is that its supply is slightly higher than its demand by increasing trit by maybe 1020 in low sec rocks that currently already provide trit it would help rebalance this ore at a slightly lower price idealy trit needs to be trading closer to 3isk rather than its current 445isk keep in mind none of the low sec rocks spawn overly large quantities of trit in the first place its more a byproduct of mining for other oresnocx used to trade around 300isk per unit isogen around 120isk per unit you can see how theyve drastically devalued as of late
i have already talked with ccp about this during our first ccpcsm meeting in reykjavik theyre looking into how to make lowsec more appealing to industrialists as well as 00 space they tried to get it in the latest patch to accompany the prettier asteroids but it didnt make it with so much on their platesi expect the autumn patch to include this if they come to a good concensus but trust me when i say they are putting effort into solving this problem theyre probably also going to change the way mining works like they did with exploration for now its a wait and see kind of thing
youre making some pretty serious assumption about the scale of this new mining that i dont think are justified remember all mining combined makes up less than half of the mineral supply and lowsec will probably remain the least attractive place to mine even after these changes because it doesnt have the concord protections of highsec or the alliancespace protections and raw profit of 00 space this is designed to make life a bit easier for casual lowsec miners so that they can earn better money than highsec without having to scan out gneiss belts but i am under no impression that tens of thousands of pilots will flock to these ores and wreck the mineral market as for your concerns about mineral distribution in these rocks i think theyre rather unfounded the proposed ores have more trit in them than most other rockstheyd be 3 5 and 6 for trit concentration out of 18 and their isogen and nocxium levels are fairly low those markets may be weak but theyre not so weak that a lowsec isogen roid less than half as good as omber will crash the market youre right that the crash in midrange prices especially nocxium is what has led to this problem but i dont see any of these changes making that appreciably worse the goal is to make lowsec mining less dependent on high nocx prices not to crash those prices further even if they change the way that mining works valuem3 will still be the defining characteristic of how worthwhile a particular roid is to mine there are some ways to buff lowsec without changing those roids but they tend to involve putting 00 ores in lowsec instead also this proposal isnt intended to just be a list of three new asteroids  the goal is to make lowsec mining worthwhile by whatever means the suggestion for new rocks was a secondary part double the mineral content of lowsec rocks and ill probably be happy but this solution seemed better if they have already decided to fix the problem then this thread is just advice on how but if they havent then id like us to see that they do
ive never been too adept with the formulas involved in calculating this stuff but my best idea is that since the reason lowsec ore is less valuable is that it weighs more than highsec orethen wouldnt leveling the size of the ore fix this problemthey still yield the same mineral content they are just easier to haulim half in mind to go dredge up the thread calling for a complete mining overhaul because i liked some of the ideas propositioned there
basically volume mined per timevalue of refinesize of refine  value mined per time  profit so yes simply lowering volumes or increasing refine value on the existing lowsec ores will increase profits in the short term the reason im not fond of this approach is that lowsec ores are very nocxheavy and nocx values are horribly depressed right now if we buff lowsec ores back to profitability by simply doubling them and if nocx ever reboundssay with a change in minerals from mission loot then theyll be competitive with arkonor and bistot which is bad better to add new ores less dependent on nocxium for their value so that even if the mineral values change in future we dont ruin 00 mining inadvertently also if were thinking of the same thread regarding mining changesbasically make each roid contain multiple ores and mining crystals let you focus your output on the minerals you want then i rather like the way it would work and would be in favour of implementing it however this thread is intended to be a fix that can be implemented relatively quickly without prejudicing future plans for the development of mining mechanics that plan can still be implemented if this thread gets passed but itll take a lot longer to get rolling and id rather fix the unprofitability of lowsec sooner than later

would it be such a bad idea to give a freighters access to the corporate hanger on an orca
hm interesting ideait might have potential to being a bit overpoweredbut the idea has merit to it lets see what others say
other than the hilarity and possible piracy fun things that could happen the only reason im asking is an orca is supposed to stay on sight and provide mind links to the fleetif the orca is too full a freighter would be ideal for pulling the rock out and dumping it into its holdof course im assuming that a freighter would be able to open up the corp hanger on a pos just like it does on a stationim not asking to give it any more than just simple corp hanger access no cans no funny funny stuff
unfortunately i dont agree with this the role of the freighter is to pick up a load from one station and drop it off at the next station nothing else more or less a freight train of rl to have it pick up from a ship doesnt make sense yeah it would be nice as itd certainly make my life a little easier but thats why we have the smaller industrialist ships no supportisaacps according to ccp it doesnt have an actual item on the ship that allows it to pick up things inspace the tubethingy
but it can use corp hangar arrays if you want a fluff explanation the orca is capable of loading freighter cargo like a pos or stationsupported
the only reason it can use corp hanger arrays is because those are attached to a station as such it doesnt violate its role the orca  freighter idea does violate that roleisaac
imho the orca is a mobile micro station in the sense that it has its own corp hangerid figured theres no real reason to say no but yeah i figured there would be some issues with itand note im not being an ass about it either  o p
not going to happenthe number of variables involved in such a tracking system would be an utter nightmareyour just looking for the lazy mans method of selling a ton of junkfine i would likely use it as its convenient but im not going to hold my breath for iti would be more inclined allowing people to sell faction items without contract requirements over mass selling
totally support especially after a long day of ratting and you just wanna unload all your junk to best possible buy order
interesting how you call it an isk faucet the risk of wormholes usually make it a challenge and the rewards should accompany that riskits an interesting idea about making them useful but they should first look into making some of the other items in this game useful passenger livestock trade goods etc if this turns into a massive isk faucet i trust that ccp eyjo and his crew will temper the influx for now the economy is working fine
i agree with that but what does it have to do with the ideaexcept that passengers and trade goods dont get spawned by wormholes fw and so on and it would be a massive amount of work to get that implemented while the system for this idea already exists and fits in
to the op you do realize when u spawn in wh space you are in jump range of the wormhole zomg that simple jump out
i am still amazed by the number of people who think wormhole space is supposed to somehow be safe it is a lawless zone just like 00 travel at your own risk and be smart about it
unless im wrong which i can be in this case but i really thinks what he means is that he really hates gatecamps wormhole or not but like qorrin said your in jump range so use that but besides that if the op wants to stop the gatecamp perhaps a negative bonus should be given if theres too much players in a fleet or just together near a gate  like a proximity sensor thingy near a wormhole or gate but for what he proposes not signed at all no way takes too freakin long to scan taht wspace dont want to do it a second time
yep definitely a dara cothrom post
drake  you came backok now thats outta my system on to the op several other people have already said you can jump back out while youre still cloaked its not like empire space where you end up 10 or 12 km from the jump gate and have to try and get close enough to jump without being seensecondly we always send in a scout  usually in a covops ship or a cheap frigate to check the gate before we all jump through so if there is a camp your scout sends back the report and you dont jump in thats what scouts are for theres no reason to lose anything more expensive than a cheap frigate to a wh gate camp
yeah i had to come out from under my bridge as i was having trouble tolerating my own smell
oh wow when did they add a 2 targets to the sig amp i agree though the low slot versions of these mods should be more like 7585 as effective as the mid slot not the current 50 the mid slot version would still have a bit more base str and could be overloaded and scripted but at least the low slot versions would not be a complete and utter joke
after that fitting mods or an armor tank usually though a utility pdu if im tight on cpu happens sometimes other than covops frigateslol mid slots i cant think of a single ship where ive had enough slots never mind too many

refining arrays are useless for ore due to the 25 loss unless you are mining arkonor then you are better off mining veldpsar in high sec than taking the 25 loss from refining at a pos the annoyingly slow pace they operate at is a fair price to pay for not having to haul to a station but the loss is killer and needs to go they should behave like a 2030 base refinery so you can at least get the loss down to less than a few percent with max skills and an implant

alliance and corp interfaces need some workpart one alliance roles and structurei would like to see executorship removed from being based on the executor corp and built into the alliances own personal roles system this overhaul would replace many of the workarounds requiring alt corps alts and etc as an example to what im getting at is that a pos for example would be possible to enable as an alliance governed pos or that individual modules on that pos would be openable to alliance control this would meanlabsarrays would actually work and they could actually have prices set on thempos gunners do not need to be in the pos corp if the guns are set to alliance controlif the pos was completely handed over to the alliance any alliance member with alliance level fueling roles could then fuel or switch out strontthese ideas are mostly geared toward more cohesion between corp and alliance assets the corps for example can still lock down specific poses if need be but siege poss could be opened to allow for a more able defense instead of watching the tower go down because no one from that specific corp could break through the gatecamppart two bills and internal managementalliances need a structure in place to issue bills to their corps ie for monthly dues or something similar as well as a system of internal alliance contracting between the alliance and a corp or a member of a corp allowing for not just internal trade but also for trackable agreements between the alliances operational leaders and the corps various tasking and etcpart three the uiseriously alliances need their own seperate system of wallets divisions especially when coupled with the proposed changes in part one accurate information about the alliance needs to be accessible by alliance leaders with appropriate rolesim sure this has been brought up once or twice but i think it needs a refresher since all the other issues after qrs changes and now apocs as well

sometimes when you draw a line in the sand all you find out is how lonely it is on your side of the line carebears have survived just fine so far because the activities they participate in are shared in some part by every other classification of player in the gameby saying we are carebears and we will defend our rights you not only energize those that hate carebears but you also push away those that were indirectly associated with you and didnt mind until you got all empowered the only exclusive activity that carebears have is the choice to avoid pvp everything else they participate in is well represented by the general population of eve you arent going to see high sec go away and you arent going to casual play removed no matter how vocal the minority group is that wants that the general population of eve doesnt want those changes they have industry alts and profit ratios to maintain so they can continue doing what they do

i can see one major abuse as safe transportie backdoor bandit has gallente titan i to train soon but has not yet met the prereqs he is in empire and has bought the skill but naturally wants to get out to 00 where his soon to be built erebus awaits him instead of risking the expensive skill in a cov ops trip or having it jumped in a carrier both of which not that risky but do carry slight risk insteads plugs it in and all is wellthis could be countered simply by the rule that if you get podded all skills that have 0 points in disappear as if you did have the prereqs there is no reason why not to at least add 1 point to the skillbtw supported
wut
its a horribly contrived situation where a pilot exploits the proposed mechanic in order to make a trip with a jumpclone a bit earlier so that they can launch a titan right when they get the skill to 1because of course youre going to give a titan to a guy who just finished training the skill to 1 right instead of having to wait a trivial amount of time to use their skill and even the guy who came up with this exploit thinks it can be safely ignored because he supported the proposal this is why i say theres no needfrom a gameplay point of view i cant speak to the technical to restrict skill injection in any way  all the attempts ive seen or can think of to abuse it are laughable and obviously contrived its a convenience with no drawback

this
help moms they gave birth to us and raise us and made who we areok but seriously now ccp needs to make them usefull againright now they are expensive flying coffins
moms  especially asking for some love we getting more and more posts about that not many people will support them because not many people fly or produce the supercapsi already posted it somewhere else but let moms bridge ships as well maybe one bridge per 30min
bridging is lame because its limitless and never puts the titan out in the open just like dd are lame bc titans only sit on the field for about 25 secondsthe type of fleet movement i posted is more practical and sensible to make these ships more vulnerable the loss of a titan or mom should be an epic battle all its own right now its a 30 second laughing stock with dreads
ill update my initial comment about defense i believe 2x now a titan has survived due to tank not because it was saved by a fleet but because it managed to inch into pos shields in time they deffo need more tank and those proposed tank bonuses would do 100x more for those ships than any triage bonusi seriously want rr carriers outta the game or limited to triage too but thats another issue all together and would just  people off here
put on the agenda for next weekend

i dont really have an issue with deep probes having the same effective strength as core probes the problem is that they are often not strong enough to resolve signatures at their finest resolution this makes them largely worthless in most situations as you will have to switch probe types at some pointi proposes that the easiest way to address this is to reduce their minimum radius to 025 matching the core probes or 05 matching the combat probes then adjust their strength to match as well in other words make them effectively identical to the core or combat probe but with a longer range this retains balance once under 32au they give no benefits over corecombat probes but also add utility for those specialized in probing via the higher max radius

making lowsec more appealing to industrialists requires making it possible for me to mine there without have to first convince 1015 other players that there is nothing in the eve world that theyd enjoy more than sitting there watching me mine so that the belt rats and player pirates dont kill me and take my orealternately make the stuff so valuable that getting one iteron 3 full of lowsec mins out is worth throwing away a couple hulks with their fittings and the ore the pirates took after destroying them and the full itty that didnt make it outindustrial characters keep score in their wallets instead on their killboards and the only thing that will get us into lowsec is the ability to make more profit there than we make in highsec
a better fix would be illegal mining crystals massive boost to yield of low end oresdevastating veldspar crystalyield bonus 350 175 is normal tech iiusable in 03 or below due to extremely devastating environmental effects synergy with the devastating environmental effects of moon mining contraband in empire sourced from pirate lp stores and rat droppingsthis would bring the market forces to play in low sec allowing veldspar to be mined there for reasonable profits to compensate the risk also this high yield short burst type mining lends itself well to ninja style mining
yes this should be discussedi love this idea although balancing the numbers is obviously in order as sepshoni mentioned above the problem for miners is the risk  in hisec theres concord and in 00 theres your alliance but its a true freeforall in losec a great way to decrease the risk is to reduce the time that must be spent as a sitting duck in order to mine enough ore this could be a good way to get both casual miners into lowsec and overcome to some degree their riskaversion and serious miners into lowsec for the high iskhour it could also be a boon for player pirates because it would mean more unguarded targets in losecim very curious to hear what herschel thinks of this
the illegal mining crystals proposal is a very interesting one although theres a couple tweaks itd need right off the top most importantly if you double ore yield in nonsecure space you need to halve the yield of the 00 ores to keep the profit of 00 mining constantsince 00 is fine asis that means you need a crystal supply large enough to keep every 00 miner in arkonor crystals forever meaning that these will have to be fairly lowvalue goods despite their nature as contraband also dont be surprised if 00 miners scream their heads off anyways since youre making their life harder with no real corresponding benefit that said it does one very nice thing for lowsec mining  it doubles the yield of veldsparand all the other ores heavy in specific lowends too but theyre less valuable for people mining in lownullsec this largely eliminates the largescale traffic in moving around lowends because its perfectly reasonable to just mine in place if you need a particular mineral instead of hauling it in from jita all of a sudden 03 veldspar is worth significantly more than gneiss and is competitive with crokite and lowsec mining is at least twice as profitable as highsec no matter what mineral prices become to be honest thats probably way too much of a buff because lowsec mining ought not to be better than soft 00 mining mechanically this works out to be fairly similar to the proposal to make a wider variety of ore grades available based on sec status  in both cases youre providing a guaranteed riskreward curve instead of allowing market values determine what it looks like which would solve the lowsec mining problem on the other hand i like market forces determining what the relative risk actually is rather than a dev pulling numbers from the air to say what it ought to be all in all this seems like a version of the multiple grades of minerals proposal designed to make life easier for rorqual pilots its far simpler logistically but it lacks a lot of the tweakability and overall attractiveness of that proposal losing things like highsec megacyte in the tradeoff it solves some of the problems cleanly  lowsec will never be worthless again  but on the whole i like the system less than the multigrade proposal and less than the status quo the details would be better than the status quo but the structure would be worse its nifty and in some ways its attractive but i think id rather fix the current system than implement this one you certainly made me think about it though

right when i decide to try out the bomber they completely change the way the thing fights we should have a torpedo bomber and a stealth bomber
why not are you sickon the topic of the op im not sure what the issue is with allowing the freighter access to the orca hangars can anyone explain what the supposed problem with this is i mean from a game balance perspective
question 1 im trying to set a good positive example for people who post ideasstupid or notquestion 2 the freighter is a massive moving cargo can with the speed of years as opposed to minutesaside from the large cargo hold a freighter who can pick up gobs of stuff in space would be viewed as a problemhowever in the orcas unique ability corporate hanger your limited in what you can doan orcas corp hanger is not something easily accessed and is not the main cargo bay for some reason i found it would be useful for someone to call in a freighter to pull along side an orca about to burst its cargo hold of rockmaterials pull it in the freighterand the freighter goes off somewhere and parks or docks some placean industrial ship of largest size cant handle that kind of inventorythe only down side to this that i can tell is just an extension of the orca being a secure can with the freighter being a massively large can that can only access corp hangers and hangers on stations let alone grab freight containersit wouldnt be a problem if an orca could carry a freight container but it cant in most cases if at allif a freighter can access corp hangers on a posstation why not the orca and is it that big of a problemfreighters are very expensive and not entirely easy to obtainso yeah im not really bugged if its lack of support just wantted to throw that idea out for people to poke at
my problem with the whole idea is that it isnt being done on any sort of scale with ships if you want to transfer items viaships its done either the station or jettison this changes the whole system with shiptoship would i like to see this maybe but it does nerf the smaller industrial ships quite a bit except the blockade runner ive beaten my head on this issue enough i doubt well see it implemented as weve had the rorqual and freighterjump freighter around for so long that ccp didnt see the need then isaac
hmm im still not sure i see the problem but since im not sure i have a firm grasp on the potentials problems ill neither support nor detract from the issue i may just watch the discussion and see what happens
a how does this nerf smaller ships most players cant afford the expensive nature of a freighter or an orcab how do you explain the ability of anyone to drop or pull or push items fromto orcas  o 
um you have realized by now that youre wrong about this right if not ill offer you the followingmining directly into the corporate hangar on an orca is a direct transfer from one ship to another
this was possible ccp changed it so they cant
one of the big problems of low sec is its low control value for high risk and little reward people say why risk it when 00 is safer so to truely make this lowsec territory more desirable why not make it a limited version of 00sov1 and 2for any system without an npc station make it controlable by players allow limited sov which would give the holders a slight travel advantage over others while never allowing them cyno jammer protection this would offer pirates or attackers a chance at bridge networks and give defenders some defensive advantagesstationssystems currently wo stations need to be allowed deployment this would again help to populate lowsec with more incentives offered for systems with npc stations of the holding entity allow for limited control this would include limited tax control over stations in system allowing holders to gain 10 of orerefining and garner 50 of service fees on stations story line could be something along the lines ofdue to an escalation of war in the high sec systems of empire the factions are looking for outpost managers of their more troublesome systems to become an outpost manager you need to do the followinghold sov claiming towers in system for 14 days register with the holding faction and due x type of task to prove abilities requiring numbers in excess of 25 pilots alliance favor needs to be above 50 for 03s  30 for 01 sec systems alliance favor  sum corp favor1corp member countalliance member countwhyadded to more monetary incentives to hold low sec space and the less defensible status smaller entities can get their slice of the pie and a reversion to the older style of pre sov warfare can ensue titan dds are also removed from playother features or comments
low sec is the only buffer zone between high sec and 00your proposing to edge 00 territorial grabs towards high secsorry the focus of fixing that value should start on the high sec side not 00imho that islow sec is much like a dmz zone for you 00 folk other than pipelines and routes not that its demilitarized in the sense of the word
people who stay in high sec do so because they dont want the risk people who stay in 00 go there bc the risk is their main desirethe only difference between sov 00 and 01 is conq stations docking rights and services can still be allowed under this system bc lets be honest the empire factions want that income this also has huge implications towards faction warfare and why someone would want to fight on any side this isnt meant to be strict control over your space like 00 is its meant to be limited but incentivised they can nuke empire mission running income by 50 and people would still stay there bc of the lack of risk for the reward the best thing yet to draw empire to low sec has been faction warfare this is another step in that sort of direction
your being contradictoryyou cant have it both waysyou say 00 is safer and yet you said people go there for the riskwhich is ithigh sec is not safest its safer but risk is very much alive its called wardecspiracygankinglow sec has the greatest risk as its the best place for piracy00 has the lowest risk factor due to the ability to take control of it and band together and likely safer than all of them together as your not likely going there unless your in the allianceblue to them or rattingmost high sec people stay in high sec for industry and marketing and mission running75 to 80 of the high sec population are in fact you and everyone else down there and there alts and there mothers altsso i suggest you get your facts straight
00 is safer based on the short term the overall risk is much higher bob for example just lost the entirety of its space in a few weeks for 1 solo ratter this doesnt matter for the alliance scale and monetary affects for an alliance its huge if youre a flavor of the week ratter this just means move to another alliance if youre a hard core alliance rat then it means months of dedicated fighting to get lost assets and space back the pos loss in isk alone is well over 200bil by goon pos kill estimates id call that huge risk overallso yeah 00 is safer than a 3 for an individual but for a group and over time not so much the empire rats who do stay in empire are those people not willing to risk huge assets that can be lost at war this plan allows for limited loss based on exactly what youre putting out ie ships and pos losing station control only affects tax intakes not assets docked in npc stations deployable stations are another jump towards risk but its providing scale for everyone while allowing different options for anyone
like i said your pushing 00 political territory beyond 00low sec is supposed to be dangerousyou should put this in the context of making life for alliances easier as far as sovereigntyif this was about making low sec more appetizing wrong approach  o since i dont participate in 00 not going to support or not support itbut dont bench it towards the high sec campers
sure
so we get 01 isk warring on faction items no thanks on a separate note i wish that changing the price on market items cost more  maybe a  of the price you wish to list at
as opposed to idiots spamming contracts to sell there faction crapill take the warring over that any dayhell i like it when they compete for my business bring it on
summary of the problem
that sounds fantastically annoying something needs to change here i agree and your list of proposed changes in your gd thread seems fairly comprehensive i dont like 1 because it cuts a step out that nobody else is allowed to ignore 4 has a few too many knockon effects for me to like but it does solve this particular problem 2 or 3 are my preference  2 seems like itd be annoying from a database point of view and doesnt solve the problem of building hypothetical t2 capital ships but its the cleanest solution to this particular problem if you changed packaged only to post a warning if you use an unpackaged though itd probably be the best generic solution 3 is almost as good overall  repackaging ships doesnt seem like itd be too broken or unreasonable and it solves this problem and others like it cleanly for that matter you could just implement them both and id be happy but yes if 2 andor 3 is the solution used im in favour of this proposal no need to frustrate the jf builders with this weird interaction
change 1 to components or t1 faction ship and it makes sensebut yeah supported
ERROR
agree
essentially i created this bc it seems stupid to tie pilots to their ship this was orriginally created as a balancing mechanic but seems an odd way to do itan xl ship maintenace array wouldcost around 5 bill to constructspend 1 weeks to buildable to fit 2 motherships or 1 titanwould take up 2 mill powergrid and 3000 cpuwould not be able to eject ships once pos has been reinforcedpos would not get sov fuel bonuseswould not allow a pilot to store a ship if heshe is agressed or is being agressedeach ship would require a password upon ejectionif array dies all ships die withinif in system w cynojammer cynojammer loses 12 hitpoints in shield armor structthe idea is to allow such pilots to fly other ships wo having the risk of said ships to be stolen instantly while still mainting a high risk of leaving the ship unattended
yes i support my own proposal though i may have swung a little to hard with the nerf bat
and why in the world you would put your supercap in such thingits as good as dead
some kind of prenerfed to hell i think 5billion would be enough and probably lower the cpupg so maybe someone uses it actually 3m pg dont even fit on an empty caldari towerand maybe instead of the usual stuff the ship in that structure approach maybe make it so the mom or titan is anchored within x km to the array so pilot flys the ship within 5km of the array and anchor his ship gets ejected and the momtitan takes 5minutes or something to anchor there same for unanchoring and boarding the ship
ok yeah i swung a bit hard just trying to fend off the dont make titans impossible to kill inevitable posts hope the changes helped removed flag on grid if used removed stront penalty lowered cost shortened time to build lessened fitting reqs
im not a supercapital pilot and im not personally familiar with the mechanics of being one but from what i can see of the numbers on the capital ship maintenance array it fits the role youre requesting without any of the absurd drawbacks  it holds a titan or two moms even if theyre assembled am i missing something here
you are missing something as a titan or mom cannot dock in such arrays although the volumes do line up
so the capital assembly array builds them they get moved into a capital maintenance array and then they can never be docked again thatsinteresting i didnt think it worked that way  i thought i remembered hearing about how people used csmas as docking facilities apparently i was wrong in any case i dont want to support this because i clearly dont know enough about the topic i sure would like to know why it works that way though
umm yes that is how it works the op is confused capital sma is fine as it is without any of these absurd nerfs though the ability to password protect ships in smas in general may be a good idea
this is how wormholes actually work gate camping them is a waste of time since targets just jump out unless they are smartbombing to clear out cov ops ships well then dont send a fragile frigate through first use brains stop whining
while i totally disagree with the op can i lol at thisgatecampers sitting at a gatewh are enterprising players and they dont want people delivered on a silver platter

i made a video to introduce myself unfortunately for ankhe there is no mini cooper involved fortunately for everyone tho  ill be answering all questions posed to me via movies edit changed link
maz has my voteslavista needs to go sort his life out
successor to ankhesentapemkahno thanks
thanks for the persistence on the skill queue ankhe it was long overdue but i am not sure about the whole take care party concept its sounds a bit overprotective to me the role playing aspect of the game could definitely need a boost especially with the introduction of ambulation and all so with some skepticism i will support erik
you mean she should stay on another term
the reason im not voting for you
i find it a horrible miscarriage of justice that she was ever electedremember all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothingi call on everyone to vote in this election  and not for this man
well i am a ceo of a small corporation and that is one of the reasons why i will vote for erik and would vote for ankhe so far i have not been disappointed what is actually your point mind you i am not trying to pick an argument i am simply trying to understand in what way my small corp doesnt fit here and if i got it wrong why shouldnt i be represented by someone like me
justice what justice true evil doesnt care for justice unless you are an imposter or perhaps you want to put to shame all those who voted for her twice
well voting for a ceo of a small corp wasnt the reason its the now bolded part no point in voting for someone with a carebear only mindset in this game as many have said this isnt hello kitty online or wow for that matter
ok i understand what you mean now i just wasnt clear what exactly you were opposing and yes i do see a lot of opposition to the carebear mentality to a certain extend i even understand it i mean it is only natural to try to preserve aspects of the game one considers crucial however the fact that the anticarebear voices are louder doesnt necessarily tell me that they are right i even suspect that there are more carebears then we think in this game they are by definition less confrontational and therefore more quite individuals while reading some of the texts in this forum i often come to the conclusion that they are more mature ooops i admit that last comment was a bit far fetched and unfair overgeneralization as is the claim that allowing the carebeares to care will somehow destroy the game for the rest of the players i think that my question is still unanswered why should the so called carebears even if in minority not be represented by a carebear no offense erik
ah right that must be why lowsec boosts factional warfare and 00 sov were also covered we represent all players and do not cater to a single playstyle or any special interest group such as specific alliances in eve as is clearly proven by my track record
i guess people are a bit confused on one hand you support different styles of play which  as you say is proven by your record on the other you form a party which proclaims while pilots of big ingame alliances will represent exactly those issues which they deem helpful to their cause take care delegates will represent your cause  i actually took the time to read your web page that reads as offering support to the underdog dont misunderstand me i love the underdogs i am skeptical only because in my opinion the name take care reinforces in some way the already derogatory label carebear dont you think that the division between carebears and the real eve players  real because they do a lot of pvp player fighting player is a bit artificialin the end the big alliances feel that they can represent different styles of play better the you and that is why rabble rabble
snake oil salesman
well if we take alliances in fw as an example thats an issue that is clearly proposed by alliance players i have no problems looking into their valid concerns if they ask me to a lot of the issues i proposed do not affect me as a player at all but i think they were for the general good of the gameof course some alliance candidate is likely to represent their particular alliance better but i do not believe that alliance politics should be carried over into the csm a more neutral view might be preferred sure the csm can benefit from the experience by having some of these alliance people on the council but in my opinion the best council is a mixed group of all types of playstyles
u stopped flying rapiers
sounds cool do you think youll be able to stay sober long enough during the first day at least to make a good representation of yourself and your constituents only to rock up with me for the second days business hungover riding on a reindeer while munching on his ancestors gonadsseriously though csm is apparantly srs business if i do get elected and rock up to iceland and it is a pile of toss ccp have no interest in anything were putting forward etc then ill happily go and get trollied or as trollied as my funds and UFFFD7 pints take me share a bottle of whisky and the cheapest hooker in town however if the staff are genuinely receptive to the ideas presented then ill probably have to restrain my primal urges
also dawgs i am pleased to announce that i have updated my blog i hope to be spending a little bit more time in the coming weeks addressing the issues i laid out any questions or queries please leave comments in this thread or evemail me in game
minutes can be found herea lot of interesting info in this one well worth the read

good postalways figured it was a lot of work and i am glad to hear that it is usefull and good work i know if i get elected i am looking forward to it oddly enough
all lies the trip was a constant orgy of sex drugs and alcoholthis is most definitely a lie but i can always hope
the csm was a lot of work for you guys because thats what you made it out to be its really easy to enjoy yourself in iceland if you simply shirk the majority of your responsibilities here check it outccp employee ok istvaan here are the minutes of the last csm meeting the agendas and information on the meeting process as well as schedules for upcoming meetings please familiarize yourself with them so as to be prepared forcsm istvaan no removes clothes runs to nearest barcsm mazzilliu also removes clothesas such one of my first csm directives shall be to push for moving the csms affairs to a local bar or nightclub roundtables in musty offices are nice and all but i figure we can hash out eves issues a lot better after a few drinks
too bad that the csm is expected to remain sober and ccp has the right to boot you out
another patch another dev blog still nothing from ccp regarding thisbumpoh and thanks for bumping this in csm ankh maybe ccp will give some indication that they remember this at the next csm meeting
if our ccp guys arent willing to let us choose between different font types i hope they will let us choose about its size at least before we all become blind this means asap thx
just bigger fonts would be great rest is an option
well patch just got deployed still hasnt been fixedgoing to start making bug reports to get this bug fixedsurely it is a bug
fix this goddammit

seriously rsds cant effectively ewar 1 ship and the falcon can jam close to a half dozen where is the balance
fully support adding the ability to fit a portal gen to momsthe ship itself will not become overpowered however the utility it offers will certainly be worth the investmentzos
forgot to support my own idea
supporting this
mothership should have the largest ship bayjump portal maybe a shorterrange one than the titans or perhaps with a size limit ie subbattleship only
ok ive been a director somewhat of the gr corp and one thing that my ceo really doesnt like is giving out roles like access to corp labs what happens when you have access to a lab is you have access to not just the lab but the assembly arrays as well with ability to anchor unanchor and of line stuff in the pos we need the ability to give more specific and individual roles to people without giving them full access to larger areas we want our members to have free access to certain labs but we dont want them to have access to everything else as wellin all honesty corp tools were ment to have been looked into a loooooooonnnnnggggggg time ago and are really needed not just this but also some new alliance tools as well to let alliances work more as a whole if they so wish to corporations and alliances are the core of eve and thus needs a high priority on the to do list and to be quite honest id rather see a compleate overhaul of the corporation and alliance toolsmechanics in the next expansion than any new fancy ships and itemsto do list individual role sand permissions allow all members to sell for corpallaince without wallet access ability to use singuler items in corp for example individual lab access without granting rights to touch other labsability to remove members from the corp without removing rolesalliance wallethangersextend character limit of alliance mails if anyone can think of anything else please post hereedit unerlining some major issues
i think you can give access by use of titles set up titles then on the pos controles you can set different pos equipment to allow people access when they have that tittle or somthing similar
theres a lot wider range of changes needed here but yes this ones important
yes
agreed the corp management tools under roles and access are extremely unwieldy
you have my support
supporting my own topic
couldnt agree more a look into alliance tools would be much appriciated
yes yes yes and did i say yes i cant stand those tools
you have my support
adding my support since just figured out how to do it
you have my support

me too
it should be looked into but at the same time consequences for standings should be expanded having a 5 with an empirefaction should make life a bit more challenging when you are in that factions space
something along these lines
good idea
things fall faster then thatwe really need something doneright now i take a ccp stand point what do they think busted or ok
supportedbut missile in general should have a much higher dmg to make up for the very hard job it is to get the perfect hitso that their base dmg is normal again and their perfect hit would be like when turrets hit perfectly
supercaps cant be webbed welp
im not an awox alt and i support this topic

well the illegal crystal proposals ive seen floating about all are for low end ores only as for competing with 00 idont think that will be an issue with the numbers i listed for blast veldspar youre getting twice the iskmin as in high sec this is still far less than what abc will earn you about 23 at todays prices this is before this increase in supply has its downward effect on trit prices and while you may say there will be only limited use of these methods i believe that numbers in this range would lead to quite a lot of alliance ops hitting the 00 veldspar therby greatly dropping the demand on empire tritanium which would have a significant effect on price id guess down about 2535 from todays market as the empire centric demand would approach closer to the available supply the other big advantage of the crystal mechanic is that he only coding required is the legality check on miner activation other than that its just the addition of the crystals to the databasethis is not my ideal mining overhaul situation but it is the quickest path towards a midterm solution i feel the overall best situation for mining to find itself in is one where most asteroids are found in grav sites and those roids are not veldspar but composite rocks with a varried mix of ores mining them yields a proportionate mix of those ores crystals skew the proportion towards their designated ore type this would also lend itself to the elimination of the variable ore grades which was a huge mistake on ccps part imho as well as put even greated emphasis on prospecting out the best belts to mine
why not require all asteroid belts to be scanned before you go mine themcertainly would dent the macro miners and would make lowsec a bit more challengingalong with the ore being made more valuable
i think the title says it all why not give us a bigger character limit for us to write our biographies let us fill our bios with more meaningless and fun stuff d
hell yeah i got half a pic in my bio need more space p
i support this 
its a small request but worthy
i would also be nice if the game saved the last tab opened in the window even after client restarts
this has been raised before ccp wont do it because there is apparently exploit possibilities with a longer bio this statement utterly blows my mind but its the official stance also theyre overhauling that whole side of the game fairly soon anyways  bio mail all that stuff i hope its soon but yeah  everyone wants to do this but it seems it cant be done
think in terms of a forum post herschelbios allow for various tags and other aspects that could be abusedthe more chars you allow the more code you can shove into that window
the basic proposal is that ccp examine in depth the ecm mechanic and change it the current mechanic is effectively broken both from a user and target perspective in addition a new second ew mechanicmodule should be introduced for the caldarifrom a user perspective the effectiveness of the module is chance based and thus can be unreliable and has a binary resultfrom a target perspective when the modules are effective it is very debilitating the inability to target anything results in the target feeling powerless and unable to take part in a meaningfully way beyond warping outother forms of electronic warfare have a measurable nonbinary effect this is both a strength and a weakness strength because its effects are known and a weakness because its effects are known ecm and second caldari ew should be along these same linesideas related to thisone possible option is that ecm reduces the signature radius of the affected ships targets this is different from affecting the scan resolution of the affected ship and has a direct affect on the damage the target ship deals from a background perspective this would represent the targeting accuracy being reduced by the increased static not speed and range  that is remote sensor dampeners the overall effect is reduced damage output of the affected shipas for the second ew system something that either effects gangfleet bonus effectiveness for the targeted ship or drone bandwidthcontrol range
oh god more falcon tears they are in every thread now
so asking for them to change ecm entirely  as in no breaking the lock is falcon tears also show me where i have ever owned a falcon or used a falconif anything for me it is rook tearsor you could actually read it and not assume a thread about ecm is someone crying about how their falcon is ruined the proposal will likely actually nerf ecm more than the current changes
how about waiting for the patch before you start screaming
i am suggesting the entirely change the mechanic todays patch addresses a few symptoms of a broken mechanic and not the actual broken mechanici am suggesting ecm no longer break the locks and then stop further targetting attemptsif you read what i have been screaming about in other threads you would see it is generally not related to the ecm changes plenty of people with complaints there but rather the addition of drones to the falcon  rook and the fact the rook can now deal out more damage than a cerberus
except for the fact your entire argument is based on an assumptionyou should wait until the patch is released test it out and see if the compromise is enough to work outif you find out its not then resume your screamingand no sisi isnt enough live release includes fixes they dont always include on sisi
ugh bad idea  bad idea ecm is fine quit whining and play like the rest of us isaac
plenty of people disagree with you as evidenced by steady changes to ecm over timeif my idea for the change is bad fine ccp wont use it it does not mean they should not look into entirely changing ecm which has been steadily changed over time just look at the ecm ragequit thread there are still complaints that the changes are not enoughthat ccp should look into changing the ecm mechanics entirely is the point not that they necessarily do what i suggested
and just which thread does this have overwhelming complaints of emoragethis one 
supportsooner or later ccp will realize there are better ways of making changes than the ol slam it into reverse to change directionsi burned a lot of sp on making my sb a terror to ecm ships that sit on the edges during big fleet fights and now ive got to start all over again with torps to go after bs eh
i dont see a huge problem with it a corp hanger is a corp hanger is a corp hanger orca has a hanger by not letting the freighters access it ccp is say well were calling it a corp hanger but its not really a corp hanger and were just too lazy to name it something elsedrake nice post btw getting tired of all the demands and vitriol flying around lately thank you
like i said im trying to set a standardif you got an idea say it but dont push iti rarely post ideas as i tend to conclude they are crap
i have always wanted this capability on the rorqual from back when it was released of course it could be argued that when the rorqual is deployed it truely is a station albeit a very limited one this was before the orca was in the picture i could even support this on the orca as it would provide a lot more opportunities for empire freighter ganksas for fluff the same advanced material management systems that enable the increased tractor beam range of the rorqual and the orca also allow the easy management of freighter loading and unloading
that is a very good points
ive cancelled two join
nomore of a change less of a nerf
see you later fotm person dont let the door hit you on your way out etc etc
cancel more and cry me a river
saying no to a change isnt the right way to go about itif you think the change could have been done differently then say so and that you think the csm should bring it to ccps attention that they should readdress ecm and actually think through a change beneficial to the game

well i dont like the new falcon but i do really like the new rook and hey im training gallante anywayso no
for all smart guys i mean cancel subscription to say no then resume it do flashmob
so more balance ingame is a bad thing we must fight the dictatorship that is ccp all join and terminate your accountson a serious noteyou actually think that it is a bad idea to add balance to ecm and make the rook now actually worth flying
1 i want your stuff so just contract all your things to me2 death to all people that whine about these changes adapt or die place curse word here3 dont like the changes post a solution and stop crying like a baby
come on well cancel together you should send me all your assets and money first though it makes more of a statement against the tyranny of ccp osrslyjust send it all to me with an evemail
no its all mine mine i say
well split it and then we will quit of course looks around warily
this tbfh
too bad that most people on here tend to cry nurf nurf every time there is something in the game they dont like instead of adapting to it which is entirely doable with the whole falcon ecm thing it can be countered easily evenguess the pitchfork and torches crowd always winsedit  must admit patch info looks indeed not realy nerf like will check when i get home
by nerf i think you mean buff
i wholeheartedly agree with this threadplease remove more falcons from the gamealso ccp whimped out on the nerf that was actually needed
your two falcon alts right
um no not that big of a deal
me drinks the bitter bitter tears of whiney ass falcon alts who are incapable of understanding that a decrease in range whilst increasing stregnth is not a nerf at allalsoadapt or die alsocan i haz stuff
actually theres quite a bit of value in low sec i know a guy who went exploring in amarr low sec made roughly 1bil a week for fairly low time put in the problem is epic lulz risk pirates everygoddamnwhere you cant do anything in a belt or deadspace you are certain to dietbh this idea could be good except it basically means logistics become even easier oh god people are going to burn u with fyre for suggesting thatempire outposts are such a wincakesso neededthough tbh in my opinion value doesnt need to come to low seccapship proliferation and less risk would be best1 capships in low sec need to be proliferated much more2 pirates need a much harder time lowsec needs to be policed
no no no no no nooooo you destroy hundreds of corps with this idea one of my previous corp made a profitable living in lowsec we had our days with hellish pirating but in the end of it all it was fun and profitable we didnt have to join a huge napfest didnt have to have 100s of pvpers your suggestion will make lowsec nullsec we dont need it i dont want it lowsec to me is much more interesting and exciting why because i dont have to deal with bs politics from dirtbags such as goonswarm yourselves and other yaahoos i agree that lowsec needs more incentives but if you havent noticed ccp has made many changes here recentlywormholesgas mining ladar sites increased in value and frequencyeasier scanning and additional sitesbattleship ratslvl 4 agentslvl 5 agentsand thats in my opinion just the tip of the iceberg for changes for lowsecno supportisaac
lowsec and 00 are fundamentally different and extending one into the other is a bad way of going about this there are many better ways of dealing with the problems of lowsec than this rather hamfisted proposal what are you talking about theres bubbles fancy asteroids good rats sovereignty gate guns sec loss doomsdays
you both seems to forget that this was only duable because of a exploited system that made bob lose soverignty etcso no if not for exploiting 00 is safer
wth are you talking about
if you want to put more candy in low sec and a bit less risky just put a targeting limitation either on size or number sure this is just a brief idea or description but something in the range of you cant be targated with more than x number of ships while in low sec no limit in zero or high secsame thing with size if you flying a cruiser you cant be targeted by a bs or higher let sayimho that should get more people in low sec since theres less chance of getting ganked by 33938 ships on a gate or scanned inside a mission hub or plex or problably not targeted by bcs while your in a frigflame shield onlol
wont workthe only way you could put a bit of a challenge on something like that is to eliminate local since it seems to be so effective in whs
we  dont  need  more  jumpbridges to make your life easiermore secure actually the contrary less jumbridges cynocampable ships titans and all that crappsov is a crapp mechanic that is goign to be revisited hopefully dont extend it to lowsec also it will reward blobers overall fix nerf hisec rewards buff lowsec rewards make 00 more vulnerable or less safe but overall thisnerf cynos you cant jump from 0402 to 00 neither from hisec ofc this will revive lowsec logistics and piracy obliguin freighterstransports to move using the damn gatesabout stations alliance should have high standings towards controlling faction sov 50 at least so this will make it hard for big fishes to control them giving smaller entities some options but there is a lot of ways to bypass thios not sure this is a good idea at all
yes lets break 00 all togethernot
two horrible ideas in the same thread wowwow indeedisaac
oh noes your dyspro
is this your plan to take over aridias moon mineral income sorry there is no other delve
sov and lowsec in the same post no
i believe the market system in eve is one of the best around however there is one problem that has been annoying me a lot lately whenever i look for an item in the browse menu i have to open several drop down menus when and i am sure this will have happend to you i have no idea of either the name or group for the item i want and i am in a bit of a hurry i will drop down multiple different tabspersonally i hate a messy market window so frequently spend 12 mins tidying it upi beleive that if there was just one button to collapse all tabs i could save at least ten minutes per week time which would be far better spent watching sports on a saturday or down at the pubthis is my idea and i hope its a good onemany thankssilverswann
yeah thisd be handy
why not
ok what happened to the in station graphics they look awful nowand as for the blue bar on cargo windows what was wrong with the old bar that worked fine took up less space and looked betterfinally the search box sure it is nice in the items window but is is really necessary in cargo and cans it just wastes space thereplease give us an option to disable these and just change the station graphics back
ive posted a question in the si forum and got a response that im not happy about just to make things easier ill just copypaste the relevant post and add a suggestionive created a vote in my corp to decide if we want to buy fuel for the pos straight out of corp wallet or to let the pos fund itself by adding the cost per hour and we decided to add the price ive set the price up for each lab slot and its working but not as ive expected bpos cant be researched from my personal hangar but from corp hangar in an office within the same solar system thus the installer of a job is my corp not me the corp then pays itself for using a slot i dont know if it is possible to implement but it would be great if i could set up a pos lab slot so any member of my corp could use it and pay the cost per hour fee for the research from his own wallet to the corp wallet main or some other wallet division the jobs would still be installeddelivered fromto a corp hangar division accessible to that member and the only change would be that he must pay for renting the slot from his wallet to the corpthanks for your time
taking drakes stance on this onewhy am i suddenly siding with drake all the time
the variables are no bigger then they are now or different from how it is now it will just load them one by one untill all are loaded would be quite fast
dream on kid we live in reality not in an illusion
just allow repackaging items at a pos it would fix so many other pos annoyances as well especially for wh dwellers
sure thing
stealthbombers have been fixed this thread needs to be lockedisaac
yes please not that ccp is listening
no this is not their roleand they are supposed to get killing by small shipsbut they need some seriously love to be able to do their jobps yes to the bomb change although bombs either need to be able to launch 34 at the same time per ship or their dmg need to be at least dobbeltsince one bomb will kill nothing and you need around 10 of these to even touch a t2 ship properly closer too 18 of them to kill it
but if you read the csmccp 22 meeting log you will realize that we already raised that issue and ccp thought that it was fine
sothe dogtag handins are borked some have been giving no standing for years not repeatable and so onthis also provides means to gain standing for ratters and explorers which is a very important thing
pretty pleasewent to buy ammo for revelation and theres no faction crystals in oursulaert nor jita at least if mission runners could supply some itd be good
moved to features  ideas
erm have you looked in amarr space
great guy gallente aswell was pleasure working with himi still have hot memories of our webcam sessions during meetings with ccpi hope we will work together in csm 30
omber did a great job as secretary
what do you mean did im still doing
1 for mazzbc
you have my vote
you have my vote
well if we take alliances in fw as an example thats an issue that is clearly proposed by alliance players i have no problems looking into their valid concerns if they ask me to a lot of the issues i proposed do not affect me as a player at all but i think they were for the general good of the gameof course some alliance candidate is likely to represent their particular alliance better but i do not believe that alliance politics should be carried over into the csm a more neutral view might be preferred sure the csm can benefit from the experience by having some of these alliance people on the council but in my opinion the best council is a mixed group of all types of playstylesi believe in your honest efforts it puzzles me however how many players engage you in aggressive polemic and how few try to actually bring valid arguments against you i mean whatever eve religion one believes it is clear that csm has done much good ccp is clear on that therefore i wonder what are you people doing wrong to deserve all that hate mail
i believe in your honest efforts it puzzles me however how many players engage you in aggressive polemic and how few try to actually bring valid arguments against you i mean whatever eve religion one believes it is clear that csm has done much good ccp is clear on that therefore i wonder what are you people doing wrong to deserve all that hate maildeservedeserve has nothing to do with silly for many this is only a pew pew game the strong kill the weak the hunter and its prey this forum is an extension of that so they keep shooting at you  with words and they will never stop is the trill of the hunt you see its like an addiction
the killer and the politician are from the same mold the only difference is the method
good point that is why i dont generally like politics what i am trying to determine is what exactly is being killed here by so called politicians like ankhe or erik or any other representative of csm for that matter even though they all represent different player interests it is ultimately ccp that guides the politics of eve
indeed last i checked the game is getting better csm proposes small adjustments ccp agrees or not end of story i support take care and their voice
i will certainly not be voting for this individuali suspect this individual will receive few votes from anyone for whom confrontational gameplay piracy highsec wardecs or favouring the pvp agenda in general is considered to be of importance
wondering if any players out there have any questions for me about my run for csmplease leave a message or send me one in game and i will post answers publicly so all can see
larkonis you cant go getting drunk juzt becauze ccp ignorez you if ccp ignorez you it would behoove you to rally cp to your cauze that of reprezenting us pew pew playerz of variouz attitudez towardz pillage in other wordz to paraphraze some famouz sayingz dont give up the talk or never surrender never give up or keep on talking keep on talking remember if elected you are not alone your conztituency will be uz your power baze priwatz privateerz scammerz and other fun loving eve citizenz and we will support you we know you dont have a magic wand to make ccp do anything but you can hopefully get them to lizten to your and our legitimate concernz
has my vote
im wet in my pants you got ma support
you or lark preferably both anything to combat the lunacy of having individuals such as ankhememamskdmas or her successor pet erik dominate the csmto be exact melodrama aside my motivation to vote is based off policy and our chum from ghsc and lark both have idea that will make eve a better place
good guy thumbs up we had few different pows regarding 00 stuff but he was valuable part of csm 20 even as alternatehas hot girl aswell d
medal fixesmore medal stuff
both medal issues were created after the 1 week minimum cutoff date so neither are valid issues for this meeting the other issues have been added to the agenda as i received them please note that both lavista and bunyip are referencing the same thread in one issue each so ive combined their agenda slot
sok wouldnt be my first time
im an alcoholic as such i need to remain quite drunk in order to even operate in a cohesive manner will ccp discriminate against me because of my disability perhaps to the detriment of my health
if you are an alcoholic how are you even going to get to iceland in the first place no airline will have a drunk person on their flight
oh ill take himhalfway
what and leave him in scotland im sorry thatd be way too cruel
correct me if im wrong but with the release of the box set for eve this opens a door for new players but eve itself is very noob unfriendly everything from scamers can to flippers to gankers to an extremely competitive manufacturing market all make eve a very hard and foreboding place for new players in general even the forums are harsh and sometimes down right vulgar and abusive to new players and old alike at any rate i feel that the whole asocial is counter productive to the future goals of ccp in general and the fan base can and should be much much larger then what it is i mean seriously 20000 vs 2 million things need to change if eve is ever to become more then just a fun little social experimentok add hate mail and flames here vvv
sorry man you dont earn a proper flaming until you can compose a proper sentence
you just wrote the main reason why eve is best mmo around
case in point chomin hakintegrated takeoversplease resist the urge to flame  mitnal
you just wrote the main reason why eve is best mmo aroundthe proof is in numbers not your personal opinion
just wondering but what is the point of your thread i know that sounds a little harsh but this game is built to be harsh also as for the numbers thing  eves subscriber base has been growing since its inception  how exactly is that a bad thing
hmm smell that smells like an alt but whose
yes and as its not really worth posting a new thread about could we have the option to change the colour of that cargo cap bar thing in our cargoholds it sticks out like a sore thumb on my settings 
good lord cant agree with this enough
seconded
i support this idea not so much for the ability to rent highsec research space but for an easier way to organize space for a large number of members
finally i gathered all my senses to finish this document for the last year i was thinking about all the things which suck when it comes to supercaps i always knew the basics of what i would change but was never completely happy with solutions i had on my mind also the good part of the last few months i spent on numbers doing calcs and all that stuff to try to balance everything as best as possible but i found out that i suck at balancing d almost the same as ccp d so i will leave the final touch to them if they decide to consider ideas i gathered and posted here disclaimer i talked with a lot of supercap pilots in the last year or so and i will try to mention everyone i took some good ideas from but please dont mind me if i forget someoneanyway lets go i am personally the owner of one mothership class ship  nyx and owner of a titan class ship  ragnarok while i didnt play much lately on both of the accounts the reason for not using the titan much is that i didnt have time and tbh the will to fly it lately but when it comes to nyx for the last 6 months i am logging in only to change the skills
i will 1st try to generalize problems for both titans and moms and then i will continue with each specificallymain problem  they die so easily its not even funny solutions massive boost of hp and supercap reps1st solution and imho the UFFFDmustUFFFD one is a massive boost of base hp of both moms and titans if we take a quick glance at the current numbers unfitted just as a rough comparison thanatos carrier has 591k ehp moros dreadnought has 890k ehp nyx mothership 1250k ehp and erebus titan 1575k ehp if we take quick relation between carrier and mom we have price ratio of 120 and ehp ratio of 121 and dreadnaught and titan ratio is 132 price wise compared to 1176 ehp ratio even with ehp boost of 10 times price ratio and ehp ratio wouldnt be the same2nd solution is the introduction of supercapital armor repsshield boosters i wouldnt boost them too much compared to regular capital ones mainly because the intention of supercaps is not to be solomobiles with all changes i will propose here one thing must be untouched and that is UFFFD if you deploy your supercap solo you need to die d3rd solution i was proposed which i dont like is the role bonus of increased armorshield resistances it would be too much imho because it simply becomes a multiplier to spider tanking which is already powerful4th solution is decreasing of sig radius to prevent dreadnaught weapons inflicting full damage except when a supercapital ship is not moving before late 2007 this is how it was until supercapital sigradiuses were increased by approximately ten times to make them more probeable because supercaps canUFFFDt be webbed ganking them with seiged dreadnaughts was challenging and involved tactical skill both on the part of the dread fc in positioning his dreads and the supercapital pilot in trying to maneuver to reduce the damage the titan which died before this change was shrike in 46dp in a long battle involving sieged dreadnaughts missing a lot and hundreds of other ships soon after the change thulsa doom was ganked quickly in a safespot by sieged dreads before any exciting battle could get underway the real advantage however is for motherships because theyd become viable again in capital battlesother boosts of supercap ships related to both motherships and titans1st UFFFD increased size of ship maintenance bay 2nd UFFFD increased size of corporate hangars3rd UFFFD buffingreworking clone vat baysnow i will spend just a few moments on one thing many people proposed but in different variants its about turning supercaps into mobiledeployablepermanent structures honestly i am totally against this and i am not even sure how it would be implemented code wise however i am open for any discussion about that idea as well
mothershipsnow i will concentrate on motherships exclusively there were many proposals about giving motherships higher damage but somehow i dont feel that dealing damage should be the role of motherships with increased static and active tank increased corp hangars and ship bays they are a step above carriers but still not that much to justify price difference one thing motherships have and i personally adore is the remote ecm burst i would slightly boost it and allow it to break the lock of sieged dreads as wellthere are some nice proposals for boosting moms as drone boats by edfromhumanresources
titansmy main dilemma here was in which direction titan class ships should go even with the initial nerfing of doomsday devices they are still way too powerful and with increasing numbers of titans around they are seriously threatening to destroy the phenomena of fleet fights anyway as mentioned i had 2 directions nerfing doomsday or removing it when i say removing doomsday it would kill the role of the titan as it is now if we exclude jumpportaling so they would need another role and the only viable one would be to introduce them as capital killer ships as they already have bonuses on their weapons when it comes to nerfing doomsdays i will be honest and say i didnt have any idea what to do beside decreasing the damage inflicted until yaay posted a great proposal especially the aspect of doomsdays doing heat damage to modules
olympians  111while considering the option of removing doomsday devices as mentioned above the only viable solution for me was giving them the role of capital killer ships finally i asked myself if maybe its time for another class of supercap ships my fellow alliance mate danny centurai christened them as UFFFDolympiansUFFFD if we continue using greek mythology the olympians are a group of 12 gods who ruled after the overthow of the titans so its a really nifty name for the new classanyway as we witnessed massive 100 vs 100 capital fights maybe new eden is ready for a supercap whose sole purpose is blowing up capital ships they should be able to inflict massive amounts of damage to the capital size ships to counter them being too powerful they need to be UFFFDmassivelyUFFFD nerfed from the other side to effectively siege one olympian you will need to support it with constant remote cap transferring someone invited motherships to the party because an olympian itself cant sustain the massive cap consumption of its UFFFDsiege moduleUFFFD their active tank due to low cap will be also nonexistent so you would need carriers and motherships if you want to make sure 5 rooksfalconsscorps doesnt shutdown your olympianUFFFDs spider tank basically if you want to deploy oly you need to deploy your moms or its just one giant sitting duck when it comes to production costs of olympian initially i wanted to put it between moms and titans around 2025 bil figure but with huge amounts of isk floating around i am thinking maybe to make them more expensive than titans from the other side it would totally waste any chance for some UFFFDsmaller entitiesUFFFD to get ahold of them maybe something like an increased price but decreased production time compared to titans anyway with the initial idea i am sure that others hello yaay will come up with more positive feedback
conclusion my initial motive for proposing these changes is to give more intense and more fun gameplay for both supercapital and all other pilots with changes like this we will see many more supercaps deployed on the frontlines and many more of them killed killed not assd without the chance to live long enough for a 2nd rep cycle d  to be honest i wouldnt be emo at all if i lost my mothership or titan after hours of fighting with my hull going down to 5 just to be boosted again and so on atm a titan pilots combat experience is all but nonintense besides praying that you will not die cause you were in lag for 1 minute d  and a mothership pilots combat experience islets say nonexistent di hope you recognized my motives and i am happily waiting all constructive feedbackcheers
i edited all the posts from some most obvious grammar and spelling mistakes danyway i am supporting the op
opens briefcasesupported
i like it
no
looks like a well thought out a pretty solid idea the olympian idea works or allow titans to fit a seige module for killing caps and give them a supercap repper this gives a expensive ship some real hours in the feild as it hammers into dreads with heavy hitting vollys whilst risking itself greatly but more of a tank is definatly needed in this area
total support
i dig it
well thought out
good ideas
aproved
lets change it
seems good nice ideas
lets fix it and ill get into one of those 
loving these proposals because theyre obviously grounded in tons of actual supercap experience plus good research of existing proposals and arent whacky leftfield dreams mobile stations etc mostly just simple tweaks to existing stats with predictable outcomes for sound reasons this was desperately needed over 18 months ago so just getting it fixed properly asap should be prioritythe details of the olympian idea im not totally sold on but there is definetely room for another supercap class with a superdread type role fixing the existing supercaps should be priority of course after that im happy to see a new class thatll be totally broken for the next two years
i suport the idea
i fully approve of this product
thats a problem of remote repairing out of triage for carriers simply put they should be allowed to do any advanced remote repairs outside of triage ie capital rr logistics ships are the repair platforms of the game and honestly id rather they have a form of triage to speed up pos repairs rather than give carriers anything of the sort that they have now capital rr are flawed in use and in range they should have a much smaller range a much smaller hp repair but they were introduced at a time when pos repairing was crap and were justified as such now we get the  ass turtle tanking as a result
the changes as a whole i do support the idea of anti mobile platform im against there is a relatively simple coding update using current game mechanics to do the limited mobile plaform base thats needed including docking ships repairing using the corp h anger bay refitting etc its just removing it from an external feature to one linked to docking docking can be as simple as a graphic of view ships while having these features available in their current form ie fitting window with carriers when docked you just watch said ship move around space going wherever it goes logging requires you to be out of the ship or risk jettison in unknown space yest disconnects are a problem but theyre already a problem in game for so many reasons far worse than this its not a flaw of the mechanics of the ships its a flaw of the internet to have instability of connection
there are some very interesting ideas contained in the ops and i agree that the overall issue of super capitals needs to be explored in a major way even though i can fly an avatar i have little interest in doing so as the the class of titans stands nowthe proliferation of titans is something that its probably too late to explore but i believe a major problem with the ship class is simply the number of them that exist tbh id rather they had never been introduced at all as they obviously have been the need a serious reworking i think the ideas put forth herein are a very good basis for moving forward along this line
supported in principle however you dont need an olympian what you need to do is remove the domesday and install the olympian as a modular replacement that way instead of having a super capital smart bomb you have a directional target based weapon think of it as a hail of bulletslaser charg or hybrid charges that one shots carriers and dreadnoughtsa slow rate of fire stupidly high volly damage and overall dps fitting of a super capitalit is also a great way for titans to due against each other
i like the idea of olympians caps are spammed
yes
i like the ideas and i agree on the ehp problem of supercaps
supported awesome ideas give me a reason to put my alt into a supercap
nothing to argue about with the op that i can see
so the proposal is for both classes to get vastly more hp somewhat better reppers smaller sig radii bigger hangars and clone bays that actually work properly moms would get cool new drone types and aoe healing titans would switch to ew doomsdays and thered be a new anticapital supercap introduced i like some parts not so much a fan of others more hp im completely in favour of supercapital reppers just seem an unnecessary complication  you want them to be gangdependent let them live or die by their gangs ability to rr smaller sigs are unflavourful but they do the right thing mechanically so ill support them bigger hangars and better cloning facilities are both good ideas new fighters might be a plan but id have to see specifics aoe healing seems kind of wrong to me  i prefer the proposal to let triaged moms rr sieged dreadsbut not each other if youre going to give them a buff to their rr abilities ew doomsdays ive long been in favour of though yaays proposal is less interesting than other variants ive seen as for the olympian it sounds somewhat interesting but ultimately unnecessary it feels like youre just creating a dread with bigger numbers if were going to add a new capital class never mind a supercapital class i want it to do something other than just oodles of dps ill support this because i think youre on the right track but there are parts im not really a fan of
signed
yes please
definitely needed i use 3 x 28 monitors plus a 73 hdtv as a 4th monitor would love to spread eve over three monitors
and a million asteroid voices cried out in pain
yeah thats pretty much what i was gonna sayloldefinitely agree though granted its not a gameplay breaking thing but i really think itd be pretty incredible if the scaling was right and you really did go wow when you flew past an apocalypse in your rifter or whatever
playing eve for more than 5 years now myself i say its time to do this finally at the very first day in eve i was already wondering about ship sizing tbh at that time the stations have been even much small than they are now at least stations have to be a lot bigger take a look at jita 44 anyone else ever wondered how all those ships do fit into that small station
yup
actually maybe a boost to the range of a titan jump bridge and for a mothership to have the current range onealso t3 ships now have the ability to be immune to all types of bubbles as we have hics with focus scripts now maybe its time for the supercaps to have their bubble immunity back
well titans are bigger motherships for all its worth the first titan class vessel was the jovian mothership but i agree they should be buffed
been keeping an eye on this thread and i am surprised it hasnt gained more supportperhaps changing the thread title or starting a new thread with a title more specific to the proposal would draw in more supportzos
i like the jump bridge idea
sounds good i dont want my minmatar bs v to be useless
time to postnot that its any certain claim that something will change but posting doesnt hurt
i took care of my minmatar capital issues by selling my naglfar training gallente battleship to level 5 large rails to lvl 5 and buying a gallente deadnaught skillbook this was very much like what i did to take care of the issue of large artillery and the tempest being incredibly suckymy nidhoggur problem was also simple fixi simply dont fly it anymore unless im jumping stuff out of 00 into lowsec or visa versasplit weapons systems on a dread are a joke i like the idea of three turret and three launcher slotslet you pick your poison and still have some benefit for those of us who did bothadditional buffing is necessary of course in order to help bring the rest of minnie capitals up to par i think the ragnarok is pretty fine asis i dont see a lot of change being needed on that front
yes i support it as well
supportedi want a research lab now ccp
every time someone new comes into the corporation i get a sense of dread because i know i have to deal with the corp toolsi put off for a long time assigning roles as i should and totally hate changing them down the road because the tool is so cumbersomethis is commonok see if that got itnope not yetok let me change something nowok now i can access that hangarit isnt just assigning hangars though it is every aspect of the system the learning curve on the corp tools alone is ludicrous i second this move and back it all the wayplease change the corp toolsthankseorl out
its weird when people say they support the topic then dont actually put a support on oo
so this thread is just about phoenix pilots whining that they cant blow a frigate up with citadel torpsblasters miss missiles do reduced damage regardless of whether theyre hitting a cruiser or a titan it has always been like this end of story if this is going to be changed then i demand blasters have a much better tracking while in siege too but then the phoenix pilots will whine that my dread outdamages theirs one of the very few intelligent posts in this thread
clearly minmatar caps need a nerf cause they can speed tank seriously give all missiles a boost in pvp and just mess with npc sig radiuss and speeds next time if you want to kick pve running ravens in the nutswhich is fine by me
naglfar and phoenix use too be able too deal great dmg too a battleship the citadel torp would hit them hard and could nearly take them out in a shotwas this broken maybe but it also gave theses two ships something over there counterparts the slow speed of a citadel and delayed dmg too anything at range  even 15km or more really hurts the two shipsnow we get the missile changes and they have lost that one small perk and gained nothingwhere they could fight a battleships gang they now cant even fight a single carrier the dmg cut form a titan moving at 20ms is just out right sick dont even bother trying too hit a battleship they can passive tank you i am not asking for the phoenix and naglfar too wtf own everything on the field but i would at least like too feel useful in a cap battle too point out one issue i seen i was in a cap fight and the range was about 60km the enemy cap fleet would die too other caps before any of my missile made it over there i even aimed away from the prime targets and yet they would never make it in timetoo top it off if your phoenix died too there fleet any cid in flight was useless would deal no dmg adding a bit of kick too the already uselessness you might feelso if you think the naglfar and phoenix are ok as they are you need too try using one and come back and see us
no i dont think its funny nor is it a bad thing in my view dreadnoughts already are almost uncounterable for capital ship warfare in that you dump them down siege and need no support aside from interdictors to kill any type of hostile capitals since youre immune to anything other than getting popped if you need a couple webbing ships to boost damage so be it not supported
as topic suggests the new probing graphics with apocrypha 11 are awful i cannot probe for more than 5 minutes without looking a away from the computer to prevent onset of epilepsy change it back to the previous graphics
also fix whatever it is that causes 15 seconds of system hang during the probe warping stage
agreed im having similar issues
while i wont go so far as to say it causes eyestrain and i actually kind of like the effects the new graphics are hard to work with its difficult to see your own probes under all the sphere effects and it does seem laggy
all warfare is based on deception and this works both ways not supported
im astounded that this proposal has gotten even 5 supports its a profoundly stupid idea
yup since you are agressing and not just stealing from a cargo
i also support this topic if i can park my whole ship in the bay then i can park my whole ship in the bay and this includes its cargo
i wonder how this would potentially change if they added cargo mass to ship mass a carrier could become quite heavy and therefore expensive to jump with the mass of the industrials and the cargo the jump freighter could retain its fuel efficiency advantageof course i like the idea of cargo mass affecting every ship in game there should definitely be an agility difference between a loaded up freighter and an empty oneoh and the awox alt bs is just annoying and seriously detracts from an otherwise reasonable thread
it is good idea and i support this topic
ccp change the contract system showing any price in xxxx million if its million or more than millionthis is just to prevent the stupid and idiotic spam in any system and save your database maintenance costswho is so stupid that it will fall into scam where an item is told to be priced of 2 m isk and it actually is priced 2 b isk seriously nobodyend this stupidity now and save your costs also
thing is it does work  i just showed contract history on some scammers in jitaamarr local and they make billions at it and besides if this scam gets banned the next one will come along and be just as irritating
i take it you got scammed recently o 
i dont imagine making engine trials would be that strenuous or resource intensive and its something about the game that really gave it some charachter not to say the current engine effects look badbut much like the badass cyno jumping animationit appears that engine trails also succumbed to the void of really awesome effect ideas that have been lost in the abyss of lazynessbut yeah bring them back and make them betteri loved the trails from games like nexus and even some of the hw mods just do something with them so i can tell which direction the vagabondintyrecon is going and because this space sim seems less spacy without them

we had engine trailswhere
instead of creating new ores why not simply just increase the amounts of ore that all low sec rocks give no matter how nice you make the rocks in low sec they will never be mined nearly as much as high sec or 00 this means that if ccp dropped the current ores rates there and boosted them substantially higher we would see more people venturing into low sec but with the same amount of risk causing the other areas to still seem appealinganother thought occurs to me why not boost the refine rates in low sec bump them high enough that a person with mediocre standings with a npc corp can get 99 much easier this would give newer players and miners a chance for better refine rates while still not causing any issues to high or 00
do you mean more ore extracted per mining cycle or more total ore in each asteroid its a nice idea but i dont think it works  why wouldnt miners just take their peaceably mined hisec rocks and ship them to a losec refinery for easy extra cash rather than actually doing all of their mining in dangerous losec theres currently no way to distinguish where ore was mined and even if there was it would complicate thingsperhaps the higherdensity asteroids should be much rarer in hisec and much more common in losec and perhaps buff their refine yields slightly i think this is along the lines of what youre getting at that would make mining in losec marginally more attractive marginally hit hisec macrominers profits and probably not disturb mineral prices too much
tbh one of the things that youre never going to fix is the reputation lowsecurity space has and for good reason industry is nearly worthless there with 00 and highsecurity space giving equal or better rewards at far lower risk this is only trying to combat the problem not create a solutionthat being said the scannable belts idea has merit and the results in wormhole space seem to make it somewhat appealing if this scannableonly belts idea is implemented in lowsecurity space it will create more interest but the root problem still existsi do like the idea of the illegal crystals but that would require a major effort by the balance team you would have to majorly limit their spread similar to how faction towers are limited now but not making it a moneylosing venture with the costs of said crystalsif you only made them for low and high security asteroids its a new technology other asteroids use too tight of a laser beam compression etc this idea would be nice this would allow people to use them in 00 space as well but only for the more mundane ores giving them a competitive stance without blowing everything out of proportionalthough its too late for this topic to be presented this weekend i will add it to the subsequent csm meetings roster as i think the idea has merit supported in part
oh i can think of a million ways to make a bio obnoxious and twice as many on how to make it obscene but an exploit like an actual the game is no longer functioning properly exploit that just seems bizarre
yeah it puzzles me too in the conversation i tried to pry details loose but all i hit was a big wall with we dont discuss exploits and a blank expression
this is the old isolate your system from your text values problem which is best summed up as followsa young man is enrolled in school by his parents once his enrollment is complete and his application submitted to the database the database suddenly ceases to function upon checking the dba finds that the database no longer existsthe root causethrough some fluke of parental geekiness the young mans name was drop databasethe point to all of this being if its true that you can input text into the bio that can result in a game exploit then there is an underlying design issue that needs to be addressed regardless of whether they make the field length longer or notdisclaimer of course this never really happened its an example from a class i took about the dangers of not properly isolating your system from the data it stores
its strange but its no more strange that someone making a forum post that breaks the tablessame idea different method
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesjokes aside there has to be a better way of fixing this than to neuter player bios i really hope the replacement system gets made soon
hilarious stripbut yes sanitary bios are the way to godid i just make an oxymoron
i think some bios could lag people who were looking at them so ccp fixed this by reducing the character limit if you cant fit into a bio what you want to say about your character  corp then post stuff on a website and link the site to your bio even better linky it to a soite that is ingame compatibleif ccp didnt feelit necessary to reduce the character limit in bios they wouldnt have done it
it is not particulary urgent or even important but i would loveto see some more faction battleships navy armageddons fleet typhoons and so onperhaps for something around 500k lp in the appropriate item shopthey could  statwise  follow the progression of normal navy ships roughly 50 more armor structure and shields with one aditional slot
aslong as ther are other classes imagine a caldari navy drake
i dont know about adding a slot but yes every mainstream class of ship should have a navyfaction counterpart
supported
also the possibility of using some of the ships for minor factionsmordus legion blackbirdkhanid kingdom mallerthat sort of thing would be interesting as well just ideas but yes more ship variants
i would love to see this i have long wanted an infested dominix the ones you see in the level 4 rogue drone missions it doesnt even technically need to be that much better as the dominix is already an awesome drone boatccp has said that theres more important things on their list than ship variations which i can understand but i still want the infested dominix supported

there is something severely broken in the npc cost for the bpos for the ore mining barges  especially when you take into account the cost of the orca or rorqual bpothe retriever hovers about 09b isk for the bpo and has a manufacturing cost around 4mthe covetor hovers about 2b isk for the bpo and has a manufacturing cost around 10mthe orca hovers around 082b isk for the bpo and has a manufacturing cost around 300mthe rorqual hovers around 3b isk for the bpo and has a manufacturing cost around 1000myes im aware their are capital component needs for the orca and rorqual but the coveter and the more useless retriever compared to any other ship in their area of manufacturing are significantly less 30  40m cruiser class bpos generate ships worth 5  10m each but when it comes to the barges youre looking at an investment in isk you cant recoup for decades it seems off balanceeven if you invested in the orca specifc capital component bpos thats around 6b isk more but with a decent profit margin on the ship you can recoup that much faster than you can on a retriever or covetor
didnt it occur to you that the said worthless bpos are required for tech 2 manufacturing
your point being lots of cruiser class bpos are needed for t2 ships and they dont cost billions
cruisers dont sell for 20mill per ship as i recall the first one do not quite surebut sure rebalance the sell price too match building price as other ships have
they do if people buy a ton for the expressed purpose of manufacturing tech 2 exhumers
nothing wrong with current barge bpo prices in myopinion so no support
if the bpo costs a lot the markup is generally high if the bpo costs a lot and the markup is low just dont buy it yeah theyre expensive but it doesnt seem like it needs a change
that thread is a complaintragequit reaction to the changes to the falcon my proposal is that ccp look into a total redesign of ecm to both address the concerns of those on the receiving end and those using iti suppose i should have proposed this months ago instead of when a patch changes the ships and modules that utilize the current mechanichere is a 5 page discussion some may called it a whine regarding ecm from months ago
theres a difference between a ragequit thread and a discussion on tactics threadwhich is what you just pointed outyour on reallllly shaky ground herei suggest you try to come up with something a little more concreteim not denying there might be a problembut i failing to see that it is a problem that serious
i pointed to a thread in the warfare  tactics section it discusses the psychology of electronic warfare and points out why ecm is poorly designed mechanicmy understanding is that ecm mechanic has been modified three times in some way1 modified to a chance based effect2 modified the overall effectiveness of the modules so they are no longer effective unless used on an ecm focused ship griffin blackbird scorpion rook falcon3 recent changes reducing the overall effectiveness of ecm including range and strengththree changes to the break  stop lock mechanic and associated modules shows that there is something with the basic mechanic that is unwanted yes the current changes have reduced the range and strength of ecm however when ecm is used the targeted players who will be fewer now are still going to have the same effect happen to them their ability to target will still be removed and the choices they have for those 20 seconds will still be warp or sit there and spam the lock key even with the reduction in strength it is still possible less possible to permajam an individual targetso ecm still targeted first not fun for the user and if it doesnt go down still not fun for the targetpermajam being a state in which a ship is unable to target and take an action against the selected target for more than 10 seconds chance for a single racial to jam an average hac str 15 is roughly 60 2 jammers 84 chance one of them is effective 3 jammers 936
as far as i know ecm works on probability based on the percentage of the chance of a succesfull hitso by definition it is not a permajamskills that push that limit to as close to 100 as possible make it look like thatwhich is why i refuse to favor ecm nerfingits called tactics
and that single phrase permajam which i defined for my purposes seems to be the single thing you took away from my previous post i am well aware that a number close to 100 is still not 100 and thus a state of being permeanently jammed does not exist by definitionbut the definition doesnt matter as much as preception to the person getting jammed 95 of the time it seems like 110 of the time frustration ensues they come to the forums join a nerf ecm its bad thread and the complaints build up some players quit until eventually ccp decides to once again balance ecmyou do not dispute that there have been 3 changes to ecm to attempt balancing and that 2 of the 3 changes have not fully addressed the issue or there would not have been further changes continuing down this course i would expect that ecm continues to be nerfed until it is entirely unusedi am suggesting that instead of waiting for another round of whines i can picture the rook centered ones now ccp begin to look at ecm mechanic design alternatives and not make it a chanced based binary effect current situation and instead to a always works precentage effect rsds are an example of this
give us back the old bombers  the new role you thought of ist completly different and you screwed over a lot of people
the nature of freighters is purely civilian with no military applicationi think freighters should be allowed to utilize tech 1 defensive shielding modules
so you want mid slots on freighters after all nobody will ever fit a scrambler or a mwd in there instead for that matter theres no existent game mechanic to limit someone to only fitting a specific type of module on a ship  what are you going to do a role bonus of 9900 cpu requirement for everything that isnt what you want them to fit no just no dont make them fit modules to have the proper hp level  if you want them to have a certain amount of hp just give it to them
here are the rules for freighters i follow1 you use autopilot  your dead2 you flying in low sec00  your dead3 you stay parked at a stargate  your deadseriously if you cant figure that out you deserve to have your ass ganked
there are many options that could work1 orcarorqual role capability that allows freighter interaction in range appears as a tower to the freighter2 anchorable freighter dock that emits this capability3 high slot docking port module that immobilizes the fit ship and allows freighter interaction relatively long cycle time to make it a decent tradeoff plus losing that one of three high slots on the orca would be a significant sacrifice4 probably other ideas out there as well
i like it but id want some economically minded folks to examine the idea first to see how much of a boon this would be for macrominers and if so what its likely effect on mineral markets would be i like the idea of making corporation mining ops less haulingheavy but not if it affects prices in a big way
2 wordsgank festmacro miners that fill an entire freighter full of rock are likely to become a new sport
for now a wasted of programmer time
taken it out  killed some stuff  its a blast cd
i support this obv

interceptors have been nerfed so many times once with the nano stacking nerf then recently with mwd nerf interceptors werent ever some sort of solopwnmobile like a nanophoonso i propose a new mechanicthe barrel roll25 decrease to velocity100 increase to transversal velocity

the last thing i want when going near or into low sec is a bunch of 00 alliances leave low sec for the pirates and the crazies
really hate this ideai hate blobbing and i normally fly with just 1 friend both of us in frigs or cruisers at the topbut if they start putting in random restrictions there wherell they stopontopic i agree that there needs to be much more incentive for people to go to lowsec but i didnt really get the impression that your ideas would be the best way of doing itthat said im pretty tired and too much thinking is beyond me
wo sov 3 it wouldnt change whats current would itthe point of this is to create an unprotected pvp haven its safer investment than 00 but riskier in the sense that jammers arent allowed right now fw is pretty dull ive tried it it failed this is a way to give fw a new life and a new purpose fight for the amarr and youre rewards will be great fight for the caldari and the stations become yours the whole point of the major task required for station taking is that it would be faction warfare driven actual faction would also either be warfare or quest driven so 2 avenues both more consistent with empires current pathconcept wise story wise i think it plays in quite well with the games current path will 00 people be tempted to come to low sec yes but theyre gonna be super busy defending low sec and 00 both if one of the 2 is unprotected by jammers
so basically you hate cyno jammers and factional warfare but want to combine both ideals into one no cyno jammers  incentive to lowsec combat how about thisnoisaac
faction warfare is dull because at the end of the day it has no real affect on the game the climate etccyno jammers are dull because they deter fightsfaction warfare as a 2nd source and as an introduction to pvp is a great tool and i do like the concept but the execution is lame people fight based on incentives faction warfare offers very little considering the risk you put your wallet at this is a more direct approach with real incentives because lets face it ehonor isnt gonna carry faction warfare on its shoulders

there should be a button that not only collapses all but opens all tabsthat way it fixes not only the problem you mentionwhich can be annoying it also opens up all tabs so you can check to see everything that is being sold in a station quickly
very yes
station graphics look fantastic on the macbut on the windows machine they look crap

imho the search box is nice for cans ever had a loot can with almost every named t1 module before the patch it took ages to find something in that cani think the old bar had to be moved for the search box while i agree that the current bar doesnt really fit into the look and feel of the rest of the ui i can understand why it is moved there
i support darius opinion as a inventor with several cans with 900 assorted bpc the search function is a godsend
do not remove one of the best things to happen to industrialists in a long time thanks
i agree it is a good idea in the items window and even station containers bpo as you say but do we really need it in the cargo window and jetcans
i do
the problem is this is mixed in with a lot of fundamental decisions on how pos labs work i agree that its a problem but i dont see an easy way to fix it that wouldnt break other things elsewhere the closest i can think of is the locker module proposal from a while back which would let players have personal hangars on the pos id have to go find the thread again but i thought people had problems with the idea that made it not work so well i dont think your proposal would work though  paying for corp jobs from personal wallets opens a real can of worms
maybe you are right but whats that cost per hour option for in the first place something that devs planned but never fully implemented or it has a use even now i still think that small corps would benefit from this as it is now a hard decision how to fund the pos fuel
for renting the slots to alliance members
main problem i see with this is how many orders would each one of these mass sells take up also the amount of people who would complain about accidentally selling some high end item would go up ridiculouslyif your really that lazy just hit ctrla right click everything then hit reprocess and then go sell the mins

no being rude or anything but who are you
you are probably right about that many players that enjoy the style of play you describe wouldnt even consider voting for them it is completely natural to support what you believe the problem is that this discussion often becomes too black and white and the arguments people offer to support one style of play versus another entirely ignore the areas that we all share as the result the whole issue becomes an ego trip on who is against who as otri sarcastically pointed out earlier the forum becomes an extension of the game and we just keep pounding each other completely forgetting the gray areas we sharei spend a lot of time in 00 we operate a pos there confrontations are inevitable and often necessary but when hauling fuel or minerals we have to avoid gate camps and we dont enjoy meeting pirates and we try to avoid them when doing occasional missions for isk one tries to avoid pvp fights since one is usually fitted for pve is that a confrontational style of play or not if i do not engage in pvp everyday does that mean i dont enjoy confrontation perhaps i am an exception nevertheless the changes that have been appearing recently including the ones lobbied by ankhe benefited all areas of gameplay moreover ccp is quit good in correcting solutions that have a clearly a negative effect
he is pandemic they are badass  isnt that enough to challenge carebear mentality
to clarify i have both industrial characters and those whom are 10i am worried to the extent to which i see eve favouring ethics of game design that make it less of a cold dark and harsh universe to paraphrase devs from a while back and more of a generic wow in space game yes i am overstating the issue and using a oft bandied around phrase i am sure my meaning is obviousi want to see industry empire mining of the nonmacro kind and invention to get a boost i want moon mining to become a dynamic enterprise as opposed to static resources that huge power blocs fight overi would love to see empire mission running become considerably less profitable and reprocessing from loot nerfd into the groundi want suicide ganking to become more viable the hp buff redacted in partlowsec buffed the current situation is still a farceempire wardec corp hopping fixed you can sum up most of what i want to see eve should funnel people towards lowsec and 00 rather than creating static divisions between players empire should not be as safe as it is empire should offer far lesser rewards to its inhabitants than lowsec and 00i dont believe erik will see this happen on his watch i do believe such lunacy as pvp flagging is a distinct possibility were the csm to be steered by individuals such as himself and his mentor
thank you for this answer i can relate to that nevertheless i believe that this game has enormous potential a potential to encompass many aspects of scifi universe both dark and light side this genre always encompasses that epic straggle and without it it would loose its appeal as it appears ccp knows that and creating a universe with a multitude of experiences is their goal from the startyou are talking about game mechanics which would enhance the harsh aspects of the game so from this point of view it is kind of clear why you would not agree with my votemyself i like the role playing aspect of the game and from that point of view the eve story is definitely harsh enough if you read my toons story you will see that it is rather dark therefore i dont see the need to get the players forced out of highsec areas to create more carnage with the help of my imagination i find plenty of harshness and you cannot say that the game lacks fighting opportunities just look whats happening in gw after fdn disbanded
sup i had a look at this track record its all  by the way except overview exporting
i assure you that that are not take cares intentionsi personally ran an ultima online server of which i rewrote a large part of the ruleset and guess what it had a pvp ruleset and not even town guards except for the capital city and what the player created towns supplied themselveswe dont want to turn the game into hello kitty onlineagreed therei supported the motion to reduce mineral gain from loot mission running for the casual player is just fine the pimped ships are generating a bit too much cash but are also at the risk of getting suicided sosuicide ganking is still pretty viable and the nerf i had a part in was never aimed to reduce its viability it was to counteract the imbalance that there was no consequence for suicide ganking and its practically a zerorisk game ive had people whine and complain that i ruined their 200 mil per hour easy money source as if that is balanced in any wayif people earned permanent criminal records and insurance gets voided so there is actual consequence maybe then we can talk againagreed veldspar earning twice as much as lowsec ore is a fed up situation and just one of the things wrong with losecccp said that the current wardec system is a paytogrief mechanic and i agree the whole wardec system could use an overhaul to make the entire thing more meaningfulagreed that it is stupid that 00 players are going back to highsec to mission run 00 and lowsec should provide more income sources for individual residents not just static moon mining that goes into large alliance pockets there should be viable targets for smallgang warfare i provided a lot of input for the 00 overhaul well be getting later this year and i hope you guys will like the resultsyoure making very wrong assumptions
please
old effect was better not broke dont fix please old effect back
you dont think sothen why am i raising this issueif i didnt give a care about you guys then would i really raise that since i dont actually fly capitals
the new effekt lowes the total epeen gain of flying a capital instead of increasing it
assault ships assault frigates are currently the only t2 ships which do not receive 4 bonuses it is only fair that this is addressed and a lot of the ships in this class are in desperate need of another bonushawk and vengeance these need a second damage bonus as they are currently outdamaged by the kestrel a t1 frigate and rockets in general give very poor performance for their fitting requirements it is increasingly common for the vengeance to be fitted with blasters or lasers as even without bonuses they will outperform rockets this is surely a sign something needs to be donewolf and jaguar given the concept of minmatar ships as being fast moving outmanouevering their opponents and dancing around them the lack of a tracking bonus on these ships is absurd given that their t1 counterpart the infamous rifter receives this bonus it is quite clear that it is necessary for the role they are most often required to perform engaging the enemy in a tight orbit using their superior speed to avoid the guns of a larger foethe other ships in this class whilst having no glaring flaws are still in need of help for example it is worrying when gallente pilots in need of a high dps take no prisoners blaster using frigate will pick an interceptor the taranis over an assault frigate the enyo everytime in my view that is indicative of a serious problem with assault frigates and i believe a 4th bonus will justify the cost of these ships and make them perform the way they should

sup
i like it
i fcking love the idea of those olympians 
yes
all supported makes me want to fly a capital for a change
very nice and well thought out ideas vuki want a rattlesnake though if you want rzrs support
in full agreeance with vuk though i did here somewhere the idea of giving a mom a temp blast shield that could extend around a fleet like a pos shield with a limited ehp this shield could defend a fleet from a titan like a mom level triage if i remember it correctly it would immobilizes the mothership completely and give it reps bonuss to hp but shorten the range a shield would open around the mothership that ships could travel through at a reduced velocity they would be immune to targetting or being targetted as a pos shield is the counter to the titan dd effectively shielding those units that are near the mom when the titan deploys now one restriction is how does one know when to deploy and if one does will a titan dd i cant remember if they talked about this in their postanyway that was something interesting that i read that i thought could possibly workmake moms useful outside of pos decorations and epeen measurements and docking would be nice cause i agree they are just as big as a pheonix and arent as tall as a naglfar so why dont they fit
did i mention i love u vuk 
because i will get hit with a stick again if i dont support this ideasrsly thumbs up for this
not completely in agreement about every part of this but theres more good than bad so supported
i dont like the idear of a new supercap ship i dont think this is the solutionrather fix the existing and perhaps is the time to get t2 cap modulesi agree with the rest of it
explain to me the point of a titan if it doesnt make newbies go holy  a titan a weaker doomsday would remove this reaction
rough principles id go withany changes should not create super missionrat ships and any change should be checked against this risk caps and supercaps should be pvp and not pve at the very least this keeps isk moving in the right direction in the eve economycaps and supercaps should encourage teamplay and playstylegameplay developmentideas and feedback on suggestions so fari like the emphasis on ewar as the main weapon of a titan with all ship systems being fried heat damage with an area effect weapon and perhaps a focussed fire weapon designed to nail cap ship systems heat damage making them easier to kill by supporting ships also an area effect warp scambler module for titan use to pin an enemy fleet definitely support the bridge radius extension also for future development could the titan create a temporary wormhole to who knows where as a last resort for itfleet giving new gameplay opportunity moms should be able to repair heat damage using perhaps a repair bubble that ships warp to in the intensity of battle aiming to get back into the battle after completion a second bubble could do as suggested and act like a pos bubble when on campaign changes to hangersvatsmaintenance bays supported survival time for a supercap needs to be engineered to be at least 30 minutes to allow for cta to get help in and around which a big battle could rage not sure whether hp increases etc are the way to do this  i would rather see the need for reliance on a support fleet racial repper ships fitted with new cap repair modules or treat them like pos with a reinforce period to save them if we have to increase hps then it should be on moms purpose of titan should be offence and moms defence super cap survivability needs to improve but should be through team support not boostingif i was going to introduce a new cap ship it would be an ewar cap this would be paper thin and need a bay filled with repper drones and racial t2 repper ships to survive but would have the ability to take down a pos shield with a long recharge time this would remove the need to conduct the dull pos bashing exercises alliance pilots enjoy this ships survivabilty must be extremely high if its well supported with the right shipsdroneswe are where we are but imo any changes should take us in this direction
i dont like idea that supercapital get vastly increase in hp  maybe 100000 or 200000 hp but not more i do like idea about t2 capital modules that maybe solution 
good ideas
seems niceespecially the new dd not being a field moper by itself but a swift kick in the nuts so that support can finish the job maybe increase warp delay to 30 or 40 secondsedit forgot support
nice post well thought out
not to bad rly
i like both the idea of the olympians and the doomsday modification
thumbs up
if you recall the first titan he loggoffski with aggression giving them 15mins to kill him lets say they boost the hp even moretitan pilots are only going to logoffski even more with primarily more passive setup tanks ex eanms instead of hardenerswhy not just an expensive tech 2 version of the capital rep where the cost essentially dictates that supercaps use them while reg caps can use them but is silly kind of like officer fitting your nidhoggurkinda what they do alreadythis is the funny thing if you put a hyperion next to a thanatos the hyperion more or less is the same size if not larger in volume yet its sig is much smaller on the otherhand pheonix and naglfail already can be speed tanked effectively well especially so by supercaps because u cant be webbedthe thing is back in the day you had uber canned out iteron 5 t2 rigged carriers jumping tons of stuff so they were kinda kept so low now the ship maint bay is so lacking that its basically a jokeheh
although i am rather a fan of the titans being reworked more towards mobile bases any change is a good changeto increase the survivability of supercaps one could think of a shortterm reinforced mode
the reason i upped the rof on the dd in that scenario is due to the titans being more exposed on the field lower damange means better chances to tackle warp disruption means static titans so as a trade off they need to have a higher probability of affecting the fleet bare in mind the repeated use of a dd wont necessarily save them like it currently can it does however give them more of an advantage over a fleet than a longer rof would titans are meant to give smaller fleets more opportunities to fight back 1 x an hr rof is detracting from that goalthe idea is titan comes in dd fleet comes in immediately behind starts mopping up tacklers while the enemy fleet recoups titan hopefully escapes if not countdown beings til it runs another dd smaller fleet is now dealing with a less effective fleet due to heat damage and the minor racial damage while trying to salvage the titan use smaller fleet is also receiving the benefits of titan gang bonuses titan tank keeps it from being ganked in 2 secnext goal is for either side to escalate the fight to either try to save or kill the titan but ultimately the titan is still effective in its own right ever 20 min beyond its current ability to use its guns and drones in fightspoint is to make the fight around titans epic this would be a movement towards that goal
great ideas
i love it
with the exception of the olympians i like it
i am not a cap fan at all but these suggestions look like it could bring much more fun for cap level pilots i will support this
im sold
great idea hope it would come truehail the greeks

how ever you can currently use eve over multiple monitors in a varity of different ways for example adding a custom resolution through the nvidia control panelhowever the biggest problem and this is mainly for dual monitor setups is spanning eve across both lcds leaves the fov focus point dead in the center which is a ugly b leaves the log in accountpw space split which is problematic and see the damage warping to and other such messages are split making them problematic to reada simple ability to allow us to manually shunt the fov focus left or right would go a long way to getting people to adopt for multi monitor setupsalso bar none the biggest problem
this would be so nice to have
i would love this now but i think it would be even more needed once ambulation comes out since ambulation seems to be more about adding flavor feel and immersion to the game it wouldnt be very effective to have to minimize everything just to enjoy the environmentsid like to be able to shove all my windows to the other monitor and see the stations in all their glory unmarred by ui
support
yes this is a great idea and i think i can speak on the behalf of most people in eve in saying that ccp should implement this with ambulationhave a look at this anyone who hasnt seen this page
this really isnt a new idea and this is very close to most the previous planetary interaction threads out there planets consume and produce items those items are used to build stuff and to support other planetary colonies on its own i dont think this particular interaction really adds anything to the party and seems awfully simple feed it what it wants and it gives you what you want just seems a bit too dry to mei do like the interaction through the anchored dock as it makes the most sense in the eve gameplay again nothing really new herewhat i would like to see are planetary structures that could be built a given structure would require a certain population of a certain type it would also take an input material and provide an output the population itself would have its own needs as well as securityunrest and moralloyalty statsexample structures could include farms which would require laborers consume soil water fertilizer and produce foodstuffs grain food etc ranch which would require laborers consume grain water and produce meat and fertillizer university which would require professors consume any general population and produce upgraded population typesyou get the idea this would bring new value to the many passenger types floating around new eden slaves could be substituted for certain population types and facilities vitoc initiation centers could be used like the university to create slaves from other population types
anything is better then the current system
i was starting to think along such a lineone step back space dust as the origin of mineralsinstead of fixed belts and a certain ammount of minerals and ores as well as having a fixed respawn time each sector is assigned several local variables being different dust densitys dust density describes how many particles of a specific type float around in a system there is each a density for each ore type additional for none refinable oresunder certain gravimetrical circumstances space dust collects to more condensed micro roids and this micro roids eventually combine to a bigger roids which will attract more micro roids and grow biggergame mechanical suggestion 1 besides ore dust there is non refinable dust one for each nonrefinable mission ore ice dust  which in itself can spawn as ice roids  radioactive metallic organic and other types harvested it might be usefull for other products of daily live it might be necessary in certain production processes or to create a specific alloy2 ores are found at gravimetrical spots the gravimetrical strength of a spot doesnt provide how lucky the finder is but is part of the respawn formulaspecific dust density  gravimetrical strength of location  3600 is the ammount of specific ore that spawns per hour at a specific location3 combined with the gravimetrical strength such spots provide a magnetometrical strength this on the other hand is cue on how rich a certain spot is4 there are several states an asteroid can be foundarrow dust cloudarrow micro roidarrow cluster of micro roidsarrow asteroidarrow planetoideach of the states has an own way of miningdust clouds are collected by dust cloud harvestersmicro roids are collected with tractor beams they should be handled similar to cans tractor beam pulls in micro roid when the roid comes closer than 500m the player can scope it to cargo bayclusters of micro roids can be mined with miners strip miners and tractor beams however using mining laser it requires a certain script so that the laser runs on a lower power level not mining with this script will lead to the creation of a dust cloud and a very low yield tractor beam wont need a script however will have a lower yield than a scripted mining laser yet without any danger to turn precious ore into dustasteroids are mined as they are today
planetoids planetoids are not like the modes before to begin with they are as big as an outpost or npc owned station have three zones a core an intermediate layer and a surface each of this is different beginning on the surface it is condensed dust loose mirco roids similar to dust clouds and micro roids they can be harvested partially with tractor beam dust cloud harvester or scripted mining laserthe intermediate layerzone consists of unrefinable ore with precious ore veins two possible ways of mining can be applied either one strips the planetoid of this layer using a strip miner however the player has to deal with a lot of unrefinable dust or in combination with a survey scanner that can identify the veins and makes them each targetablethe core in difference to asteroids the core of a planetoid does not consist of known ores yet of inartificially alloys the core is the hardest and will always require a deep core miner to mine it additionally it may have a primary and secondary ore that are its basis then mining crystal might provide a bonusasteroid farmsbeing a known fact that minable asteroids are found most likely near gravimetric sites as well as objects of high mass lead to some experiments of trying to attract asteroids to specific fixed sites in so far as not having to always track them down and search themwell over short or long some device that fosters artificial collecting of asteroids in space and those are todays beltsmight be even usefull for 00 sovereighnity as those who have sovereighnity could anchor such devices and create belts where none would be otherwisejust my 2 cents well had some more thoughts i didnt manage to write down
still dosent get any better than this
my previous topic was more on minmatar capitals in general 
sniping with dreadsalong the same lines of sniping battleships sniping dreads sacrifice tank and dps for range this isnt as effective as sniping battleships as they dont get the nice t2 ammo for extra range  damage and they are stuck in siege where as the sniper battleships have more ability to warp in  out but if you can control the hostiles youre shooting at its an effective way of killing hostiles that arnt usually designed to even be able to lock you let alone shoot at you the naglfar is once again bottom of the barrel by a long shot for this all 3 other dreads only have to fit a few range mods because they only have 1 type of weapon to worry about naglfars have to fit range mods for both guns and missiles this is one of the many reasons why split weapons suckhow to fix thisnow bare with me for a second and read all of this before you start screaming and shouting about how overpowered this isremove missile slots give naglfar role bonus 100 damage bonus to capital projectileremove both bonuses give the naglfar 5 damage per level instead of the 75 rof per level which means this is a 10 damage decrease from bonuses and give it a 5 bonus to shield boost amount per levelgive the naglfar a 15 cpu boostdrop 2 low slots add one midslotokay i know what youre thinking holy  4 guns on a dread thats like 25 more damage than all other dreads first of all artillery sucks if you look at the pheonix it gets a 5 kin damage per level and 5 rof damage per level it has the same number of weapons as the rev and moros and it does the same damage even with a 25 more damage bonus through hull bonuses the moros gets a 50 drone damage per level and a 5 damage per level but compared to the revs 5 damage per level and t2 sentries they both do the same amount of dps infact the rev does more the gun types matter artillery sucks and in order to compete the naglfar needs this extra boost of damagewhere does this leave the naglfar in comparison to other dreadsgood damagebest burst tank although still very uncapstablegood ehpno fitting problems able to sniper fitedit update due to discussionheres a nag with giga beams all skills v

i find too that the old design was better now we see almost nothing
having one interfere in anothers war should be a concordable offense on a storyline context the wardec mechanism was put to somehow allow corporations to fight each other in empire space lets say that for some reason nation a and nation b are at war nation c allied with nation b starts sending medical supplies to the b frontlines you bet your a a will start attacking anything that looks like a nation c convoy same thing here except that we have an omnipotent force in concord that could take care of the problem the minute it starts

i agree docking games arent fun but the agression cd should be a lot shorteri say 60 seconds at mostand as for the lawless arguement i believe not even npc pirates would want to harbor a person who was currently fighting what if your agressor follows you and shoots you in the station thatd cause a lot of damage not that its possible but its more realistic
tbh i dunno why they havent done this yet think of all those people who are smashing the dockjump button because they dont know how long until they can itd simply result in less traffic and thusly less lag
just read the damned things ive never actually gotten scammed when i read them and only came close once when i was just being lazy scammers are annoying and somewhat immoral but as that old saying goes a fool and his money are soon parted
no he didnt he does a lot of trading of contracts in market hubs though so id wager hes just annoyed at having to sort its still a bad idea but his intentions arent quite as base as youre suggesting
pretty loud for an good intentioned postnot to mention very misguided and not very brightdatabase load would be a few measly kbs if not a few bytes of datacost would be nulland the cost your referring to is the title of the contractwhich can be made to look like anything you wantwhich is why you check the price firsti suggest you come up with ideas as opposed to making demandslike a karma system where pilots rate sellersbuyers
well after couple too much beers you are loud atleast in internetspaceshipsforums anyway i still think that it would be best if it would show the million tag in all cases
dont drink and post  o again your dealing with the title of a contractits like me posting an article in a newspaper or here on the forumsfreighters suckbut they haul a ton of cargoits misdirection but niether have anything to do with the otherscammers do it because they canand they dont give a  what you think otherwisethe only way your going to get around it is for the contract title to be self generatedand therein lies the problemi meani could say 1 million and mean to say 1 billionamazing how 1 letter can throw the whole damn thing off
as discussed here and afterwards acknowledged by transgaming here as an apple drivers bug this memory leak affects all that use macbook that used gma x3100 the game has become nearly unplayable because of this crashing every hour or so even if the integrated graphics is unsupported due to lack of power as mentioned in many answers ive been given this graphic card doesnt have much power issues just this memory leakid like to ask for more information of what it being made to fix this or even if possible when will it be fixed
i meant to say more ore per mining cycle for all of the rocks within low sec i think that if there was enough of a gain per rock then some people might be willing to risk the chance into low seci also like the idea of the illegal mining crystals but i think they would need to be properly balanced in case to not make everything to easy to mine

i agree with your premise ecm is annoying for both the user and target but im not convinced that your proposal works some reasons1 it would have almost no impact on ships using modules that arent impacted by signature radius such as warp disruptors webs painters neuts etc other than possibly making the original lockon take a bit longer2 it would have almost no impact on ships that are attacking larger targetsi realize that you were trying to steer away from chancebased system but heres a variant ideainstead of ecm inflicting a single hitormiss attempt to break a targets lock for 20 seconds make it so ecm instead gives the target ship a miss chance for the duration of the ecm cycle equivalent to the current chance to jam for the duration of the effect each time a module is used that requires a locked target the server checks to see if it missed this would include guns and missiles ew disruptors remote repair etc for multiple jammers used on a target apply them in much the same way as adding multiple hardeners  ie subsequent miss chances affect the margin and stacking penalties applyby the way note that this would not automatically require an total overhaul of ecm strength sensor strength eccm etc the miss chance would still be calculated like the jam chance is and for a given jammer the effects over time should be the same though the interaction of multiple jammers might make some adjustments worth looking into eccm has a direct benefit by reducing the miss chancebasically this would represent the jammer creating false images on the targets tracking systems leading the target to effectively fire at ghosts instead of his desired target its still chancebased but with a much smaller granularity  generally some of each volley would hit and even if you got an unlucky volley your next chance is only a few seconds awayas to the second bonus granted by caldari recons  perhaps remote eccm would make sense
i am not realy agree with these bombers and i explain whythey are only two race need normaly to learn the missile skill  caldari and minmatarfor me the best way will be to put the bonus in the bomber on the large weapons of each racial skillexemple amarr  large pulse caldari  torpedo gallente  large blaster minmatar  large autocannon and each bomber can use bomb for me the term of bomber its to be launch the bombs and i dont understand with the only other weapons you can fit is missile
how about changing it so two racial bombers go back to cruise missiles and two stay with torpsi dont really use them for what theyre meant for but the new torp based ones are even more completely nervewrecking and i wouldnt have though thats possible
i agree and support this suggestion
how aboutno
no and i fly freighters into lowsec for crying out loud well used to how about you get a bunch of friends online and get them to help protect youisaac
exception to the rule but only if your good at what you do
not trueand they already have defence called friends in battleships
my previous topic was more on minmatar capitals in general 
stupid forum please delete this thread
grea idea
great idea
this macro miners are not likely to invest that much upfront capital just to reduce hauling times its not like hauling is cumbersome to them
the orca can indeed unload its cargo and still provide uninterrupted mind link coverage for the fleet it need only visit a pos to offload a corp freighter can then consolidate the shipment from the pos and deliver it as requireda second option is to run your haulers out to the orca to offload the hangar this is really just a step up from jetcan mining but it is a heck of a lot more secure the orcas extra space even allows you the ability to sort cargo so your different haulers can deal with only one type of ore this makes for quicker stacking if youre anal about that kind of thing i think the balance issue here deals more with the potential for macro miners to sweep entire belts clear without the necessity to pause in their actions it seems like it would be much more difficult to write a macro that mines and dumps ore into a hangar when the orca may or may not be there in the system the requirement to coordinate either the orca dockingredocking cycle or the hauler trips into the macro make it a lot harder for those unscrupulous folks to conduct business also by factoring in the corporate hangar size as well as the cargo hold size the orcas cargo shuffling would come into play for extremely large mining sweepsthe orca seems to work well for its intended role its an empirebased coordination platform it allows storage and transport internally as well as gives options for peacetime higher security cargo movement via industrial haulers for low sec operations the appropriate ship to use would be the rorqual

thankyou for the response i wont reply in full this thread is about eriks prospective term after all to keep discussion on the tracks so to speaki would like to hear more from erik on the issues i raised previously and see a statement of policy and intention with more meat to it covering more issues than this thread currently containsi think this would be well received by anyone that wishes to make an informed and accurate judgement regarding eriks prospective term on a csm and why we should want this
hi ank why dont you allow your man erik to answer these questions himself
guysthanks for the elaborate comments to those who invested that effort all the others thanks for your volley i need to bow to otri who put it into terms which are understandable for my kitten mind  for many this is only a pew pew game  this forum is an extension of that yes my pvp experience i made on the weak side so far and above that i had powerful help to avoid it in most cases this csm candidature now is me turning pvp and this post is about my personal backgroundgetting personallet me hence comment on the pvp issue first  pvp is what makes this game interesting to me as well as to my whole staff  and it is actually implied right by my rp play style i am subject to the whole playertoplayer sandbox and its immersive drag and interaction with an npc does not fit there only the whole player interaction mechanics and the oneshard promise is what makes this game the best which i have advocated also on other forums like xing and linkedin and i mean the whole pvp mechanics which includes the playerdriven economysure the pve aspect is supremely beneficial to me at the moment still all my companys activities are shaped by the pvp aspects  do not use jet cans but invest in haulers do not go to lowsec unless a scout is sent ahead and an escort is guarding your route do not employ pilots without a thorough interview to avoid scams etc we even go mining in lowsec for the thrill cause we know its not for the profit and while we are picking up a notable number of pilots who did not like the aggressive behvaiour of their previous company yes we all dream about one day being able to take on the real challenge of capsuleer fight why in new eden would i want to abolish my idols being balanced  game and realworld economics new and oldit is about the balance and this balance with all due respect i am not measuring by the immediate whining about changes neither as a csm is it my office to roleplay during the meetings as a csm we are vested by ccp to a real world game design mandate thus let me toss into the discussion a realworld economical aspect of the balance  ccp is depending on a growing subscriber base this will not happen should the new player evolution curve be too steep with newbies being vaporized and take this can its for youscammed on the spot at the same time the experienced players need to be fed to keep them and between the two positions a viable curve of playerevolution must be craftedto know the state of things i want to rely on economical data fed by dr enyo and on other statistical data like pilot movement and number of pilots organized in corporations and alliances and to change the state of things i will always pick up those suggestions from the assembly hall which have playerinteraction as the driving force of change again  i will pick from suggestions which have been posted by you to assembly hall or directly to take careas a side note  that said the highly discussed highsec gank nerf using concord was the least liked solution of all the whole csm advocated and still advocates pvp options and you all know that  tradeable kill rights are on the table and there are fantastic suggestions to a wardec refactoring it is ccps decision to go the way they deem most cost effective ankhe has submitted 00 incentives to be integrated into the next expansion and i am in favour of a playerdriven mission system
edited for spellingwhat you vote is what you getthe csm is made up of sane people csm and take care are always proclaiming changes which will increase player activity ankhe is a student of game design i have studied computer science and virtual sociology and we have an advisor rufus britton who lives in nullsec take care in addition to that is about making csm work efficient by passing on experience about the csm mechanics it is this mindset i am putting up for vote 
can i have an indepth answer clarifying your views on the following nonconsentual pvp empire wardecs with special detail on corp hopping deccing yourself to avoid wardecs and other such exploits mining in lowsec highsec and 00 the profitability of l4 missions in highsec npc corps their 0 tax rate and safe haven for players who are not new to the game
erik im really after answers on the specifics questioned abovei can get generalities from a plethora of other csm candidates im looking for what sets you apart from themthat lies in your stance on specific issues
i dont think we should get rid of jita local instead ccp should just remove the ability to link on that channel
confirmed looks like a bunch of bears to mewhile i will admit i am a pirate ive dabbled in all parts of eve mining missioning and industry just check my standings the characters you mention all appear to have no depth to them and all seem to represent one facet of the eve community so you can definately not speak for all of us
if you dont like it then feel free to join instead of whining
im an experienced manufacturer building upto capitalships i mission run lvl4s in hisec i also pvp a lot in lowsec and im just moving out to 00 for a bit i used to haul on corp mining ops thats the closest i get to mining i have a lot of varied experience in eve and dont fit into this mould that youre constructing in your imagination for me
this is exactly why you were a terrible csm candidate answer his questionyou are a snake and nobody with an ounce of sense trusts you
i know almost nothing about you far be it that i have made any kind of judgement about what mould you fitank please address the point the thread isnt intended as a whinei want to know more about the political might behind erik the party that looks set to steer his term in the csm should he be elected and hence the individuals that it comprises
fine but others have already started making judgements on me without any facts whatsoever
its easy to make ill informed judgements about people when you know nothing about them and indeed before they have offered up anything about themselves isnt itwhy not tell us about your lowsec pvp experienceswhat have they your experience of lowsec lead you to conclude about pvp in lowsec with regards to the policy and aproach you think take care should adopt towards lowsec and lowsec play styleswith regard to the policys you would want erik as a csm member to adopt towards lowsec and lowsec play styles
anyway i suppose i should do a little bioim a bit over a year old ive spent most my time with the benegesserit chapterhouse but ive recently joined the flaming sideburns i mission in hisec a lot for iskies to fund my lowsec pvping i enjoy smallships more than bs combat so i mainly fly harpies and hawks im also training for a dreadnaught which i should hopefully build myself in the next month or so im about to move to 00 and try life doing pve and pvp out there to see how that compares up until now ive only had little sorties into 00 i havent stayed there for any significant periods im experienced in af and bs combat and used to be fc in our roaming gangs in my old corp but in my new corp im hoping to learn more from those more experienced than me
i think lowsec pvp is pretty good as it is the only issue that frustrates me is station hugging you can spend a lot of time camping people only for them to station hug and redock when aggressed but i cant think of any solutions to that which wouldnt make gameplay worse the other issue id like to look at is maybe changing gate and station guns damage so the lower the sec of the system the lower the damage they do i fly afs a lot i can tank the gate for a short time but if 01 gates did less damage i might engage a bit more at gates and gank and run before the gates finish me off currently if youre in an exclusive small ships gang it can be crap for finding pvp as you have to be aggressed first which bs are reluctant to do or you have to go in belts but its hard to find any targets in lowsec belts even if you only send one member in the system to scout and directional scan the belts
now that would be just one of many issues of interest to those that pigeonhole you into the bear category and see a distinct lack of policy favouring pvp in your hopeful eriks campaign
i have been playing eve for over 3 years now and i still learn new things all the time i have mostly been in marketing industry invention research and tend to do those on the mass scale and also mission a lot have basic pvp experience and my eve schedule is usually pretty busy would need more hours each day to do more z0d

i am loving the ideas and suggestions youve written down in this threadi am picking out the highlights for me  not a supercap pilot tho 1 titan makeover way higher ehp dd device makeover less damage cap drain ecm shockwave effected area warp disruped tank balanced so it couldnt be used solo2 mothership redesign raise the logistical role of the mothership  let it be a real mothership nanobot repair cloud bigger corp hangar  ship maintenance3 a new capital class between a mothership and a titan dedicated to be deployed on enemy capital fleets with penalities  eg cap boost  when siege mode on no ability to fully operate without external capital support  rep  cap 
give me your nyx ill luse it as for your ideas i support the need for change but i would ask you to go further in your suggestions specifically supercaps should allow pilots to dock in them while online with a mom make the sma superhuge if you log off in it well you are stupid as all you get to do is talk in local where the mom logged off or jump clone out nothing else but when the pilot is online you can pick any ship from the hangar and undock in it or man point defence weapons up to 6 xlarge  15 large  30 medium 50 small ship weapons with the mom having a racial bonus to proj energy hybrid or missiles the only thing you need as a docked gunner is to have sdm skills note not pos guns guns you could fit to a ship depending on the skill of the supercap pilot does not include the highslot weapons at the supercap pilots disposalwith the titan you get an even bigger sma and double or even treble the number of available point defence weapons using these things to move big groups of pilots around would make titans and motherships much more usable having them not persistent in space after the pilot logs off though maybe a 15 minute grace period where it becomes invincible on disconnect so people can undock from it if the pilot gets dcd when he logs back in he better have a scout maybe with having these defensive capabilities the need to buff the ehp so heavily is reduced the ships become multiplayer powerhouses able to defend themselves with other players docked andor project a metric ftonne of offensive damage

i like this
even if it would be able to build them in any low sec only on the pos ofcourse not the required system with sov 3  would be an advantage
as many as needed until it gets ing fixed you think the changes in the op that you didnt read gj on that will take a long time to balance and put onto sisitq the naglfar has been waiting years for a fixsupporting this great thread
supportin dis here topic also
while i think the rest of vaals post is unnecessarily harsh this part i agree with fully the nag is hilariously bad and needs a fix its obviously and by a large margin the worst capital ship in the game unless this is part of a plan for racewide balanceeg minmatar intentionally get the best cruisers and the worst capitals and i have no reason to believe it is it needs fixing not a big fan of balance issues but this ones pretty glaring
forsure best looking dread and cant use it
never flown a nag never will unless this gets implemented
im supporting the living daylights outta thisi dislike that the naglfar is little more than a very large trimark for the next dread down the target callers list for the love of god fix the naggie
it is just because there is already few topics like that also not many people can fly moms or have any clue about them
bumping for the updates
allow to build them in low sec systems on pos not only in sov3 sys
clone vat rebalancing1 allow fleet members to alter and upgrade their medical clones when next to a ship fitted with a clone vat bay this does not allow them to store medical clones in the ship just change which station they are in and uprgade clone coverage there should be some indication like an alternative icon in fleet to let fleet members know which ships have useable clone vats for this purpose2 allow alliance members to remotely install clones into a ship in the same fleet to do this the ship must have an active clone vat bay and the character wanting to clone jump should be docked in an outpost owned by that alliance this would provide a mechanic for alliances to bring reinforcements back to a hostile system easily3 allow fleet members to clone jump back to a station jump clone when in a capsule next to an active clone vat bay when using this mechanic the character performing the jump would have the option of storing their current jump clone back into the capital ship or simply discarding it this allows clone vat bays to hold clones containing implants too4 reduce or eliminate clone jump period when done via clone vat bayto support this change id like to see three further changesfirstly mothership and titan sma size should be doubled to allow for more spare ships to support the fleet a repair bay module for motherships and titans would be a nice asset to fleets this item would project a shortrange smartbomblike effect that repairs friendly vessels it can only be activated inside a starbase shield and causes hull armour shield capacitor and module heat damage to regenerate slowly for all fleet ships within a short distancenext  alot of people keep suggesting the ability to allow motherships to dock i disagree but do think i have a better suggestion in order to add another perk to owning good space as well as providing ore chances to kill supercaps i suggest this allow supercaps that come within docking range of sov level four outpost to access its services in space this would mean supercap pilots could upgrade clones refit their ship and even access personalcorporate hangars in the station it would make reloading with spare ships for fellow corp members a simpler process and more viable to use the ship as a real forward base
ok you have my support
and my axe uh support i mean
signedbeing a ceo or director trying to sort out roles is insanely hard work i support ally  corp tool get an overhaul

i agree this should be at the least considered
this plus some other upgrades
the ewar based doomsday appeals to me especially if it was made to be a more regular effect firing several times a minute rather than a fire then get the hell out weapon a racial aspect would be better however making each racial titan good for varying situations with the amount of titans ingame now it should be possible to combine different effects into the perfect tacticsuch a dd change would need to come with a defense boost of some kind as the whole concept of nanotitans is silly the biggest ships in the game should get the best defenses  not able to be ganked in 30 seconds and requiring interceptor fittings to get them off the field first beforehandive never liked the idea of docking inside another ship perhaps im just too jaded with watching a simple idea like starbase jumpbridges suffer constant bugs for a year before being fixed but i think something like that would just result in a plethora of broken code and stuck petitionsi do think there are better ways to make supercaps more viable frontline bases though fixing clone vat bays and making it easier to load spare ships would be a huge improvement supercaps could also be better fleet support ships in battle with appropriate new items
obvious troll but ill bite this thread is about citadels doing pathetic damage to moving capitals i used the phoenix as an example but the nag is also affectedim not going to bother reexplaining why guns miss doesnt cut it read the thread understand the figures look at the graphand grats on quoting the second stupidest post in this thread yours wins first prizelets ignore carriers for a second this postis stupid becausesupercaps cannot be webbed
this thread is about a balance issue but what youre talking about is game design the problem here is that two dreads need that extra webbing support against carriers see bold above for supercaps while two do not
scamming im fine with it punishes stupidity and rewards cleverness contract spamming local with these bogus things when all you want is to say hi on local whilst selling stuff or even trying to use it to spot a nice contract im not fine with that i know this has got a lot of support on other non ah threads im putting this here to appeal to this and the next csm to implement a simple change that will destroy this mechanic 1 the colour of the price changes from dark red to something much easier to read  a nice white green can still be used for negative prices 2 the exact price is always displayed next to the price in numerals ie for 199999999isk it would display as one hundred and ninetynine million nine hundred and ninetynine thousand nine hundred and ninetynine isk 3 isk cents are always displayed on wts contracts ive never fallen for this scam for the record but for traders i can imagine this being highly irritating  dprevision it has come to my attention that a new variant of this scam in which the contract instead reads 800000001 or similar this is inherently the same problem but is actually a little harder to detect thanks to the problem highlighted by solution 1  ie the red sales text is too damn hard to read
i as a wholly independent body along with my penguin crew of course support this proposal
you got my support penguin
if youre using local to search for contracts you really deserve everything you get
which is a face load of spam it is sometimes nice to sit in local and talk to people  eve gamers are usually a friendly bunch  and i can imagine that the guy that is really trying to sell his contracts on local is annoyed because all he sees is spam this xkcd comic is a good way of putting it
this threads a duplicate  please take it to the original
actually it isnt  mine is a proposal thread whereas that topic is just an issues thread but thats beside the point
it doesnt work it causes spam wich doesnt help anyone and it also makes life of legit trader harder everybody hates it
as i said above  it does work amazingly enough and the scammers seem to like it just fine
i did enjoy the superfast mwding intie trails that you could almost double back upon with sufficient fiddling still the occasional lag or jitter did make them do crazyweird stuff so the lack of them isnt bad visually
very much agreed i turned the trails off pretty quick because i thought the game looked a lot better without thembecause i had the trails off i never noticed that they where removed i support bringing the trails back as long as i have option to turn them off
word of advice  it usually takes a couple months for a csm issue to get to the devs and get implemented this seems more urgent than that have you filed a bug report
wrong forum isaac
how can it be wrong forum when i was contacted by the guys from the mac channel who would like to have this issue raised and bumped up in priorityedit forgot to support
yes a bug report has been filedthank you for the support lavista vista 
being a newer player and not having much low sec experience not sure if this already happens what about adding a chance to find 00 ore in low sec either by hidden belts or just a random chance of finding a decent roid in a belt the reward of mining extra ore has to outweigh the cost of losing ships to pirates
already exists  lowsec gravimetric sites can spawn the lesser 00 rocks worth about 140175 per m3 i think that level of income is fine to give to beltmined rocks though  its hardly gamebreaking when veldspar is worth 125
recently i have returned a bit more to the game because i belive invention thing could be finally interesting doing good profits building some interesting tech ii stuff and so on i got some of ours lots of core datas and buyed some interfaces to try and then i discovered that the maximun of runs you can obtained is like 10 and with a probability of 50 or less because of the prices of the core datas nowadays it is impossible to get any profit at all and it is better to sell the core datas with that kind of ratiosi can imagine that if you have moon mining and reactions you can do a good profit on tech ii stuff but that is a alliances and 00only activitiesgreat so invention is basically another more givingfuel for the endless and nonsense wars in the 00 space greatif all the game is for the alliance wars things at least transform that wars into a real interesting thing a useful thing an activity that could be creative and not just a circle of destruction allow to the powerfull alliances to transform the 00 space very slowly and very expensively in real little growing secure empires that could be interesting but firing your enemies all the way just for fun is basically a nonsense activity
i think you need a tldr version  its kinda hard to pick out your point i guess i can support this sometimes the 00 sov stuff feels kinda pointless  the only reason youre killing the other guy is because you dont like him a point to reeeeeally large 00 holdings that would be nice
btw if you havent noticed t3 cannot be dominated by the super alliances simply doesnt fit in for them on that note if alliances cant have some reason to conquer space beyond the i am uber reason then why bother with 00 at allisaac
i can tell you that your numbers on invention are simply wrong and that its quite profitable even if youve never seen a moon also controlling 00 space seems to be judged worthwhile by the people trying to do it which seems to be enough also slowly civilizing 00 space is entirely possible  look at the spread of outposts over the years those objections aside though i dont think youre actually making a proposal here what is it precisely that you want the csm to advocate i really cant tell
my idea for the change was just a suggestion added to the proposal that the ecm mechanic be thoroughly reviewed and changed whether a variant of my idea or your idea or anyones is used doesnt matter to me but rather that ccp review and change the from the current mechanic of break lock  block lock to something elsei am used to if you think there is a problem provide a potential solution and so i did that
posting to bring together two ideas in other threads neither of which i take credit for but i do think worthwhile and simple quick fixes for momsdocking a mothership would not detract from the supercapital status nor does it seem impossible in terms of ship models versus dreads for exampleadd the ability to fit a jump portal generator to motherships for bridging fleets in the same manner as a titan this would fit with the role of mother of the fleet without encroaching on the role of carriers or freighters through extension of cargohangar capacity the mothership essentially transports ships via the bridge into hostile situations rather than internallyadding the portal would not infringe too much upon the role of the titan since the mothership does not have the devastating damage output of a doomsday and perhaps its current stats would feel more balanced vs cost given the utility a portal gen would offer to an alliance buying a mom would then be a useful investment for any alliance since it makes fleet movement significantly easier and allows even smaller alliances to project power more effectivelyas i said not my ideas but interesting to see what support they get as a packagezos
supported im dumbzos
no and no supercaps are not allowed to dock end of story titan gets the generator isaac
idea looks good ccp should think about that
eveo thread
00 warfare there needs to be some adjustment pos warfare is a drag for both parties involved and can be a huge timesink of suck yes i said it suck being in goonswarm im right in the middle of the action and have plenty of opinions on how things can be improved not only have i been following my own alliances moans and groans ive seen what the rest of eve online thinks too one big complaint is setting up and tearing down pos structures i will be proposing templates and queues to lift some of the burden in deploying them and another thing i believe the game needs are fuel packs to accompany the templates it would involve same mechanics as producing off of a bpo where the numerous pos fuels are combined into one specific product 00 environment the addition of wormholes did a lot to give everyone more options i however want to see more added with the static areas namely npc space there is mission running there but not much else that sets it apart from the rest of 00 territory i would like to see the npc ai enhanced for systems they hold sov in just as players will aggressively defend their space the npc should too marketcontract improvements it would be nice to see how much of a specific item has sold in a station or system as it is right now you can only see sales totals across the whole region create a new skill if you have to because this would be an asset to all players concerning contracts the ability to view more information from the list when a search is run would be highly desirableui improvements i must say that im pleased with many of the additions to ui that ccp has made since my last csm campaign run it was a major part of my platform and seeing the changes leaves me very satisfied there are still more things to improve on however namely the overview a column needs to be added for state which reflects what pos modules are doing online onlining anchored unanchored incapacitated when your dreadnaught is in siege you are already dealing with a slow lock time having it lengthen further by wasting lock cycles is a huge frustration also when are we going to get an aggression timer countdown for 00 combat do it alreadyccp policy visibility ill get into this more on my website but i feel that the rules of game and forum need to be spelled out better the official wiki is up and now it needs to be fleshed out further ive read so many accounts of one gm doing one thing while another does the complete opposite there needs to be more consistencylowsec revitalization there isnt much activity going on in lowsec space beyond people constructing capital ships gaining access tofrom 00 or the occasional pirates i propose that bounty and mission rewards for lowsec see an increase along with this 00 ratting bounties need a big boost previously i was leaning towards a highsec nerf but i have since reversed my stanceand much much more my website will be updated with further thoughts a few things on the list are giving logistics ships a hull rep range bonus mothership role improvements evemail filtersfolders t3 ship innovations and plenty of ways to make holding sov more exciting in a constellation i hope this post has given you a decent overview of my platform and what i hope to accomplish should i be elected to csm it has been said that ccp will be taking a closer look at revamping 00 warfare in the upcoming year and i want to be a part of that process not to mention walking in stations is another thing im very interested in both of these things will be huge for the game and i will dedicate my time to ensuring it will please the eve online community
i endorse this candidateshe is indeed a girl however angel looks better imo
you sir are blind brain damaged or both shes fat in game
yes more details would definitely be helpful to put this discussion on the right track
jaina redsplatlet me first say your questions are not new and i am proud you are turning to take care in seeking for answers the solutions neither are new nor unknown indeed the csm has been discussing them for a long time it is one benefit of an organization like take care that such knowledge about the history of issues is forwarded to the next candidatefurthermore i read from posts over and over again the implication that we are pacifists no  take care embraces pvp and realizes that nonconsensual fights are part of the game it is a bit misleading though how your questions imply the existence of easy answers i acknowledge that take care puts the bar where pvp turns into ganking a bit higher than you likedark universenow as to your questions in particular nonconsensual fight is a fair style of this game even in highsec redsplat i am differentiating between highsec pvp and suicide ganking where the latter is a style which heavily compounds the new player experience the silent majority of highsec pacifists felt that it was getting out of hand not because ganking in itself was unacceptable but because they lack means to retaliate and there was no meaningful consequence to the criminal act the suicide ganking fix is often cited as an example of a hellokitty attitude instead you will see from the csm proposal that we are in favour of a pvp solution for example tradable kill rights among othershighsec industry mining and mission running are directly connected to incentivizing 00 because take care promotes bumping the right aspect over nerfing another in order to achieve goals from the csm wiki entry you see it includes a decoupling of industry from sovereignty creating opportunities to develop the vastness of space connecting nullsec economy with highsec and increasing the rewards also for small gangs may i remind you that empire income currently at least often is a required fallback for both fw and 00 pilots we want to change that as well but that is just to give you an idea of the interleaved mechanics of the game
the wardec mechanics are being discussed in high detail jaina and the csm has submitted an issue on war dec mechanics almost a year ago we are aware of the issues with people in npc corps where the safety it provides is abused for activities such as canflipping corp logistics and let us not forget about remote repairing in highsec warfare however like the other issues you listed this issue also is a twosided coin on one hand there are those that abuse the security yet on the other hand we have large amounts of legitimate casual and solo players that simply do not enjoy playing the game as part of a corp or do not have the time nor mindset for it sacrificing this valid playstyle just to get rid of an inconvenience for another is not acceptable to tax or remove npc corporations has been proposed on the assembly hall many times and none of the csm members not even those closer to your background ever saw any merit in it if you want to make changes to the game mechanics you will have to take into account other playstyles as well which is why suggestions like abolishing npc corporations altogether simply will not work however we can work together to identify minor aspects of the problems that we can do something about for instance if npc corps are being used for logistics perhaps it we could look into removing the sec hit from aggression and killing of npc corp pilots in lowsec this will not have much of an impact for the legitimate player but does help corps and alliances at war id genuinely appreciate it if you would bring up constructive suggestions like that either to me directly or to the assembly hall balance  not boringjaina redsplat one mans meat is another mans poison while some might imply you are seeking the easy kill highsec bears seek easy isk and you see from the above cited issues that pvp is always part of the equation which take care tosses into the gamewhat you might not have noticed from the wiki is that most of the above issues have already been submitted to ccp following current governance of the csm we are not supposed to raise the issues again  on the other hand the highly acclaimed skill queue made it into game because take care knows how to bend these rules in our voters favouri will take your pvp desires into account and then it is about managing ccps attitude to bring them into game and i am very capable of that from my reallife experience in management consultingyour vote  my job 
i have to say i am very glad for this well written answer the point i have been trying to make from the start of this discussion is that improving this game is all about balance i think it is important to understand both extremes when trying to find the middle ground and to me this post once again shows that you are only being misunderstood as leaning strongly to one side in fact you are kind of in the middle when in comes to your views while in the same time you will try to represent any proposal that your voters will impress upon you that is a winning attitudefrom what i understand about ccp and their philosophy that middle ground is the best place to be when it comes to effecting changes it is the best place to be to make our voices heard ccp will be always skeptical to solutions which favour one side and open to the once that are winwin i dont think people realize that a good csm candidate is not only the one who simply represents our interests heshe should also understand how to get results from ccp
edit firstly even retrospectively thank you for the carefully worded and well thought out replyerik i still feel you are somewhat dancing around engaging on issues you feel are contentious rather than expounding your opinion and what you thinki was as i think i emphasised looking for your opinion on these issue not what has been done in the pasti am looking to the future and am interested in your personal and specific views they will be what motivates me to vote or not vote for you and what will motivate many othersthese view i think it reasonable to assume will be driving your actions during the csm termi was be they in altered form or otherwise now that i wasnt aware of hamstrung would seem an appropriate word on a related aside i dont want highsec to be a gankers paradise i want balance i feel game balance between styles of play in eve is adversely effecting with mechanics favouring specific play styles over othersif there was only 3 things i would like take care to shepard into existence they would betransferable killrights and a reinvention of the bounty system and by extension sec statusrebalancing of level 4 missions from reducing minerals from loot reprocessing favouring miners having 40 of the market in minerals being from reprocessed mods and ships isnt right to a general reduction in profitability proper divisions between security of systems and the inherent profitability of ventures from highlownull sec as part of an initiative to favour mechanisms moving players into losec and nullsec the stagnation that exists as current can be pinned rather firmly on the comparative profitability of highsec
this idea i definitely agree withbtw erik i feel much more confident about voting for you now understanding how you think helped a bit
finally we are getting somewheredear redsplat i hate to do the an i mean interfere in your informative exchange with erik but it is my perception that the take care partys strategy isnt primarily centered around their own egosviews but rather on a firm grasp of the divers needs of the players and their ability to sell those needs to the almighty ccp i imagine one has to do a fair deal of dancing to get them to listen then again i may be overstating things
greetings larkonisid like to know what your thoughts are on those we refer to as carebears how do you feel about us love us hate us would you like to see us gone from the gamei read your blog and it seems like you want to change high sec to benefit the predators more is this correct you seem to be willing to make high sec more dangerous and willing to nerf its rewards how far are you looking to if elected csm how would us carebears benefit from your election

i think right now the mechanics in highsec with regards to the predatorprey dynamic ie suicide ganking can flipping etc are pretty much bang on and i think a shift in either direction would be a bad thing you are not going to get ganked if you pay attention and use a suitable ship you are going to get ganked if you ap in a t1 hauler with a bils worth of loot although i loathe rl comparisons if you absolutely have to transport a load of gold and gems and monies through compton or some other notorious district of a large city youre going to do it in an armoured car at speed not at a leisurely pace on your bicycle with the goods overflowing out of panniersyes i would like to see the rewards of hisec tweaked for starters given the uselessness of mining in lowsec i do believe that t1 loot drops from missions need a nerf restrict them to named only this gives the t1 producer a boost hes not being undercut by mission runners dumping 6 months worth of goods on the market at ridiculous prices i mined itshot it therefore it is free hurf durf durf although there will still be the flow from drone missions and rats im sure ccp can find it in their heart to tweak the alloy refine rates too i realise that if you nerf rewards too much then it will just drive people away ccp has pretty much made it clear that level 4s in hisec were a mistake but now that theyre in place they cant really do much without several thousand emo rage quitsref carebears in my mind a carebear is someone who out and out avoids confrontation either in battle in chat or on the market i know plenty of mission runners and industrialists who are able to put up a decent fight if need be these people are not carebears in my time ive run across a lot of industrialists trying to get a foothold into lowsec many of them were receptive and we traded protection for goods and services these are not carebears the ones whod ignore me block me call me a dirty pirate because of preconceptions and would then procede to be milked for all their worth by us as we pulled down their towers and ganked their haulers these people were carebears i have no issues with industrialists these people are part of the game i couldnt invent manufacture a t2 ship or build a carrier wed be pretty boned if there were no more industrialists if you want real representation for industrialists then vote one of the other candidates however ive got a pretty level head im more aware of pvp dynamics and the knock on effects of any changes than most people i realise the harm that moving level 4s out of hisec would do as much as the harm of moving level 5s to hisec or buffing concord even moreits not a case of what i can do for carebears i have a few good ideas but i am no idea factory if issues are raised that i think are fair and balanced then ill support them if not well i wont i am a pirate and a scoundrel but if things arent kept balanced then i will run out of targets pretty quick
regarding fuel pellet issues i attempted to raise this issue for a previous csm meeting however access to the wiki which was at that time was being required for issue proposal and a decision to focus the entire meeting on expansion issues prevented me from bringing it upi definitely will be involved in the discussionsissler
we have been discussing this in militia chat some of us are looking to vote for a candidate that promotes faction warfare and causes ccp to inject more content into faction warfare eg making system capturing meaningful monetary or nonmonetary rewards for pvepvp centralised killboards statistics improvements medals achievements etc since ankhe may not run again the candidate should be part of one of the four militias and prove his commitment to faction warfare with a high rank pve andor sufficient kills on the militia killboards pvp election campaign tactics such as promising to work on fw improvement in order to get the thousands of votes of militia members wont impress us if the candidate havent ever participated in fw the candidate should be vocal and persuasive a good lobbyist who knows how to influence the devs so that we know that our interests are well represented if you think you are an eligible candidate for this task or know someone who is please link the campaign site in this thread so that we can check it and give our vote if we think the candidate is suitable most of us are not patient enough to read the campaigns of all candidates in order to find the one who represents our interests at best
edited for wordingiudexthe short comings of the fw content are apparent and have not been addressed properly since the introduction of fw more than a year agotake care has already picked up the matter  our member ankhesentapemkah has first joined the federal defence union then the 24th imperial crusade to get handson insight some issues have already been put forward as documented in the csm wikiankhesentapemkah has visited me a few weeks ago in berlin when we were shooting the campaign movie and explained to me the pressing fw issues while i might lack personal experience eva and i consider in unison that i have the better lobbying skills and social experience from my studies to well succeed in promoting the issues and i shall be proud to forward your cause current issuesfrom current knowledge these are the most pressing issues the order does not reflect priority feel free to get touch in order to discuss details 1 the rewards need to be bumped as to take into account plexing and kills fw does not have to be a profitable carreer but it should at least be sustainable people should not be running back to highsec and grind missions to fund it2 the current loyalty point shop does not have anything special and is only accessible to those that run fw missions3 as for storyline impact  right now the caldari have been victorious in many systems and it does not have any consequence enemies can still operate out of a station right in the middle of their territory and there are no benefits to actual occupation4 spawn mechanics  right now the plexes end up in the leastfrequented areas over time and whole strategies of plexherding are required to just be able to conquer a desired system frontline systems cannot be attacked because no plexes spawn and it is a vicious circle with decreased plexing activitiy spawning less plexes resulting in less plexing5 as you we love the medals  now it is nice to be featured on fw stats but how about something like a small medal for the weekly top pilots  fw stats should be expanded on too6 not to forget the cloaking exploit ccp attitude and prioritiesthe most important issue to address though is ccps attitude towards fw in particular and working on released game mechanics which are only halffinished in general sure content is only ever used by a part of all players but still ccp should care when a majority of these pilots feels that it is half finished  they promised rp alliances in fw from empyrean age 11 and it is still not done what is so difficult in that i expanded on my view of ccps attitude in my campaign thread  i suspect that ccp struggles with our suggestions on the dimension of investment effectiveness new content can be put into shiny press releases which will address the whole market and will trigger new subscriptions but update type game releases only address the existing player base i guess that take care will be able to influence ccp in that area if nothing else because i have experience in management consulting and can bring forward the right argumentsthus making ccp move is as much a lobbying ie right language matter as it is putting the finger onto the technical matters i am the right candidate to do that what you vote is what you getiudex i shall be happy to support you as a fw pilot i am depending on your experience and i will be able to turn it into the right words which will make ccp move into a winwin direction
i express my full confidence in erik and believe he possesses the skills required to convince ccp to allocate a higher priority to factional warfare

supporting this idea i posted here last year and watching it get ignored alsoalthough i would change it so that ships in an sma can carry any item up to 1500m3 total volume
am i the only one thinking it is pethetic and stupid that such a scam is even possibleseriously it is only possible because of a freaking stupidly made gui and systembeing written in millions sometimes but other times in clear isk by isk when it is millions etceither do one or another this mixmax  gotta go ffs it is more then stupid
yes you are the only one
no its pretty pathetic that people are still falling for it but then i feel that way about all those silly jita scams the font only having a minimal difference between a comma and a period doesnt help but even then theres a serious difference between 99999 and 999999  the third decimal place if you dont look at an unknown contract closely enough to see that you deserve to get scammed
i never saw the point of having to place guns in the first place seeing all calculations are done from the tower there just needs to be a menu like the skill planer to anchoring and online pos mods the menu bring up all pos modules that are inside the pos shields you set the order of anchoring and onlineing then the tower just auto places and online all the modules take the same time but no arrows and no need to be there at the tower for 8 hours
listen to this man ccp
i miss trails
i was thinking that maybe a shorter rep cycle time say 1 or 2 secs along with a simular reduction in cap usage and rep amount per cycle would help active tanking this would make a active tank regen more like a passive shield tank instead of in chunks that have huge alpha strike gap in the cycle timeso the base stats on a lar would berough example onlyactivation time 15secs instead of 15secsarmour hp repaired 80 per cycle instead of 800 per cycleactivation cost 40 cap per cycle instead of 400 cap per cycleso it cycles 10x faster but reps 10x less per cycle for 10x less cap per cyclegives the same overall effect but does not leave a massive 10 second or so hole between rep cycles for alpha strike meltage especially considering a lot of races have a rof of 5 secs or even less so 2 volleys per rep cycle at the momentso as you see proportionatly reducing the duration amount and cap of active reppers gives roughly the same effect as fitting a plate with the down side of it uses cap but the upside that it is a regenerative effect ie if the dmg is lower than the resistacesrep amount the tank will be stable instead of just breaking slower like a pure plated fit woulda 1600 best named plate gives a set 4200 raw set hpwith this idea a large repper would give without skills 800hp but instead of doing that every 15 seconds in one chunk leaving a big 3 volley alpha hole it gives the 800hp without skills over the 15 second period 53 per second or 265 every 5 secs ectit woulds be a little like the passive shield tank effect but with a active rep component doing the rechargingps i only used the armour tank as a example and would apply this effect to all active boosters and reppers in eve shield rr and hull
maybe im just confused but isnt that gap there for the exact purpose of striking between reps
hell yeah lets nerf alphastrikes because minmatar are so overpoweredhahaha no
oh joy a goontardhow often are local active tanks used in pvp compared to plus and plate fits at the momentand considering the rof of mini guns a repper gets a cycle in between their volleys already so it hardly effects themnot as far as im awarehow often do you hold your fire until you see a ships armour or shields get repped a little and then start firingactive tanks are already one of the thinest in the game let alone coupled with the cap fitting and cycle time they suffer from
fit 2 small shield booster works well on a golemcnr atleast for missions not so sure about pvp besides shield booster already have a shorter cycle time for the usual 2x lar setup i think staggering the reps might help
im not asking advise on how to pvp as i have been playing eve and pvping for 6 years and have several thousand kills i am making a suggestion for improving active tanking and making it a more viable option in pvp
you dont sound like youve been playing for 6 years
how can i make suggestions or comment when your idea is contradictory and wholly doesnt make a damn bit of sense
maybe you could start by explaining why you think it makes no sense as when i posted it in other threads it has been highly supported and understood
why argue with someone who has no idea how game mechanics work im not going to waste a lot of breath on you your idea is simply not going to work because thats not how the game is going to work isaac
i know exactly how the game mechanics work pal its you who obviously doesnt fully understand the ideaso are you are saying that the passive drake does not workok im now not sure if you are trolling or just clueless
first off the only clueless person around here is yousecondly if your going to suggest a change to the mechanics take the time to do a propper explanation and list the reasons why not beating around the damn bushnot supported due to the size of ops ego matches that of a planet that and hes obviously a bloody liar and a posting with an alt6 years my ass
well if im relying on an alpha strike ship or a ship with slow rof timing is key so in my wolf neverin a sniping battleship literally every time i fire my gunsas for 6 years what
i dont see any benefit to this getting killed by burst dps is not easy outside of a serious blob fight and if anyone can kill you that fast a repper wont help it also increases problems with module lag as for why people fit passive tanks its because pvp fights are short at max skills a lar adds 71 hpsecond and a 1600 adds 5250 hp if the fight lasts less than 74 seconds the plate is better on top of being a lot easier to fit unless you want yet another buff to ship base hp which would screw up other things fairly badlymost notably station dock timers or unless you want to buff active tanking massively which would destroy pve balance you arent going to fit active tanks on any ship where a plate gives you more hp in the opening 3060 seconds of the fight capitals fit active tanks because they have no reason to bother with those dinky plates but subcapitals will plate until you make an active tank better not just more finely divided
the key to what if you hold your fire until he has repped all you are doing is reducing your dps the only reason i can think of to hold fire is if you have a monster alpha and want to ninja the km but that is hardly a laudable or valid reasonor maybe against a ship with a high transversal and you need to time your shot when it dips to a point you can hit it but that is another issue all together and has nothing to do with this matter
a lar has 1 cycle for 800 or so every 15 secs so you go 15 with 0 armour repped until the cycle renews with this idea you would have been getting repped bit by bit upto the 800 or so hp for the entire 11 seconds i know why ppl fit plates instead of reppers in a lot of situations but the 74 second rule does not apply to a mobile and intricate pvp fight it also means that a roaming gang with plates needs to find a place to rep up or bring rr along in the form of drones or moduleslogistics ships this is a idea for solo and small gang pvp where the dps is naturally lower along with the fact ppl manouver and warp in and out engagedisengage and a resist and rep regenerative tank would be a reasonable and useful optionthe fitting issue for active boostersreppers also needs to be addressed as it is a crazy situation that it should have so many short commings in pvp and so few benifits compared to plated fits
jesus youre like a childunchronicled shots do not  more dps 5 ships with ungrounded artillery cannons all off sync will be easily tanked by someone with an active tankif every volley coincides directly after a rep in a long cycle the damage will be done all at once and instant massive damage is better than staggered damage in any scenario where you want the enemy ship to pop as fast as possibleas for your boosting idea they already have that its called small reppersboosters thats why youre getting flamedim curious as to what ship loss caused you to take up this crusade you must have had a bad streak attempting to active tank or something
maybe you should read your own stupid unclear postyou do not say anything about synchronising a gang of ships you only mention oneif all the ships fire at the same time half way through a bloody rep cycle the damage will be done all at once you clown a simple target caller saying fire can synchronise your gangs shots ffsthe only reason you would apply it just after a rep cycle is if you had a fast rof and wanted to get as many volleys in between his reps as possible in the hopes he would go pop before his next cycle1400mm arties with 3 dmg mods and max skills could maybe get two volleys off in between a non staggerd twin lar rep cycle depending on if the tanking ship had rep rigs fitted but the fact is that it is all speculation and eft warrioring as active tanks are very rare in conventional pvp or i would not be trying to improve and thus increase their useageim talking about pvp rep and resist fits for solo and small gang fighting not stupid pve fitswhy would you think summat like that do you only post after you lose a ship or summathaving active tank modules spread their repair ammount over their cycle time instead of just lumping it all together at the end of it is a much better way of operating its that simple and i thought of the idea while reading a post about active tanking on the ships and modules forum
no no it is not that simple stating an opinion vaguely and then expecting everyone to agree with you is probably not the best way to win an argumentdrake was right this is like talking to a wall active tank  passive tankthey have different uses they operate differently and whether you like it or not they are both viable in combat no need for a change and you dont get my support nor apparently anyone elses now stop wasting a top slot in the assembly hall this place is clogged enough with bad ideas without yours sitting on page 1
i will reply to as many posts as i feel like thanks and if you do not like it tough1 your post is the first hypocritical one here and other than your proposed change you offered nothing but a vague reason as to why it would be better ie your opinionyou are more of a U1F51pU03CCU03BAU03C1U03B9sU03B9 than me im not kidding around i at least gave you a few reasons why i personally wouldnt like it since this is less of an argument and more of an exchange of opinions the rest of the board responded by not supporting and barely responding to you2 drake is not an idiot rude yes arrogant yes and out of line most of the time but youre just as rude to fill your own thread with responses instead of simply telling us why this would be better other than its more like a passive tankthat brings me to3 why would anyone want the active tanking system to be more like a passive tanking system you havent given any reasons because people use drakes wow people use amarr ships quite a bit too for their tanking ability4 uh i dont care how many times you reply people like me and drake will continue to shoot you down i was giving you the honorable out your idea is obviously not getting support angers a few of us who appreciate things like spelling variety and etiquette in a situation like this an intelligent person would simply bow out and devote his time to rearranging his proposal with more reasoning changes or ideas or simply stop arguing a moot point lets hope youre one of those
i gave a good reason why it would be better and ofcourse its my opinion ffs if it was anybody elses it would not be me posting it you clowni did and have done that if you did not understand it that your problem do not make it mine by trolling the thread and claiming its not understandable just because you are to stupid to get it1 it helps close the alpha hole2 it would allow reppers to be run reasonably well on a ships passive cap regen instead of needing 400 cap for a single delayed cycle so its yay for mini and missile user not booo3 i also mentioned reducing the fitting costs due to how ineffective reppers are compared to platesyou have shot nothing down all you and the other clown have done is show your ignorace inexperiance and capacity to trolladd to the discussion ask questions or go away
this would help mini and missile usere the most as they do not need cap to fire and as such could proly run a single repper very regularly of their cap regen 1 it does need closing2 all you did was show how stupid you are it was my post after yours that corrected your silly post and pointed out the benifits of firing as a group just after the rep cycle with fast rof guns i have never flown a drake in my life on this char my cyno alt fyi or my main but your post does show how little you understand about this idea
the alpha hole i describe on say a lar fit would be the gap between rep cycles so if it is 11 seconds between rep cycles the oposing shipships have 11 seconds to hit you with enough dmg to pop youin my modal the reppers would rep say 80 dmg per second for 40 cap instead of how they are now giving say 800 dmg repped after 10 seconds for 400 capobviosly these figures are not totally accurate to in game figures but using 10 seconds makes the math easy to do and understandit does not change the simple end math nobut imagine if you have only 200 cap available or even 80 in actual pvp with things as they are your repper would not activate because it needs 400 and even if it did you would need to wait 11 seconds to get any benifit but with the new system 200 cap would give you 5 cycles or likewise 80 cap would gave you 2 cycles and the benifit would be 80 hp repaired x the amount of cycles so 5 x 80  400 hp repped and 2 x 80  160hp reppedperhaps but the fact is that when you consider that a 1600 plate costs 500 pg and 28cpu base for 4200 hp and a single lar 2300 pg and 55 cpu as well as 400 cap per cycle for a base of just 800 hp per 15 seconds it is obvious that reps need reducing in fitting cost considewring their poor effectivness
okay can everyone on both sides calm down for a minute youre all making asses of yourselves youre both trying so hard to make the other person look bad that nobody is actually making any sort of a point stop flaming get back to actual debate and this might be a thread worth having right now all it deserves is a scrubbing or a locking
alright simply put i disagree with the ops proposed change because its simply pushing active and passive tanks closer together i do not agree with itis that civil enough
and this is how i reply to reasonably phrased and inteligent questionsthe alpha hole i describe on say a lar fit would be the gap between rep cycles so if it is 11 seconds between rep cycles the oposing shipships have 11 seconds to hit you with enough dmg to pop youin my modal the reppers would rep say 80 dmg per second for 40 cap instead of how they are now giving say 800 dmg repped after 10 seconds for 400 capobviosly these figures are not totally accurate to in game figures but using 10 seconds makes the math easy to do and understandit does not change the simple end math nobut imagine if you have only 200 cap available or even 80 in actual pvp with things as they are your repper would not activate because it needs 400 and even if it did you would need to wait 11 seconds to get any benifit but with the new system 200 cap would give you 5 cycles or likewise 80 cap would gave you 2 cycles and the benifit would be 80 hp repaired x the amount of cyclesperhaps but the fact is that when you consider that a 1600 plate costs 500 pg and 28cpu base for 4200 hp and a single lar 2300 pg and 55 cpu as well as 400 cap per cycle for a base of just 800 hp per 15 seconds it is obvious that reps need reducing in fitting cost considewring their poor effectivness
yes though to be fair youve been the least obnoxious by a good margin and for that matter i agree with you i think hes trying to solve problems that dont exist with solutions that wont work i just dont think that a flame war between op and drake solves anything and its gotten past the point where it amuses me
i dont see that as a hole any gang that can do 100k damage in 10 seconds is going to kill you no matter what your reppers cycle time is 800 repair even assuming 90 resists across the board cant even buy you an extra second if anything id like to see alpha made into more of a consideration not less  right now dps is the only thing that matters if youre that low its either because youre being neuted in which case you wont get above 40 without a cap boosterand with a cap booster youd prefer status quo reppers because they use all that cap instead of letting it get neuted away or because youve used the cap already in which case a bit of change to how the cap use is parcelled out wont matter much i dont see this helping much under any reasonable circumstance active tanks are hard up against the realities of pve balance pve not needing nearly as many specialized modules lasting far longer at much lower intensity and with known damage types that can be tanked with two pair of hardeners allows for a much larger active tank without a massive shift in pve numbers you cant make active tanks good at subcapital pvp without making them far too good at pve i regret that somewhat but i cant see any easy way of making active passive and buffer tanks all viable and not overpowered at both pvp and pve unless you can figure out a real way of improving this i cant get very enthusiastic about changing it furthermor your proposal doesnt change the viability of an active pvp tank at all  im no more likely to fit a lar if it did 80 per 1125 than i am when it does 800 per 1125 like at present youre not fixing it youre just changing it
i did say this was about solo and very small gang pvp and i do not consider the raw dmg of 10 gank fitted close range bs to be a small gang or solo amount of dmg output tbhof course you will the natural regen of a mega gives 20 cap per second so thats 1 cycle every 2 seconds even without a cap recharger fitted vs never getting to 400 for a normal cycle because of the neuts cyclingif you cannot see the benifit of being able to rep 400hp over 5 secs for 200 cap instead of needing to wait for your cap not only to get to 400 but also needing to wait for 10 seconds after that for a cycle in a solo or very small gang pvp situation then i cannot make you although im the first to say on a bs hull and considering the available forms of pvp at the moment for bs its application is limitedbut do not forget to consider that it would be applied to med and small reppersboosters in the same way and then think about the bc cruiser and especially frig hulls that are very vulnerable within the alpha hole i describe above as well as not really wanting to plate up or use extenders due to how much speed the plate reduces them by and larger sig radius the extenders givethese changes may not be earth shattering for bs considering the availability of pvp for them at the moment although they would be useful in a few limited ways but on smaller ships they would be a lot more useful and viable and maybe even prefered to a plated or extended fit due to the drawbacks the others give that smaller hulls rely on like speed and sig radius
thats exactly my point if they can alpha you down in 10 seconds theyre not a small gang no local tank will save a ship primaried by a big gang doesnt matter what your cycle time is  if they can alpha you down your repper wont save you you say youve been playing for 6 years but you dont even know how cap regen works if youre at zero you dont get 20 cap a second you get closer to 4 that 20 is only valid if youre at about 13 cap  aside from there you regen far slower you really think 80 hp every 10 seconds will save you no i really cant see the advantage of not having to wait yeah itll save your bacon one time in a thousand but the rest of the time it doesnt much matter if youre using a cap booster those 400 charges will run your tank basically permanently and at full strength whereas under your system you run it at 15 to 110 strength assuming proper neut staggering your system would harm an active tanker at least as often as itd help them also im not sure precisely what your complaint about small ships is but it seems kind of silly to demand that you get bonuses without penalties all the time yes plates slow you down and extenders blow you up but theyre a form of tank thats actually somewhat useful accept their penalties or work around them but dont assume that you should get a bonus of equal magnitude without any penalties  thats just nonsense
what part of solo and small gang are you having problem understanding this is not about it competing with a rack of plates in a gang v gang situation its about it being more effective in solo and small gangthere are two options for the idea im using lars in the example but it can be scaled down relativly for meds and smalls1 you get the repper giving 800 hp over its 1115 second cycle for 400 capor2 the cycle time is reduced along with the rep amount and cap usage by say a factor of 10 so you rep 80 per second for 40 cap per cyclewhere the fck do you get the idea that im complaining about small ships do you understand the differance between pointing out a benifit the change i suggest gives over extenders and plates like you and others asked me to do and complaining about summatand where do you get the benifits without penalties comment from reps use loads of cap and have huge fitting costs compared to plates as well as needing to run for many cycles well over a minute with a lar vs a single 1600 rtp to give the same amount of hphow many more freaking penalties could you possably fit on a bloody module
the part im having trouble understanding is why youre talking about a ship fitting a lar getting killed by alpha damage inside the 1125 second window between repairs if you die that fast youre not facing a small gang either the alpha simply isnt that high at which point your argument fails or youre facing a big gang at which point your argument is irrelevant yes i get that we all get that the thing is we dont think itd be a useful change i was referring to the line think about the bc cruiser and especially frig hulls that are very vulnerable within the alpha hole i describe above as well as not really wanting to plate up or use extenders due to how much speed the plate reduces them by and larger sig radius the extenders give  im not entirely sure what you meant by that but i was responding to it benefits without penalties comes from your whining about plateextender penalties you want all the tank a plate provides without having to slow down so you come up with this at least thats sure how it seems i dont know why youd think this would solve the problem but from what i can tell thats one of the problems you see and are trying to fix also seriously man cool it i know we dont see eye to eye on this but you could at least try not to make yourself look like a fool when you defend your proposal
how can getting the hp from your reppers sooner and spread out over its 1015 second cycle instead of having to wait until the end of its cycle not be a benifit so in your world pointing out the drawbacks of extenders and plates and saying that a repper does not have those draw backs but others like fitting cap and a relativly small rep amount compared to the hp a plate gives is whiningiknow its standard procedure for certain posters to call anybody with a opinion that differs from your own or a point to make a whiner but do try to control it you will look less stupid if you do
never done one of these but i think i got the format correct i was looking through the wiki to see if this has been brought up yet i did not see it but its possible i looked over itid like to inquire to the possibility of an actual log being added into the game so we may see whom is giving to and taking from the corp hangar instead of trying to manage it with audit containers
overdue feature supported
very ditto this has definitely been mentioned here before but i looked over the csm wiki too and i guess it just never made it to a csm meeting beforethis would be especially excellent if it were combined with some sort of autonotification system that ceos and directors could set up both to alert them to low or high stocks of certain things need more ammo in the corporate ammo hangar tab or high volume of unrefined ore in corporate ore dropoff hangar tab and to potential thefts someone took a large quantity of things from a corporate hangar and immediately removed corporate roles
this was sadly voted down i guess my eyes will have to bleed to death now
id love to add more historical quotes to my bio
i disagree with the programming angle this guy summed it up ccp limited the character limit because some people would experience lag if opening a bio that was 50000 characters longthis problem is simply triple the current limit and have a warning pop up for character bios longer than the current length ie warning this characters bio is another x characters long and could cause lag upon opening proceed show this warning again yes nothe idea of limiting what little expression there is in the game is silly supportedalso seriously if their database was so intrinsically connected to its own data the goons would have shut the game down by now
if throwing around simple undirected lag was an exploit they would have nerfed hardins corp history years agoseriously try loading it maybe go cook yourself dinner while you wait the old bio had a character length cap too and it wasnt an extraordinarily long one  not much longer than a forum post iirc i cant imagine this was a reaction to lag issues
supporting on the principle that more faction ships  better tier 1 battleship variants would be cool but i would rather see faction bcs first
oh yeah black amarr ships
as long as you dont drastically although the existing ships sure

i cant play much at work and i dont have an interesting job atm so i browse the forum although this never happened to me or anyone i know its getting more and more annoying to see all that posts about bans im starting to get an impression that soon every large isk transfer in billions will lead to a ban  so how about saving some gm and player time skill points and isk also and do something about itideas1 every direct isk transfer char to char larger than 500mil or something like that should be done through a new window where both characters state the reason for the trasfer that info could be of some help if your account gets banned for no reason it could be avoided by sending say 2x 250 mil but it would definitely make life harder for isk sellers 2the time frame could be added also something like you recieved xxx isk from somecharacter in the last hour you will need to confirmproove that you are not buying the isk or something like that this could be implemented it the client so the only thing that adds traffic to the server is the message you send after typing in reasons for the transfer3 i dont know figure something out yourself cheers
and you my friend got trolled ccp doesnt ban someone for being too rich quit buying dirty iskisaac
clearly you dont hang around in said threads long enough for gms to come in with evidence of the ops of those threads buying isk
thisyes you smell of elderberries kindly leave
maybe this is a reason for me to see this problem oh well if there isnt a problem we shouldnt try to find a solution for it
choosing the immobility drivers subsystem grants a bonus to a midslot module but yields less overall midslots than choosing some of the other electronic subsystem options why would adding a subsystem designed to augment a midslot module add a low slotthis is not the case for any of the other races electronic subsystemsproteus gains max midslots for electronic subsystems when choosing friction extensiontengu gains max midslots for electronic subsystems when choosing obfuscation manifoldlegion gains max highslots for electronic subsystems when choosing energy parasitic complexi propose that the immobility drivers subsystem add 4 midslots instead of 3 midslots and a lowslotps i do realize this screws up some pretty good builds for the loki but it grants just as many and simply makes more sense
oh no theres tradeoffs required when building t3 ships i agree that the module probably isnt as powerful as itd be with 4 mids but its certainly not as powerful as itd be with 6 mids just because the power level can increase doesnt mean it should
way to dive down the slippery slope im arguing for logic and consistency i havent proposed some ludicrous slot distribution like adding 6 mids what i have proposed is entirely consistent with the existing mechanic in terms of both total slots and typical distribution for the subsystem in question and again every other race gains the maximum number of appropriate slots within the standard distribution pattern when choosing a subsystem that adds a bonus to a specific type of module im just not sure why the minmatar ships are always the odd man outmoreover this slot distribution doesnt necessarily make the loki more powerful as i have several good configurations that use extended webs and make good use of the extra low since it is difficult to both shield tank and use webs because you really need 2
no your proposal wasnt unreasonable its not that it was bad its that i tend to prefer changing the status quo only if theres a good reason to do so i dont see a good reason in this case this seems like an issue of preference not of a generallyagreed improvement and i tend to think that the csm should try to confine itself more to the latter
fair enoughi still feel my argument has merit but i respect your perspective
im not sure what to say on one hand its not good to have a 3ship module slot streak running and then just have one different nor is it good to have them all the same diversification my opinion do it to one of the other ship subsystems too 2 for 2 manmay i ask are you one of the lucky few to actually own a loki
im waiting on a few of the newer subsystems to become available
mhh this feels like a market 101 learning session here yes its always better to do inventions dont sell your datacores but selling it is a good way to make isk anywayfor the restmhhh nope i wont tell you how to do it but its pretty obvious though
there is profit in invention and i like wars wars make things go boom that keeps the market going please blow up more things my sell orders are up p
i propose that when a pilot enters a system via a cynosural jump in including titan and black ops bridges he or she does not show up in local until he or she comes ongrid of a stargate or station or speaks in localthough the logic behind why local exists is a little flawed no matter how you cut it up the proposal conforms to the existing logic better than the current system when you cyno in you have not entered the system via a stargate or station cloning facility so there wouldnt be any record of your entry this would be especially true of entry via covert cynosural fields and bridgesmoreover this mechanic boosts the effectiveness of black ops and covert cynos making a black ops supported recon team very stealthy
good idea but i think it should be implemented first for covert cynos only then well see what happenz
this change would be positive like riding a bike with training wheels is positive im still waiting for the day all of local is set to recent speakers mode
thisthe market prices anyall build costs into the final ship price and bpc prices
i like the way the salvage system already works so no change is neccesary butif there would be a change threatening me with a gun on my head  well how about thisfirst to salvage the wreck belongs to him its yellow even to you fleet corp mates and everyone else becomes white to the person who does the first successful salvage plain and simple just like cans i dont know if it changed with the patches but if the can is yellow and you take from it its stealing and you get aggrowell you can shoot him in other words
i was reading the first page and got bored bear with me if a wreck is salvaged by anybody outside that players corpalliance in the first 15 mintues after the wreck is created that gets the ninja salvager flagged after this the salvager can do whatever the hell he likes including looting the wreck
x the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because i support ccps current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wreckskeep salvaging free id also like to thank those people who keep leaving their t2 drones behind once they have handed in a mission would you like to have aggro on a salvager for those as well
00 warfare agreed and ccp is closely looking at this too i expect much to happen regarding this in the near future but that future is in ccps hands based on their workload00 environment i can agree with more piratefaction npc space but not with the improved aisyet the ai will gradually weed its way into 00 space but mostly in commander spawn tacticsmarketcontract improvements i think one of the last things the market system needs is more datacalls as its already overworked with the current system the sales per system is something that you need to acquire from research not just a blanket statement the better contract searches i can agree with thoughui improvements well yes the ui does need to be improved but you can already see the state of the modules by looking at the pos structure admittedly ive only setup poses ive never sieged them but even still i cant see how this would improve the system as it is ccp should be looking into this as we speak hopefully the ui improvements i would recommend would be an improved layout so that people dont get a headache from the overflow of informationccp policy visibility yes their policy is currently being worked on especially with the whole bobzoku incident however as a csm that wont be in your responsibility as were only liaisonslowsec revitalization move level 4 agents to lowsec theres already risk enough in high sec as most of the agents are in trade hubs and player interference is a common thing lowsec does need to be improved but that should be done by boosting it not by nerfing highsec lowsec has level 5 missions which is enough  i ran one level 5 mission and wound up in my cloning station also people who dont want to leave highsec never will its the nature of the beast and the reputation that lowsec has even if it isnt fully deserved is the part that needs working onand much much more i agree that moms need an improvement but the evemail should soon be hit with a sledgehammer and reassembled t3 is a new introduction so give it some time sovereignty is also hopefully being looked at with intense scrutinythat said i do think you could be a valuable asset to the csm remember that a csm is only an elected official to filter through the forums and coalesce the data into a usable concept for ccp to consider best of luck though
not so much adding more npc space but improving the ai there why should more intelligent npc be restricted to missions and wormhole space it would be a way to keep nearby alliances stimulated with combat even if their space isnt threatened at that moment take venal for an example where guristas have sovereignty when they arent off fighting a war rzr could send their troops there to attack guristas towers and camps all of these would be randomly generated by the game system and as a result limit chances of perceived abusefavortism i wasnt aware of the current system being overworked if that is the case then it is unfortunatewhen there are 2060 dreads hitting a pos having to select the module on overview and then find it in space to see if it is online is a complete pain in the ass if youve got brackets turned off you are in for even more suffering nevermind the fact of having modules grouped together and you cant tell if one you selected is online among the cluster of incapacitated ones this all goes for repairing modules too itd be my responsibility to convey what the players have complaints about and this has been one everyone has grumbled about at one point or another perhaps if a new standings system were added to the game which allowed for people in lowsec to pay for additional protection as a buffer for getting used to the harsher environment if theyve been running missions for the entity in control of that system racial faction or corporation owning local stations or bribing them a ship could spawn should they be attacked which would attempt to intercept the pirate and give a chance to escape the very same pirates could do similar things via bribing so a blind eye is turned towards them attacking people in that area agreed thank you for responding to my introduction bunyip

about time we had action against isk farmers and dont listen to lavista he just wants to reassure himself that all that postering he did on csm1 was in fact as relevant and game shaking as he tells himself it was im an internet spaceship politician lookit me
i bet any posturing done by me will get a lot more attentionheh heh heh
oh ouch that hurt oh wait i never claimed to be anyone important but this guy comes out withand since he seems to think he represents all players and i have no actual idea who he is and the fact that he apparently is representing all players now via another player whosesp sole game time is spent in an industrial corp i have to say that does inspire confidence these words carry very little weight when the character you post from has not a single kill on battleclinccom or evekillnet  granted youll probably have alts but not having any kills isnt exactly advertising your pvp is what makes this game interesting to me as well as to my whole staff  line
ank as much as i would love to be manipulated by your feminine ways and horrible dutch accent much like your man eriki do love your excellent website and you do seem to have put in a lot of effort as csm but as a self confessed pacifist where is your passion for eve pew pew this is an area that you and your advisors and indeed your chosen candidate really appear to have little or no grasp of i will be the first to admit i cant tell one end of a bpo from the other but i do know how important miners and manufacturers are to my work do you people know how important we are to your work i think not
level 4 agents should be transitioned to be in lowsec itll bring more players to that area and bring the isk value of missions more in tune with risk vs reward increasing bounties on the rats in lowsec would help this too and speaking of websites i completely revamped mine 
i am a fuel bitc and a pos manager in my small corp and no bodys alt i avoid gate camps when flying to my pos in 00 but i guess that is not enough pvp for you while my skill is not sufficiently high to engage you in a direct combat i promise that if you show up at my pos and i have you in my sights i will do my best to give you your moneys worth of fun you mean no matter how valid a point i make about pvp its worth little in if i dont have any kills that sounds like some religious extremist crap and it hurts ouch  now i am definitely voting for the sensitive types
pew pew drives the economy granted but as you admit in your own thread it is about balance  i am a pirate and a scoundrel but if things arent kept balanced then i will run out of targets pretty quick i support them precisely because they understand this and i am passionate about eve even as a pacifist just in a different way then you
i dont think my pos was directed at you but anyway 1 pos if its one pos it doesnt exactly make you a pos manager since its like once every 30 days you top up the fuel woohoo  and is no real excuse to not have at least a few kills saying that i should come to your pos and youll pew pew me is hilarious and im curious if you even have the skill to pos gun at all or are you talking about autoaggro thats exactly what im saying
hithanks for your response but i feel you have avoided answering the question a littlei was hoping more for a response which listed what you felt to be issues and the the resolution you would promotefor examplei see neutral remote repair being an issue  thus i would campaign for either concord shooting neutral remote repairing or repairing causing an aggro timer so that docking is not possible for 2 minutesthis will allow us to very explicitly see your views on what issues are faced in eve and your philosophy on how these are best fixedi look forward to your responsejaina
sorry i didnt know that commenting on issue which i feel effects me but is not directed at me was against proper etiquette it wonts happen againwell it takes a bit more for one person to find cheapest fuel and deliver it in a transport ship with a small cargo space i dont have time to play for hours at the time so i have to do a bit everyday i also take care of selling off the minerals researching blue prints etc anyhow my point is that as a character with specific role in mind being only 4 months old i do have enough evasion skills to avoid gate camps etc but i hadnt the time to develop other more combat related skills i focus on skills i need including starbase defense for the guns of course if you came with an intention of destroying my pos you will not come alone anyway so inviting you to a fight was a bit of irony in case you didnt notice my point was that my inability to offer you a serious challenge in a fight doesnt exclude my ability to draw conclusions about pvp and what it means for meperhaps we should propose to ccp that people with less then 50 kills should simply be banned from discussing pvp then you would not have to waste your precious time to explain to a noob like me what this game is all about brilliant

boo hoo people have a decent income through a playstyle i dont like nerf themdo you honestly believe that people come out to lowsec if you remove level 4 missions alltogether nope theyll just go do level 3 missions or look for other ways to generate isk in highsec such as mining plently of ore in some level 3 missions ha exploration trading or producing oh  nerf that too as those people have to be dragged kicking and screaming into lowsec by the time people like you are done with the game the only thing that youll have accomplished is making a lot of people quit because a lot of people would quit with their assets intact hoping for better days before venturing into lowsec and if this type of player ventures into lowsec and gets a l4 mission ship ganked a few times you can bet that they quithave you even considered other playstyles as your own i think that people that cant wont make a good csm erik on the other hand has given ample display that he can step outside his own little sandbox and see the impact and consequences of changes to the game mechanics for multiple playstylesby the way for completeness sake ive already brought that level 4 in highsec problem to ccp as part of the missions under review issue ccp didnt even see it as an item worthy of discussion but feel free to bring it up again if you ever make it to the csm so ccp can put you in your place and we can have some lulz if the rest of the csm doesnt protect you from your own stupidity and shoots your issue down that isalso in case you havent noticed i lobbied for lowsec boosts and we got battleshipsized rats in there now as the first step and improved ore is on the horizonthank you for your appreance in eriks thread please come again
this may in fact be the best idea ever honestly run with that as your campaign slogan and youve got all 5 of my votes
thanks for the compliment larkonisyes i am a true pacifist in eve even when i go to 00 or play factional warfare i dont go out with the intention to shoot other players which is an activity that simply is not enjoyable for me as a person and conflicts with my rather strict moral code which i apply to games as much as real lifehowever i look at eve from the perspective of a game designer rather than a player one that did run a ultima online server and has hosted several other game communities as well such as nationstates and is only months away from graduating for a master degree i might not like pvp but there are many players that do in an mmo like ultima online and like eve a game designer should seek to create game mechanics that benefit and balance different playstyles as all playstyles are inevitably intertwined and like a ball of twine one should not peck at strands and attempt to unravel the thing until there is nothing left of the ball itself if we would do so wed end up with a very onedimensional game indeedit took me a long time to find someone with a similar mindset but i truly believe that erik has it he will not just advocate his own playstyle but work towards the betterment of the game as a whole pvp is part of the game pvp is fun for a lot of people so we will do whatever we can to make it even better we may not know every detail of it but well spend the effort of researching any complex issues that show upjust like factional warfare i spent months in the militia did you think id enjoy that kind of activity oh yes i like the shiny ranks a lot but for me fw is rather boring and unrewarding i saw that no other csm picked up fw and that there were many things wrong with it i didnt mind dedicating a lot of my playtime to experience it and nail down all specific issues i could its a shame that a lot of fw players did not understand what i was doing and just criticized my cowardly playstyle but my satisfaction will come when my work comes to fruition and fw improvements will seep into the game eventuallythere was some criticism towards the selection of advisors in another thread but id like to point out that rufus britton has experience in lowsec pvp and is currently packing to head out for 00
bumping vuk because i want to see a capital mining module implemented
you have my sword
some of ccps best decisions stuff like corpses floating in space are from sources much like the inside of istvaans head they really need to let that kind of thinking dominate more of what the game is like
i was going to vote for mazz but your platform of grief and unending torrents of blood has me intrigued please good sir elaborate further on the coming bearpocalypse
are you a girl
nope
i wanted to stay out of this but as i can see there is some personal issues derailing thread how could this happen in eve some tournament ring a bell but dude seriously what is your argument that you will be better than others not that they did great job anyways i mean i like your style and i believe you would but still need convincinghmmm am i also alt of friedrich if i do enough ash kissing maybe i get recruitment convo with free cookies and carriers and vindicator perheps
one of the biggest reasons i think i will be better than others is experience on csm nope but in rl i have lots of experience working in a political environment i am a civil engineer working with local municipalities mostly so things like councils planning commissions etc which is how csm is organized are second nature operating within the csm environment should be easysecondly this csm will be devoting a significant portion of its time helping ccp out with new sov mechanics from my current understanding ccp is looking to utilize a system similar to the faction warfare system as a base for the new sov mechanics look at fooms my corps history within faction warfare we have one of the best records of all the militias for both pvp as well as pve we broke ground in faction war so many times  first to do empire in our case jita raiding where we tanked the npcs instead of just trying to outrun them  i still feel kinda bad for that officer fit bhaalgorn that was only in the guys possession for less than an hour before we popped it first to capture multiple systems first to capture an entire constellation first to show folks that moving into an area is the only real way to do force projection to capture it etc etc yes now there are several organizations within the various militias that are probably as well organized as we are but we were the first and we showed many of them how to do it by example so unlike most candidates i have first hand experience with both the existing sov system running and managing dozens of pos to do sov spam logistics via titan jumps jump freighters though cyno jammed systems etc and as close as possible to the proposed new mechanics with the time spent in faction warfare your not likely to find a candidate that understands both systems nearly as well as i do including their benefits and their flaws considering how ccp intends on working with the game mechanics themselves now is the time to work with ccp in terms of helping to polish up the faction war mechanics to push it beyond that 80 complete stage to balance the system out and to help ccp make sure that sov mechanics are as close to being a completed system when released due to the importance of sov for 00 space and making sure they stick with it to polish it up once released instead of leaving a mostly finished product out there for us players to deal with its flaws and omissions as best as we can
you say that you are a wellrounded player a sort of jack of all trades having experienced both the pvp and logistics aspects do you have any aspect on the trade and manufacturing based parts of the game tooand if so i have another tougher question eve allows you to be many things and if you want you could be a jack of all trades however a specialist in eve will beat out a wellrounded character in that particular area of expertise more times than not so what can you offer as a jack of all trades over some of the more specialized candidates you are running against
just a simple filter option would fix that for example filter everything in local except corp mates alliance buddies wartargets etc that way no more mess in local both for the characters in local and the links in jita or that crapwould be simpler to code in comparision to the op suggest
take care are a group of empire carebears pushing a 3years in noobcorp agenda buried under prose and misdirection they are for mutual pvp and other such wonderful advances search their posts
i suppose you have some evidence to back up your troll comment cause if youd read the campaign thread and all the wonderful work ive been doing the past year youd see a different message and our message seems to be a welcome one to the many players of eve based on the successes in the past two electionshow about you actually read rufus posts he doesnt sound like an empire carebear to meand actually its over 5 years in aliastra and over 4 months in the various militias for factional warfare couldnt get that fact right either
im going to be attendingplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesi encourage anyone who is attending to come up and introduce yourself and pose any questions you might have about my csm campaign you can see pictures on my web site for assistance in recognizing me in the crowd this is a great opportunity for any candidate to meet players and field questions facetoface
well buying ad space is not buying voters acutally nice idea op

vote on cat being turned into chinese foodop 100mil a week is a better price
righto
how much will you offer me
oh how wrong you are as long as youre a quiet drunk and dont create a scene the airline is likely to not care i believe that anyone who serves on the csm needs to love the game and eve community youre representing the interests of tens of thousands of player there has to be passion behind that responsibility otherwise you are robbing the community of proper representation

would love to be able to join fw  dont really want to leave my alliancecorp to do that so supporting this
does anyone know if theres been a change in 11 ive yet to be able to get some game time
absolutely not of course the csm and ccp cant cater for what you as a paying subscriber actually want they wil continue to ignore us in this for a very long time it really concerns me
agreed i think this is more for ccps qa department to work out but i will bring it to their attention at the next meeting
please fix afs
agreedthey dont live up to their name of assault frigates
thanks for the support so far with the big balance thread going on nows the time to get this fixed there are plenty of people asking for it there but of course it can always get ignored or just slip under the radar again so if you havent already done so please post in this thread with it as one of your priorities
since i love assault ships id love to see them receiving more love even if it means encountering even more russian campers in assault ships
afs could use a bit of boost indeedwhat i concider being worth mentioning as well is apart from the missing bonus theres the retribution with only 1 medium slot making it a rather limited af in comparisson to the rest
i very much agree the retribution is entirely useless for solo work unless you want to try honour tackling and outside of frigate hull gangs the only job you need an assault frigate for is heavy tackle turn up for a fleet in a retribution and youll probably be asked to come back in something useful on top of that just to rub it in the alternative for amarr af pilots is outdamaged by t1 frigates someone at ccp is having a laugh at your expense
agree 100 with this afs need that little bit extra and as mentioned why is it that the retribution only has 1 mid slot  kinda makes it hard to pvp in it with only 1 mid slot you either put in a mwdab to keep up with things or you stick a point and not be able to keep up

due to the large discussion already having gone on and the detailed ideas to support it i also give a thumbs up
didnt even knew eve had one in the first place i guess it was used for some testing on sisi so i dont know if they are ready or in a need to do it again but it would be great supported
the first one was where basically everyone had max skills and everything under motherships was seeded on the market there was no concord intervention for pvp in highsec or anything as well
this is just what eve needssupported
buy like 3000 more processers and then switch off the empire cynos aswell d
nerf those ideas they are too good dfully supported
i agree on hp boost but1 you should take logoff time into consideration i would suggest to increase aggressed logoff time for supercaps so it would not be a solo survival tacticmoms ecm burst and clone vat bay1 definately needs boosting not major thoughhangarsdont see any serious problem with them so increasing their size is not vitalolympians is an interesting idea but it needs a lot of tweaking so it would not1 replace dreadnoughts2 be invulnurable for support fleetprobably charging it with smaller ships like logistics either than with moms probly some special this purpose only energy transfers will be more vulnurable to subcapitalsmedium sized shipsdd reworkseems nice but i personally would like to see more deviation of effect types by dd type each race dd will have different effects including cap drainheat damage  warp disruption  maybe mass web etcand a really like an idea of personal aoe poslike temprorary shield  it would be nice and encourage to use moms in large scale fightsand a small idea of my ownbiggest problem of supercapital use in large fleet on fleet battles is definately ammount of damage that kills it almost as fast as regular capital shipi think we can introduce the following solutionall supercapitals get strontium bay as pos  and after shield  armor and lets say some ammount of structure is destroyed supercapital goes into reinforced mode similar to pos but in smaller period ofcourse lets say for example moms for 30 minutes and titan for 1 hour cannot move  fight or logoff etc probly may be a good idea to give support fleet the ability to heal the damage and get their supercapitals out of reinforced stateit will give ability to shutdown supercapitals in combat without destroying them and support fleets will have time to respond and save thembut ofcourse massive hp boost is needed anyway otherwise this solution may not work in full strenght
i havent proposed the idea in the features forum but ill post it here insteadlet titans fit a siege module idea originally posted here it seems like the perfect compliment to a fleet of dreadnoughts and could replace a battleship fleet for anti support with the doomsday device you jump bridge in the dreads with the titan following any battleships or hics that run in for the tackle or warp into grid to snipe get doomsdayed the damage on titan guns in siege mode is also higher than a dreads which makes me wonder if they originally planned to allow siege modules on titans in the first place it would certainly make them viable as more than a glorified smartbomb and i would actually want to fly one of these if they were changedit does make the titan more powerful but the tradeoff is its more vulnerable to being destroyed in very large capital fights almost always a guaranteed primary target but in smaller capital fights it would be invaluable
 why again would you as a normal pilot want more scaps on the battlefieldsuper caps are so insanely overpowered compared to anything else in came it is rediculess they totally remove any means of balanceand dont give me some bull with they cost a lot of isk well so do a best officer fitted bs one of those can get over 30 billions easy if any one was crazy enough to fit it but that doesnt mean it is balanced if it had the abillity to take out whole fleets by itselfcaps are overpowered too after the siege and tri modules was introducedanything that cant be taken down by 4 well fitted bss with max skilled pilots and t2 fit is overpowered to the point that it needs to be rebalanced since it absolete any other ship type only a matter of time so people can fly them you already see now that when the cap fleet are comming almost any other ship then a cap is useless and a wasted of pilot spacemy solutionremove the bposbpcs for super caps and reimburse the amount they costed to the corpallianceand let the last of these roam untill they diethen remove any siege and tri module bpo and bpc and do the same with these while removing the modules on market and in hangers and on ships and reimburse the producers with 10 of its value and the mat it took to build themnow the balance is way better although a rebalance of the dreads would be needed to get their dmg up a bit but keep their tank low
sound and well thought out suggestion
by putting super caps on the field in more situations theyre more likely to die especially when it comes to titans and why their proliferation is so high its very hard to make a mistake in a titan atm its more about luck to get kills people point to shrike for titan losses but only 2 of his were in any sort of actual combat the other 2 were based on nano bumping using pos passwords thats more a flaw of game function mo was also in combat but was reimburse similar to a mm mothership due to a change in servers for testing reasons by the devs of the 20 or so titans that have died in game 4 were logged off 1 was a spy sellout 3 were to pos bumping outta shields of the remaining 2 were total gits warping into fights they never should have been involved in 1 was due to a terrible cyno and possibly a sellout for a grudge out of the 20 or so killed maybe 10 of those were legit good kills 10 titans in 25 years of game play lost to legitimate fightsthese proposals are geared towards making the ships more vulnerable while giving them a different role than just damage for the titans its ment to remove their ability to 1 or 2 volley fleets for a more tactical role and more risk the only real overpowering problem with capitals right now is the remote repping abilities of carriers and how its been implimented i would personally like to see it removed or allowed only in triage or not at all i mean why do we even have a logistics ship in game if carriers are used far more often and far more practically in most situations

i have noticed that that there are a lot of ideas about what the new system should be like but there arnt many suggestions about how ccp should handle the transitional period between the current sov system and whatever sov that comes nexti posted a suggestion that is probably of the same mind as many others just with my spin on it i was thinking more of a orbiting colony a small station then eventually later expansions could add the planet stuffi posted it in 3 pieces but the most interesting is probably the last one that covers the transitionhope you guys like it i for one am routing for planetary sov
simple  to ease the management of hundreds of corp members and thousands of alliance members and get them on the same page when they log in can ccp not make the alliance and corp channels motd capable so that the ceo possibly directors and alliance executor can post in these channelswhat say you all yes or no bad idea or good idea
make it work just like a normal channel in that you can close itpls alliance chat is entirely in a regular channel alliance chat itself is completely empty you cant kick mute ban or invite alts into alliance chat
got the same idea maybe in the wrong threadbut anyway supportder nudelmann
i was under the impression you could change the motd in allaince chat or corp chatcourse i tend to not use them if at all

first of allyou cant reuse a password in the first place second while the intention is good the solution put forward only serves to annoy more people than it helpsi would be ed off if a game forces me to change my password on a regular basis granted that i do it eve shouldnt force me to do anything but pay my subscriptionediton the other hand but implementing a security warning that is shown on the characterselection screen could workbasically if you havent changed your password for x amount of time it will say we recommend that you change your password in big bold letters
first off anyone who posts a stupid idea like this and has a crap ton of alts posting support is just begging for trouble which makes this idea completely stupidsecondly if you are running a computer with little to no security on it and you go off and make a dumbass move in buying isk you deserve to be hackedthirdly it is your responsibility to secure your account if you dont got brains enough to figure that out then i sincerely hope you enjoy being hackeddont blame ccp for the lack of intelligence you haveget a brain and actually use itnot supported
do you even know what reusing passwords means anyways wrong and wrong you would be really surprised the number of eve accounts you can log into if you capture the username  password  email handed over to a ty forum with users that play eve not like ive ever done it personally but you know ive seen it done a lot of people reuse their passwordsin my experience users cant be trusted with their first and second choices of passwords the periodic changes dont have to be often and perhaps a minimum complexity requirement will do just fine but if you let people do what they want you will always have a certain percentage of people that get hacked when in reality they input their same password somewhere elsei find this quote funny
this is extremely constructive since ccp suffers no negative consequences when an account is hijacked and the isk spread around to other accounts and real  is exchanged because of it maaaan  those guys that arent more computer savvy then the average population
oh yeah thats constructive alright whats next ccp being blamed for blowing up your ship because you forgot to fit it properlyccp being blamed for you accepting a contract scamccp being blamed because you forgot to change your diaperswould you like a bottle with thati can take care of myself what the hell is your problem
confirming i want to have mazzilliu babies and support all her ideashow much for pics 
are you allowed to empty quote something just to let it stand alone and people can see its wrongness a second timeaccountpersonal information is on an entirely different level then space monies i dont really see where you are getting at with your last line clearly if i know enough to want these policies i probably know enough not to break my own rules
let me break it down into small words so you can understand a little more easilystop blaming ccp for your mistakeseven a 6 year old can figure this outforcing people to change passwords for there stupid lack of security and common sense is a total waste of timeall your going to do is make customers mad and it will not fix a single bloody thingthere will stil be idiots who install limewirethere will still be idiots who buy isk and get scammedkeyloggers will always be there for downloading pleasureif you cant think beyond your delusional state than im done here because its like talking to a brickwall nevermind a child
what mistakes have i done you should elaborate more on that part since i have no idea what you are talking aboutthe issue isnt individuals computers being infected with viruses ccp cant do much to help that the issue is easily obtained massive lists of passwords from hacked forums malicious forums etc gathering user info handed to them like candy a matchup of those lists with eve login info will produce a large number of results enforcing password requirements will decrease that number of resultsfor example everybody warns each other about reusing their login info on com but what if scrapheap challenge was hacked and their database backed up it only takes a few days to get a ton of passwords from a stolen phpbb3 or vbullettin database it is always the sites you trust that pose the greatest threat
try and go in and change your password to something then then go back in and try to change it back to your old password againyou will find that you cant conclusion you cant reuse old passwordsnobody is it at all questioning that eitherthe csm already raised a big bunch of securityrelated things however when it comes to passwords eventually the user has to be trusted not that i mind if it requires me to have a minimum complexitymine are about as complex as they get but we already discussed with ccp about thatbasically ccp cant save its users theres still a lot of things that ccp can do to help and that i support but anything intrusive like being forced to change passwords on a regular basis is stupid
in my experience the more often you make people change their passwords the less secure those passwords get its not quite as bad with a computer game as it is in a workplace scenario since you can write it down without it being a security breach but itd still be a bad idea also i dislike a game that i pay for being obnoxious about security  its goal should be to let me play easy not to annoy me with security measures to protect fools if my bank doesnt make me change passwords regularly neither should my computer games also spamming alt support is childish
which mistakes youve donealt spammingoh you meant the topic im sorryyour posting about password security that imlpies youve been hit or know someone who is that or your stupidly paranoidnow your arguing that ccp needs to step up security due to forum attacksgot news for yah pal when someone starts getting worried about security they usually go to the sourcethis whole proposal is bloody stupid as a result of your logici manage phpbb3 boards myself and if there was a concern for security as far as sql injection and password hacking theres only 3 factors1 the user2 the admin3 the server forumsnote i said user firstmost cases the server getting compromised along with the admin are few and far betweenstatistically speaking its the user whose been compromised not the serverusers do stupid things after allas i said before you started flapping your gums the user is responsible for his or her own securityyet you presume that every user is too stupid to be responsible to keep to a secure passwordi answer you who the hell do you think you are to make such a presumptionwe can speak for ourselves if i choose to use a massively complicated password ill use itif i choose to use 12345 as a password then that is my bloody rightif i get hit then thats my problem not yours not ccpccp has told us time and time again use effective passwordsdont buy isk dont do this dont do thattelling ccp to change our diapers will not fix the problemthe only way people will learn is to get hit once or twice until it sinks inbut most will blame ccp wont they wah wah cry me a riverwhich is why i dont support antiscamming systems short of being able to mute them for those who are actually picky about the crap thats sprayed on localsupports darwin awardsif they cant read then your wasting your breath with this ideathis is nothing more than sheer paranoiayou should be more concerned about the users who use the same passwords for hotmailcom and yahoocom and eve online not about the ones who have groups of passwords based on how secure the servers are or one for each and every little itemstop blaming ccp for your shortcomings and that goes for the rest of you who happen to support this little ideagrow up stop being lazy change your bloody password and use something unique for oncejust keep in mind this whole system is easily defeated with a simple keylogger all thanks to windowsunless you use a mac or linux then the odds of getting hit are dependent on your common senseyou keep pushing for something that would anoy the users in the name of securitywhen in fact you are not helping but making it worsethis changes nothing as far as securitybecause all one would have to do is keylog your computer and thereby rendering this whole system uselessjust like your proposal completely useless
aha now theres a detail i hadnt known before but theres still no provision for the users that set their password to something stupid and never change it more specifically reusing it from other websites a forced password change at least once in a players lifetime should clear up the majority of reusedonothersites passwords most people have no clue that reusing their sgrs33rt43wve2 password on somesketchygamesforumcom and eveonlinecom with same username is a security risk it doesnt have to be as obnoxious as sayyyy pandemic legion forums but if there are restrictions on the number of login attempts a weak password is far superior to a password that is reused on another website its the difference between handing it over and making them guess at it youre right i just wasnt subtle enough and ended up getting caught
hey i heard thatpressing enter every fewwords is a goodway to get peopleto read what youretrying to say
are you talking about the forumsshadowcadrecomboards if so i can understand why you take that attitude since you have about twelve users that an eve account stealer would even take an interest in small fishiesso the user is the biggest threat to security you even say so yourself then you say we should not attempt to reduce the vulnerabilitythis is very funny to me because admins reuse their passwords as well also incompetentuneducated server admins for eve corp forums are generally the rule rather then the exceptionsomeone who knows a mere desktop computer can crack 50 of the passwords from the average stolen phpbb2 forum database in a few minutes with a good dictionary and a few  more in a few days using different methods putting targeted keyloggers on eve players computers takes some social engineering for every single target and is a serious crime of some sort and only nets you one password setting up an eve related website that innocently asks users to log in to get access to something is not a crime at all nets you a zillion passwords and a certain  of them will work on eve accountsand ofc hacking a preexisting eve related website is very much a crime but less time investment and no problem if you live in certain foreign countries nets same end result as above pointhahaha do ittttso i can post all your top secret worlds end consortium director forums all over the internetswho has to clean up the mess afterwards always ccp in the endsign me up for the yahoocom and hotmailcom csm council thingy pleaseman i really want to use this better password but i cant be arsed to change it from 123456 i really wish ccp could force me to do it
your arrogance and ignorance is just bafflingfor someone who is so concerned about security you know very little about it as a wholeregardless you can keep alt spamming away you will get nowhere
im voting yes because1 mazz promised me a shaved llama  with a goatee beard2 mazz said if i didnt vote yes i would learn a whole new use for pineapples3 its a damn fine idea
no because it doesnt help in real life its not going to help game lifeforced password changes is a concept for people write down their passwords on paper and leave the paper in a draw or on the table etc this forced people to protect themselves from themselves you cant protect the stupid from themselves if they change their password on eve theyll probably change their password on eve related websites as well so its stupid to force them to change their eve passwordto be blunt if ccp forced this id petition my password changes every time my password expired here ive been forced to change my password here is a petition back to extend my password expiry save ccp money not likely
exactly
spot on
im inclined to go with this too although if i disagree with maz will she get kugu to hack my computer and kill me with it the stupid people this will be targeted at probably wont take notice yes their pws might become slightly more secure but it wont stop them duplicating that pwi see no harm in implementing this feature or at the very least a warning every 3 months or so on the log in screen
would you prefer that ccp introduce other optional security measures to protect your account how about mandatory security measurestake a look at final fantasy xi online and world of warcraft both of them are offering keyfob random number generators linked to their players accounts that allow them to use one randomly generated number to access their account and play both of them are optional purchaseson the other hand most websites that have had problems with spammers and bots have captcha authentication to thwart those sorts of security breaches rumor has it that these security measures are vulnerable to compromise by sufficiently advanced ais dont laugh theyre in developmentboth of these examples are used all of the time by major corporations to enhance their security and make sure that something doesnt happen in irl these measures cost lots of money but they save much more when used properlyand you say that because something is a hindrance to your real life that it cannot possibly enhance your recreational pursuitsheaven forbid that someone take the initiative to protect you from yourselfsupported
to quote my best friendyou cant fix stupidyou want ccp to remind you to change the passwords on your pos shields your secure cansyou want ccp to hold your itty bitty little hand as you leave the station and fly off on some missionplease grow a backbone people
simple request here in 00 you are often sharing regions and even in empire you often do not want to fly far for goodstherefore add a 5 jump filter along with the current system station and regionadditionally add a filter on the main screen that will remove all orders from nonalliancecorp mates even better make it possible for players to only offer sell orders only to members of their corpalliance then you know that the special offers you give will not be used by a hostile
sounds good to me
the xjump filter makes some senseyoud make it an option not just 5 but id like to see the market interface fixed to the point where it isnt necessary instead the idea to filter out nonalliance orders wont happen though  itd be laggy and the game mechanics dont like it
supporting my own thread
wow how the hell does ccp justify this one are we going to have to have another speed nerf just so phoenixs and nags can hit something lolthat is quite pathetic that any cap ship can speed tank another cap ship
after the missile calculation change all missiles ed up not much more to say change it back a stupid move to change it like they did in the first placeand why again should ab be a 95 tank against missile  not like they work anything like this on turretsyou already have mwds which is against missiles as long range and ab which worked better against turret at close range while turret have no problem hitting stuff at longer range missiles still have the same problem as if they where 1km from them actually bigger problems since they can move faster at long rangeanyway long in short change the missile calculation back to be signature as main calculation and tweak it
i believe this new scanning system as a whole has caused nothing but trouble sure the old system had its flaws but this new one creates more problems than it solves its very slow more complicated much more difficult to manage and is generally an eyesorethis must be one of those ideas ccp thought was good on paper however on implementation im all for a new scanning system albeit a scanning system thats efficient and practical one that works

i have to agree that it is getting out of hand
it should just round up 199999999 a 10 up or down it rounds out the number and reports it like almost 200 millionround up to the nearest even million unit149999999 is almost 150 millionpretty easy even if they go 149000999 its still almost 150 millionsupported for rounding up to nearest million and reporting it
ive already explained this  its not a benefit for a cap boosterfueled setup under neuting getting it all in one shot with a cycle time comparable to your injectors is actually far preferable to spreading it out since it means you get to use more of your cap and have less of it get sucked away this seems far more common than the number of fights where a minuscule injection of hp will save team active tank to fight another day i expect your change would actually be a net detriment for activetanked pvp fits ive said it twice now  i dont know what you were talking about i replied as best i could to a thoroughly unclear statement phrase your commentary  the bottom two paragraphs of post 44  more clearly and then maybe we can have a useful discussion edit postscrub make that post 31
cleanedplease stay ontopic and post with respect towards fellow players
no support in addition to all the reasons previously mentioned if you had your way youd be killing one of the advantages of shield boosterstransporters hp at the beginning of the cycle
i lawl at this threahdi have gank mega dual rep hyp and dual rep domi and a shield hyp at ready i fly the dual rep hyp most then shield hyp then the mega then domi only for rr gangs with domi the reps of the active tanks are fineif this has been made because of the malstrom then look at the maelstroms bonuses and think of remapping them since it gets a large percentage of boosting from the 1 bonusbut to say the least a maelstrom is easly beat if u no how to beat it
where the fck do you get the idea that im complaining about small ships do you understand the differance between pointing out a benifit the change i suggest gives over extenders and plates like you and others asked me to do and complaining about summatand where do you get the benifits without penalties comment from reps use loads of cap and have huge fitting costs compared to plates as well as needing to run for many cycles well over a minute with a lar vs a single 1600 rtp to give the same amount of hphow many more freaking penalties could you possably fit on a bloody modulejust fyi the lar has more penalties because its actually functioning to repair the ships armor right there so it needs alot of power to use yet plates or just like a add on you get a sheet of metal and apply it to your ship so it doesnt use cap or to much pg or cpu becaue its basicly adding more armor not repairing big holes in you armor on the spotits like saying body armor or nano botsnano bots not beeing expensive and are buyable p the nano bots take a while to work but wen they do u feel brillant but body armor u feel heavy slow but loads of protection
i already said that the second option took the 400 cap as it does now but instead of repping at the end of the cycle it does it over the cycle so you get the 800hp over the 11 seconds instead of at the endthere is nothing wrong with my comentary or my points i do suggest you use less provocative and juvinille terms in your replies and stear clear of making accusations about whining ect and other childish and inflamatorytrolly remarks when somebody is explaining the pros and cons of each system
i think everybody knows how reppersboosters work and how plates work bud but the fact remains that the fitting and cap costs for them is absurd when you compare it to the benifits they give in comparison to plateslets be honest the only ppl who use active tanks all the time are carebear mission runners and ratters active tanks do have a small application in pvp but only in a very limited sense because of the drawbacks vs benifit situation they have compared to plated fitswhat is it with this forum that everybody thinks a poster has a alternative reason for their idea is that why others post here or just how those who are accusing me of it do things
the ore is not the problem its mineral prices mex iso nocx zyd are supposed to make low sec ores more valuable but their prices are in the toilet due to rat and drone loot providing far too much of them these sources need eliminated andor rebalanced to bring the price of these minerals back up and restore low sec ore to being more valuableincreasing the size of asteroids would be nice too though so you dont waste so much time switching targets as it stands an additional few percent yield bonus is useless since mining out a rock in 21 cycles is no better than 26 cycles
this is very probably the easiest solution of allit would be a lot easier if the minerals from rats and loot due to inefficiencies would be reduced by 50 to 75 it would nearly instantly spark a hike in mineral prices today the missioner who salvages the ships they destroyed during the mission makes about as much in minerals as a miner way to undercut an entire profession at the same time the miner in a hulk is sitting in a 100 million isk ship with a giant bullseye painted on the back the only alternative is to go to nul sec with covetors with vastly reduced mining ability as a result it takes longer to mine the ore which increases the miners exposure to risk in a ship that is even less equipped to defend itself against nul sec threats hows that for game balanceminers sorely need a space frame that is better suited to handle the risks of nul sec as well as a real advantage compared to alternative mineral sources or if ccp is not inclined to do this it has to get rid of the mining profession altogether instead of keeping up the pretenseabulurd bonifaceme meceo
longterm yeah thats the solution mining should be the primary source of minerals not missioning thing is if you try to do that right now youll mess up everything there arent enough miners to support the mineral needs of the economy and trying to make them would spark massive price increases hence i want to see mining boosts like this proposal added before we even think of nerfing mission mineral income
thispeople keep screaming about drone drops and mission drops when the problem is elsewhereits only a symptom of the problemmy suggestion is to start with the nerfing of macro miners make all asteroid belts scannedrandom and thus requiring a human brain to actually find good ore to mine then kick up the value of the rock to make mission mineral hunting not so profitablethe rest should fall into line
the security status mechanic has many good aspects but one thing it does that is less desirable is to make it difficult for people to establish and hold a presence in lowsecurity space without ultimately finding themselves barred from highsec this is not a problem for 10 pirates but there are many other groups who could use lowsec to a far greater extent than they presently do if this problem were reduced as such id like to propose an extension of the concept of occupancy of lowsec space as it is currently used in factional warfare to allow corporations to gain occupancy of nonfw lowsec systems and thereby reduce their sec status penalties for defending their space as well as possibly also gaining other benefits i know that the instantaneous reaction to this will either be pirates are just going to get free ganks or big alliances are going to take over everything but i believe that those problems can be addressed effectively while leaving the core of the idea intact and making this a serious option for smaller corporations here is one example of how this could be implemented i do not claim that it is perfectly balanced and it will certainly need significant review by ccp before it is implemented but i believe that it should address most of the obvious concerns effectively every lowsec system not used for factional warfare will gain a control bunker this will not be attackable but will instead be a control point every hour the corporation with the most shipminutes spent in the space around the bunker will gain one point at each downtime whichever corporation meeting the standings requirement has gained the most points in the last week will gain occupancy of the system the standings requirements are the same as for anchoring a pos 10 of corp standing to the faction holding sovereignty for every 01 of system sec so to take a minmatar 03 system you need 30 corp standing towards the minmatar republic occupancy would offer the following benefits  a 25 fuel use for poses in the system the same as sovereignty 1 provides  any of your players may shoot a 01 sec player as if they were 100 without gaining a gcc or losing sec status  if any player gains a gcc in the system your corp will gain kill rights on that player this works best if one of the transferable kill right systems proposed is implemented but it could be done even without such a system if a corporation in an alliance gains occupancy the entire alliance gains the first two of the above benefits however the corporation must hold the system in its own right as well i would like to see some kind of cap on how many systems a single corporation can gain occupancy of preferably a skillbased cap though a hard cap could also work flavourfully the empires are busy with factional warfare and are looking to pass off security duties in unimportant systems to trustworthy corporations this is why unprovoked attacks on sec players are still disallowed and why standings requirements are in place however it would in practice function much more as a set of options for corporations to defend their space more aggressively than is currently allowed i expect alliances will take some systems of course but most major alliance corporations do not have enough standing to take anything and the above bonuses will not likely convince them to try on a large scale i acknowledge that this is likely to be a controversial proposal and that there may well be aspects of it that i have overlooked the detailed proposal is intended as an example not as the only way it can be done however i think that this idea properly implemented will revitalize lowsec and give new options to many corps who would otherwise stay in highsec and that it is worth bringing forward to ccp
i like where your goingbut theres still the nagging issue of the ever popular pirates that love to prey on most players in low secuntil there is a balanced solution to that problem most will not likely go thereif there was a way to bring forth a police enforcement incentive much like a 00 alliance would provide in there own territorial areas that coordinates with the empire navy or concord it would be quite fun and a challengesurely the pirates grow tired of one ended fights and campingwe need some all out fightsfights that pirates are forced to fight not the ones they pick
lowsec piracy will never change and lowsec will never be as popular as highsec those are basically unchangeable aspects of eve and theyre not even bad ones at that lowsec isnt bad because its dangerous its bad because its dangerous with too little corresponding benefit to bring out the people who are willing to accept danger in search of profit  and yes they do exist this is why i keep proposing changes to lowsec im not under some delusion that it will ever be half as popular as highsec because it wont be the number of players interested in it simply isnt as high i just want it to be an environment that more people find to be worth dabbling in maybe even moving residency to it may never be as popular but it can and should be made better and more popular
i agree with herschel in this case i know shocking right  the reason i dont really want to move to low sec is that its not very attractive to me from a purely profit vs loss standpoint in high sec i can make substantial amounts of money with very little risk yes risk does exist as our recent loss of a ship during a war dec proves but it is far less than what you encounter is lowsec and this is the core reason why low sec is so unattractive nullsec really doesnt figure into the arguement imo since thats a completely different beasti like the idea behind the op so i will offer tentative support though i think theres a lot of implementation that needs to be hashed out as herschel mentions in the op himself
yep id have to agree with that im just a bit hesitant as very few ideas in low sec are even possible let alone doable herschel is far better than most tho
you mean like a local defence forcegang made up of players if you want to occupy your own space then you should be able to fight for it yourselfinteresting ideas but they need some work tbh the op clearly has no clue about lowsec agro mechanics etc etc but some form of occupancy by lowsec dwelling corps giving certain benefits might entice more people to lowsec
 gutsy for a whelp like you to say that about hersch
the only assumptions i made in writing my proposal that i can imagine youre objecting to are that gate guns will fire on anyone at a low enough sec whether theyve aggressed recently or not and that shooting someone who is at a low enough sec statusi believe 50 will not lower you further are either of these assumptions wrong did i make an erroneous assumption somewhere else i havent played around with all the various sec status interactions having never been a serious lowsec pirate so its possible i made a mistake somewhere but id like to get a better explanation of what it is i dont think i botched anything that fundamental but if i actually have no clue id definitely like some enlightenmentassuming trassier is trasslers alt hes been playing a year longer than i have and with more experience at lowsec pvp than me besidesgiven that hes 100 and im 42 if he has objections id like to hear them
ive never seen you say anything without researching or knowing about that one thing specificallyfor someone to say you dont know what your talking about is like saying the sky is not blue but greenwell maybe not like that exactly and im not saying your infallible but your rarely ever off key eitherwhich is why i stalk your posts
and i appreciate the vote of confidence if itd been someone less knowledgeable i wouldnt have said anything i dont know lark especially well but judging by the reaction to his candidacy thread his opinion is one i ought to pay attention to and hes certainly no whelp i dont think i made any glaring errors but if he says i did im going to doublecheck it for sure
a whelp like me and just who are you
i am indeed my main just recently joined the 90 day clubsentries will never agress a player for simply having a low ss they require you to have a gcc or be flagged somehow to the owning corp in the case of stations or the empire in the case of gate guns i may have been a little harsh with my initial statementi like the idea of tying this into standings but i cant see it working out too well tbqh perhaps in lieu of this either some sort of cash bribe should be offered isk sink or once the bunker is taken a specific task is set which requires multiple people to carry out
 read the name o and i tend to defend hersch from the disrespectful peoplebut since you where kind enough to withdraw so shall i
seriously damn could have sworn i heard about sentries autoaggressing for low sec status oh well that was easily the least important of the bonuses anyways doesnt matter too much if its removed ill go edit the op as for the standings thing that was part roleplay and part a way of dealing with the oh god the goons will conquer everything concerns people have whenever you mention anything about buffing lowsec in a way that doesnt expressly forbid alliances from participatinglike fw personally ive never really understood why people thought the big alliances would bother with lowsec space  yeah that vanadium moon is really going to bring down the ravenous hordes  but its sensible on its own merits too even if players are gaining occupancy theyre not sovereign and the owners wont let you have it if they dont like you as for the details of conquest i went through a few different ideas i sort of liked the one about tying it into the wardec system  declaring a war with the stated objective of taking one particular system  but concerns about multiple aggressors swapping it off to alts and limits on how many could be gainedlost per week scuttled it the proposal above was the simplest that i thought would work effectively you can certainly elaborate on it from there but i wanted to give people an idea of how it could work in practice without it being overwhelmingsince i have a tendency to write too bloody much as it is i dont need complicated ideas to make it worse im not sure if i like your idea  control being contestable at any point appeals to me as does the natural way it spreads out the contest to prevent alarmclocking and other tz issues all that said the proposal i want to go forward here is the concept not the specific implementation i outlined ccp can pretty it up later but its the general proposal im concerned with here
good ideas maybe itll make it farther this time around itll certainly be an improvement
i like the new pos graphics when its nice and calm around the bubble but i guess it would be difficult to see anything when its under attack the option to switch between graphics would be great if that could be implementededit didnt see it was voted down oh well
hope ccp designers will give us a chance do not become crazy during a pos managment operations 1 to ask for removing the animation on pos shield or add an option to switchoff the animation effects
if ccp can not tell me why it shouldnt be longer i can only support this for i see no reason not to
imagines having a decorations page that lags everyone out
if lag was an exploit they would have nerfed jita by now
more variety would be grand ive always wanted to fly a drake that is different from every other drake out there be it tech ii or just a navy version
you can petition your own isk transactions and a gm can tell you if its clear or not and if not at least you wont get bannedthe only trouble is when you have a ton of isk transactions v
one more question and on a more serious note will you be forming a party with istvaan to herald in the bearpocalypse
i think i will try to solo them first but if that fails then much like voltron we may have to join forces to become powerful enough to defeat the carebear menace
i will vote for you on the assumption that your appearance in iceland will result in picsi will then save said pics for my ogling pleasure
seriously though1 wants to fix macrohauling isk farmers in a way thats inline with fine eve tradition1b boosting lowsec activity by legitimate players at the same time2 active pvper familiar with 00 concerns and logistics has significant lowsecsolo experience3 known for having a cut the bull and get to the point attitudeif the csm had more people like this maybe theyd actually achieve something and be useful
mazz for csm president papa doc for life one area that needs improvement is the whole pos managment interfaceaccess i can currently see any of my assets anywhere in the game but i cant see how much fuelmins i have in a pos in the same systemhrmm id like to see remote viewing of pos fuelmins added
i will be on eve tv or something i think i just finished taking some source pics for some propaganda to be released laterthe api can be used to do this currently
with ccp getting around to confirming our acceptance in the race for csm today i would like to officially announce that i am now on the ballot so to speak so this post is not entirely devoid of content to mull over i would like to present to you the voting public my thoughts on transferable killrights something that i think should be implemented as soon as possible as i believe it is in line with what ccp and the players vision on eve is transferable killrightsintroductiona single shard for some people it is merely a piece of marketing spin by ccp to sell eve as a unique experience for the majority of us though the idea of a single shard universe to play in when combined with characters that dont get maxed out in a matter of weeks or even months means that for our actions there are potential consequences to our every action and our every word killrights are such a consequence right now in eve kill rights are something that are on the whole ignored by many but what if those killrights could be sold or given to another player what if that noob in a badger you kill today could spawn a 90m sp pvp specialist gunning for you tomorrow in a universe where frankly everything is for sale including concord turning a blind eye to the deaths of millions of crew members for a paltry bribe should the bounty hunter not have a role the answer i believe is transferable kill rights mechanicsthere has been much discussion over the years about how this could be achieved and the answer i think is a reasonably simple one instead of kill rights being some esoteric entry on part of our character sheet we never use they should become a real commodity when you are killed in a way that would normally give you a kill right you are given the next time you appear in a station a small 01m3 item that you plug in much like an implant this allows you the same rights as the current kill right mechanic if you are a one week old new player with no way of using the kill right what use is it well then you can trade them on the contracts system as with any commodity you can set your own terms maybe some people will sell them to gain a bit of isk and hope the other person kills the person named maybe to try an ensure the kill you offer an new form of isk on completion contract which when the kill right is used up transfers isk to the person using it all of this will of course require some programming on ccps side and there certain are ways the mechanic can be abused it wouldnt be impossible to contact the person you have kill rights on and terminate them with their consent to claim the isk and split it with them for instance i believe however that the market will adjust for this i believe that people will be willing for pay a little bit of isk to gain access to a kill right in this way i think the hunt and the kill will be enough of a reward to a certain type of player who wants to do some solo pvp on the side now before all the pirates start complaining that this is a nerf to their existence just think for a second what it could mean if you have access to high sec and you have bought a kill right on someone that happens to be flying past in a freighter headed for jita loaded down with some tasty items its yours for the taking if you are in low sec and you want to grab that person whos been bugging you recently and the only thing you can use to tackle him quick enough is an inty you can buy a kill right and no longer be blown away by the gateguns there will be things that i havent thought of that result from this post and id be glad if they could be pointed out so i can modify it before putting it in the ideas section let me know what you guys thinkif you have any questions about this or anything else you know how to get hold of me
get seriouslets say for arguments sake you get elected with such a slogan and then what  if you insist i am sure erik can make such a proposal to them so whati would imagine that as a dedicated player with 5 accounts you have some understanding of the way ccp thinks i mean what part of the word balance is hard to understand you all seem to blame erik and ankhe for their pacifists soft approach but refuse to see that it is ccp that ultimately dictates the terms and they will not accept proposals coming out from an attitude which you demonstrate if you would get chosen as a csm your impressive killboard will not be of relevance as long as you refuse to acknowledge that fact erik in his responses may luck the detail some of you insist about however that is because he understands that an effective csm in ccps terms is first and foremost a person with an open and flexible attitude and not one that desperately clings to his ideas and only cares for his own play style if our attitudes here are so outlandish and unpopular for you why dont you stop wasting your time and focus on supporting larkonis dispite being a blood thirsty pirat he seems to have respect for other play styles balance and understands honest effort when he sees it
p0wned asking to move lvl 4s to lowsec only is the wrong direction what we need is to move level 5 agents into highsec so that the majority of eve players according to one of the quens over 80 of eve inhabitants live in highsec have a real pve challenge and not only weak rats that are eaten by a faction fitted cnr like french fries by a fat kid
if you want a challenge go and pew pew sentient players or go and find some sleepers do you honestly think people would do level 4s if the income from them was nerfed and the difficulty ramped up the first one or two times you run a mission it may be difficult but only because you dont know how to run it after that theyre all pretty simple even the level 5sat the moment ccp shouldnt be encouraging more people back into high sec and they have stated several times that level 4s in high sec were a mistake but gentley nudging them back out into lownullsec
in response to the sickening take care platform shaping up might i suggest a similar platform for the miscreants and malcontents around here you could even call ittake everything
cool beans but then id require a 2 term csm member to adopt me and use me as a mouthpiece to push hisher agendas through
can a csm be an effective leaderrepresentive of the people if that person is banned from the forums
that might be good qualities if you are a sergeant in the army but certainly not when you are supposed to represent people besides your self and deal with people that are the same level as you well at least i hope you aim at doing more than simply try to force through your own self orientated agenda because i see very little point why others should support you in that and vote for youi see you have listed some problems but i do not see you listing any well considered solutions except beat it with a hammer until it works solutions of course does overall game balance mean nothing to you do you even recognize potential bad side effects of your proposed changes
and my bow
and my axe
i represent what my kind of players feel is fair and balanced in eveif one has to please the masses one ends up with nothing being done because wether you are capable of seeing it or not eve is divided in two major parts probably more parts but lets say two for simplicity the hardcore and the softcore pleasing them both will just end up with the csm being all about talks and not about doing i am here to do thingsit is not a self oriented agenda none of the changes purposed will have much if any effect on me it is changes that i and many others feel are necassary for a well balanced and fun game experiencemy solutions are better than no solutions at all and i do not see you posting anything constructive except for your personal dislike if you feel you can do better what is stopping youyou can not just post have you considered the negative of your solutions and leave it be every solution has a negative side be it mine yours or any otheri see your post as a poor flame you are trying to point errors by argumenting with your feelings and not with facts if anybody here is selforiented it is you
yes i do i make most of my personal isk doing the trading thing with some occasional mining  missions  ratting i also run several of our corp programs including reactions and capital constructioni am a gerneralist human but in eve that doesnt usually work out too well i have several characters one of which is a builderinventor t1 cap t2 one of which is a miner exhumers 5 ores at 5 etc one of which is a generalist that i started the game off with and am putting into a carrier righ now and one of which is pvpfor newer players most people start off as generalists but then realise the need for specialization fairly quick the only effective way i have found for people to do this particularly if they are new is to have multiple accounts with multiple characters so game mechanic wise i am specialist several specialists actually having a broad experiance base with the different specialists is what i am offering do i have 70 mil skill points no can i fly a capital ship  yes can i invent most t2 and build it if i want yes can i run multiple poss plan and move bulk goods in freighterjump freighter position and set up a drag bubble strip out 3 belts of everything from ark to velt in a single day plan an assault on a hostile corpallaince run a roaming gang kill off a pos scout out a new region  yes and i have done all of themobviously some have more experiance in things than i do  some are leaders of thousand person alliances some are supercap pilots some are lowsec pirates i am not everything nor do i claim so i am probably more rounded than most people are however because it is what i enjoy and i am fortunate in that many of the skills i have picked up in eve are the exact issues that this csm term will be facing ccp has said that they wish to look at sov mechanics this term which hay  guess what  i have dealt with first hand and hey guess also what some of the means and methods thay are considering are the things i do have experience in good things for me and ccp if i am elected
im astoundedthe most pressing issue on every pilots mind in militia is still the almost game breaking lag and desyncive never seen any candidates in militia chat asking us what issues we would want brought to ccps attentionpure lol and waste of timesorry you have no iodea about fw and our needs
i have to agree with dr grot there the number 1 priority is the lag i have been trying to monitor it with the intention of submitting bugreports but the lag gets so bad it breaks the logserver fw did used to run pretty well at one stage and big fleet fights were fairly common now they are uncommon if not completely rare and almost always involve at least half the fleet being desynched to the point where they are just lumps of metal floating in space unable to defend themselvesthis is not a problem with my settings or computer as i can get involved in bigger fights in 00 with all the options turned on and i get minimal lag barely even noticeable if a fleet goes above ten ships in fw the whole game starts locking upit is common and everyone experiences it although it seems to vary as to exactly when if anyone on the csm had partaken in a fw fleet they would have seen the lag this isnt a small problem its an elephant in the roomeverything mentioned in the post above is all fine and good but it pales in comparison to this nothing should be going ahead of this not even the cloaking plex bug this is the first and foremost problem and should be fixed ahead of anything else as this is gamebreaking whereas the others are just bugs
i am not involved in fw but i ply a lot of my trade around black risetamaold man star the lag is indeed pretty terrible with more than a few dozen ships on grid yet ive done the same in 00 with greater numbers by an order of magnitude and had no dramas whatsoeverbefore looking at the rewards of fw about which i thought was never to give anyone anything particularly tangible just to give people an excuse to get involved in mediumlarge scale pvp without shooting poses or messy alliance politics ccp need to make it possible for people to access the rewards that are currently available while i realise there are finite resources on the server and the nature of fw doesnt lend itself to fights over one system for days at a time i am pretty sure there are some resources that could be freed up and ill be brutally lobbying for this to happen
all it takes is an evesearch and thats what the plus 3  was forbeing in a noob corp for that long is nothing to be proud of persons who never leave empire invaribly push an empireonly agenda answer me truthfully do you believe that pvp should be mutualvote istvaan shogaatsu i hear he is building a fountian filled with blood and tearsedit removed a little smack 
oh right i suppose you read my agenda and accomplishments then did you notice the 00 improvements and factional warfare topics have you even seen where ive been hanging out the past year half the time you could find me in lowsec and 00 so please use evesearch some more silly troll define mutual pvp is by definition mutual otherwise its pve eh as you need two players involved to make something mutual i think you mean consensual pvp here eh and you can find all the answers of that in the campaign thread no need to answer the same questions twice of course youd know my answer if you had actually used evesearchi couldnt care lessnext remove the rest of your senseless dribble as well please
agreed
be real if you can have dabbled in all parts of eve what should have prevented them for having doing the samejust because they end up with a different main occupation than yours there is suddenly something fundamentally wrong with their views on game balanceof course they can not represent all of the eve community as the individuals within the community have contradicting desires but they can represent those that give them their vote and if they are nice they can try to please some degree those who did not give them their vote too
youre not going to see the really experienced 00 players in the csm at best there will be some random alliances middlemanagement buried there but never any of the people that saw the upper strataseves too much of a logistical nightmare in the endgame for people to survive the ccp audits or care for that matterits the classic unpaid politician problem the bulk of the applicants are going to be inexperienced and biased players with nothing else going on in eve there are a few shining exceptions but not enough by far
jade constantine darius johnson vuk lau to name a fewso far the csm has been a diverse mix of people from all areas of the game just like it should bei dont understand the hate that some people here voice against particular playstyles and no matter what assurance we give them theyll just go youre lying youre all stupid carebears lalala so whats the point of even arguing with them if its just going in circles
this is the real misdirection carebears noobs hidden agenda conspiracy theories what else like if you are not a lobbyist by starting such a thread splati thought that the carebear term applied mainly to people who never leave highsec  larkonis wrote in his threadref carebears in my mind a carebear is someone who out and out avoids confrontation either in battle in chat or on the market i know plenty of mission runners and industrialists who are able to put up a decent fight if need be these people are not carebears in my time ive run across a lot of industrialists trying to get a foothold into lowsec many of them were receptive and we traded protection for goods and services these are not carebearsi am not against non consensual pvp when attacked i engage in a fight and usually loose because outgunned the only difference is that i dont find it fun to hunt and attack other players i live in 00 and trade with pirate corps for protection if need be i focus on mining my moon and role playing with missions etc so am i a carebear now make up your mind and stop manipulating the carebear definition to fit anyone who doesnt agree with you aggressive play style the truth is that many of you have industrial alts who dont do a lot of combat just like me so who is doing the misdirecting i support take care because of their open mind set which is the key to success when presenting ideas to ccps ambitious agenda and gangho attitude are secondary qualifications if you want to be csm member lack of pvp experience and a massive killboard score doesnt effect once ability to come up with creative solutions ccp is clearly welcoming only balanced proposals senior producer torfi frans olafsson in his presentation during the fanfest clearly states that pvp fighting will always remain the core however that he himself plays a miner and some of his friends never even leave the station he clearly states that the game will be developed in other areas as well just look at ambulation project if that is not hint enough well you are simply wasteing your time
ill make time for any csm canidate who wants to give a 2 minute campaign speech at eve vegas eve vegas websiteeve vegas facebook group
well id like to solidly agree with you but lavista has responded twice i think but i will agree that we are due for more information now
not one but two csm candidates responding im glad this issue has your support guys and as an alt of one of the less legally inhibited pod pilots im pleased to see our esteem cp candidate here as a fairly new pirate in a 2man corp i fly solo for a lot of the time and i need a ship small and fast enough to avoid the camps and blobs yet with the firepower to deal with any juicy targets i come across with a little bit of a boost assault frigates could be the perfect tool for players like myself who want to avoid the whosgotthebiggerblob style of pvphopefully this thread alongside the many mentions in the big thread of balance will get ccps attention and get this sorted
why be so surprised its a good idea  o 
veng is the tanking ship if anything it should get bonuss to tank harder retri is the killing machine pair em up and fun fun fun 
definite thumb up for this one poor little friggis
the problem is unless rockets are fixed the vengeance does better damage using blasters or lasers even with the rocket damage bonus it really needs a double damage bonus to redeem it i do agree with a tanking bonus for some ships though personally i think the enyo would be a good candidate
i love assault frigs but im not sure that an added bonus is necessarily the way to go  i think it might be too blunt an instrumenttake the vengence for instance  its role isnt a dps ship  the whole reason for it being there as i see it is for you to sit there eating dps and holding point whilst your gang warps in to gank the poor fool youve got locked down  something that it does suprememly well if you gave it a dps boost too im not sure thats not overpoweredon the other side of the coin id equally say that the retribution doesnt need an extra bonus but id sell my dear old gran into slavery for an extra mid and 44tf of cputhis thread needs to be more specific  after all wolfpacks of a few inties and af are nasty little blighters  even when your fleet is only the other side of the system once we have concrete improvements that wont attract the nerf bat then well have something to support
assault frigates need to be nerfed
cuteadding a support for more t2 bonuses like all the other t2 shipsnot supporting meddling with the slot layouts i think the bonuses will do enough
im always leary of slot changes other than the dreaded 1 mid slot amarr tech 2 ships
1 med slot amarr ships are fine crosstrain caldari if youre too stupid to figure out a good ship setup
troll this thread is about t2 bonuses and the fact that the assault ships dont have enoughmaybe you should try hooked on phonics if youre too stupid to read forums
i find assault frigates to be fine in fact i have innumerable kills in them including the supposedly terrible retributionyou ought to stop sucking
thats your opinion and its nice good for yousucking has nothing to do with the proposal its not even a matter of opinion its a basic logical argumentpremise 1  t2 ships have 4 bonusespremise 2  assault ships are t2 shipspremise 3  assault ships do not have 4 bonusesconclusion  assault ships should either get 4 bonuses or all other t2 ships should get nerfedbetween those two options ill take the afs getting a bit of love if you like assault ships what possible reason could you have for not wanting them to be a bit better
they do have 4 bonuses the fourth one is hidden thats allit used to be public but people kept whining about the apparently bad bonus a lot of people are very bad at this game
10
to be honest as efrim has said all other t2 ships get a 4th bonus its just ridiculous that afs dont however in regards to your point about the vengeance yes it performs well as a heavy tackler already but a second damage bonus would hardly make it overpowered given that its outdamaged by a kestrel im not proposing damage bonuses for all of them in fact its only the veng and the hawk that i personally think need it but for every single one of them there are useful bonuses they could be given to bring them in line with all other t2 ships without making them uberi did make another thread in features and suggestions that had some decent discussion in it
this just shows that either youre trolling badly or dont actually fly afs as much as you like to think the old bonus for resists was moved to being built into the hull like all other t2 ships but they never got a new 4th bonus the one which all other t2 ships have
this is what i see every time he postsi suggest everyone else does the same
qft
putting this back on page 1
he posted on his own boards to get the thread recognition this is not a morsus mihi issue its a game issue for those involved in 00 hence the reason that bt the 3 main threads that this one entails there is goon aaa bob nc and other support all of 00 know how borked supercaps are but since youre so naive with your reply it can only lead me to vuk im putting my app in for mm tomorrow if youll have me sweetie
the amount of idiocy here is so staggering i hardly know where to begina mothership can not take out 30 other ships even a lone titan will loose to 30 bs if they are set up properlyumm no siege was always there and is the only way that dreads become at all useful out of siege you are better off in a bs the only time triage is used is for repping up pos guns it isnt used anywhere else because the penalties  cant be remote repped cant move loose fighters  are too steep not to mention burns strontwaaaaaaaahhhh thats like crying that it isnt fair that 4 t1 frigs cant kill a maurauder of course its fair ohh and a dozen bs can easily take down a mothership if set up right
remote repping on carriers is not any more overpowered than on any other ship you have logistics ships for the same reason you still have dicters when we have hics each has its own advantages and disadvantages carriers might rep more but they require more skills are far more expensive less manuverable and cant use conventional stargates to get around which prevents them from entering cyno jammed systems entirely
no offense crest butyou obviously arent a capital ship pilot if im in a battleship gang more than usual i would rather have a team of logistics with me than a couple carriers reasonslogistics are fasterthey lock quickercan follow the fleet through gatesthey can warp out or avoid if primaried alot quickergenerally logistics pilots know what they are doing cant say the same for all carrier pilots running in a logistics rolecarriers are great when supporting other capitals assigning fighters repping at a pos when friendies warp in but other than that they are pretty useless against a well fcd bs fleet secondly a dread without siege is useless their tracking is ty their locking time is horrible their tanks are much worse than a carrier the size of sig radius they have to hit as a target is sooo large anyone that ever said bss and smaller dont have a position in a fleet is purely and utterly wrong supercaps without cap support are lost and caps without support are lost its easy to overwhelm a cap fleet with a well fcd support and bs gang they are all integral parts of an alliances over all fleet mechanicwhat vuk is trying to do is make the highest end of the ships by highest end i mean size value more useful to the general fleet mechanics of the game this way he is hoping to see them more commonly in battle because right now if your in a mom your an instant primary if your in a titan your only job is warp in dd and get safe thats it sounds exciting doesnt it so dont bash someones ideas that are going to make the game better and give a class of ships that is not used to its full potential an actual position in the fleetvuks got my support

raised in csm1 year ago and passed to ccp should be implementedanytimein next 4 years
my thumb you have it
spinning my ship in station and trying to imagine all the tiny people in it is what i do best in eve so i will support this measure in other news the sky is blue but that is not my favorite color lets change that too it should be even easier than redrawing every single ship next youll have ccp putting out a little eve ships guide that tells you where the hell the bathroom on a tempest is and whether that little thing that connects the two sections of clawsstilettos is actually a hallway between the sections or some sort of bizarre laundry chute
they have an internal planck bubble stabilizer that allows them to fold space in their interiors
definitely support
simply because the issue is raised does not mean that it does not still require attention to be blunt 3 years of neglect on ccps part warrants whatever action the player base deems necessary in order to get the ship balanced properlyedit lrn2sign
convincing arguement yorda even if you are a goon
yes naglfail needs attention obviouswell no dmg mods on ur fits kinda suck tbh id drop the 3 hardeners and get 1 more faction eanm and 2 dmg mods 1 bcs and 1 i guess heatsink pshaw
adding that i think this will be ignored by ccp as the same blight of split weapons systems infects a number of ships that they would get pressure to revisit if they look at this with the seriousness it deserves and i bet they dont want that
pretty hard to dispute that nags and largexl arty need a buff now
supporting this not much else i can say really just look at the evidence infront of you nothing ccp says can dispute the fact that the naglfar is the worst dread if not the worst cap ship out thereccp fix this please 
minny ships are pretty terrible this one however is the worst
supported something so awesomely vertical shouldnt be so terribly bad some sort of fix needed

i have a few issues with pos access regarding titles and roles i think a coherent thread listing in detail every issue should be created however for now i want to raise this issue in particular  a member cannot change the type of a silo without the config starbase equipment config manager role i have tested this thoroughly and have done what i can to allow my members to run reactions but it is impossible without giving them complete access to every single array at every one of my towers this is inclusive of offlineonline and unanchoranchorthis is a serious security flaw and illustrates the fundamental issues currently involved with pos access roleswere faced with a choice either give a member the ability to take every single asset inside your force fields or dont allow them to do anything but seek its protection this is unacceptable
dear drake draconis your right hence im not trying that with you since at least one of your advice options in awesome in itself if your wondering right now  why the  lil ecid is beeing that blunt with you  take a look at how all your previous responses are wordednow to get to the point cause its annoying as  if you dont get a response for your valid bug petition for a week or 2 cause ccp is to busy dealing with rmt and hacked accountsthe quote that most of you guys agreed on is totally unrealistic why would one if forced to change the pwd change em on all other websites they visit too when you consider that they have not changed their pwds before cause it simply was effort and to be honest its not the people that buy isk or frequent hacking sides or have a software like limewire or bittorrent running per se that become victim of a cleared out account its people that are careless with their information either because they dont know any better or cause they dont careif you have been playing for a while now you might remember the multiple newsdevblogs one of ccpUFFFDs customer support persons posted about how hacked accounts have been straining their customer support and how buying isk can also make you become a victim of getting hacked in all those cases they gave advise like having anti virus software not visiting shady sites or not buying isk but the most important part they did not advice changing the pwd regularyi can see how for some fellas changing the pwd mandatory every 6 month is a pain in teh arse perhaps ccp should just display a big warning in size 72 letters saying after every 3 month  your pwd has been used for 3 month now time to change it for more information on why to change it please read  link to wiki here until the players actually change the pwd and the timer resetsin any case people that suggest that the user is the biggest problem are right people that suggest that you cant fix that problem are that wrong that its not even funny anymore and should when suggesting that they work in security look for another field of expertisereminder for mazz pictures
also confirming i am chieldish too while supporting this topic
drake you are awesomefirst you call mazz stupid then expertly masking the irony you tell her to grow up but not satisfied with just a good effort you then crank it to 11 and deadpan an admonishment of her arrogance you sir are the best troll on the eveo forums never stopand speaking of trolling mazz if you promise to never stop tweaking pompous prigs like lavista vista ill vote for you early and often
i dont even need to promise its just going to happen because its the natural order of things vista just fights like a tiger on the forums it is hard to resist trolling someone that important
how the  does forcing someone to change their damn password mount to a  hill of beanswhat the hell is the advantage in that if at allseriously do you people even know what the hell a keylogger is do you have any sense of intelligence about you when it comes to securityare you all just that damned stupidhell why stop there force everyone to not run windows that should clear up about 80 of your trouble right there dont even connect to the internet youll get hacked this is utterly insane and hilarious all at onceguess ill be expecting more business this year i fix computers for a livingbetter tell the boss the gamers are getting stupid and lazy they cant breath without the game developers changing there diapersseriously this is going from stupid to hilariousnessis this a comedy stop wheres the next punchline seriouslyanyone see my tin foil hat sheesh must be running out of tin foil not enough to go around in this thread
mazz is proposing a change that will hopefully cut down on the number of people who get their accounts hacked due to them blindly using the same usernamepassword for eve and an external forumsite it doesnt effect me much either way as i dont but i bet theres a whole ton of people out there who doit wont help against keyloggers but as mazz has already pointed out these are by far and away the most pain for least gain method of stealing passwords compared to hacking a forum database or starting a site designed to harvest usernamespasswords in the hope that one of them will be a vaild eve logini support this plan
this wont happen because ccp is not staffed by a bunch of total idiots with a lack of forsightguaranteedyou people are so bloody backwards on security its hilariousyou think by forcing people to change there passwords is so damn effective its laughableyou assume the user isnt going to keep using the same password but only change a couple of characters next thing you know youll end up screaming to have us use microshaft 2k3 standard passwords which are utterly insane and not to mention wholly stupid and sorry to say eve online is not the end of the my world here i happen to have a life unlike you tardsbut i give up its like talking to school children who love to speak on behalf of us so called idiots who have no common senseits disgustingim out of here
this line has me in utter stitches this is the best line ever may i steal italso being an antivirus2009 remover for a living doesnt mean you know everything about security for a large number of users please dont leave my thread
i prefer to not waste my time with jackasses
im againtsi like short password its easier to hack then and without that i would have an empty wallet
tell me why password requirements offend you so much dear drake
worst idea ever if this is what we can expect from you on the csm you can count me and everyone else with an ounce of common sense in your oppositionjk
im not the idea is stupid also altbumping  a juvenile sense of humor will not win you votespasswords can not be reused and anyone who makes their password easy deserves to have their account hackednot worth forcing on the rest of the playerbase its also not worth a top slot on the main page when more important game changes like lag fixes ship balancing ui tweaks and fresh ideas are all getting shoved to page 2thumbs down
supporting this it needs to be on the front page so that people would read drake draconis posts
i am captain internet of the aids corporation and this idea is wholly relevant to my interests
and my axe
replying to this to point out that out of the 26 current supports about 1718 of them are almost certainly alts and corp matesthis is pathetic
i am not a corp mate nor am i alt are you claiming that i am part of sniggerdlythis is further proof that you infidels are much too inferior to be taken seriously in very serious matters such as game and password balance it is obvious that those who are actually competent such as members of pandemic legion must take the matter in their own hands
pandemic legion  finally an appropriate name for an alliance you guys have the combined humor of a 5 year old
well to be honest i ran out of alts on the first page i dont know if those other chars are alts or not or whos they are exactly but thanks to ccps forum system they still count the same you should enlighten us on the proper way to have a sense of humor go on tell a joke or something i promise ill laughanyways so far the only real rebuttals ive seen so far arepeople who dont know about password security deserve to get hackedme and everyone else is going to raise a huge fuss and petition everything if this goes throughbecause lost password forums are hard to fill outthe op is dumb and wrong and i know because i work at geek squadwe in the past csm already failed to solve the issue so dont bother wasting our time havent you been paying attention mazzi like to hack peopleand alternatives offeredwarning popup on login instead of mandatory password changeminimum password security requirmeent instead of mandatory password changewas that all
that about sums up this entire thread plenty of people who know what they are talking about and run servers have told you that your proposed idea is pointless andor stupid you just ignore them for some reason
wait i run servers too
well then i guess we have to go majority rule lets see how many more supports you can scrounge up for this sinking ship
you know on the whole i am actually pretty glad that the only people who seem to be supporting me are people that would do so anyways and just about everyone else has this sort of carefreehostile attitude about this sort of thing especially when they run serverswhich servers exactly do youall run and whats their addresses
i run servers therefore am immediately superior to anybody who doesnt and thus my opinion or vote counts for morehelloi am efrin blackin other nesw i wholly support this however i believe the prescribed notion of passwords only being accepted with a mandatory secure level should also be added into this proposaloh and ccp should also do hellpurges of passwords forcing you to change at irregular intervals as long as they have a working and userfriendly password recovery system  which automatically resets their password to a scrambled 12 character one which they have the option to keepanother final thing perhaps a function to allow one to save their password so they dont have to enter it each time as long as this doesnt produce any security issues other than somebody actually taking your computer  which is pretty unavoidable itself anywayps i love mazz and she has promised me nudes if i post here backing her upso this is what i am doing y0x
this deserves to be back on page 1
this needs to be brought back
are you entirely sure about this your snippet seems to give off an aura of uncertainty i believe this serves to prove that live events were an utter waste of time and resources ccp should focus on real matters such as lag management and word limits not waste time on roleplay
basically virtual worlds research has shown that live events are a goddamn incredible drain on resources as ccp mentioned in one of the previous csm meetings when this was brought up personally id rather they fix the game than put people into this black hole of an ideai know you all love to have fun and all but if the company cant do it they cant do it and theyve said they cant do it writing an essay about this stuff wont change that alsodid you ever get a new wyvern
events are good to have eve should have them however you are somewhat misguided in what you want to happen you describe a team that puts together theatre people do not play the game in general to watch other people play the gametake your example of the empress and how people would be punished for trying to gank her why if you want real rp real theatre then it needs to be alive living breathing and evolving if the rp plays out as planned cool but you should want a team dedicated and creative enough to be able to adapt the rp to what actually happens instead of taking your hostile view that people are ruining itif you have a creative rp team then anything that occurs in the event is the event and should be adapted into the storyexcessive punishment for actions that already have punishments associated with them means you just want to go to the movies and not actually take place in anything meaningful if you want that lackluster rp go read a book books are fun and they stick to the storyif you want grandescale rp in a game filled with people then you should want it to be adaptive to whatever happensso for instance take you empress example a better way to handle it if it is so important that she is received unharmed you use normal game mechanics you protect her with an armada of concordequivalent vangaurd this has two effects itll possibly stop alteration to the script by people that you think are just trying to ruin the fun but it also provides an epic alteration to the script that the team can play off of if somebody manages to topple the armada and kill her
we already have that i set mine to 0 jumps often because i only want to buy stuff in jita no thats no good and it would cause tons of lag toohave you heard about contracts
all good points contracts system is bleh but does work if they overhauled the contracts system it would be ok
op just scored major respect points in my book o  stick around mate we need more folk like you in assembly hall
supporting
got my support its a cheap exploitation of the current contract system
as being directed to this thread from my post i support this idea primarily for implementing a buffer to keep scammers from posting at ridiculous speeds in local chat all for scammingnot for spamming
supportedthe contracts will reach a point where they will become worthless honest traders in particular will be at a loss imagine a noob looking at the contracts fore the first time i wouldnt look a second thats for sure the contract system will die if something is not implemented to control the spam and scamsif you want to scamgo for itbut eve doesnt necessarily have to make it easy for you
opposedalthough i dont really entertain myself with scamming people or havent been scammed yet like this its a fair tactic and if you cant be arsed to properly read the letters on your screen then you deserve everything you getpeople tend to glance at things hope ccp makes it into easely understood pieces of info and press the buy button just for once actually read properly what it says on a contract and 99 of all these scams become useless
after reading 1020 contracts yes you tend to glance at things9999999999 is not easily understood without having to count the digitsmemo 10000 trit cheapcontract trit x 1is conflicting informationso why bother with contracts at all then
youre confused as to the motive of this change i want to see this removed to help get a spam free local in jita and other trade hubs for community and legit advertisers sake i think that tackling the scam head on would solve this as every spamscam ive seen in jita has been this scam
really i dont look at jita local much but i seem to recall a fair number of navy issue ravens and 100 million tritanium being spammed as well not to mention the old 10for1 scam besides just because this is the one theyre spamming now doesnt mean that theyll stop if its changed theyll just move to the next best if i thought itd deal with jita spam i might be inclined to support it but it wont
sov holding alliances should be immune to wardecswardecs are about a conflict between 2 groups you require no wardecs in 00 thusly any sov holding entity has at least 1 asset in space in the sov system thusly for example anyone with a grief about say goonswarm or solarfleet you have to first goto 00 destroy all their assets removing sov then you may wardec them
yes lets prevent high sec strikes of cargo and transport for alliances like goonswarmtop that off with the fact that wardecs are usually a waste of time when its against a 00 alliance who hardly comes to high sec in the first placeplease try to put some thought into your idea before you postand giving a alliance wardec immunity is a serious balance breaking mechanicdont like it then join an npc corp
wow that breaks the whole point of wardecks as if superalliances didnt have enough power as it isno isaac
you are wrongi support this idea
this doesnt make sense from either a gameplay or a roleplay point of view in gameplay terms wardecs on big alliances are how you attack their logistics which is a valuable purpose and not one that should be eliminated in roleplay terms concord doesnt give a damn about 00 space  a wardec has no effect outside empire and concord doesnt care how sovereign you are out in delve or perrigen falls theres no reason i can see why anyone would want to do this
terrible idea  makes no sense  not supported
the entire point of wardecing an alliance is to attack their highsec assets
no because some of those sov holding people are in high sec and a war dec lets those people get shot in high sec without concord getting its nose all bent out of shape
no for all of the reasons already outlined if you want to attack an alliance you need to be able to attack all of its assets and members not just those out in nullsec
why should empire dwellers be able to attack 00 empires it doesnt even make sense
the same reason why corps should be allowed to wardec each otherbecause they can and they will
makes perfect senseget your 00 alliance out of highsec or get your 00 alliance to protect your highsec assets if you still have them shockerimo logistics arent defended very well ingame enough this would only encourage less protectionisaac
this mechanic makes perfect sense you know as long as members of the sovholding alliance are not allowed to enter high sec or low sec
intriguingbut then that would compound the alt wacko issue something fierceso no but intriguing idea none the less
i think i speak for everyone when i say that the most important and vital change ccp must do to eve is to fix the absolutely shocking insult that is made to fenris the nordic mythical wolf of awesomenessfenris is the name of a giant wolf son of the god loki who during ragnarok nordic apocalypse for the heathens ignorant in nordic myths kills odin and lives on a diet of gods hands fenris sons eat the sun and the moon during said ragnarok
i would suggest sleipnir not naglfar but the general consensus is yeah fenrir shouldnt be a freighter
a freighter is large at least take some solace in that could have been worse rookie shipon a similar topic whats up with the name vargur the minmatar marauder cant find any info on that name
from what i recall after asking around back when they got introduced is that vargur means outlaw in icelandic
cheers for the reply ill stop derailing this thread now
your initial premise is severely flawed
and your sense of humour is severly broken
a vargur is a wolf often reserved for a maneating wolfthough the name has been used for men with connotations to wolves ie murderous criminals
i stopped reading when i saw thatnothing turns me off more when someone starts a proposal like thatcourse if you do start the proposal it better be bloody truesorry to say while the names are pretty much as the op stated i wholly think this is a waste of timeme leans on his fenriri happen to like my freighter just fine thank you very muchim not completely against it but i think there are far more important things to worry about
no support ccp has bigger issues to worry about then epic names on wrong ships i see no reason to change them and if we do start changing names there are tons of epic names that are on the wrong ships but you dont see me crying about it oh and btw dont try and speak for everyoneisaac
four years ago id probably have agreed with you today not worth the confusion
am i agreeing with a goonswarm member
supported the option to turn them off was there so surely thats the lag inducing issue out the way i miss my epic trails
yes yes yeswe want our trails back
no support
ok im gonna be real with u guys i dont know what the right way to fix this problem is but there are some great ideas in this thread the bob guy seems to be right about there being too much mediumvalue ores and the guy with the pirateillegal mining crystals idea was awsome too the fact is we should all be supporting this thread because the more support it gets the sooner ccp will atleast try to fix itjust the 2 cents worth of a highsec hulk pilot tbh
more miners in lowsec
why not nerf loot drops instead im pretty sure i read somewhere that 40 of ore in eve was from reprocessed loot im no expert on the subject of what items from what part of space reprocess into what oresis it true that these rarer lowsec ores are easily found in your average reprocessed items change the loot tables or change the reprocessing equations and poof all of a sudden that ore sitting out there in lowsec is worth a hell of a lot more
i have trouble believing thatcourse i dont bang out level 4s until my ears bleed eitherbut by the time you grab the lootand reprocess it you pretty much make the same amount of isk as you would doing a good solid few hours of mining in a hulkjust mining 2 to 4 hours a night for 4 to 5 days straight i still make 80 to 100 million isk easilymission running in the same amount of time is dependent on the missions which is not entirely predictable not to mention that the loot may or may not be reprocessablethis is all tied into the market prices and tritanium is still the most pricey of the lotdrone drops do produce more but only if you get a pile of drone killsalso keep in mind you do not get bounty for killing drones so how do you compensate for that i ask youim not asking the nerf pve jackassesim asking the rational people who balance both worlds without being stupidly prejudiced and blind
highsec has the best trit pyer mex and iso ores lowsec has the best nocx and 00 has the best zyd and mega ores the problem is that most of lowsecs value comes from nocx which is worth bugger all right now oddly this doesnt seem to be the fault of missions  nocx is one of the least missionsupplied minerals in the gameonly zyd is lower  see
verified and confirmed i see more of the high sec popular ores than the little rare guys
totally agree im one of those people that would take the risk but not if it means making less money then i would be in highsec which is the current situation btw the op is well thought out and has good ideassigned
not supported this idea could easily be exploited to a high degree for example any of the large alliances with a moon mining operation pulling r64 mats would put tons of cloaked covops alts in the system that way whenever a pos bashing crew comes the alliance with the pos and alts in the system has a definitive advantage both in defence and in running the posthis would encourage metagaming to the extreme
maybe im crazy but if i had a major alliance i would have far better things to do with my pilots than park gobs of them in covops to watch one system one sucker on sentry duty maybe but tons and if youre suggesting that the covops pilots would be collecting points for system control i assumed it went without saying that cloaked ships dont count barring that i really fail to understand how this proposal would change the status quo you describe in any way okay so your dysprosium moon netting 20 mil an hour can spend 50k less in fuel costs sure some people like their 025 i suppose but if you actually read the proposal i think youll find that youre worrying about nothing
linkagei think that would be a better way of managing lowsec tbh
paranoid muchsome how i seriously doubt any self respecting alliance would do thatmaybe not on a grand scale but still thats a bit far fetched at best
i support the general idea while the mechanic you suggest has at least one very exploitable hole and one big drawback drawback the corporation with the most shipminutes spent in the space around the bunker will gain one point if this is meant literally the corporation would have pilots doing nothing beside orbiting the bunker to get the standing and this get us to the  exploitable hole alts especially people with alts in shuttles or noob frigates orbiting the bunker at 100 200 km or whatever is the maximum range where the bunker register the presence to get to control the system those alts will have a clear slate no negative sec standing and so firing on them would damage the standing of the people trying to get controlif the bunker register all the people in system or even better all the people outside a station pos shields not cloaked not in shuttles ie all the people that are at least potentially doing something related to using the system and not only the facilities there it would be lesser exploitable even if alts in safespots could still be a problem even with the limits any idea leading to a more used low sec has merits so supported
no drake you are not enough paranoidto better protect a good moon in low sec any alliance would go to great length
no im not paranoid at all any alliance would go to that length to protect a moon that produces 1520b isk per month in materials you would see metagame altcorps spring up just so alliances would have parking spaces for alts to sit in the system cloaked a mechanic such as what was proposed is far to easily exploitable
ive always sort of expected that shuttles pods and noob ships wouldnt count  nothing below a t1 frigate so that you at least lose a token amount when you get shot the standings concern is a reasonable one though i expect you could fix it by saying that all pvp around the bunker is legit  if you go there its for a fight and so you dont need the protection of sec status penalties for your opponents its a bit clumsy but something in that vein should work the systemwide option is one i considered but i dont like it  too easy to safe up and make it a fight of pure numbers instead of numbers and skill like it ought to be if you want the system you should have to risk a fight not just sit warping between safes yeah good moons are worth a fantastically large amount of money and alliances will want to protect them nobody denies that the question i have is how this system will change that you dont protect dysprosium moons with fuel use reductions or kill rights you protect them with the ability to drop fifty dreadnoughts on anyone who comes to take it and you hardly need alt corps or occupancy to put a cloaked scout into the system  you just get someone in a covops you dont need any sort of special status for that to work you just do it
thisas i said i dont deny the defense but exaggeration to such a degree is laughableif someone is in local your likely to locate them if theres a problem you call in the fire supportend of story as far as i am concerned
youve got my vote this is something ive felt weve needed since i started playingthe lack of logs in corp hangars is a serious issue
supporting this would be very helpful to see where things have gone and find corp thieves quickly
sure  supported it could probably even be an extra feature a corp could have the option to pay for or not  x amount more isk per month for a managed corp hanger that keeps audit logs or just the basic rent for a basic hanger
actually a better way is to push that log info to the api datastreamapps like eve hq could log the activity for youbut thats just a minor suggestion
i would like to ask the csm to get ccp to fix this issue immediatelyrecently had experience of flying a battleship with 215 scan res 1 sensor booster and you cant lock a battlecruiser before it warps not just at a gate but in a belt or missionthat is just plain wrongits killing pvp fix it please
fit a second sb get a buddy to fit a rsb or get a smaller ship to tackle with im sure its annoying but there are obvious workarounds  i wouldnt say pvp is killed just because a mixed gang outperforms a solo bs
ummlolbattleships have crap res scan fit another sb or get a tackler isaac
no matter what you would have posted after this it would have been dead in the water
i didnt see anything i was trying to find an answer to is there a topic on a separate bay for just strictly ammo scripts etcwas wondering it is an idea i had but not sure if it has been suggested and i couldnt find any other place to put this question upkryllster
a separate cargo for ammo and other charges no i dont think that idea has been proposed before why would you want that
actually it hasbut not oftena separate cargo bay for ammo would allow for ease of sorting when your doing multitasking like grabbing cargo or salvagekillingthat or your keeping your ammo sorted out when you carry multiple gradesis it a major need no and not likely to be implemented as its a minor annoyance
i think there is a relative concensus that bigger minmatar ships are underperformingthe root cause imho is that versatility is the racial idea behind minmatars which is nice but the implementation of said versatility has been lackingjust giving us split bonuses andor mixed turretmissile points and calling it a day doesnt work you end up with a ship that can do everything but also sucks at everything naglfar im looking at you evil or very madnow we can either ditch the concept and go to a more traditional focused role for minmatar ships or we can go a bit creativei say we keep the minmatar ships as is keep the split weapons keep the ambiguous tanking abilities keep the split bonuses keep the ty cap keep the ty hpbut give minmatars more slotsup to now ccp has always given the same amount of slots to all ships in their classes 16 for dreads for example and i think ccp should think about ditching that rule for some minmatar classesif youd give the naglfar more slots it could really become versatile depending on fits becoming good at one thing but still not overpoweringsame for the tempest give it more slots than other bs to compensate for its anemic tank anemic dps and anemic range but you couldnt compensate for them allobviously the bigger the ship the more the slots advantage it would havethis would mean that minmatar still need insane training and it would also make minmatar ship more expensive to fit than other races but at least you could be truly versatile without falling into the jack of all trades master of none a truly focused fit could become very lethal in that one narrow focus yet you still couldnt compensate for all the inherent weaknesses of our ship design obviously this would involve a good dose of rebalancing but i think eve could do with more wildcards and thats minmatars creedjust food for thought
sounds reasonable
not supported because for some reason i get the impression you dont know what your talking about being a minmatar pilot i always have plenty of cap but then arties and autos dont use capthe only exception to that however is the loving there capital ships needi think your going about this the wrong wayyou keep forgetting minmatar are people who fall down stairs in a wheel chair with duct tape and bailing wire while holding an uzie and do so gracefully while surviving the whole ordeal o and why do people keep saying add slots as a quick fix
the new stealth bomber is interesting but they are something will be not correct for mei dont understand why to use torpedo for each race on this shipwhy the bonus will be not on the main weapon of each raceexemple caldari  torpedoamarr  large pulsegallente  large blasterminmatar  large autocannon the bonus will be not the same on each weapon type surefor the bomb keep the same then nowalready sorry for my english
because its a bomberand missiles arent the main weapon of caldaritheres even more things wrong you would give the 3 races instant alpha and again missiles with crap noits ment to fire large slow high damage weapons against large targets its not a mobile weapon platformno just no
hum yes i agree its bomberfor me bomber its to launch bombthe torpedo is not a bomb its a missile i say you keep the bomb and bonus on this shiplol the main weapon of the caldari is not missile if its a joke nice yes the caldari can use also hybrid turret but you know a lot of caldari who use only them and sorry about large weapon they are no problem if you ajust the damage bonus of each type of weaponwhy this modification because i dont understand why the gallente or amarr must to learn torpedo to use the 100 of this ship if i make one ship for all race with laser i am sure than caldari and gallente and minmatar will be not very happyalt of helkia
nothe torp is not a missile its a torpedo as its name suggestsand after seeing it action i must say i like what i sawits just fine the way it is now
the latest addition to the pos effect the cyerstyleringthings that rise through the whole thing is posshield never made me dizzy be4 that
hello i couldnt be bothered to train any useful skills which allow me to actually make my own isk does anyone mind if i come into your mission and salvage all your wrecks i know its a pretty big part of your income as a mission runner but i really dont careninjas should copypaste this in local and see what kind of response they get maybe some runners dont salvage but most doand before any ninjas respond by saying scanningsalvage skills take time to train up compare that with the amount of time it takes to get lvl 4 mission running skills up
tell that to the 3 month old raven pilots doing lvl 4 misions with easeits all about riskreward in my opinion you want to sit in high sec untouchable by other players and rake in the isk hand over fist there should be some risk in this case the risk is that some of your profit is at risk from a ninja salvager
laughable if that were the case then the design wouldnt allow mission runners in deadspace to be probed out and intruded upon to begin with
thread
needs more of that video from last year
yeah definatly after seeing that ak47 my vote is for mazzseriously tho this is my first post i told myself i would never post made it about 8 months but mazz is hot with the ak and all
would this not mean you could be scrambled for hours if the attacking party does not kill your ship  this would be an extremely bad change from a game perspective as this would create a situation where the game you pay for becomes impossible to play without a means of escape
a couple questions if you dont mind1 you mentioned pos warfare i agree that it sucks ive been playing eve for 15 years and it feels like ive spent more time in a pos shooting a pos repairing a pos than anything else like most id prefer to shoot people rather than towers one dev proposal was to remove sovereignty from poss what are your ideas2 i think that its time to increase the amount of claimable 00 space well past time to do so since the game population has increased so drastically in the last couple years i also think that there needs to be a serious look at existing 00 space and the fact that certain regions through also have npc stations and agents in them which have broken truesec levels and thus are much much richer than others id like to see truesec fixed in regions like delve so that it functions like other regions and the addition of npc stations and agents to other existing regions what do you think of that and what are your ideas
here are my vote for you
got my vote mainly from vistas and ankhs do more than we had to butthurt
logging out worksit would be hard to keep track of who lives where and it would make useless the sov234 mechanics ccp already put a ton of work into pos warfare would end up centering only around dyspro towers and the like and i dont know how station ownership would be handledi like npc 00 regions it gives small corps with no friends an opportunity to live in 00 without obligations and makes it harder for large alliances to completely own such rich space when enemies can just base out of npc stations some regions ought to be better then others so people who already have 00 space have something more to go for and the richness of npc regions is always offset by the fact that its a lot more active with enemies vast tracts of owned 00 sov space might not be as rich but people wont bother you so muchi see my likes to watch people get provoked into internet anger base is well pandered to
you got my vote mazz
im sure pattern clarc would sponsor you
only that pattern didnt even last 1 full term
boost rewards simple as there are many ways to go about this and ive covered several of them in various other postslowsec at the moment serves no real purpose other than to act as a buffer zone between highsec and 00 and really needs something to bring people to it apart from pvp for the sake of it fw which only affects part of lowsec anyway and of course i would like more worthwhile targets to shoot and who actually have something to fight foryeah i do although i am sans tache atm if im elected ill regrow it for any potentially lulzy photo ops
i think ccp was trolling the population tbh first with the name change then the subsequent reversal i fail to believe that they could have made such a blindingly silly error

shouldnt this be stickied
i can only ask and i did we are at the mercy of the moderators
ccp is well aware of the lag and has some people assigned to fixing it already with them wrapping up the issue soontmhowever it seems that they are still busy with apocrypha and the issues that expansion spawned now i can go in there and yell at them that they suck and should fix it but what would that accomplish the csm is for bringing matters to ccps attention but they are already more than aware of this problemalso its easy to complain that i didnt do x but i have been in militia chat for months asking what people want and my mailbox is open 247 ive got hundreds of mails from people but none from younow as for addressing your particular concern here and actually doing something productive instead of whining ill ask about the lag in the last csmccp meet this termand larkonis can make all kinds of quick and easy election promises here but i think its clear to see which is the more committed and knowledgeable party here
unfortunately dear i dont run the csm wiki nor do i have the benefit of having sat on the council for the past year so do not have at my fingertips details of every issue raised in every meeting and yes i dont think anyone can fault your commitment as for your knowledge of the issues have you ever been involved in a large scale battle in an fw zone or any other area for that matter do you know what its like to fight in laggy conditions ever been unable to lock a single thing on grid or desynched so bad you explode on the other side of the system to the battle until you have and you understand the frustrations faced by these players then please dont bring my knowledge of the subject into question and my commitment to resolve it
hello larkonis im not questioning your awareness of lag in general i was referring to fw lag specifically and the things ccp has been undertaking to fix it i think we can all agree that combat lag in general is bad and frustrating fw lag or otherwise ive experienced my share of it and lost a few ships and pods nothing big but still annoying to it because they went unresponsive
tbh the the extent of lag as you describe it is a myth and ive been in quite a lot fw fleetbattles from day 1 there were major lag issues when we had 80150man fleets in first months but in the last months i didnt notice huge lag myself occasional desyncs which were fixed by a quick relog but the majority of the fights was playable thats because i play on low resolution when entering fleets no sound no effects no brackets and always scrolled out this way i have a little weapon ation at best when others scream they cant play because of lag so i think fw lag is mostly because of wrong overview settings of inexperienced fw pilots not serverside  or a cheap excuse for having lost a fleetfight always easier to blame ccp instead of admitting ones own fleetfight incompetence buy a good graphic card and learn how to adjust your comp for fleetfights and lag wont be a pressing issue for you anymore young padawan
intents and purposesok that said the issue of local has many potential solutions some have stronger benefits than others and as always you cannot please everybodythe simplest method is to treat local as an in game resource instead of a player resource for instance the help channel is a player resource it has zero to do with the actual game of eve beyond eve being the topic it would be just as effective and useless outside of eve as it is inlocal on the other hand has no relevance outside of eve because local is a representation for something in game a systemso you treat local as a system resource instead of trying to approach it from some chat moderated functionin this caseif you speak in local you are in the local listif you arrive in local via a normal gate you are in the local listif you get on grid to a station you are in the local listif you come into system via cyno you are in the local listbut this information can go stale  that is your name turns grey indicating normal eve mechanics have not seen you do something not the same as going afkif you stop talking in local after x amount of time you go greyif you stay away from gates and stations after x amount of time you go greyafter a stale period  that is eve mechanics have not seen you do something for even longerkeep not talking after x amount of time you get removed from local listkeep staying away from stations and gates you get removed from local listcloak you get removed from local listnow the idea here is two fold if you cant guess by this short lists1 people in a system from a role play type perspective receive local information from the eve entities such as gates etc2 from an in game role play type perspective other people in local can only know about you if you have done something to demonstrate you are in that system to the eve entitiesso the roleplay mechanic of local is thishello gate that i entered through i have just come through you you obviously know about me since i just traveled through you and thus you will tell other people i am here you are broadcasting this system wide as a questionably useful servicehello gate that i am going to exit through i am going to leave through you you obviously know that i am leaving since i am traveling through you and thus you will broadcast this sytem wideuh oh i am a sneaky bastord i came in to this sytem covertly i have not spoken touched a gate or a station nobody knows i am hereuh oh i am also a sneaky bastard i came in through a gate but i am leaving through a covert cyno everybody will still think i am in local but really i have jumped outso to sum if an eve controlled entity knows about you it will tell everybody else about you but that information becomes old if that person is doing nothing to get noticed that information might even be flat out wrong if that person stays clear of those things which announce their presencethis is essentially an extension of what the first post is about but boils it down into gamerelated reasons there is no reason players should not have this information but there are plenty of reasons why the information might be out of date from an ingame rp type reason and no reason that a person cannot work around it cloak and covert cynos

yeah the current mechanics allows for time and material research slots to be rented out and people can install jobs from the stations but to rent out invention slots people would have to have actual access to the pos as the fruits of your endeavor are deposited into the lab at the corp this would be of use to people who would like to rent out invention slots if they changed the mechanic so that you could manage everything including the final product from the station remotely this wouldnt be as necessary but otherwise i support something like this
seems good a hp boost could do some nice things for them anti capitals and ddd with different effects also seem like good ideas
the difference between a carrier and any other rr platform is about 500k eft 1800 more repair per 5 sec cycle 76 eccm strength and 40km more range than a bs group carriers also have considerable offensive power projection compared to none for logistics yes theres a problem with that when out of triagewhen a carrier group exceeds 10 especially in a cyno jammed system baring a vastly larger enemy fleet or a capital hot dropnot in jammed systems you might as well not even take the fight yes there are lemming groups that can manage to fail most wont its got nothing to do with abilities of carriers it has to do with the power of their remote rep platforms carriers are offensive projectors and hubs for resupplying ships they are not logistics they only reason they were ever given repair abilites was because pos repairing was even more dull than pos shooting so it despirately need to be reduced in timecarriers were originally put in game with 3050k hps in tank platform with bonuses in gang theyre now 170 to 200k hp in tank and vastly more proliferated in numbers id rather have motherships retain the ability to repair out of triage while carriers are unable than to keep the current structure it would add another level of uniqueness to moms while removing the joke that is carriers atm carrier swarming just kills conventional combat and forces capital warfare even more by fun factor conventional fleet warfare is far superior to capital warfare any day
oh hell yes thanx vuk for finaly proposing some really really useful changes please please dont let this topic fall asleep and keep up the good work
always a brides maid never a bridei dont know a better phrase to catch the moment
good ideas
as a nyx pilot i wholehartedly agree with this statement which is why im uneasy about the proposed changes and leave my own below ill be sticking to the mothership side of these changes for my analysisnecessary changes in priority to moms1 boost survivability2 boost usefullness to fleet3 improve maintenancecorp hanger space add fuel bay1 survivabilityi agree that moms need a huge boost to hp and armor repping ability as do titans they are way too easy to kill which is a major reason why they arnt wanted in fleets2 usefullness to fleettheyre primary role is as stated a combination of offensive firepower against support fleets and being used as a forword resupply platform for shipsammofueletc i fully disagree that mom primary roles should be ginormous hospital ships aka capital logistics ships w fighters the bubble heal is a nice idea but thats more suited to a ship whos primary role is a hospital ship i dont think that rr should be allowed to be used outside of triage mode but triage mode needs to work like seige mode and boost defenses if its to see any use outside of repping pos on the other hand i do like the pos effect mentioned earlier that allows the mom to put up a pos bubble and protect the fleet that idea has some major potential if implemented properlyi like the projected ecm effect but its effect is simply not enough it needs to be boosted clone vat bays need to be changed so that the mom isnt a sitting duck when its activated i think clone vats help fulfill that forword resupply platform role but theyre currently worthless in their current state 3 maintenance bay corp hanger fuel bayi think that like blackops all capital ships should have a seperate fuel bay so that corporate hangers and cargo isnt filled by the necessary fuel requirements this aids in the motherships role because that means more room for ammo and modules to help the fleet refitmoms also need huge boosts to their maintenance bays to resupply a bs fleet that just lost all its ships moms should be able to carry 20 bs
not sure where you want it butissue corp and alliance tool overhaul
absolutely would support this stop the game being caldari mission runners onlinewould also like to see better options for accepting and refusing missions no 4 hour rule and get a menu of missions offered so that you can choose a quick or long mission depending on your playing time oh and can we have missions against factions clearly marked or better removed as the faction hits make so much of this game problematic if it was an rvr game fine but its not so very soon a player can find themselves in a lot of trouble faction wise
people are using small 20km tractor beam on bs ratting doing missions or exploration where wrecks are usualy even around 100k from you this is just wrong ccp have from years in their database bigger tractor beams for non capital ships but they just doesnt want to turn on them in the game medium tractor beam 40km base range with 1000ms speed large tractor beam 80km base range with 2000ms speed
best idea 2009
please god yes
i agree hisec missiongrinding isnt profitable enough yettheres no reason for this change get a ship with a mwd on it to loot
please look into this ccp these are great suggestions
i support this while i do use the right click menu for other ranges than my default id like to be able to set a few different values that are a lot easier to access
good idea
delete me
yes
you know this is kinda amusing i was once told of a hallowed time for the artilley piece where it was so awesome the ammar favoured it to their own guns for bs engagements that was fixed pretty bloody quickly by nerfing artysboosting hp and boosting beams if memory servesand now the exact opposite is the case ah well i was thinking of training amarr anywayme still supports

to be honest i dont think this is a good idea i dont know the numbers but perhaps ccp can tell us if they want how many accounts get hacked on a montly base how many of those account have been doing bad stuff buying isk using macros they get from a site that uses the account info to hack and things like that i believe most of the those people who get hacked is because of their own stupid fault i dont think you have to bother over 90 of the userbase with a problem caused by 10 players who dont follow the eulaoffcourse the 9010 range is a guess
not supported at least not yetwhile i agree online role playing games in general could do with something of an incentive for roleplaying eve needs time spent on balancing the damn thing and working out bugs before i could support something like this tbhlooks at yordas beamnaglfar postsob
theres still playerrun events that can be memorable like for instance the xetic inauguration ceremony in yulai that made me feel like i was playing a massively multiplayer game for the first time seeing the sky full of ships each with someone inside much unlike quake lan parties with just a few dozeni must guess that the quafe ultra rollout probably didnt take all that much man power away from development since it was all rather gungho but that was a mistake as seen by the abuse of the system when there was not enough accountabilityfor now id be happy if just a bit more man power went into fun stuff like christmas or anniversary gifts or even ingame occasions even the interbus shuttle was just a a really quick hack and far inferior to the apotheosiscurrently all man power seems to be focused on getting the next expansion out according to schedule with no time left for a little fun on the side ill say this works nicely for expansions but id hope with all the folks now in employ there could maybe a bit time left for fun distractions
pretty much this all the missiles are screwed since the nano nerf the formula changes were a disaster and need new rethinking
bump this is totally ridiculous ccp i was shooting a carrier with my phoenix today and doing less damage than if i wouldve just got a raven out insteadthe idea that a carrier can speed tank a citadel torp blows my mind you need to fix this immediately in the short term a boost to explosion velocity would probably do the trick for the citadels please unfork my ship and torps that i trained a long time and spent a lot of my friends isk onthanks
pheonix does the weakest dps of all dreads and even these dps are screwed massivly by the missile nerf in fact even a bs like megathron is a better dps dealer against caps unless the cap is webbed by 45 ppl so what is the meaning of the phoenix then suggestionall kinds of capital weapons has two different types of rangesin case of the moros railsblasters phoenix doesnUFFFDt just the long range oneso why dont introduce a capital missile launcher for short range but with better dps explo velocity maybe something like capital assault missile launchers
india99 the problem is ccps stupid missile damage formula not that we need to introduce yet another capital missile to train and equip they simply need to fix the formula so you cant speed tank citadels with simply by moving your shipits utterly ridiculous and whoever allowed this to go through at ccp failed to do their job i cant imagine it would be hard to fix this and until they do fix it my 2 billion isk ship is severely gimped
two things1 this needs to be looked at citadels need to be able to hit other capitals i dont approve of them alphastriking bs thats bull but something should be done so that they can hit a flying city titan mom super caps cannot be webbed so something needs to be done to make sure they are hittable other dreadscarriers shouldnt be able to shrug off half the dps at a mere 20ms 2 i dont think all the people who say phoenix dps is the lowest of all the dreads have ever shot a pos every pos shoot i am at the phoenix walks away with the highest damage done why you can choose your damage type thats a huge advantage and dont pretend its not tldrthe dps numbers on a phoenix are fine the citadel torps need to be able to hit other caps for much higher  of damage when the target is moving
maybe but its a fact that the phoenix does the lowest dps pure numbers of all dreads in addition to the explo velocity speed main issue that means even with the a better missile calc the phoenix is the weakest dread at allsure u can choose the damage type but if we talk about dps the only dps u can deal in compareable numbers is kineticso why dont give the phoenix a short range antiship weapon like every other ship has since ever
wat
i support this i also wouldnt mind having a superlite client that was instation only maybe a webbased client that allows you to manage skills chat with people and manage trades itd be like instation is now except without the 3d and no undock button
the problem is not in the scam itself  im totally fine with scamming but the problem that every single person in jita is trying it there are like 20 people or so trying to do it and all but 12 never get any contracts through its more an annoyance as they all scam every 12 seconds most of them are under my block list fortunately but they keep popping up everyday because they think this time that player who blocked me suffered such a iq decrease by drinking so much alcohol that he will fall for it this time aroundto the scammers i request of them to be more original and dont just follow the fotm scamto op sure why not this new scam has had so many followers that it inst funny any more and i see no harm of putting the number in exact words
as my fellow capsuleers are aware the transportation of rigged ships in quantities is very limited in low sec we have the carrier the move battleships and smaller around however in high sec we have the orca which can only move cruisers and smaller around in any substantial quantities this is puzzling considering the cost of rigs especially since theyre most likely to be used on t2 cruisers battlecruisers battleships and the various t2 versionsas it stands currently rigging ships burdens the owner with a time consuming logistical undertaking to the point of unfeasibility if he or she decides to move his or her base of operation this flies in direct opposition with one of the basic premises of new eden the freedom of capsuleers to setup and move their business wherever they see fitin the past proposals have already been put forward to deal with this issue by imperator jorah and myself but to this day ccps standpoint on this issue is still unknown therefore i urge the council to place the issue of rigged ship transportation on the agenda again the capsuleers of new eden are eager to know ccps view on this matter
yeah i have to say that the inability to pack a ship with rigs is just flat stupidits been raised several times as welli dont mind transporting mods and equipment and ammo separately but whats the point of buying rigs if your going to lose the damn things just because your packing your ship somewhere else
my preferred solution to this like i said in jorahs thread is to allow unpackaged ships into cargo holds at their full unpackaged size it lets freighters move the bigger stuff far more easily than at present without it being too easy
fine as is battleships arent supposed to be easy to move around if you want to move bs around then go to lowsec or dont riginsure them
stacking solutionokey i have noticed that stacking is a huge problem in eve and it have been proven misused time after timehere is the problem the problem is not that modules stack but that they calculate on a  on this means that it calculates on the active amount on a shiplets say a 10 increase to the ships 100 this is a increase of 10which means a 110 well if this module was based on the base instead of the active this wouldnt be a problem because no matter the amount of modules it would still only add an extra 10which means you would need 10 modules to increase the 100 by 100 thereby double itbut because it is calculated on the active the next module will add 10 of the 11011 and thereby bring it up to 121 which is only an extra 1 no bigge but then the next add an extra 121 instead of 10  1331 and then the next an extra 1331 which already means that the module now adds an extra 33 of its original addings and this is only after the third 3 module so it would take101112113311462160317703197632145235so by the 10 module it is suddenly not 10 it is 235 which is over the double of the original module and actually is a 235 increase in the modules yer sure there is a stacking penalty but this still doesnt stop the fact that there are a lot of different ways to increase and they doesnt have that penalty which means this is still what is happeningand this is why we see so many problems with nano ships double mwdback then heatsink full low rack before stacking nerf crystal setcapital cant even use them because of it etc etcso what can we do well this is the simplest and most obvious waylet every procent  be calculated on the base of the shipmoduledmg maybe after own skills or before depending on what the intention from ccp wasthis would make a module give a set amount of increase depending on the ship and your skills not depending on the ships other modulesthis would solve the problem and you should then remove all the stacking penalties you have made which by the way was a utterly wasted of time because the method you tried was and are clearly wrongextremely time taking and not very productiveany commentsi would really love to know why ccp decided to have the active number being the source of the  increase since it seems quite weird overpowering and exploitable to do sotheir solution have been stacking penalty making a cookie cutter world where you know that 3 modules touching the same thing is usable 4 is a bit over the top and 5 is uselessi would like to have the ability to put 8 modules on if i so choice too so i can design my ship the most after my needs instead of having to do around the same as every one else and still so it would not be overpowered compared to the amount of slots used for it which it would now without the penalty but the penalty does that it is useless to put more then 4 modules on
maybe they did it because every other game known to man does it that way maybe they did it because thats how percentages are defined or maybe they did it because thats easier to look at the info on maybe they just did it so that 5 cap rechargers dont give you infinite capacitor to be honest im not really sure i am fairly sure however that bringing up a bunch of fixed mechanics two of which date to the early days of the game and one of which most people didnt want to see changed isnt going to prove your case for why this mechanic should be changed
please read then test then calculate then writeclearly you havent done these5 recharges wouldnt give you infinity cap it would just let your cap recharge at dobbel speed already now you get much more then thatfleet temp base max skills192  3 recharge t2374  4468  585  3 ccc 952 cap per secsoo thats a 4958 increase while without this  on  it would be 145 increase instead and thereby would every module actually be as effective as it is written and wouldnt become overpoweredunderpowered depending on the amount of different things that adds up those last ccc adds around 85 instead of the 15 cap recharge as is said
actually if you were to look at the module youd see that it provides 20 cap recharge time five of those under your funny version of math is 100 which is zero recharge time which is infinite cap actually with energy systems operations youd only need four there are similar problems with other modules2 damps preventing all targeting 5 sprs giving infinite hp etc but thats the first that came to mind
yer okey i see why you think it in that waybut i am talking about how much effect the individuel module will give in the totaland just like resist which will be taking from the constant basebut yes you are right in things that decrease you will need to let the decrease be a constant but it should be like with resist if you have 50 resist and get a extra 50 you will get a 50 of the 5075 aktive resist in the same manner will the recharges give first 20 of 100 then 20 of 80 etc
so your suggestion is  change the way it works for positive percentages and leave it the way it is for negative percentagesseriously do you normally eat stupid flakes for breakfastok lets use some real numbersthe catalyst has a capacitor recharge rate of 31250 seconds unskilled and two medium slots bear with meunder the current method of calculating the recharge rate if i put a cap recharger ii in both slots i get a final recharge time of 31250  80  80 200 seconds ok wow i never actually did the math beforeusing your new method of computing these that number would be 31250  23125020 18750  125 seconds better thats not an insignificant bonus especially for active tankersnow consider the worst case let us just suppose we have a ship with 5 mid slots  for example the hyperion it has a base capacitor recharge time of 1500 secondsrepeating the above calculations for a full mid rack of cr iis we havecurrent 1500  80  80  80  80  80  49152 secondsnew 1500  5150020  0 secondsso your new suggested calculations mean that you could have ships with effectively infinite capacitor  which means you can kiss the nos goodbye as its now uselessworse in fact you could potentially give a ship infinite shields using only four t1 nonfaction fittings so well have ships who can rep forever and ships with shields you cant take downim thinking no
i fixed your post no charge
epic troll or epic faileither way my answer is no
epic troll and hell admit it if you ask him jasons actually reasonable half the time half the time he comes up with absurd  to amuse himself the one im still confused by is crest  i sort of assumed he was epic of the fail variety hes got that air of wellintentioned idiocy about him but this percentages thread is making me secondguess my assumption
nothis would be insane and stupidalthough i think wardecs price should be calculated on the amount of players in the corp compared to the amount of players in your corp the difference in these two would be what determined the amount of isk the wardec will cost

this is certainly complicated but i still believe that nerfing t1 loot would go a long ways towards making mining profitable again by the way draco heres a link for you
ok you got one big problemif you nerf loot reprocessing you will cut about 50 of the tritanium supply which would let it skyrocket even further making lowsec even more unprofitablenoxc isnt supplied by mission as much and that is down trit is suupplied alot by missions and it is upthink a few seconds and tell me what will happen if you remove all the trit supply from missions
this is why im against nerfing loot dropsyou folk who are oh so worried keep forgetting to look at the big picturetake off the rose colored glasses and take a good long look before you start yelling your mantra
should be a rule against spamming the local with scam ordersits insanely annoying when the local is totally overspammed with clear scam contracts  i rather have isk seller spammers then this its around as annoying and inconstructiveand i will bet you that half of these are macros spamming the chat 
noyou cant just have a rule against scam contracts since scamming in game is totally legal if anything the only solution akin to what you want would be to remove the ability to link all contracts in local
well so is talking in the chat but still there is rules about what you can say in the chatthere should be a rule against annoying stuff like this it is seriously annoying and it is no doubt pressing the servers quite alot when there is a constant ton of spamming in the chat which have to be send to x00 people in the systemand no removing something usefull because some people decides to be s and idiots and do stuff that just clear irritates every one but themyou should look at the overall and say hmm okey we got this which irritates every body and stress the note so one person can have a bit of more funbla this should be reverted so every one could have a bit more funbla and one person would have to be irritated and the note would be less stressed
theres this handy little tool you take your mouse and you right click the name of said scammer and you say blocksee that wasnt so hard now was it
1 it is just chat the amount of data is trivial11 if youd forbid it just to save bandwidth you should shut down all the npc corp channels as well they usually tend to be even less informative than scamspam2 there is a block feature use it3 return that crest of intelligence 2 to your trader he either scammed you or it is cursed
you can pause a skill queue but you cant resume it without redoing the skill queuesimple answer add a resume button onto the skill queue window
click apply
this  however i would like to see them have the apply button text change to resume if your skill training is pausedit took me like a week to figure out that clicking apply would restart my training
ive seen the original thread months late and was wondering if this has gone anywhere apoligies if this is a cross post or a rehash of something years oldi was surprised to see no suggestion of optional 2 factor authenticationi have been in the unfortunate position where a game account was hacked not eve and it took weeks to get the problem resolved meantime i discovered eve so it wasnt all bad2 factor authentication will have some deployment costs however these can be recovered by charging for the keys  either as a one time cost or as a bump to the subscriptionthe benefit is even if youre machine gets compromised andor your password becomes known the one time key generated by the 2 factor system secures you  even if you have a weak passwordagain i suggest this as an optional additional feature for those that want it
id support this as an optional feature with a one time cost for those people who want it
i like options
options are good
i agree something like a 1time password would be quite nice
ehh as long as its an optionotherwise no go
more stuff
needs to be implemented corporate espionage and what not is supposed to be part of the game but even with that sort of thing rl logs of who accessed things have always been around p
much needed 
a corp hangar log but you already have that by using containers with logseven if ccp were to implement it they should make it an optin thing which would require a considerable corporate investment per hangar
hmmisnt this exactly what ninja salvagers do what do they risk mission runners risk losing their ships if the mission goes wrong and please tell me how many lvl 4 minmatar fleet agents for example are there in highsec ninja salvagers are just griefers who couldnt shoot their way out of a wet paper bag so all they can do to harass other players is steal their salvage
ever warped a probing ship into recon 3 of 3 hehe theres a risk for you or what if the mission runner leaves the mission then we risk aggro yes the risk is low but i think the level of risk for the salvager is on par with the risk for the mission runner

my mazz has my vote and then somevamm
 mazzilliuwhat is your position on highsec pos sieging
420 siege high sec poses errrryy dayseriously though i dont know what you are asking me here if someone gets wardecced all their stuff in highsec is fair game to the attacker
highsec pos sieges are long insanely boring and very repetitive and tedious do you think a rethink of how pos sieges work is necessary
now i think of it it is pretty ty that you cant use dreads on highsec poses do people use tons of hardeners on their poses or something thats the only module i can think of that skews the balance too much against battleships simply making them unanchorable in highsec should fix the problem to bring it more inline with 00 pos seiging yesgive me more complete information on the problem as i dont have experience seiging highsec poses none of my pvp characters can enter highsec 
i like you please pledge to have md shut down and the regulars airlocked ingame  if you know what i mean
wow im really surprised with you ankhesentapemkah youre going wild with the assumptions claiming i believe one thing and another plus insulting me do you have any idea how much isk per hour a player in nullsec can generate with ratting if theyre lucky they can match that of level 4 missions in highsec this means we have all this isk being pumped into the game with very little risk by way of highsec they arent at risk of being blown up like the players in nullsec so how is that even remotely fairas for lowsec im saying there needs to be more incentives to draw players in that direction shifting the level 4 missions would accomplish that and maybe a system could be created where players can generate standing with npc entities in lowsec so that they get added protection by way of a support cruiser warping in to jam the hostile and allow escapethe csm reps bring issues that concern the players to ccp by way of the players voicing their support first are you letting yourself be blinded by the corp i belong to it seems that way which is unfortunate because i believe you shouldnt judge a person so hastily btw why are you doing eriks campaigning for him people are going to have a hard time getting to know him with you towering over his thread
i believe that is exactly what the sleeper ai was intended to do but then those players who are fighting mission rats which are complete cake in faction fitted cnr would be upset when their old tactics wont work very well
i like how my question still hasnt been properly answeredmaybe he doesnt want his views on them known

all this talk about falcons what about stealth bombers i like the new extra pew they bring but some people did point out they only trained cruise missiles for stealth bombers and now they need to equivalently train up for t2 torps with the changes in say scanning the skills were simply renamed or retooled so probably what im asking is should something similar have been done in this case ie an option for a cruise missile  torp sp swap and oh what to do with the extra sp

i only can agree waiting for this for 2 years now  i am patient 
there is no general problem with afs they might suffer from comming agility nerf but tq afs are finevengance good tackling with strong tank for a frig if you cannot outdamagea kestrel  outtank it problem solved jaguar one of best afs in evewolf little bit tricky but ok especially in wolfpacksa general problem with t2 frigates not only afs is the high price tag for more details read
yes please its much needed
there is no general problem but some of them are so badly gimped that even with a price drop theyll still get laughed at if you cant see a problem with people fitting blasters and lasers on a vengeance instead of its bonused weapons i dont know what to say plus youve forgotten about the hawk the jag may be on of the best afs but that doesnt say anything as to how afs compare to other ships particularly other t2 ships which is where the problem lies in my opinionid much rather see them remain at the same price and get a bit of a boost if you want to be economical fly a t1 cruiser
i disagree while i support adding the missing 4th bonus a price drop in assault ships would mean me flying them exclusively forever if a jag cost me even just 10mil as opposed to 20 id never fly anything elsethe prices are absurd even for t2
unfortunately prices cant be locked its a player driven marketif demand goes up prices go up if demand drops they go down
well hope springs eternal but i simply dont see a boost and a price drop through changing the material requirements or whatever happening given the choice between the two id much much prefer the 4th bonus than a pricedrop and them not getting looked at again for yearsid love to be able to fly them exclusively but really if they were that good how long before they got nerfed into oblivion
yeah assault frigs are really terrible at everything and they should be fixed thanks
cool
can i please design the olympians names descriptions i have the perfect names etc cooked up straight from my homelands mythology greece
i endorse this product andor service
feel free but do it fast d cause i raised this issue for tomorrows meeting last one of csm 20
this ow yes thiss please thishate that the developers of tractor beams totally skipped those and made cap sized instead 
id like thismake them require graviton physics though like the capital tractor beammedium could require graviton physics iilarge could require graviton physics iiicapital already requires graviton physics ivi dont think the range increase has to be as drastic as 100 for each step up though 203040 would be enough as long as the tractor velocity increased with each stepone thing id like even more would be if tractor beams in general had a falloff in addition to their range yet a smaller base range to compensate where falloff would affect tractor velocity that way those who sit still in one place would have a bit more comfort but actually tractoring the stuff in would take longer for anything beyond base range that would give other parties interested in the salvage a better chance to fetch the fish right off the hookora rather nasty concepttwist would be to add scripts to tractor beams that allow it to run a tractor beam in high powered mode when the script is used where both range and velocity double or tripple but with a chance of 50 5 per level in graviton physics that the wreck is ripped apart in the process and destroyed i like potential benefits that include a drawback
no dont like it fit a mwd get someone else to do it get into a smaller faster ship dont salvageloot etc etc current mechanics work just fine no change necessaryisaac
bs  battleshipbs  battlesalvageshipsorry your reasoning is not strong enough to warrant this changenot supportedmarauders have tractor beam bonuses but even then they should not be that powerful
medium  small on a marauderlarge  small on an orcajust because they dont have the names doesnt mean that they dont exist
i dont think we need more tractor beams if you think about it the bigger the ship gets the slower the ship gets this means that the small tractor beam is actually more effective on a bs than on a frig since it will save the the bs more timealso t2 bs  40km spend the time and train for iti would however maybe support having a t2 small tractor beam that has a 25km range but that would be pushing it
doesnt work heremaybe you will spend your time to help me then and your friends to help other guys which also want better tractor beams yeah because ccp doesnt really want people to lootsalvage their own wrecksmedium tractor beam 40km base  bonus from marauder  80km  thats sounds and works alot better because many l4 missions have npcs even around 130k from your warpin point
use a marauder  i thought that was supposed to be the big advantage of the ship
yeah because no one is doing missions in 00 no one is ratting in 00 and definitely no one is doing a plex in 00 and even if then we all know that 00 npcs does not leave wrecks
whine thread is successful whine
good idea i am also sick of the orbit changes i constantly have to do isaac
definitely want
but it wont be fixedccp allways keeps the brutors in there placeyou would think after all the years that that if one dread allways gets called primaryccp would fix itooo wait we really needed tier 3 ships
if only ccp could hear us
a tractor beam skill book that lets you get 5 range and 5 velocity make the book a3xto be able to unlock the book u need to have salvaging 4 and and science 4
there is already a skill that fits tractor beams because it is already a prerequisite for capital tractor beamsgraviton physicsjust implement it for such an application its a x5 skill btw
supported
no isaac
i tend to be pretty gungho about adding new skills but this one is a little too narrow even for me i really dont see the need
i cant say yes or no on this oneso im taking a seat until i see the logistics behind this
india99 what is the point in introducing a new short range weapon for the phoenix when the problem is the damage formula why should a siege phoenix do less damage than an unsieged phoenix when shooting at a ship the size of a small cityits ridiculous atm and needs a formula tweak and not a whole new weapon system to be thrown in on top of an already broken formula so simply increase explosion velocity on the citadels or maybe just include an explosion velocity bonus against caps if thats possiblei dont know exactly what the best comprehensive solution to this problem is but ccp will hopefully think of one it is their job to do this sort of stuff after all
the phoenix is widely regarded as cannon fodder in other words if a dread dies in a cap fleet odds are its the caldari one this is just another shiny example of one of the many things that need to change in regards to capitals
like i said these short range missles should have a better explo velocity than the citadels so u have the citadels for snipingpos bashing and the other ones for killing capssuper capstank of the phoenix very ok i would sayi see there no point to complain about it atm
citadels torpedos are the short range missile there just arent any citadel cruise missiles to serve as the long range missile that isnt really the issue here though giving citadel torps a 2025ms explosion velocity while in seige mode would probably solve this while still allowing bss and smaller to speed tank them effectively
supported
150 km range  short range dont get confused just baout the name torpedo its the cruise missile in siege
because theres only one capital missile you can argue back and forth all day wether they are short or long range weapons but beyond the name their lack of a bonus from guided missile precision follows the pattern of the close range missiles remember when torps were changed from not so useful midrange to close range heavy dps dealers well a similar change for citadels coupled with the introduction of capital cruise missiles for longer range fights would be greatthat said this topic is about a specific issue if you want to continue discussing the lack of a second capital missile system you can do so in another thread

please consider getting a filter for level 5 skills why an earth they are included in the skill queue skill training selection makes no sense since they cannot be further trainedthis adds significantly to the bloat of skills that you have to scroll through when applying skills to the queue
agreed a couple more filters would be nice this one especially
agree seems silly to include lvl5 skills
this though tbh it is kind of bad ui design so i wouldnt object to the almost xxx idea
one item which i consider an exploit as it has no real benefit to storyline or community is the log in trapis there no way to force a 15 second buffer timer so that when someone logs in they are immune to attack and can not attack a targetthis 15 secs would prevent these lamers that park all their ships at the gates at optimal range log off and wait for a ventrilo alert to log inbasically what they have created is a super cloak that can not be governed by ccp an unfair mechanic and exploitan added bonus would be that players that get legitimately disconnected in battle would have a 15 second breather to allow their graphics to catch up and get positioned before continuingi would also suggest a buffer to exiting stations the same 15 secs would prevent undocking and finding yourself podded before your screen ever shows you the battle field
yarrrrr
sounds reasonable and gives all parties involved time to have a fair advantage
i would prefer more or less 510 secondsbut i would rather when you logged in in space you would not warp to last location but rather the nearest celestial objectplanet i think this would help out allot with things instead of local spike then everyone is ontop of you you have time to get away etcinputs
10 secs may be a more appropriate time
randomize the login entry point except when your docked at a station or a pos and you have my votehave them show up at some random deep space point or near a celestial bodykeep in mind that logging off is an entirely different pandoras boxyou cant possibly have an effective solution to that problem due to the nature of tcpip and the science behind internet connectivity
stations already have 30secsfirst movement you makeabout your ideathis can be exploitable in lowsec for people trying to avoid gate camps were they quit out of the game log back in and cant be shot for 15 sec while they just warp offit might work if you need to move in order to lockbe locked delaying logoffski about 4 seconds while giving people who dk a chance to get there barrings while not giving them the ability to warp off while in the timer
thats reasonable as far as logging offif you get targeted before you exit the game then okand i cant stress the before part enoughhow do you know some jackass didnt pull the plug on your internet connection in the middle of a fightthis is why its a pandoras box
i like this idea if the ship is smaller than the hold it should be possible to put it into the holdwe dont have to repackage the magic bigger inside than outside secure cans to get them in why should we have to unfit and repackage ships if theyre smaller than the available space in the hold
in case anybody forgot the csm was originally created in responce to the call made by players for some sort of independant auditing body in all reality i dont think ccp will ever let the csm do something like that all conspiracy theories aside also i dont think elected players inherently have the experience to look at huge lists of transaction logs by ccp employees chars and determine foul play or not and the temptation to out them is theredespite that i still support this idea the csm could be replaced with an online checkboxes poll in its current state
oh my god none of my modules are sellingccp must be outselling me with their secret restricted economic information including the highest module drop locations and the best asteroid belts there aresupporting for the lulz
not so much actually you will find out if you get to talk to themthats what internal affairs is for not the csm you would know that if you read the csm document which describes the csmhence why thats something the csm is working on changing
did it occur to you s minus the people who laugh at this whole thread that ccp doesnt need any isk or any stupid anythingthey just snap there fingers and have the items they needits called being a gm you know access to db spawning itemsyeahduhthey dont need any frakking isk x o dyou people are hilariousbtw im selling tin foil hats 1 million isk a piece ill even throw in an exotic dancer for yahstep right up
1 why would ccp need to make isk they can spawn it with a single button press2 ccp know about changes before players oh my god see point 13 the forums are not the preferred way to contact ccp internal affairs have you tried emailing themwts tinfoil hats only 99999999999 isk 100 thousand isk
so basically you dont want to have to interact and be committed to put up a pos hmm no i think not
ccp stop destroying our souls
from what i read the ops point is that the way reppers are now you have to wait to get the damage reppedwell i would like to point out to the op that he is wrong and that his entire argument is based off a false assumptionthis example will use a repper with a 10 second cycle that does 800 hpwith the ops ideastarting at time 0  total hp reppedt0  80 hp reppedt1  160t2  240t3  320t4  400t5  480t6  560t7  640t8  720t9  800t10  880now using the current systemt0  800t1t9  800t10  1600now the op is saying that with shorter rep rate you gain your hp faster but this is not the case if you look at the above example you will see that at no point in time does the shorter cycle ever end up gaining the player any extra hpthe only time this idea would work is if you had to wait 10 seconds for the first rep to occur but since this doesnt happenthe idea is not good
i like the idea of making the armor repairers repair 70 per second over the cycle time rather than repair the full amount after the cycle ends reducing the cycle time instead would be a bad thing since one of the things lars have going for them is that they cycle at roughly the same speed as a large cap booster which adds some neut resistancethat is false the way armor repairs currently work is that you get nothing until the cycle ends with the current system is is more liket0  0t1t9  0t10  800the only exception to this is if your enemies are doing low enough dps that you can turn your rep on while your shields are still holding and time it perfectly so that its cycle ends as you start taking enough armor damage of course when the enemy does that little damage your repairers should hold the incoming damage anyway and you dont need to worry about the cycle time
ahive only used shield reppers and i know they work the way i stated if the armor reppers dont work that way then i apologize
can we get more of a reply on this and possibly a word in from ccp i really would rather not have the answer be get a new computerif the drivers on the gfx cards are not supported than why cant us mac users get some love from ccp and have them supportedeve worked fine for me before apocrypha came out and it really is a shame that we cant play now because of some fancy new shader engine
i enjoy you cherry picking your own topic of course getting kill rights or a fuel use bonus are not 100 defensive things but the ability to attack anyone who comes into your lowsec system and has a sec status less than 01 is very much a defensive advantage thats the part of your post ive been focusing on yeah congrats you can drop 50 dreads on a lowsec pos bashing fleet but which is easier the logistics cost and time of 50 dreads assembling jumping fighting hopefully not dying jumping back and being refueledrearmed or parking an alt corp in a system in which you hold an r64 moon and letting it sit there then when your spies hear rumblings of an impending attack you blob the ingate to that system with a bs heavy fleet the first character in the attacking fleet that is below the security status gets wtfbbqed but the noone else in the attacking fleet can fire back because theyll draw a gcc and diaf even quicker so where does your idea get us stagnation of lowsec moons and resources alliances that can pull off the metagame are rewarded for it instead of punished still not supported
okay one of us is missing something here we are still talking about fleet combat in lowsec right the same lowsec that lets anyone shoot anyone for any reason the same lowsec whose best form of defence for innocent players is some hundreds of dps of gate guns do you seriously think that gccs and sec status losses are going to dissuade anyone in a fleet fight from firing when youre protecting dysprosium you dont check sec statuses of people going through the gate to see who you can fire on and rely on the gate guns to pick off anyone else you shoot them all im not the slightest bit worried about a narrow interaction between my proposed aggro mechanics and dyspro defence because a the alliances wont care about this  they defend the moon not the system and they dont care about sec status when they dob most alliances wont really be able to use this even if by some miracle they do carec there are a whopping 20 lowsec systems in the game with valuable moons and i intended this proposal far more for the 800 that dont than the 20 that do
as the title says to be honest seen blue responses over two years ago saying this was going to be implementedi know this wont be on the top of most peoples lists but there really is no reason why this has not been implemented yet should not take up to much time or resource to do eitherthumbs up please people 
i just realized today why are drone control units active modules they take absolutely no cap to run on their 20 second cycle times why not just make them passive modules fit them to the carrier and they give 1 drone no need to activate the module
supporting my own idea lest i be a hypocrite
because they cant be used when you are in triage mode
yupno support for ideaisaac
id think the easier solution to that is to make triage modules work properly on a ship fitting dcuseg by giving a flat 25 drone cap rather than having dcus be active modules this feels like a fairly sketchy workaround that said its not worth changing no support
just have triage mods remove 625 bandwidthmoms bandwith and make the dcu mod passive seems like a better worarounddcu dont give any extra bandwidth and unless theirs some problem with the calculation in having negative drone bandwidth it dose not matter how many drones you can control if you dont have any bandwidthi whoud not mind them being passive because that one less module you have to activate in a fleet battle and one less module that can lag out
fighters dont use bandwidth so your fix wouldnt work personally id like to see triage just have a 100 drone damage mod so you can keep using logistics drones but really any change in this is likely to not be worth the effort
this is so true after spending a couple of hours in jita trying to scam people it was still horrible looking at npc corp chat and seeing endless reams of people spamming crap where they substitute the word duck into normal sentences really local doesnt have a well defined purpose but npc corp chat is meant to be at least mostly for help for the record i dont do any of the usual crap scams though 99999999 isk 10x back raven instead of navy raven etc
why is there an option for allaince use on a corporate hanger array when non corp members can not use thisfor alliance wide mining operations etc out of a corp pos the ability to set the specific array so that anyone in allaince can access it would make sense of course there is agreat risk involved in this at the pos owners expense and heshe would need to remove the access when the opp is finished
alliance access permits alliance members to put things like ore into another corps cha they cant see or remove items but can put things inif you dont like it dont give them access
from my time in sn i remember most members not only salvaged but looted wrecks in the missions they enteredfrigatedestroyer fit with salvagers vs battleship carrying light drones that can permatank an entire lvl 4 spawnthere is some risk for you if missionrunners would rather retaliate on the forums in the form of whines rather than in game well id say that rather predjudices any argument against themi just know some of you are thinking but he will come back in a pvp ship and kill the missionrunenr if he gets shot at by him oh just a minor thing the missionrunners entire corp have aggression rights to the looterplease dont forget that the mr can change ships as well nor that your average pilot running level 4s makes isk an order of magnitude faster than anyone ninja salvaging and should a ship be losttldr missionrunners have plenty of effective tools against ninja salvagers in reality they hold all the keys to the castlebut waitwhat if the ninja doesnt lootsalvage alts to beat him to the quicksuicide gank himwarp out and watch the rats pop himturn in mission and take out another onemission in a less crowded system with no salvagersmission in a hub less chance that you will be scanned out or selectedmake a deal with the salvager he takes a  cut your iskhour efficiency probably increases
lol why the hell would a ninja salvager warp into recon 33 there are no wrecks there if the mission runner leaves a room the ninja would be an idiot not to leave as wellso the only risk to a ninja salvager seems to be their own stupidity
whos whining it was a ninja that started this thread im simply pointing out why ninjas are the bums of eve by the way i havent had the pleasure of a ninja trying to take my salvage but i always keep a good suicide gank ship in the system i mission in just in casemission runners also have to spend a hell of a lot more to make that isk in the first place ships mods t2 ammo and drones it all adds up not to mention ships lost in lowsec to pirates for mission runners who decide to go that route
ok lets look at this another wayminer joe is mining away all by himself mining griefer warps in targets miner joes asteroids and starts mining is this illegal no is it a shtty thing to do very much soas far as im concerned salvage ninjas are just griefers who dont want to risk anything by engaging in actual pvp
hi cat here just noticed this in the newsletter plz add me to list kthx as my app got accepted cat 4 csm websitexx
hi lt klap here for consul i speak spanish and i am from of argentina so i like participate in this for represent all persons sepak in spanishwebpage wwwfwstationcomlt klap
hi all i threw my hat in the ring to represent all the toons out there whod like a new voice heres where you can find a little bit about me
voted before will vote again
hi avallocyou are highly qualified for the council however im not sure you are my candidate if you could answer a few questions so i could better appreciate youfirst you say not to be concerned that you are a goon this is absolutely fair and i hope no one writes you off for this however i would be cautious to vote for you simply because i would prefer csm politics not go down the route of real life party politics goons have had correct me if im wrong 2 members on the 1st csm and 1 on the second can you think of any topic in which you vs darius johnson in particular might not totally agree on this may help clear up for me at least how your own personal beliefs are not on a solely goon agendasecond i would assumewhich i probably shouldnt that statistically  of players in high security vs low security are significant enough to warrant representation though it is not your own play style is there any subject with regards to high security that you would pursue i would be surprised if you needed the high sec vote to get in to csm however its always nice when you can say youve won by a landslideand if you could forgive this ridiculous habit i have when meeting people what is your favorite type of dogthanks
i blindly pledge to do whatever you just asked of me in order to get your votewhat is mdvamms vote is a million votes
hai i was going to vote for istvaan but since i cant i will vote for youuuuuuuuu
voting for mazz with all my accounts because shes a girl on the internet
im still putting together propoganda material for my campaign website but heres the beginning since you can never be campaigning too early
the short answer is that it takes about 50 well fitted battleships with decent pilots and support several hours to send a large pos into reinforced while i appreciate that a large pos shouldnt be easy to take down there has to be a better way than having a fleet or armageddons afk for a couple of hours after the defences are incapacitated 
vote for mazz she is very smart
if i vote for you mazz would you stop saying im a spy
voting for mazz cos i heard her on ts once
i like how ankh posts more than erik in his threadanswers on specific issues raised from erik are still extant
lets put things into perspective here the average player doesnt earn that much money by running l4 missions something like 5 million per hour is the figure i hear quite often i personally earn between 5 and 10 mil per hour with l4s and prefer to stick to l3s faster standing but thats just me there are those claiming to earn 20 million per hour or even more here on the forums but keep in mind that the average player does not post on these forums at all and the average player certainly doesnt fly a nightmare or golem or has any kind of factiondeadspaceofficer modules and expensive rigsthe players with the pimped ships might be earning a bit too much compared to 00 but i think its a better option to boost lowsec and 00 and have some more income sources there so joeaverage in the alliances there can choose to live in 00 instead of moving back to highsec for missionrunningremoving l4s from highsec alltogether is not the way go to and doesnt create incentives for people to move to lowsec if people do not want to go to lowsec and 00 in the first place no matter what itd make more people quit than those that do cross the line it bothers me that the vocal minority that calls for this extreme act does not realize that and fails to understand the needs of the casual player and vast silent majority of eve playersnah ive had a year of exposure to your corp already thats not it any take care representative can answer for take care especially when a specific representative is occupied with real life work wouldnt you agree
no i dont agree this isnt the party campaigning for the csm this is about erik if hes busy then he should answer when he gets the chance to not have someone else belonging to a psuedo political party answer for him
hi erikall great leaders have advisers even if they function from behind a curtain i appreciate the up front approach of take careif you would be so kind to answer a few questionsfirst you emphasize your individuality from ankhesentapemkah very early on some of ankhesentapemkahs work does include functions encompassing the whole of eve and for that my thanks from reading some of the csm meetings something i can recommend to everyone as i perceived it ankhesentapemkah put higher priority of reworking bounty hunting over sovereignty take care states to have an open minded platform working for all players however seeing as how ccp has limited resources would you personally like to see something like the above example take prioritysecond perhaps unrealistic with 2 instances i can see the same alliances being voted into the csmcorrect me if im wrong after reading arguments from 1 member in particular i can think of no other explanation except that party politics is already involved in this new democratic processas i wasnt there perhaps they just seem like bad arguments on paper if it came up would a representative of take care push not only for the 2 term restriction per pilot but also for a 2 term consecutive restriction per alliance ankhesentapemkah feel free to answer for this last question if you care toand last a fun question if you dont mind what is your favorite dogthank you
hes like superman batman and hugh hefner all rolled into onevuk for csm
what you been bad again istvaan  how could you it is a shame that this has happened you would provide so much to the csm rules are rules i suppose
guess i wont be voting after all i hope captsky gets around to making my new sig soon
hijackcould always just vote for me insteadhijack
no i agree they should vote for youin fact let this be my rallying cry though i myself have fallen in the pursuit of csm power there are many candidates available in this running who arent useless carebears therefore i encourage the voters during this csm run to cast their votes for omber zombie mazzilliu and larkonis trassler i have faith that they will represent my moral stance well enough in the upcoming elections
ive updated the original post with chip mintago and larkonis trasslers interviews ive got a couple of more sitting around still waiting on replies from alot of my commitments
just wondering if you got my responses  i emailed them to you almost a week ago
i too would like to participate
after your initial mail ive never received any questions or request for an interview did a mail get lost somewhere
didnt receive nearly as much support as i would have liked it to have but lets give it a short anywaysstability issues on macbook
thread has been stickied
i see the human sacrifice to the moderator gods worked
bumping for my bro
its good to hear theres a candidate with an understanding of pvp while being pve centered however the sound card on my computer has been fritzed for quite a few months and i only got it working again due to a usb sound cardthat said i would like you to list your favored types of topics and what you would like to change for those of us who havent listened to your radio program everybody has an agenda and its only by finding the people who represent what you endorse that you make a change in the game by votingin that regard there are a few questions i have for you1 what aspects of the game do you think are in the greatest need of change and how would you change those to make the game work better2 what do you like andor dislike about previous csm sessions and how do you think you could do better if given the chance3 if an idea comes up that lies outside of your sphere of influence how will you find an answer to reflect the wants of your constituentsthanks and just trying to get an idea of your platform
well let me start off by saying i love this game i have since i started playing in 2005 i actually was in the beta briefly but my pc at the time needed a triple bypass after trying it due to its low performance after a few years in other games earth and beyond swg i found my home now in eve there is so much about this game that is enjoyable as for aspects that need change that is a difficult topic really i feel that above all else the community is a big portion of what makes or breaks a game dont get me wrong the development support is also a huge factor but the community is what really keeps the players together i read the general discussion forums almost every day mostly taking in the complaints and whines from people and also just looking at what people are discussing i browse the other forums when i am search of information but i find the gd forums to be generally a good read when it is slow at work ectright now one of the biggest topics that the gd forums are raising concern is the contract scams while scamming a player out of hisher isk a right for each and every person in eve it really has gotten out of control to some extent mostly in the form of the local channels of trade hubs being bombarded every second with more and more contract scam spammage the local channel wasnt really designed for that and some people do enjoy a little conversation with others in system but that is impossible when there is so much spam being saidpersonally i also wouldnt mind seeing ccp go through with the removal of local or changing local to be like wormhole space the idea of not knowing who else is there with you really brings a rush to me when i go into a wormhole local channel is more of a crutch for lowsec00 when fleets are looking for fights ecti would also like to see a return of the ingame events on a certain scale one time as a member of an alliance in 00 space we got contacted by a mordus legion npc run by isd to do an escort mission to the mordus station on 5zxxk the alliance formed a fleet and pulled off the escort without a hitch though some others tried to stop us which was great fun pew pew one of the most memorable experiences in eve and i think with some planning could be brought back the previous csm sessions i think they were really useful to the community a few items that the csm brought to the table were really taken in by ccp and eventually made their way into eve skill queue the csm is really a unique element of eve which makes eve that much greater when you compare it to other games of similar type one reason for this is ccp really takes the csm seriously i feel i can offer the csm a community orientated side because of having a talkshow on the radio i ask and also get asked many questions about the different aspects of eve
im always learning and expanding my knowledge with eve recently i started getting into tech2 invention as well as poss the eveonline forums as well as other players inside the eve universe are a great resource at everyones fingertips ive also used my show as an outlet to voice questions when i am interested in learning more about different aspects of the game its amazing how much knowledge is out there in the community and everyone is always so helpful not a problem i had actually considered running in the previous 2 elections but reallife took precedence over my choice i was chosen to host the alliance tournament coverage shows during the tournament and enjoyed doing it a lot we offered very unique perspective to the community and everyone enjoyed it it was the biggest thing i had ever done for the community and i would love the opportunity to help out the community again i love this gamealso anyone interested my scheduled show is 0400 to 0700 eve time saturdays on new eden radio feel free to tune in or join in on our conversations in our in game channe newedenradio

its very truemost people i see skip the af for the hac since it fills its role better sucks when an interceptor can outdps an assault frigate
af need 4th bonus indeedand btw every t2 ship shoud have hes own role bonus so every t2 ship has his own role in gang
you know what the funny thing is when i hear people quote the jag is one of the best afs have you looked at how people fit this ship then took a look at the bonuses the bonus suggests artillery as the ships weapon of choice and afs are meant to speedsignature tank yet the tank most people fit is a medium shield extender and an abmwd and webpointits quite ridiculous that the long range minnie af gets used as the short range heavy tackler with autocannons not by me though p also i fully endorse the adding of a fourth bonus to the assault frigates although it doesnt necessarily need to be the bonuses proposed by the op
10
i was gonna write a big post arguing about long range fitted afs but to be honest i dont really care its great that people have success with both autos and artys would be a shame if there was one good way to fit a ship and everything else didnt work it would remove the ingeunity in putting together a fit noone has thought of beforewhat im really trying to say is that i hope the 4th bonus isnt one that confines the ships to being used in a certain way for example if only the wolf was given a tracking bonus and not the jag youd be forced to use a wolf if you want to get up close and personal  the way i like to fly my jag but am finding really suffers from not having the tracking of a rifter of course a tracking bonus would also suit the arty use as well hence not confining ships to a particular role
best of luck vukkick their asses and get it done for all of us super cap pilots out here
ing rights supported good on you
agree we need reworked titans and motherships bonussesrolesbut im not agree with topic starterccp say titan should be a logistic ship i say its bull coz titan should be a flagship with heavy defence and firepower capabilities
the proposed changes keep titans with immense firepower and usefulness they just dont allow them to be the 1 shot killers they are now
i would support the idea but not with such overpowered stats as the op suggests missions are lucrative enough as they are without speeding up the process even moreperhaps have longer range tractor beams with slower tractor speed as a tradeoff so players might have to think a little more about what sort of tractor beam might suit their style of mission runningben
this but im going to support now rather than later that said when salvaging i frequently end up going too fast if i do it after a mission ends and outrun my own cans and this is with a bc having a longer slower one which doesnt require as much running around andor would allow me to grab a can that accidentally fell of the end while i slow down would be nice okay i admit it im kind of voting for thinking less but salvagings pretty brainless as it is and id rather have it be simple and brainless instead of complicated and brainless
i would like to see the ability to add or even make it a default a column for meta level in the items listit would make organizing our accrued crap easier we could sort by meta level and identifyrefine all the low meta level itemsthis may help server lag if everyone is refining all items below a certain meta level there may be less for the server to trackstoremaybe this is an option currently and i have not found it
i know ive seen people asking for this before though im not sure if ccp has already brought it up but yes this would be one of the best single features they could add to inventory management
yes
raised the issue is still outstanding as a fix has not yet been applied and this is the only naglfar specific topicthe nag is the biggest white elephant in the game with no advantagesgreat inferioritys and certainly no role
the question is why ccp does hate mintards
yes the naglfar needs ballancing not that i necessarily want it to be changed to a 4 turret layout but it does need some changeson a sidenote on capital ships signature radius is not an issue while it is true that the naglfar has the smallest signature of all dreads it means nothing since1 dreads in siege mode dont move2 xl weapons signature resolution is still smaller than the naglfars signature so no help from thereand on a sidenote adding a falloff bonus component to all optimal affecting modules as tds already have would help minmatar weaponry quite a bit as you can see with the xl arties 88km falloff is quite a number to be modified by a range mod
topic needs additional bumpage this is important  well more important than additional bling on ships and such
agreed the whole corp interface needs an overhaul it makes no sense to new players and old players dont like dealing with it
id rather see a skill that adds 10 range to tractor beams per level and adding that as a bonus to graviton physics sounds fine to me
ive lost a carrier in empire recently turns out you have to wait 20 seconds before you jump  for the purpose of getting a better look at the flashing red gang in front of you obviously i was bumped to hell and back immediately after exiting the station and couldnt make it back mwding vagabonds are quite fun aint theyso im wondering what is the common procedure in such cases1 check station surroundings with an alt first2 set an insta jump bookmark prior to exiting the station with the carrier3 log offlog off works as intended however i would appreciate it if the untargetable time interval after undocking in empire could be extended to 30 seconds or more for capital shipsps go to null sec and use bubbles  dictors you lamers
not supported you are wrongwhy1 dread in siege modedreads in siege mode are supposed to be anti posdread weapons if you want to hard hit a moving target while in siege mode you have to use some tricks sieged dreads shall not be able to do it outofthebox there are two tools for that target painter and webberwhile the webber cannot be used on supercaps but it still works on carriers and unsieged dreads the only point is ship fited webbers are too weak to give you enough dmg boost alone the only webbers that have good effect are the faction webber arrays but these are expensive and only avaiable if you are in range of a pos which is equipped with them and if you manually direct them to web your target you want to kill these pre nerf aera like 975 faction webber arrays are able to web a bs down to a speed where you can alpha strike it with your citadels when used together with painting go and buy such babies if not do not complain about fast moving targetsthe second tool the target painter helps to hit moving capital targets with citadel torpedoes harder the small explosion radius of 1000m for a citadel torp compared to the much larger sig radius of a cap is your friend while it was limiting damage during speed tanking before the nanonerf it does not any more after the nerf excessive sig radius painting of speed tanking targets can be used to overcompensate lack of explosion velocity this was designed to give afterburners better speed tanking capabilities over microwarps which allow faster speeds while blowing up the sig radius so if you want see your citadels hit hard use excessive painting by skilled pilots in ships with painter bonus and not by your five tp900 drones the formular on the page you referenced is correct redo the math with painting appliedsomething similar applies to small pos structures while they are not moving arround they still have too less less than 1000m the ex radius of the citadel is limiting damage here sig radius to take the full punch of your citadels to compensate this you need paintingon not moving targets with larger sig radius than 1000m you dont need any painting this aplies to siege mode dreads to the pos forcefield and to capitals with active cyno generatorseverything is fine here nothing is broken and nothing needs to be boostednerfed just the description of the siege module should be clarified2 dread out of siege modeyou can hit moving caps with full damage isnt it you also can move your dread arround speedtanking other dreads who try to gank you from siege mode and they can try to webpaint you to compensate so everything fine here tooconclusionnothing is broken nothing is bugged nothing needs to be boostedfixednerfed ok maybe gun fitted sieged dreads should be nerfed to not to be able to hard hit moving targets any more not even the large ones but thats another story all tools are in game to help with damage while in siege mode you just need to use them the need to use them is not epic failure its fun dreads allready are one trick ponies ok maybe two trick ponies you need to turn on trick 1a siege mode before you can use trick 1b lots of volley dmg it would be boring if a dread could deal full siege mode dmg without any support by webberpainter matesequipmentdont panic everything is fine
let me start with a simple assertion if citadel torpedoes are fine now they mustve been overpowered beforethey werent they have been made significantly less effective against moving targets therefore they are underpowered now qedi could leave it at that but since youve taken the time to write a well structured post i will answer you fully and point out your numerous misconceptions and your tendency to mistakenly apply your personal ideas on game design your first misconception why this is wrong dreads are anti pos and anticap ship weapons if the devs didnt want dreads to be used against carriers  supercaps they would have made all dreads innefective against those targets not one and a half of them and even then only since the missile formula change if they werent carriers would have no same sized counter that is poor design and thankfully thats not the direction the devs took with dreads no matter how hard you wish it werelets assume you may be right for a second it would mean every alliance that has ever deployed dreads to kill a carrier or supercap lacks your in depth understanding of how the game was meant to be played and has in fact been massively failing or you could be wrong guess which one is more likelythe reality is all dreads were effective against caps of all types more so than any other ship class turret dreads still are therefore an imbalance that needs to be fixed amazing how you brush off supercaps as they cause all your arguments to break down they cannot be webbed they cannot be painted they are there and cannot be ignored if you expect to be taken seriously once again for emphasis you cannot ignore supercaps
anywayship webs and painters are band aids citadel explosion velocity is a throat wound yes they work on carriers  3 60 webs and a tp gives full damage against a thanatos but with that kind of support youd expect to start doing damage to lower ship classes as is the case for every other ship class in eve so lets take a look at what would happen if you used those three webs and a painter on a battleship the megathron for examplehow about three webs  three painterskeep in mind these are worst case scenarios with max transversal and that the phoenix is fitting two additional damage modsthe question is why use citadels when you could use a gun dread and kill not only same sized ships but do serious damage to battleships and some bcs as well with that same support the answer should be obvious your mention of pos webs fails for two reasons not all cap fights happen at pos most do but you cannot pretend fights dont happen at stations gates or elsewhere feel free to look up battle reports if in doubtthe second reason is that major cap battles at pos happen when the pos exits reinforced see that cpu use on the webs it means they are offline when reinforced you really should know thisgun dreads do full damage with no painters doesnt seem balanced at all but this thread is about explosion velocity and youre off topicif youre shooting another cap out of siege mode and youre not flying a moros youre doing it wrong the reason is simple youd be more useful in a carrier or battleship no its not either citadel explosion velocity is broken or gun dreads are way too good at hitting carriers and smaller targets and have been since their introduction with nothing concrete to support the latterquoting this again this is where you fail the most dreads already need support to be effective wanting them to need more support isnt stupid per se but one weapon type needing that extra support to hit same sized targets while three do not is massively broken stop writing about how eve is in terms of how you want it to be in a thread about a balance issue
sorry if ive upset you with my answer it was not my intentioni dont want to apply my ideas of game design and i dont want writing about how eve is in terms of how i want it to be if this was your imression then im sorry english is not my natural language  i do my best to get into words what i think and i know sorry if i fail trying what ive written is what ive learned all the years in eve but back to topic balancing or not balancing citadels thats fact allow me to cite for proof from new ship classes planned for this year devblog 229sieged dreads are inteded for antibattleship role really no in a later devblog oveur gets more concrete from sneak peaks part iii  needful things  devblog 247 original emphasisso it is not my idea to have sieged dreads as weapons against immobile targets okyou can hit slow targets with a sieged dread thats not a problem at all it is not a problem even with ganking something like the megathron in your example above you show 900 dps there not much for a spider tanking mega but does dps really care for phoenix ganking a bs how much volley dmg is it its 22k per volley per phoenix bring four friends with more sieged phoenix dreads and the poor guy in the mega gets 110k within a timeframe of one second between the first impact and the last one no chance to spidertank that if the buffer is not large enough so whats wrong with that nothing you need coordination and support to get such kills its a fun challenge or do you really want such kills shall be possible solo i suppose not so if you ask for rebalancing citadels towards more dps then you also ask for much less volley dmg to compensate its a bad idea to provoke the nerfbat here its nice as it is and nerfbats are known to hit where noone expectsnext point the hitting supercaps with full damage can you hit a supercap with full damage yes you can wait till he activates triage clone vat bay or cyno maybe he will never do it then you still can hit him with reduced but good damage even if you cannot paintweb him why do you think you should be able to hit him with full damage while he is moving eve is a stonepaperscissor game nothing is perfect here ive digged arround and found this cite for you
from more balancing changes for revelations 22  devblog 494hmm so originally not intended to siege caps but no problem when they get better suited as a side effect on balancing of the scanning system but still no words about dreads to be the ideal suited antimovingsupercapweapon ive digged arround and found it nowhere maybe because it simply isnt intended to be one like absolutley nothing in eve is inteded to be perfect because perfect is boringbut ccp fendahl shows a much better way for rebalancing than to mess up with explosion velocity maybe you should just ask to increase sig radius and sensor strength of the supercaps a little would 10 be enough for you however i still dont think its neccecarymaybe gun based dreads can deal in special situations more damage to moving supercaps than missile based the minmatar dread is another story the difference is missile dreads do not need to take movement of the target into account the fc can cyno them anywhere on the battlefield they jump in siege lock and start fire the target cannot reduce the damage by manuvering into another direction for gun based dreads the fc must do his homework to get them positioned well so they can deal ideal dmg both concepts have an advantagedisadvantage its balancedask yourself is it really a must have for you to deal 100 dmg into a moving supercap in all situations or arent the 2k25k dps enough its not perfect but more than a bs or carrier could deliver so even the phoenix is as it is now a good suited anti cap ship no matter if the supercap is moving or notanother reason why i would not try to force the devs to look closer on this topic is when they start to do they will take a look on the gun based dreads maybe with the result of a nerf of them if they sometimes hit bs too easyexplosion velocity is the verry wrong screw to use for rebalancing this issue if it is an issue at all
eve is filled with inactive towersespacially in empire i say if you put a tower somewhere it should be activetherefore i would propose that all towers who have been inactive for more then a month should be removed automaticly from the gameincluding all modshangarsstuf in the hangars etc
it should be more than just having them removedpeople would exploit them by not putting in fuel except enough for a day or an hourit should lose health over time right down to structure
i agree with the principle but i think it would be more appropriate to automatically unanchor them and let the problem sort itself out
would make for a great new sport tower hijacks ftw
i have no issues with it but i do feel it should be an option for playersmaybe a render of the station with a render of the ship instead of realtimethe normal look should default on but the option to turn it off should definitely exist my laptop would definitely be thankful
supported
one thing that would be very cool is the addition of an alliancecorp marketplacethe ability to add things for sale on the market to alliancecorp members only and a filter to show only alliance member offeringswhat this would allow is the ability for alliance members to post items at very cheap prices for their mates i dont really look to make a fortune on drops i find and would rather support my mates but find communicating what all i have all the time is difficult currentlymy alliance has members from all time zones so asking if anyone has an item available only hits a portion of the members and only those on linethrowing all your crap into the exchange hanger gets to be a mess real fastof course these items would have to be outside of the normal sale slot count or your open market slots would be used up fastcharging a fee andor tax for each item should keep players from abusing it as a storage areai feel this would add another perk for alliancecorp members
i really fail to see why this is needed as the current contract system does the same exact thing you want so why should we do something elseisaac
i agreewe need an corpalliance marketplace
it will help contracts are awkward
i would love this as my character has the majority of their skills to level 5 and it would save a marginal amount of time
sensible and logical request thumbs upben
this tbhthere really is no reason why all prices should not be displayed in numerals as described above this is common practice even in rl when you write a cheque for example
thats one of the points the op makes there are no letters as such just numbers that have a similar effect to being snow blind
fix local and cov ops  then we will talk
i fully support any attempt to fix an exploit any lamer caught using a login trap should be banned imho any abuse of the system is an exploit and should be dealt with rather than over looked by ccp
i think it should work only if your currently training the prereq on the last level before the new skillsso say im learning skill a to learn skills bi need skill a to lv3 before i can learn skill bi can only inject skill b when skill a is at level 3i hope that makes sence
cant believe i didnt support this yet
good idea counterarguments at weak at best
its a simple enough idea in concept that there are no doubt coding issues thatll keep it from happeningi can see the attractionive run into the problem myself a couple of time alreadybut theres always other stuff to train ive been keeping a full queue all the time and using low priority skills as filler when i need to retains a bit of the training time juggling thats traditionally been almost a minigame as wellnot supported
i was thinking that having a system to remove unwanted skills would be a good thing to have in eve for example when you are new and dont really know what you are training you end up training something that in the long run you will never use so maybe you could have it that you remove one skill and it saves those points into a pool that you could use for another skill
welcome to assembly hallplease avoid bold typing your posts as it comes across as you dont want to be viewed as the worlds most annoying noobespecailly when you start typing and doing funny funny things like this and that which dont really increase the chances of being noticedas to your proposalnot supportedif the pilot is new have them reroll a new char they get the skill double time bonus as it is when they start outthe only mistake is lost time its not the end of the world unless your an obsessive compulsive neat freak
i am talking about a year down the road when you have 18mill sp or more and you end up with a skill that you have no use of
i think this would be kind of a cool feature it will compensate for when ccp nerfs and entire shipskilltree out of all usefulness and makes millions of skillpoints worthless to have players shouldnt be penalized when ccp makes a game balance decisionthis is probably the best way to alleviate player hurt when ccp does something like this if i dont see a better alternative if i get elected ill probably try pushing this to see what ccp thinks
i think it is a good idea especially for the more common skills where everyoneor near enough must have like basic nav and gunnery skills but also it should be like specialized in some area where people who use laser find laser books in a cheaper place or minnie cruiser books are generally cheaper in minner areas out skirts of the region become more expensivecheaper depending in your going to or going away from where the book is most use to the race but things those especially hard to findexpensive books shouldnt be able to find in a central areatldr its good idea but on a small scale or raceregion
seems like a reasonable feature to add as long as the rarer books are kept on the market in some fashion
cant support thisfirst off  this is not about the frustration of flying off to some place to get skills i know all to well why thats suckysecondly skill books are seeded in each region as far as empires your not likely to find amarr books in minmatar space however you do why because players buy them in bulk and sell them on the marketde what you propose would disrupt that mechanic and potentially cause damage to the game economicsnot to mention the fact you run into an issue as far as special skills being kicked around by loot drops and other thingsand this also makes things just a bit too easy it would drive up the demand for free injection of skill booksi happen to like the idea of 00 pilots having to risk there necks for that titan skill book or that dread skill bookkeeps things livelyif you want to get into the rp business read up on the backstories theres one in particular detailing a capsuleer picking up a skill book  o unfortunately this is something of a pricetag and if ccp is willing to overlook that or invent a mechanic to compensate i have to say nootherwise yes i like the fact i dont need to fly off to some dark corner for a skill bookbut then you have to do the same thing for your ships your equipment materialsskill books would be the first step people have toyed with ai shipping companies and yet you get pirates who demand the ability to attack themetcetcthis is a can of worms need to tread carefullyill be more than happy to change my mind if given a strong enough reason
hi there forum dwellersthis proposal is simple make autocannons reload as fast as laser crystals and make them keep on shooting until the cargo is empty of ammunitionif you have say 2000 bullets in your cargo the autocannon will empty its magazine reload and keep on shooting without the need to reactivate de module until theres nothing else to shoot at that will give back the auto in autocannons
why
they are called auto cannons because they automatically shoot until the clip is dry not because they reload automatically
ehhh i think your confusing the situation opfirst off autocannons are raipid fire cnanonsyour comparing them to laser cannons which have no reloadwhat your probably wanting to ask is the ability to hot swap ammo quicklylaser cannons use a single crystal per cannon auto cannons uses a kajillion buwets that must be precisely loaded into there itty bitty wittle slots for pew pew pew action
there somewhere is this mittani tentonhammer article about the first ever titan belonging to lotka volterra which was obviously an alliance led by a ccp employee this was before the internal affairs bureau existed and as far as i know and thats from reading the article the employee needed to abbandon the character as obviously one of the rules is that nobody can know youre a ccp employee and that no ccp employee is allowed to lead an allianceas for other rules i dont know and about insider knowledge all changes are known to the public before the changes go live that is the reason why ships quadruple in price when changes are applied to them because some the broker like characters have so much isk at their disposal that they can pretty much control the marketbut since that is also pretty much how people can make money in the real world its nothing gamebreaking but just a showcasing of human nature where egoism and greed is usually kingand your fear and i even dare say paranoia is also a showcasing of another side of human nature accompagnied by greed and egoism too of course but mainly fear of the unknown
im not saying what it is now im saying what it was originally thought up as being which was an anticorruption organizationthis new york times article predates whatever csm manifestos because it predates everything else officially csm relatedbeing the first serious mention of the csm ive seen mentioned anyways
while it would be very easy for ccp players to use inside knowledge to make lots of isk do you think most would risk their jobs just for some isk that is already easy to come by
i got a proposal for ccp regarding the csm council and i wish the csm council to bring it to their attention i want to be able to vote blank votes during votation so you could vote in a vacant seat into the csm council if there are no worthy candidates from what i have seen lately of possible csm candidates i am afraid sooner or later a completely joke candidate might end up being voted into the boardsthx
id support it if i by default get the seat of the blank candidateedit this is why we ought to remove term limits
armour reppers rep at the end of their cycle not the start and as such you need 400 cap just to initially activate them and then wait 1115 seconds for large reps before they repair any damage at allone of the ideas proposed was to activate them for the same 400 cap but for the repair amount they give to be spread out over the entire cycle time instead of having to wait until the end of it for the benifitits a reasonable idea and would be make judging if your tank was going to break or hold against incoming damage a lot easier along with it repairing some of the volley damage done in between the rep cycles by ships with a fast enough rate of fire to get 2 volleys off in between the currant repair cycles
sentry drones like the bouncer ii have a optimal of 60km42km falloff and are no more than a turret you drop in spacethe alteration i would make is there auto aggro range and the range that they can be told to attack a target to be at least the same as their optimal and falloff obviously if you were controling bouncer iis for example you would need to be able to lock the target you wish to assign them to attack but the auto aggro would not need such you could obviously only give your sentry drones orders if you were within your ships available drone control rangethis would have quite a few nice effects firstly any ship with the ability and space to use a sentry drone would have a effective ecm proof auto aggro effect secondly they would have a assignable counter if they have the lock range to ships out to 100km with the right sentries of course looks significantly towards the new ecm ranges on the falconps i saw this on another forum and stole it to post here as i think its a very good idea
agreedwe lose tons of drones and take a big hit on our mining yield because our hulk pilot is on a mac and crashes every ten minutes
a i dont see this problem other than the usual issues i have along with other people who happen to be running 1056 and running nvidia gpushowever if your running ati cardsintel gpu or running 104 or both then your not going to get support as they clearly say not supported on the minimum requirementsif you are well then you should max your ram out and if your still having trouble well again i dont have memory leaks here just a crash on exit which is well im exiting so yeahb ccp cant do anything about drivers they only use what is available drivers are supplied by the manufacturer and or the operating system developer in this case applec the largest problem is the fact the game is not native its windows craptastic code being translated to something partially understandable for the mac osx platform and until ccp gets off there butt and codes the damn thing nativly not likely to happen unfortunatelydont get me wrong i support this but you mac pilots obviously have a very limited view of whats reality here your view is just eve online so dont hold your breath if you dont get itbe happy weve gotten this far maybe its time you updated your mac hardware o  or just sit tight things might get better yetsupport regardless acsp actc acmt credentials and im not just ranting to be ranting i know mac i fix mac i study it and im not happy with some of there ideas but its better than windows
to drakefirst id like to address us mac pilots not living in the real world when it comes to very complicated issues such as a memory leak in the drivers of my card yes you are entirely right im not living in the real world i dont know up from down when it comes to stuff like that so when i see eve crashing within a half hour of getting into space i figure its gotta have something to do with evesecondly i cant update my mac hardware because i am running on a macbook now im no rocket surgeon but eve ran perfectly fine on my macbook before apocrypha was released ccp patched apocrypha and now if i step out of the station i crash within a halfhour without fail i understand that ccp works with the materials that they have at their disposal but why is it so impossible to get a mac specific patch that workslastly as for upgrading the memory i have 4 gigs in this machine the issue isnt one of having enough memory its that the memory seems to disappear let me give you an examplei can sit for hours on end in the station with no problems at all but as soon as i exit the station and go into space funny things start happening i notice that eve starts taking up more and more memory until it crashes i can watch this happen in my activity monitor and it happens every timeso i guess the issue for me really is that ccp acknowledged a memory leak and said they fixed it when they clearly did not and now we cant viably play the game like i said im very much not a computer whizz matter of fact im barely computer literate but i do know that it worked before and now it does notas for the issue of eve not running natively on the mac os im not necessarily asking ccp to pull time and resources away from making the game better as a whole to create a native mac client what i would like to see however is a response from ccp telling us exactly what the problem is and why everyone tells me it is impossible to fix like i said earlier eve ran fine before and i just dont understand why it is impossible for it to run fine againdidnt mean to lace into you by the way drake but to me buying a new computer is just a terrible option to even think about i dont have a couple hundred bucks to buy another machine and as it stands im pretty sure that i am unable to upgrade the video card in my macbook thanks for the time guys and thank you lavista for at least trying to help us mac users out and bring it more to ccps attention
oh as a side note i fly drone boats primarily so thats why im so agitated also apologies for ignorance
i support this idea 100plus it could help when you have the dreaded lost socket issue which has been happening less since the last patch
shouldnt this be in features and ideas rather than in the assembley hallor even game development for that matter
currentlly the importance of some moon minerals is none compared to others of same rarity take for example r64 moons dysproprom vs neothulium the fix is simple change some of the t2 components needs so all the minerals of the same rarity have more or less the same weight you could even make it racial based the importance of the resources should be based around rarity and not only about distribution some regions have more r64 than others and this is fien as it promotes strategic objectives for alliances but some regions have more of one type than others ie fountain delve this makes still possible to manipulatemonopolize the resources but not as easy as now as it stands by controlling 24 regions you can almost control a big part of the t2 market this makes life much harder for competing alliances new  old but if you need to control 610 regions across the whole universe it gets much more difficult but still possible for large coalitionsorganziationsps edit for some typossome addition related ideas which have been proposed and talked about allready also hopefully sov will be tied to planets while industry will be keept around moons so lowend mining would make more sense there should be a possiblity to incap moon mining arrays by decent sized roaming gangs ie 30men hac fleets
i fail to see the problemissue and your solution is incredibly hard to findno supportisaac
i dont really feel like nerfing regions that my alliance  allies have just conquered
i respectfully beg to differ as it stands now and by ccps own admission 40 of minerals comes from loot reprocessing while i dont want to completely make that impossible it means that if the miners stop mining and start missioning by and large they will be able to make up for the rest of the mineral requirement by reprocessing their own dropsid like a good explanation for why an entire profession has to suffer as a consequence of a game mechanic which makes the profession as good as obsoletei read arguments against nerfing loot drop reprocessing because it would raise the price of minerals when i take off my rosy glasses and squint against the bright light of reality before my eyes adjust to the glare i see an entire profession having to perform its humble task in ships that barely have the capacity to defend themselves are open to riskfree harassment that cannot operate as a solo endeavour in nulsec where the shiny stuff residestime and again i read about how few people there are in nulsec and how theres basically not much mining there obviously there is mining mostly in fleet operations but the solo miner just doesnt have a snowballs chance in hell there is no mystery to it the miner flies a space frame to harvest a commodity in an extremely hostile environment i dont have a problem with a hostile environment i have a big problem with the fact that there is no space frame available that is designed to withstand the rigors of nulsec space if anyone mentions the rorqual as an argument to indicate there is a ship for miners in nulsec im going to scream very loudlywhy is it that the combat pilot can now fly a new configuration of combat ship every day of the year without having to fly in the same space frame twice and the miner has exactly nothing that will facilitate low security space mineral harvestingyou implore us to see the big picture how about this perspective people express reservations about the price of minerals going up if loot drops were nerfed why would mineral prices go up because of the fantastic risk associated with harvesting them you know basic economics miners are looked down upon and scorned but the people who do that are not flying ships themselves that are essentially defenceless in an extremely hostile environment where capsuleers fly ships with vast amounts of longrange fire power which i dont begrudge them to be clear go ask them what price minerals would have to trade at to make the enterprise an acceptable risk for them to undertake im willing to bet that no mineral anywhere in eve trades at half the prices they would requirei see people leaving the mining profession because they make more isk missioning i cant blame them as it stands now it would be far easier for ccp to remove mining as a profession from the game because they obviously dont care enough about it to provide an adequate environment for the endeavour to thriveabulurd bonifaceme meceo
as long as the ability exists to use it in empire from people smuggling them in im all for it while this could potentially cause some balance issues if large amounts of them started arriving in empire it would boost smuggling a bit maybe have some new npc that cargo scans miners in a belt every 15 minutes or so to see what kind of crystals are being used and an appropriate fine is levied if caught regardless im all for boosting lowsec and 00 get more people out of empire and let them explore the rest of the game
not supported if existing ores with similar such mineral yields arent enough for lowsec miners why would more of the same make any differenceben
the existing ores have entirely different mineral yields  thats sort of the point the minerals i proposed are worth twice as much as the best lowsec ore that exists right now and three times as much as the joke that is jaspet
nox and iso arent dropped heavily in missions they are dropped i huge amounts in 00 loot so youre adding 00 loot 00 superior rocks to the mixnox is in way over supply atm in game a lot of this has to do with the last rock adjustments that were introduced to game prices are also falling because freighters arent getting ganked in high sec and jump freighters are making ore transportation from 00 to empire very easy simply put to fix mining nox and isogen need to be reduced heavily in the supply chain both 00 and low sec rocks
supportedand i love the idea of selecting default launch groupprobably put that in the rightclick menu on a group
supported i hate playing without my shortcuts and this would be a good one to add
signed
i approve of this
i like this idea i think that ccp would definitely need to look over this before anything would be implemented but that is true of anything suggested here
i agree and fully support thisand where the hell is my interbus storyline agent damn it youve already said you guys are working on it ccp but where is it lolbut yeah itd be super nice for all my interbus work not to go in vainif not a storyline agent at least an lp store
if you can run missions for a corp it should have a decent lp store
fighters do have a drone bandwidth its the same as heavies 25 bandwidth its why the carriers bandwidth is 375 15 x 25  375 15 being the highest possible amount of drones on a carrier using 5 dcus motherships have 625 bandwidth which is 25 drones x 25  625 simplest fix is triage mod zeros out the bandwidth on carriersmoms

thank you for the questions well darius johnson and i have have very different personalities i would venture to say im quite a bit more amicable than him in dealing with people we both however want to see the game grow stronger whether it is for empire players or those out in 00 space the goon agenda runs the same as all 00 entities for the most parts we want 00 to be potentially enjoyable and fun for everyone of course we want our enemies to suffer but within the rules of the game and not by cheating we want to see the game as fair for everyone who plays it and no favoritism shown i would like to see the high security players have a little more excitement in their gameplay the great thing about eve that wow for example lacks is the capability to be a truly dynamic environment blizzard pretty much controls everything a wow player gets to enjoy and the players have limited options in terms of doing things outside the boxthe designers created the ability to have scripted events which location are generated randomly would be a great thing for high sec players who wish to take part would warp to the beacon that appeared within the system maybe the use of sleeper ai would be great for this too after a specific time the beacon would vanish and by the next downtime and uncleared parts of that event are despawnedwhich breed labrador retrievers

do you think pos sieging and cap ships need to be changed or do you believe they are fine as they are
motherships need to be changed and the amount of time it takes putting up poses need to be changed id like to figure out some helpful suggestion that would involve reducing the amount of time spent boringly shooting at a pos but i havent thought of one and i havent seen one good enough
hi cat herei feel that it would be prudent to at least try to explain myself at this point ive held off revealing too much in my forum posts so far mainly keeping in the cat character some shrewd folk have already guessed that there is more to cat than meets the eye but please remember that cat has been a character with a degree of roleplay involvedtakes off cat earswhat would make me a good csm member eve basedi am actively involved in most facets of eve as a player currently i help run a successful industrial corporation involved in mining production invention poss and such gubbins im quite aware of the issues that industrialists are facing and have a decent base knowledge of this sector of evethis is the bit that pains me to admit as cat i am a pvper im a ganker a deccer ive podded people who didnt want to be podded for those that worked out that leaving eve who talks about his ganking occasionally was probably a cat alt yep ive been a director of a moderately successful pvp corp for a considerable amount of time i say moderately successful because we take on a lot of new players and a few unfortunate choices were made with some wts i still regard this as a positive as weve helped many new players blossom into pvpers i am however very familiar with pvp i will never proclaim to know all about everything but i think i know something about most at leastthis character betrays me in that i am actually a coherent social and understanding person ive made a whole bunch of friends in this game heck ive even had friendly chats with wts while were busy trying to kill each otherparagraph tldr ive mined built researched invented ganked yarrd warred missioned pirated antipirated and made friends in the processwhat would make me a good csm member rl basedmy job has a strong emphasis on problem solving and process improvement if something isnt working as well as it could be im often the one asked to look at the situation i understand that this is a great balancing act  improve speedreduce quality or that adding steps in a process may increase workload but ultimately improve customer servicerelations basically i understand that every decision on process or policy does have an impact elsewhere obvious or not i can see ccps point of view on many things but as i deal with generally irate customers in my own line of work i fully understand that customers have needs and requirements and that these must be taken into accountstanding policiesim going to go out on a limb here and say that i do not intend to bring any of my own grievances into account im not planning on going into a csm meeting screaming to nerf pirates or whatever that in my opinion is not really the job of the csm members to force their own issues on the groupi plan to gather up player issues apply a triage based system and present them in an appropriate manner i think my rl experience with customers and business lend themselves to this approachmy point is mainly that i am not here to enforce ideals but to listen to the crowd thats what a representative does rightin closingas stated above i am generally aware of most arenas of eve i have decent social skills and a positive and constructive approach in dealing with people and situations i honestly feel that i could be an asset to the csm and to the playerbase in general ill open the floor now
came expecting one thing left moderately surprised i suppose a few questions wouldnt hurt since this post displays a good level of sensesince youve mined built researched invented ganked yarrd warred missioned pirated and antipirated what would you say is your favorite activity to do in evewhat in your opinion are the three biggest issues balance or otherwise in eve todayrisk vs reward in hisec  nerf hisec or boost lowsec00how did you feel the ecm nerf was handled and is there anything you would have changednot sure if you have enough experience with 00 to answer these so they go in a separate sectionwhat are your thoughts on pos spam and the 00 sovereignty mechanics in generaltitans as a fleet ender  with multiple doomsdays becoming fairly common does anything need to be changedmotherships are in need of some love what do you think should be done to make them more useful
some of the most fun ive had in eve has actually been ganking miners in highsec the reasons are several knowing i ruined that guys 100m retriever then the hillarious local talk afterwards victim then engaged me using his killrights so i took his 70m caracal off him smack increased in local death threats and such i waited for a wardec that never happened in the end i decd their corp with my 1 man corp they paid me off before any losses on either side that was all very funi think metagaming is a contentious issue i cant really think of a solution that would be successful and popular reputation score that is applied to the account not just the character maybenoob corps theyre too good a hiding placei cant think of a third right now maybe blobs im tentative on that one thoughi definitely wouldnt say nerf highsec the carebear crowd probably contribute significantly to the market if you made their lives harder they wouldnt venture into lowsec but probably jack up prices im certainly not going to be encouraging more expensive shipsmods id say boost lowsec i think adding random faction navy patrols would be a positive thing here as it would make a pirates job to gatecamp potentially more difficult nb more difficult not impossible this security could entice more miners into lowsec generally lowsec is more risk than reward i think the ecm nerf was long overdue the falcon was previously too powerful due to its range i like the idea of the scorpion being a brawler must say though i dont fly caldari  but my friends do and they seem to be taking it quite wellmy experience with 00 is limited but i have lived there in a couple of spates i was part of a smaller alliance claiming some space starting to get sov but then the alliance heads got threats and pulled out  much to my corps dismay cant effectively answer your questiontitans and a ddd are aoe weapons so their deployment could damage their own fleets and theyre unable to jump for some time after a ddd which gives the attackers time to assemble a counter fleet maybe the cyno timer could be increased again not my area of expertise so my opinions here are formed on what i have read not what i have donei know less about motherships than i do titans so i have to pass on this onecat
well  there isnt any point in me voting now the screams of terror are becoming distant echos
vote for me as the grief candidate in the csm istavaan if i win i will carry on your legacy of the destruction of carebears and all who do good let no infractions no matter how major tarnish our campaign for evil be it in the game or in the metagame let no peaceful citizen of eve go unpunishedalso i am a girl in real life have i not mentioned this yet
hi cat herei have been wondering lately how to increase public awareness of my csm campaign and i think prizes are the way to go im not a very wealthy cat so i was trying to think of other optionsin the real world i might have leaflets for people to put on their coffee tables or badges to wear but no luck like that here im quite good at art so that was my solution i thoughtso if you consider cat4csm you could be the proud owner of some lovely custom art i make just let me know what ship you would like and i will make it for youhere is an example of a thorax i drew you can see it only has 3 blasters but it does use 5 drones delivery time is dependent on workload
helo m8
if you can create some rule 34 of a thorax and an avatar ill consider it
 or gtfo
honestly for a csm candidate you know pretty little about eve particularily eve forums because if you did you would know that posting pics in the forums is not allowed they should be linkedwhen it comes to buying their way towards votes either by paying people to view their adds or by other means i am getting sick maybe some people take csms for a joke but i dont so when i vote with my accounts in may i will certainly vote for people who have at least shown some integritypersonally i think ccp should make it possible to vote blanks so there could be some vacatant seats in the csm counsil if there where no worthy candidates running i am afraid sooner or later a joke candidate will be voted in
ankh cant run again dont worry

well the issue was voted down as it wasnt an important enough issue according to the following peoplevuk laubunyipissler dainzelavista vistaomber zombietusko hopkinsat least now you know which of these people not to vote for in csm3 reason given was that according to them ccp was already working on it and we dont need to remind them

in certain mission hubs in lowsec and nullsec macro haulers have infested the area in such large numbers that even lowsec pirates cannot contain their numbers here is my proposal to solve the problemfor all hauling missions with a reward above a certain small amountso this excludes low level highsec missions increase the collateral to one million isk or more and increase the value of the hauled item to equal the increased collateralprosplayers are now more motivated to drastically reduce the volume of macro hauler abuse rather then antimacroers and people who do it for fun now disrupting these missions will give you a profit fewer petitions will waste gms timepeople who successfully complete the mission will not be adversely affectedrelatively easy to implement rather then introducing new code ccp just needs someone to go over the mission texts and change some numbers aroundboost to piracy seriously piracy got hit pretty hard after the value of t2 modules plummeted and a lot of ship value blows up in rigs now any sort of increasing the income from piracy is a good thing dmacroers are forced to stick to low profit highsec issionscons hauling missions in general will be harder to carry out in lowsec and 00 there may be issues with players not wanting to invest in a scoutsome musclea jumpdrive capable ship in order to complete a mission i think this issue can be resolved with an ongoing look at re balancing the reward system for hauler missions
supporting with my main would support with all my alts if it didnt take so much time
as only macros run these missions anything is fine in my book supported
while only macros do not run these missions i would say that 99 of the people who run them in lowsecurity space are macroers most people who are at the keyboard just deny a courier mission if it sends them to lowsecurity spacei do however support this measure while i may run courier missions occasionally to boost standing for instance i do not go into lowsecurity space for it supported and championed for the next csm meeting
makes a lot of senseben
im normally suspicious of proposals to nerf macroing because they tend to have huge numbers of unintended consequences but this one is utterly reasonable even if macroing wasnt a problem id probably support this  high collateral for valuable hauling missions is actually more natural than low
booyah
this is what i was trying to say thanks for saying it better
deffinite support aside from the impact to macros it makes a hell of a lot more sense than the current system
as a minmatar pilot i firmly support finding a reason to train for my own races dreadnought rather than a moros
how ever many topics it takes for the issue to get attention from ccpand it needs to be raised again and again until ccp fix itedit link to the wiki entry of this issue being raised note the lack of a vote on it
much support from a future naglfar pilot
shameless hopelessly optimistic bump
100 agree this really needs to be looked at the nidhoggur is a lot better than it was but its still silly how much more you need to train to be a minmatar capital pilot compared to other races and your not even better after all that training your actually in one of the worst capitalsi dont see why they dont just pick a tanking for capitals probably shield tanking would be best but i dont care and give the nag 3 arty guns it would still be underpowered but at least it would take the stupid  of training torp v and armor tanking for your carrier  dread out of the way
this is the second most requested issue on nozhs balance thread
already raised to ccp during iceland meetingslinkageiii display account expiration date on character selection screen
you have my support on that one dude
most definitely support this corp roles are such a nightmare biggest reason i dont actively recruitedit forgot to support its late here
you have my support
as long as it gets here is all that counts and hopefully this might go into one of there meetings rather than some of the other less important things that ive seen go up lately
im not really an expert on dreads but i think its safe to say that the people who design them aredreadnoughts capital ships created for extended sieges of stationary installationsseems to me that youre bringing a trebuchet to a gunfight 
issue was raised during the meeting on iceland in january
disagree but only because i dont see the problem yes inactive towers are a problem but there is a very simple cleaning procedure already available and its funwar dec the corp holding the tower many times there is no response because nobody is home so to speak blast the tower into its atomic components and collect any structures guns labs etc anchored to the towerthe very least you get is the fun of blowing the tower and you could easily profit if there are other anchored structures works in high sec as well as low secwindjammerps or am i missing something within the context of this topic
have you tried to blow up a tower
there were allready two threads on this topic but they are older than 60 days and closed because of inactivityso once againplease nerf local intelall regional chats system constellation and region should have no visible list of players who are in system to prevent easy intel the probing system can still be used for intelif this is hard to implement because of some reason consider just to change the client to not to draw this player list on the screen so the information is still present in client but hidden from users abuse by external tools like bacon would still be possible but could be fixed laterand please nerf local intel soon not in five years
i do not support this 
lol try againno supportisaac
until proper intelgathering measures are implemented i cannot support this
disagree
i support this better intell and scanning tools would be nice but they are not required to make this change work the local list is a crutch leaned on by far too many pilots for the wrong reasons
strongly disagreeutter rubish once again completely ignoring the realities that miners and other none hunting pilots face on a second by second basiswindjammer
i wouldnt mind anyone in a cov ops ship to be hidden untill they speak in local at least then i can actully scout covertlybut yea this owuld be welcome to
these people could place probes covering the gates and hit the scan button from time to time it requires some effort and attention and you dont get it for free so it feels more real and best thing is it will be difficult to place and maintain the probes using a macro program so macro users are pretty nice screwed and will be hunted down more oftenwhat would be proper intelgathering measures for youthe problem i can see here is we will not get such proper intel because there is no need atm and there is no need because of local but we cannot remove local because there is no proper intel causality chain closedso we will never get rid of fun and atmosphere breaking local untill we accept to live for a while without intel once local is gone we get better suited and balancable intel tools
proper intel tools would largely duplicate the function of local without it all being based on a stupid chat channel one of the more interesting proposals ive heard along these linesthough still very much a first draft is here with some modifications i suggested here  empirecontrolled space will give players intel access based on standings with the respective empires playercontrolled space will allow poses to anchor scanning arrays that give you intel and youll be able to fit some sort of scanner module that gives you the same its more powerful than current local but actually has requirements on use and i dont regard this as a chickenegg problem at all though i will admit that i phrased my above post badly i dont necessarily want the intel tools implemented before local is nerfed though some might be but they will need to be designed first and ready to go it should be a general swap of the two all at once
yet you want effort free kills of ratters and miners just go ratting its about the same level of effort but you get more kills
a few other people have said support but only if the prereqs are in the queue what happens to the injected skill when i cancel the prereq that is currently training and start training something else are you proposing that the skill queue becomes locked once the skill has been injected
the skill would be ejected at the last hanger you had it or something
thnx for the support and you got my vote
i think he is not talking about relocating skillpoint but deleting themrelocating good luck pushing that wont happen lol half of the subscriptions of eveo gotta be people playing evemon online  paying for ghost trainingabout deleting sp as an obssesive compulsive freak i agree lol so support gotta delete these in lvl1 skills
i know that ccp will never let you just move points from skill to another and i would not support that as it could be abused very easily howeverif for a fee you get the choice of removing all the points from one skill and getting to put half of them into another skill you want this would make it so that players looking to abuse the system would take a loss for doing it but at the same time give everyone that either made a serious sp allocation mistake or had ccp change a bunch of stuff in a new patch and made a large chunk of their skills worthless get a little something back for it
skill removal would be used by one person in a thousand but the problems with it would likely outweigh the benefits skill transferring though is a bad bad idea theres no cap  just train the new skill you want
no no support this goes against everything that eve stands for live with your wasted spisaac
a few days wasted training when you are a noob is no big deal in the grand scheme of things having a sp pool where you can redistribute sp would just be abused a lotimho terrible idea
then say so you said when you are new last i checked 1 year down the road is not newregardless the answer is still no end of discussionand if your that ocd over it you should take a break from eve and get some fresh air
i believe the key word you keep missing here is in the long run within the original post but being that this is a proposal i came in here knowing that it was possibly getting shot down as it did so no big deal anyway thnx for everybodys view and this post can be deleted
the key word is sticking to the contextyou say new people and then you say in the long run and then you say 1 yearthat is a contradiction the longest single level skill ive trained so far is a month i would like to think someone who is training would know that training a skill that takes that long would be damn sure its what heshe wantsi get what your trying to say but your grounding your reasoning with contradictions
some time ago there was an unspecific discussion about farmers as a side effect fathim maidires came with a simple but efficient solution which can be used to fight macro miners and macro ratters i want to bring it up againt for concrete discussion herethis simple technology is called captcha you can read more about how it works on wikipedia here
something must be done that part with mining license isnt bad
1 good quality macros can read captcha and rtm shops have professional programmers2 having to input a captcha occasionally is a bother having to input them every 10 mining laser cycles is the fastest way to ensure that only macros will mine3 this is a game what you propose will remove the fun from mining4 even if you think differently ccp is constantly evolving the anti macro systems exactly like the sweatshops are constantly evolving the macro they use so an emergency hotfix like you are suggesting will do nothing that is not already done every patch and you have used exactly the right phrase to define the use of this application no i dont want my game to be plagued by a message bothering me constantlyeven more fun is the idea that you want to use it against macro ratting so a captcha every 10 shots by your guns it would really make the game enjoyable please explain how you think to avoid people spamming captcha to you in combat so that you cant do anything it would became at who is the fastest at spamming captcha against a enemy and disabling him
hahahahaha no
indeed good point not to rely on it on the other hand the captcha can be enhanced and upgraded frequently when its transmitted from the server and not generated in the client it causes much more work on rmt shop side than on ccp side for private macro users it causes they need an update for their macro tool each time the captcha was changedit should not be used often some macros run over night if you are in a belt and you get one captcha every 34 hours so it does not stop you from mining but the guy with the macro gets income cut down because his macro cannot run the whole nightdaywhatever any moredo you know more would be nice if you could supply some links for further readingnah that would be crazy the captcha request should be rare enough to not to hurt the normal playerhehehe no no that button should request a captcha check for yourself you would use it for example if you are mining your hauler alt is full and you want to alttab to it and bring the ore to the station then you request a captcha on your mining char so he will be not distrubed by a random one while you are underway with your haulerin no way there should be a mechanism to force a captcha request on someone else in such a way risk of abuse like you described would be extreme but your idea to request captchas on other ppl isnt that bad it should only be possible in special situations and not just in time but delayedare captchas really not worh the effort not even for a test run on sisi they are relative easy to implement a test run for mining in high sec would allready be fine to see its potential and to give feedback whats acceptable and whats annoying
no insulting and annoying your players in a futile attempt to stop macroing is generally a bad idea
it could be roleplayed in a nice wayfor example while mining an agent warps in and contacts you he asks for your mining license once you legitimate yourself by that captcha he tells you he is happy to find you because he is in trouble and asks you to mine away a small but more valuable belt than you have now for him so you get a mining mission with a real ore belt spawned for you and because you are a real miner and not a macro you now have the chance to get some bucks more than you would get when staying where you arewhat would happen to the macro which fails to legitimate its mining license shall navy spawn and gank him standing loss or nothing this should be discussed
you have the two dumbest threads in this forum
pretty much what he said quit copying lasersisaac
most real autocannons that fire two different types of ammo ap and he for example are openbolt and have a dual ammo fed system which allows them to instantly choose which type of ammo to shoot now i dont have any reallife lasers to look at for comparison but i would imagine that changing the lasing crystal would be a much more involved process for a laser cannon than simply flicking a switch to choose which ac shell will be selected when you pull the trigger and the bolt slides forward to chamber it i support the idea artillery should be handled the same way as well as by definition they dont have any magazine shells are loaded into the weapon one at a time
this is not real life this is eve online
after a few answers i see that nobody comes up with a reasonable argument of why it is not a good ideafirst off i know autocannons are not lasers nor blasters they have a reduced dps compared with them and they work for the most part in falloff range granted you have more damage types to choose from but that has also its drawbacks like even more reduced dps the same goes to artillery but its even worst as reloading time plays a big factor on them
just because no one comes up with an argument doesnt mean your getting support
how about you dont vote at all if your not satisifeda blank vote is a pointless and useless vote not to mention a waste
that has already happened a few times tho
not voting is letting the l33t people decide those who dont care about the well being of eve online a blank vote is a vote something ccp needs to account for when counting the votes while not voting at all means well that you dont care anough about eve to consider who sits in this boardi know many who are well suited for this job but cant or wont run for different reasons and i know many who wants to run just for the fun of it or for the joke of it ccp cant say no to someone who has been elected i think even a joke candidate but i want us players to have this choice now i know that this time there are at least a few that is well suited for the job and i know how to vote this time but what for board session nr 4 or 5 what about session nr 6 i hope ofcource we will have good people all the time that is what we the players and ccp are hoping for but i dont think it would hurt at all to have the option to give a blank vote if there is noone you likeor is there something i dont have considered when it comes to voting blanks
id be in favour of people being able to decline ballots as a show of ignorancedisapproval but electing blank seats is pointless
that is the same thing at least from the voters perspectivethe goal is not to necessarily create an empty seat but rather make it known that none of the potential candidates were to your liking that is the goal correctso there needs to be a none of the aboveabstain amongst the voting options if 50 of the votes for some reason are none of the aboveabstain then there is something wrong that needs to be addressed you still get a full csm out of the other 50 of the votesplease remember when you support this topic it is supporting the overall idea and discussion going on and not just the ops idea
its not the same thinga nota or abstain is not a blank vote its literally as it sayswhat your proposing would leave an empty seat with an invitation to someone else as opposed to blockingim with hersch however notaabstain is much better
so do you give your support to the ideadiscussion going onnotaabstain being part of the discussion
no not to the ops ideabut to herschs idea yes
for me its important that only those who seriously considering doing a good job as a csm wins the election and not a joke candidate in a real world election most people know what is at stake taxes for instance but in a game someone might take the oportunity of just running for csm with a joke goal making eve into an another wow for example and someone might see the fun and just vote on it for the heck of it simply because they dont care now thankfully ccp dont have to listen to the csms and continue their business as usual anyway but that seat is now for the next six month filled with an half wit i dont care if the seat is filled by goon bob ra or even an npc corp player just as long they intend being serious about what they do and have a serious agendaherschs idea looks good too i guess for me the important thing is that at least ccp sees the risk and so does the playersregarding leaving an empty seat i would rather have an empty seat than filled by an half wit with a joke agenda
i think worrying about joke candidates is rather unnecessary  i dont necessarily like all 15 of the people elected thus far but none of them have been especially whimsical about it looking at this race not all the candidates have announced yet and theres at least half a dozen who will win almost guaranteed and who are serious respectable folks i favour the ability to decline a ballot mostly because it mirrors standard democratic practice and to a lesser extent to drive up voter turnout a bit for pr purposes not because i think that theres a pressing need for a you all suck option on the ballot
make the skill queue account wide meaning that any character on the account can append skills to the queue within the current time limitsthe skills of the other characters could then show up on the queue with a red tinge
sounds reasonable as it would not be a breaking type of mechanic and its within the rules of the current systemprob is api key datastream not sure if ccp can pull it offbut i can dig it
actually i just logged onto the forum planning on submitting this issue since ive had some annoyances with training alts lately yes definitely supported  better crossaccount skill management would be very nice
4000 people asking the same questions all the time between spam and people asking but not listening makes it very hard to make anything out of it making it race or region based should cut down the number of people there considerably
good ideait was hard to get coherent responses as the posts and spam flew buy
the concern i have is isd coverage  it tends to seem like theres only one isd in the channel at a time so if it were split you wouldnt have isd to answer questions all the time unless they got a bunch more of them if that can be dealt with id favour splitting the channel to make it move slower
bring back the nice litle recoil animations we had pre apoc they were very nice imho made capital guns looks way cooler ccp please add it in the options if i am mistaken please somebody tell me
supporting my own suggestion ofc
as topic says currently each account can take three characters where many other mmo with simmilar character based system can offer more character slots than we have in eve proposal is to add one slot more for each of yours and your friends account good thing for a cynomarketscout alts or everything else you need of course only one character can be trained
supporting this great idea
signed
so you are proposing the 4th character for free where now people pay for them dont see it likely to be implemented
other mmos have more character slots because they have limits on what one character is capable of if you could spec into every class in wow at once id wager theyd have a lot fewer character slots for you to use also even if this was a good idea it wouldnt be worth bringing up because ccp will never nerf their own income stream like that

alphas only matter on passive shield tanks that is what is missing in this argument when you lose shield hps your ship will auto regen them based on a formula that formula breaks strength around 25 shield capacity so while you were at 30 you may have been regenerating a huge number of hitpoints below 25 you are generating hardly any at all that is why alphas matter in this case the faster you get them below that point the sooner their tank is brokenarmor tanks have no such mechanic and as such the alpha only affects whether they die now or after the next cycle what is being proposed here would have two positive effects neither of which would be substantial enough to matter the first would be slightly longer cap stability since cap works the same way as shields and you would be eating it more gradually removing your own alpha of your cap the second would be that any active repping ship could potentially avoid being blown up for a few additional seconds over what it would take nowlets think about this if you are going to get blown up before the end of the next rep cycle then a few extra seconds isnt buying you anything i like the idea of trying to bring active tanking up a bit to match better with passive tanking but this suggestion does very little to accomplish itas was pointed out right now you can cap boost and burn that whole boost on repping before it gets neuted away and wasted the suggested change might favor passive cap regen mods a bit more but they would still both be items on a loss mail
no support bad idea and sentry drones shouldnt work like this isaac
this is what drone range extenders are for giving them this huge of a buff really cant be justified
drone extenders are for extending the range you can control them at by 20km per unit not the range they can hit atif a sentry drone has a natural optimal and falloff of 80100km it should be able to fire at ships within those ranges or what is the point of having those ranges in the statsi like this idea as it gives any ship with the ability to use a sentry to have a med range low dps option in its hold
i like it
its the same as any other ship that fits longrange guns but cant target to their maximum range a rokh fitting 425s and spike can hit to 19430 but can only target to 1125  people dont ask ccp to double its lock range they fit sensor boosters besides even without fitting modules its quite possible to get a natural control range of 85 kmmaxskill ishtar which makes use of all the natural range any of the sentries have
memory leaks are not a csm issue theyre a technical issue wrong forum
1 to your first statement i never meant it to say your living in a delusional state im saying that most pilots are stuck in the sense that eve is all they see when in fact your not dealing with eve your dealing with the y code called windows architecture that is being duct taped and tied together with spit and bailing wire and just barely pulling it off those who dont have the legitimate background unlike some people who rant and rave about things they obviously have no knowledge in tend to go off the walls and ignore details that answer there questionsodds are the memory leak is not eve related but caused by the translation engine windows is a total idiot and jackass when it comes to memory management and that is a bit of a problem when your dealing with a mac platform lording over it it will do the stupidest things when it comes to memory and as such ccp may never be able to be rid of it2 odds are that your macbook gave a false impression eve may appear to be running fine on my mbp here but watching the console logs says otherwise while i may not crash knocks on wood or have this memory leak show up its frakking around when it shouldnt be and if i really push it hard it does become unstable since you cant upgrade it you run into a problem your pleas will be ignored due to the fact that your likely running outside of ccps minimum requirments as i outlinedthey did not officially declare the intel gpus or ati gpus as supported hardware yet several pilots have managed to pull it off but not without alot of problemsccp reserves the right to say no to anyone outside the declared boundaries its not fair it sucks but its a fact and they probably did that for the fact its alot less frustration to code the fixes for itis it impossible to patch no but that depends on where the problem is again your talking about windows a piece of  platform that is nigh impossible to predict and control you fix a few dozen problemsand a half dozen show up as evidenced by the last patchand those same problems show up in native windows platforms too just not so obvious and burried by vast amounts of virtual memory and other head for tail os crap3 your computer is having to deal with the new shaders kicked in if you dont have the current hardware required to run the game you cant blame ccp for the problemso your memory leak may not be a memory leak more likely a gpu run away error and as i ve said before windows is as dumb as a brick when it comes to that and when you emulate windows you get the idea run away processes cause memory leaks just a hell of a lot faster than youd expect a leaky process to cause4 native would fix all of the above removing windows from the equation forces the software to obey the rules of the os along the standards set forth giving the kernel control and not cider translating information to the kernel removing the middle man makes it nice but that means rewriting the game to do it not likely to happen they would rather patch the problem and move on that could change however osx 106 is comingits ok i get alot of flak for being a pain in peoples side but they also know that im right 9 times out of 10 and it really irritates the hell out of themand im not so polite about it eitheryou should plan on replacing your hardware regardless because i can easily predict you will not see results for a good long with snow leopard on the horizon ccp could permanently lock out outmoded hardwareand it is well within there rights to do sofeel free to eve mail me maybe i can figure out what you got going on
yeah i agree i trained t2 large proj simply coz i like the muzzle flash and i liked how the tempest looked ofc a week after i finished large auto spec 4 they change all the effects to the new crappier ones
im not talking about nerfing nothing only every moon mineral with certain rarity should matter to a point and not only a couple of them anyway i obviouslly dont see how anyone on pl would agree with me lol but csm is for balancing the game amongst other things not pushing your own agendaisaac do you think it should be possible to control a big part of the economy just controlling 35 regions there are more than 40 00 regions so im not talking about changing moon distribution neither the mechanics behind mineral rarity just adjust itas for the fix there is not any complexity on it you only need to run a simple spreadsheet and can be done in minutes then you adjust t2 components composition and thats about it
wow that made absolutely no sense lots of words thrown together im totally confused by what your saying and what the issue is btw live with the fact that superalliances exist this will not change that problem isaac
i wasnt aiming at you there and i wish you luck on your endeavour that is to say suicide ganking salvagers
ahh you must mean advanced salvaging rank 15 right must take months to train that upi dont read guides its like cheating at solitaire actually youre right i dont scan but from what i understand you use directional scanner first why would you probe a ship with no wrecks around itclearly i meant t2 drones and faction ammoso now that the mentally deficient have had their say anyone else wanna share their opinions
x the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because i support ccps current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecksreasons why 1 ninja salvaging is a defacto profession2 the 1 in 1000 times that someone actually scans you down and salvages your stuff in a hostile manner is not a good enuff reason to nerf an entire profession3 some of us actually ninja salvage in a nonhostile manner ie make bookmarks come back later see if the guy bothered to salvage his stuff i see the business as more of a scavenger than hisec piratingsetting me to flashy red for scavenging wrecks that ppl leave to rot is discouraging and not fun4 l4 missions in hisec have no downside as it is and i say this as someone who does l4s in hisec if someone invades my deadspace 1 in 1000 times or even 1 in 100 times im not gonna freak out quite frankly half the time i dont salvage anywayi dont mind other people sipping from my stream once in a while so please stop freaking out if i sip from yoursits so difficult to get human interaction out of eve sometimes you almost have to grief someone to get them to say hi and most of the time they just curse at you for being personally inconveniencedits a game a game you know tra la la makebelieve wonderland so what if someone salvages your wreck why do you even care just get another mission and kill more million isk rats youre not gonna run out of money by making 15 less income for 1 hour in your life
as previously stated earlier in the thread xavier hayes is running for csm can you please add name to list ill post weblink and thread link shortly cheersxavier
i believe the drone ui needs a lot of love im not entirely sure of the best way to address it but i have some ideas having the name of what theyre aggressed on would be a big help for one next there needs to be better notification when theyre targeted by a hostile so you can start reacting before they start taking damage their distance from you and their targets distance would be nice in that ui it doesnt need to be cluttering up the overview which is enough of a mess when there are drones all over the battlefield the ai really needs some help any ability ccp can add for controller to give the drones scripted instructions would rock if you start taking damage evade i dont mind this question at all in fact im rather open about my disability and welcome any inquiries concerning it ive been to ccp hq twice now once during fanfest 07 week and second time during fanfest 08 week both times the reason for my visit is winning the office tour auction ccp ran to benefit the childs play charity  they were very accommodating both times especially considering a few ccp employees helped me get up a spiral staircase in the office because the elevator was down due to construction

then he can reply when such activities arent occupying him and if he is not prepared to do so then he shouldnt be running for csm a candidate whom refuses to or cant make time for discussion with other players outside of take care i should hope he has broader horizons than that and wants to take the pulse of as many walks of life in eve as possible is a poor candidate indeed if this is the case perhaps another representative of take care should be runingerik is running for csm whatever spin is possible to put on the issue he is the csm candidate and take care is a think tank focus group or quango if you prefer on the day erik will have to decide what issues to raise and those he chooses to do so will be given a spin all of his ownas laudable as you efforts to reply for him or for take care are erik needs to engage with his electorate in discussion
hello everyone a brief note of support for take care and the election of their candidate erik to the csm you folks are doing an excellent job looking out for the entire eve community thank you if i may be of some assistance to you do let me know cheers
me waits for erik to answer her questions
thank you guys for all the praizeone quality of mine is that i usually take my time to carefully craft posts just as i would do to prepare a meeting with the csm or ccp this does usually take two hours or more and i am doing this because my answers are aimed at all my voters as much as i am addressing your questions in this thread as you have mentioned yourselves take care has built a pretty consistent image in the past two terms thanks to eva and this will not change with me as a csmthat i have one account only and a real life as a business process consultant might be a second quality for some at least and those with two or more accounts may assess for themselves how much time they would have for activities like checking forum and other players opinion in order to prepare a csm meeting no pun intendedas take care we do have the time for this because eva and i work closely together and debate the issues at hand hence you will also see a lot of eva in issues we select and solutions we support naturally and her experience both with the game and how the csm works are highly valued  thanks to our combined effort i will be able to start into work of the csm directly and i can be on business trips during the week and still support your most favourite solutions towards other csms and ccp on the saturday meetingsthe twoterm restriction is not bypassed by take care any election will see the best arguments win i am sure that this election just as any other will see most votes on the candidate who is the better organized one to the candidate who best knows to network who thus will best know what the pressing issues are if alliances are putting up a candidate or two it is up to you to decide if you want to support the powerblock with your vote or rather an association of reallife people who want to build the better gameall specific issues which you bring up we will treat as part of the currently running csm term of eva or i can take them into another term of take care if you vote for us it would be sad were your issues lost in this thread now would it not ps im a cat person british short hair but else it would be a doberman

well sure a rep should be listening to what is being proposeddiscussed by the playerbase  but i really think they should have a list of topics that counts as their own agenda as wellin csm1 jade constantine got my vote she presented a list of issues that she intended to bring to ccp and most of them but not all were things i agreed with sounded good to mein csm2 i voted abstain no candidate put forward a platform of ideas that piqued my interest i voted abstain instead of just not voting at all to demonstrate i had seen what everyone had to present and didnt care for any of it lots of good people ran none really stood for anything though my opinion obviouslyhonestly im not going to vote for a candidate who doesnt present an agenda of their own openly and honestly i expect that from a candidate its great that you intend to listen to all the proposalsissues that get brought up in assembly hall but that should not be exclusive of what your own thoughts and proposals arewhen i look at the winners of csm3 i want to be able to look at the list of names and say oh yeah i voted for pilotx cos they said they would bring up issues x y  z  things that i care aboutof course things that i care about might be very different from what other pilots consider to be important lolrp but i want to know that theres someone in there who represents me and i need to know that before i vote i want someone in there who will take care of what i consider important without me having to lobby incessantly on forums to get their attention id rather log into my internetspaceship and blow things up knowing that a candidate is working on it already on my behalf so i dont have toyup you do have to listen to the proposals  issues as they come up but you gotta actually stand for something yourself as wellps please draw me a pic of a cyclone blowing up an evil slaver or just blowing up either works
well istavaan hit the dust for undisclosed reasons apparently he did something bad presumably winding up a bear the list of cp votable candidates is getting smaller and smaller
ffsjust as i was getting really excited and looking forward to voting i see that you are disbarred from standing
please go away
really not necessary ill send you the questions
as a candidate i too would like to participate in your interviews
i see candidates that appeal to the pvp crowd and those described in the thread title in many areas of the forums and in game entering into discourse with a great swathe of players from many backgrounds in eve and experiencing many areas of the game and its community most of which they personally disagree withi would like to encourage those csm candidates for whom lowsec is a scary place full of probably sociopathic 10s those that promote a platform for discussion that centers on the industrial or pve and those who present a manifesto lacking in changes to pvp aspects of the game or matters of importance to the groups mentioned in the subject tocome and talk to usthere is a vast largely untapped demographic awaiting you many of these people only read certain areas of the forum or only participate in narrow areas of the eve community they are under represented and a powerful voting forcethose csm candidates wishing to embody the democratic nature of the csm would do well to talk to players of all backgroundswith that in mind i urge you to lay your eyes on cp or to give it its full name crime and punishmentwhat does cp want to see from the csm and you as a prospective candidate is a question you might ask yourself go and ask them
imo the crime profession is valid and has a permanent place in evedisagreements are mainly about what and where that place isimo the only buff lowsec needs is an interbus courier system because logistics in lowsec is such a pain in the rearother than that i think its great nice rats decent ore npc stations sporadic pvp that gives the defender the advantage what else could you wantonly thing really hindering lowsec is the difficulty in replacing ships and equipment you basically have to be in an organized pirate corp to get supplies otherwise you end up having to make 20 jumps to buy a shield boosterat first an interbus service would be a boost to pirates but in the long run it will encourage antipie corps to settle in lowsec which means more fights for pirates and safer freight lanes for bears
yes drones have been neglected for awhile wheres those salvage drones they had plannedwhat really annoys me is when you dc your drones are left behind to get popped by npcs until you log back in and try to reclaim them and if you happen to have been in the last room of ae your pretty much screwed i think this unfairly treats players in a situation thats beyond there control if ammo disappeared in a persons ship when they dcd theyd been screaming at ccpi know previous csms brought this to the attention of ccp and suggested ideas like being able to reconnect to your wayward drones when you logged back in but ccps excuse was that it might create more server load also not much of a solution when you have to start a mission from the first gate againso how about if when you dc npcs dont target your drones unless they had done so already before you dcd and they would be left alone until you returned to retrieve them ccp would be happy cause the drones would still be floating in space so someone could come along and steal them the developers seem to like that stuff it wouldnt make and difference if your in pvp something else i think ccp would like and it should reduce server load wouldnt have to have the server wasting cycles running the npcs trying to pop the dronesjust one of the many ideas i would like to present to the guys at eve
3 mil in drone skills heredrones are great in both pve and pvp imo they warrant no buff could maybe use better aithank youc7
drones ftwim your candidate i use drones all of the time totally agree that they need work on overview etc generally a great weapons system although you need to know what you are doing with the ship setup due to tanking reqs etc em drones could definately do with love id also like to see some inprovementsvariations on ewarfare dronesxavier hayes

they did a similar thing with the apoc but they still replaced the old bonus that was now built in with a real bonusccp took an important step in half recognizing the resist increases should have been native to the ship when it comes out of the oven they need to go the rest of the way and add the fourth bonus

signedmissiles was too much nerfed ccp must less nerf it a few to correct them without have to remove the tank capacity of afterburnersthey just have to change a few the formula to make primary the signature radius instead of the velocity like it is today velocity should be at second place with that we will be able to shoot the same type of ship than us at real damage
not signed adapt or dietwas said to me that i had to adapt or die when several nerfs pwned my setups and skill distributioncoincidentally the minmatar have ships that of all things rely on split weapon systems between the supposedly fail missiles i have no problem in a huginn or phoon and the projectileswhich have the lowest dps poorest tracking lowest clip size and so on and so on for the nominal plus of not requiring capso yeah deal with it and stop being such whiney little btches

yes please do this pleasei never understood why they would pay you several million isk for hauling a few bottles of quafe 5 jumps i think if you want to make several million anywhere you should have to put at least that amount at risk even l4 mission runners have to put themselves at some sort of risk for broad definitions of risk whereas these haulers are risking maybe 500k in return for several million isk rewardit would also be an awesome boost for piracy
this would be awesome and such a simple fix

you have my support tigerclaw i think there are several things in the corpalliance stuff that needs to be addressed and maybe rethought a little
if i remember right this was already raised and the conclusion was that ccp could add in onlining queues for pos modules but anchoring queues would be hard to implement and thats where it stopped how about thisdecrease anchoring duration of pos modules to a few seconds long or so so people can put things in place uninterruptedincrease the onlining time of each pos module equal to the amount of anchoring time that was just taken awayimplement onlining queue
whee
why patch a broken system when what it needs is a total overhaulalso queues for pos stuff is bad in my opinion the reason why there is an anchoringonline timer is too increase the barrier to entry for putting up a posputting in a queue removes the majority of that barrier hence its no good
tell that to the pos managers that have to tend to a stupid pos every ten minutes for five hours people dont want the barrier to be how much boredom you have to put up with the pos system has been overhauled enough it doesnt need another complete overhaulthe delay in time is still necessary to prevent people from putting up instant deathstars this retains the time delay without chaining a human being to it theres already a hard 5pos limit for alliances and during pos wars large alliances usually max it out anyways soul destroying has never been a real barrier to space video game players stront timing fueling and defending still have to be done normally and they are still perfectly legitimate barriers to pos spammageif you dont take out the soul destroying aspect of pos managing people will keep doing it anyways because their ceos push them to and theyll stop when they quit the game hating the game shouldnt be an element of the game
linkagealready brought to csm passed the voting and forwarded to ccp
spiffy 3
i beg to differplease tell me why that a pos overhaul is the single most requested feature towards the csm for the last 12 monthsi agree poss are soul destroying but that just goes to show that they basic concept is not well designed seeing as a needed barrier to entry makes it want to stab yourself after just a small amount of timethe pos system is a legacy system which was added very early on in the game anybody in the software business will know that legacy code is expensive to maintain as such chances are that a complete overhaul is the answer in the long runand ccp having agreed to a complete overhaul of the sov system i cant imagine poss playing a large role in the futurewith poss not going to be the method of claiming sov onlining large amounts of poss wont be required that makes this issue rather redundant
ok i should elaborate on what my intentions are i am looking for the smallest possible changes one can make to the game that produces the biggest return on investment and i try to use that rule when i think of stuff to post here i could say overhaul poses but unless i have an elaborate plan for a new game for eve to play instead of poses online then i need to come up with concrete solutions based on the current system or i am just wasting my timei do not think ccp are going to do a complete pos overhaul after putting so much work into our sov1234 system reworking the way pos modules can be manned and placed outside pos shields and anything else they did to support those featureshonestly i really cant think of a less worse system for holding sov then poses one of the big things about eve is how players can take and hold space markers need to determine who owns this piece of space and it needs to be hard enough to remove so that you dont have wildly fluctuating tracts of space if poses are replaced with something else that something else will take a long time to remove and replace as well i think this issue is really more a fundamental issue of the game when opposing forces can assemble a huge force while the other is asleep and different alliances can rule different timezones
if there was such a role people in holding corps for alliances would not need to hand out director roles to everybody just to get the standings setting work done the disbanding of band of brothers was funny the first time but its really a sign of a broken game mechanic when ceos are forced to give more permission then necessary just to get necessary things done just because the necessary roles are all bundled together with unnecessary ones also this change should not be retroactive
i was pretty surprised this option didnt exist when i was setting up permissions for my corpit seems like a lot of permissions given out have to be given with broader roles then i would have preferred so this is just one part of the bigger issue
supported
got my vote
corp roles need a massive overhaul but this is a good start
i think something does need to be done i like the idea of them decaying over timehow about a high level skill like unanchoring allowing you to unanchor something that is offline or maybe a corporation theft  hacking skill where you can break into a pos  corp hangar in space that is offline allowing you to fuel up a pos that no belongs to you or simply have a look whats in the corp hangar
i like a combination of these two solutions 1  make them degrade over time so that a neglected tower can be destroyed by a smaller and smalller force over time2  make them hackable so they can be stolen
declare war shoot tower win not supported
this has also become more common in wormhole space when a corp manages to lose their tower when wormholes unexpectedly close not sure from personal experience but i suspect that its also harder to bring in the necessary firepower to blow a tower up in whspace  rather then having them simply removed after a month of inactivity i like the idea of somehow letting them have a value of sort to whatever enterprising pilot can come along and unanchor hack or take over these abandoned towers
abusing contracts as corpalliance market replacement is really awkward
id prefer to make corp contracts easier to use than implementing this the functionality exists but the interface could be better that said a separate marketplace isnt the answer
id use the thumbs down checkbox if i had onedefinitely not supported i had a list of reasons why this is an obviously terribad idea but i doubt the op would understand
you dont want local go to wspacecurrent problems1 probing in pvp is only usefull to find carebears in plexes and such you can not probe ships without an expanded probe launcher 220 tf it should be the other way around2 hit the scan button from time to time you have to be very very lucky to find a force recon bomber or any ship using covop cloak which is visible for like 1 second during an op taking hours3 carebear ships have virtually no chance agains pvp ships espetially miners and haulers4 show me the risk in this situation for the pvpers carebears miningratting in system single pvper copop with covert cyno sneaks into system and checks out the targets no local ship cloaked  no way to know for the carebears pvper opens covertcyno his gang jumps in in bombersrecon ect no local ships cloaked  no way to know for the carebears pvpers own the carebearsproper intel gathering suggestions 1 auto reloading ship scanner2 foffriend or foe or foufried or unknow identification when using probes or ships scanner3 long ago i suggested proxi sensorsprobes you drop probe like a mobile disruptor buble that automaticly relays you info about any ship passing through its scan range200 km
im pretty sure that ccp are already working on this and the holdup is more to do with designing a viable active intel replacement than anything else
not supportedno alternative means for gaining similarlevel intel posscanners of some sort that fill local for those who have enough high standing could work if they not tie it to sov think about npc regions but they would also give defenders a significant advantageyou delayedlocaleverywhere guys play this game with local minimized rightit could backfire you know how many times do you look at local without noticing it
not supportednerf of local would make indeed eve more realproblem  reality is not fun and more a game become real more he become harder so less fun a game must be a good compromise of difficulty and effort to please everyone and local permit itlocal is fine period
infallible local intel tool ruins any pretense at stealth
definetly needed having local as an intel tool really makes no sense at all mineing and ratting groups should just use their directional scanners combined with combat probes and actual scouts on gates 1 combat probe dropped at max range a few spread around system if the system is too big will inform you of any new ships that appear
having experienced the adrenaline rush of hunting for and being hunted in the local channel free environment of wh space i fully support this implementation across at least 00 if not all of eve there are the aforementioned problems assosiated with the resisdents of the systems struggling to get intel but it is a two sided coin this game is ultimately about teamwork and time and time again it has been proven that the side that works together best prevails if this means better use of scouting and intel gathering so be it in 00 this could include the use of tactical bubbles to slow down the approach of the enemy giving time to assess their numbers i think there should be the facility while docked in station to switch to an external station camera to see what is outside  it would be very simillar to when you look at an object with the camera locked but free to rotate maybe no overview but the ships would reflect your current overview bracketsas is stands the directional scan is a bit weak but i have heard other players propose some sort of active scan mode consider what we have now as a passive mode that would perform regualar pings of the area alerting the player to other ships in the vicinityall in all i think some people will need to adapt their play style a little bit and stop treating eve as a single player game but it should do a lot to prevent the hordes of cloaking macro ravens in 00 cloaking before anyone gets a look in100 support
this would be a beneficial change and i still support recent speakers mode for 00 local
i love running around in wormholes while cloaked delayed local is great however theres certainly a case to be made about the fact that new intelgathering systems needs to be implemented before anything else
here is the risk carebears have cloaked protective fleet of recons or other nasties hunting fleet jumps in and attempts to kill easy target gets free trip to fresh clone instead hunters think twice next time
lets make it like in wurm online if youre cloaked youre cloaked in local too i like idea of scout a system withoung being in local any maybe you add a 60 seconds timer until youre in local if you dont recloak so you can launch probes
maybe introduce delayed local graduallystart by with 00 only or cloakers only
hi i think it could be useful to add a new channel in the forums for those programmers that build eve related utilitiesthere are a bunch of them already being in the same channel would make them easier to find for those that are new to the game and want something else or for those that just are looking for updatesi made one a few weeks ago im a programmer after all but it wasnt after i posted it on the forums that i found that there was like 3 more doing more or less the same
i hereby support my own post lol
eve technology laba forum for player created tools and applications including those based on the eve api
wow fail to read much geez quit posting random crap because your blind
no1 read slashdot captchas are no longer effective the spammers have figured out how to deal with them automatically and i have no doubt that theyd sell their solutions to the isk farmers2 try subscribing to a yahoo group the captchas that work best humans have problems with too
just no
who was talking about roleplaying
lol fail idea  failisaac
in your opnext time look better what it the idea you are proposingread the patch notes lately the only put several exploit removed read the dev comments look how after some patch the supposed macros disappear ecc any request in a fight will hurt a normal player and you have no idea what it will do in a laggy fleet fight misread your idea but then if it is implemented as you suggest it will remove any use from the captcha start character ask for captcha resolve it start macrorepeat after 2 hours the only function of a test run on sisi would be to alert the macro developers and allow them to put in countermeasuresessentially it would make the captcha useless even faster
alright who stole my troll mojo
or just revamp how mining is done ingame i believe ccp is currently working on this
do you really think eve could handle such a huge drop in tritanium production mineral and ore market is already upsidedownmy suggestion would be a less monotic more fun and less timesink gameplay make the monotic log term activity automatedloot collecting and salvagind it was designed for macro aproach tractor collect loot salvage suggestion automated by design a spetialized ship with spetial modules with large cargo that auto loots and salvages all your whecks around fast and easy it is no fun to get 30 failures 5 min when salvaging a t2 frig wreckmining it was designed for macro watch your miners go zooom zooom and every 3 mins empty cargo to a can
i really hate captchas
it was me you get a popup message from scc where you will be asked to confirm your mining licenselike everything in eve the captchas should be embedded into roleplaying too it would be just another building block for content creators and used where appropriatebut i agree lot of care is required in use of captchas otherwise they will be insulting and annoyingive seen it fahtim meidires described hiss idea but there is no need to take it too literal the important part is the core of the idea the captcha how it could be used and what effectsside effects this would cause is what we discuss herei missed any comments of the devs regarding macros could you link for us please it would be worth to take a look on and its hard for us normal players to see macros disappear if we are not in the macrogankbusiness or using macros ourselvesyay it would hurt but since they are no macros in fleet fights i hope so there is no need to trigger captchas during pvpthis works only if you can look on your screen from time to time if you rely on the macro working for long time while you are at workschoolsleepingwhatever then your income gets cut down significantlyto have more time to adapt the macro to counter captcha does not matter the captcha image generator on sisi needs not to be the same like later on tq it should be modified frequently either for sisi a simple one would be ok this would drive macro developers crazy over timethere is only one really reliable way to counter captchas the macro relays them to an operator who solves them and gets the correct password back the macro supplier needs to run a 247 service pay the operators that gets expensive he will charge his customer the user of his macro tool with a monthly subscription fee how many macro users would pay real money for that each montheve would adapt like it did after fixing the t2 reaction exploit the prices for mins would shift but they would still be limited by what ppl are willing to pay to replace ships they lostmining would become more profitable for real playerssomething like that is allready in game see datacores moon mining and productionif you introduce anchorable belt harvester into game then everybody will use lots of them income will be limited by the time you sped to haul the ore into your station and maybe by fuel if the harvester needs it and resources if they are as limited as they are nowme too they will never come ingame either  not even with 1000 supports in this thread  but it would be cool to have them on sisi  isnt it
only if you ask for a captcha request for each time you open fire or buysell on the market
autocannons are fast enough as it is besides lets try and keep different weapons different
this is sort of an extension of my macro hauler thread but the idea is a little more to address the larger problem of isk farmers using macros and low paid laborers and it may or may not already be implemented as its sort of an internal sort of thing heres the general ideaisk farmers using laborers and macros have certain behaviors that casual players do not have if these behaviors can be determined then accounts can be monitored for them and put on a shortlist for gm investigationnot autoban or anything like that accounts found using this method must be handled leniently since this method relies on probability and many legitimate players also play for long hours repetitively for the sole purpose of gaining isk there also needs to be some sort of remediation for players who claim to be unfairly banned since farmers probably wont invest a lot of effort into recovering ratting account 3543i believe the future of isk farming will be in 00 ratting level 4 missions macro mining and wormhole space the nature of eve makes it difficult for players to monitor other players usually it seems players just resort to petitioning everybody with poor english we need gms armed with tools to flag isk farmers and remove them at the source rather then deal with the repercussions after the isk has already been generated and sold the behaviors that are monitored for should always be refined in response to new data determining their validity and the specific things monitored for will probably not be published to slow down the evolution of isk farmers behavior used to evade ccp withhere are some behaviors i can think of that isk farmersmacroers have that players do not have dont withhold support because you disagree with some of these they are all written off the top of my head and only ccp can determine if they are valid or not after enough mining their server logsan active account that is logged in and performing actions for hours without allowing appropriate time for sleep for more days then it is possible for a human being to stay up 237ip address shared with a large number of other accounts also performing the same action possibly with the same skill build and setup for hours and hourshardware profile identical to previously banned isk farmermacroer accountno kills activity no wallet activity beyond isk gaining and transferring it to another character which also receives isk from other similarly behaved accountsthere will need to be some further refinement to this idea to exclude flagging even the most repetitive ratting alts im pretty sure the nature of relationships created by isk transactions between a farming ring is different from that of normal players even when those players are organizing alliance logistics or something like that but i would need a lot of server data and probably a phd in statistics to be able to determine that how about sending your economics guy to find that out ccp dmassive usage of contracts to send isk using items which it can be determined without a doubt arent worth the isk thats being transferred over themfor market macros measuring the time passed between the putting up of a rival sell order and the adjustment of their own measuring the number of refreshes requestedlittle to no chat activity whatsoeveror certain kinds of repetitive chat this is sort of borderline i thinki doubt any isk farmers use credit cards to pay for their accounts not saying all timecarders are farmers but if someone uses cash it lowers the probability of being one very muchtheres no substitute for good police work but when you have a huge population and youre already getting complete reports on all their activities a good system for finding the most suspicious accounts will be a step forward from relying on player petitions only
clearly i support myselfvote for me
do you honestly think that ccp doesnt do this already
theres not been any mention of it that i can find if they have then all power to them but if they havent then it would be stupid not to suggest it
do you really think that ccp is going to discuss how they combat macros thats like the us government to go out and say how they spy on terrorists
in this forum lavista vista has a problem with mazzilliulavista you say ccp must be combating this already well try paying a few visits to the low sec courier mission hubs and see how good a job they are doing 1 from me
hey lavista maybe you dont realize this being an ass doesnt make you more right
seeing as i used to pirate in lowsec all the time in areas infested these macro haulers i know how bad the situation ishowever that doesnt make my point less right ccp is doing stuff you just wont exactly notice because thats the nature of how they works please refer to my above comment comparing this to the terrorist situation
lavista vista has a problem with smartassed punks who dont know what the hell they are talking aboutnot supported for assuming ccp is stupid
looking at this thread made me a little speechless on the one side i know from visiting for example insmother or ingunn there are in the eve universe suspious activities going on which could everybody see if he wants to also gms and ccp since years on the other side you annoncing this issue  uhh what is your real intention hm i would never vote for you bye
personally i dont see any problem isk farmers dont take any isk from my wallet and dont see me off at all i dont need to buy isk and even if i did  surely the gtcs are the way to do that ccp is doing alot look at all the banned accounts and gm withdrawals from wallets from people who buy isk from isk sellersok on your following pointsan active account that is logged in and performing actions for hours without allowing appropriate time for sleep for more days then it is possible for a human being to stay up 237i sometimes log in straight after dt and stay there moving stuff about on autopilot with my freighter  so if i dont touch any buttons for a while does that make me a macro noip address shared with a large number of other accounts also performing the same action possibly with the same skill build and setup for hours and hoursso people like chribba for example who have multiple 5 accounts all mining is now against the ruleshardware profile identical to previously banned isk farmermacroer accountthis one made me laugh the hardest  do you think computer businesses in a crazy attempt to make money  sell more than 1 computer built the same so if one computer gets banned everyone with that computer has to get banned hmm way to go on that one thanks i havent laughed like that since i was a little girlno kills activity no wallet activity beyond isk gaining and transferring it to another character which also receives isk from other similarly behaved accountsthere will need to be some further refinement to this idea to exclude flagging even the most repetitive ratting alts im pretty sure the nature of relationships created by isk transactions between a farming ring is different from that of normal players even when those players are organizing alliance logistics or something like that but i would need a lot of server data and probably a phd in statistics to be able to determine that how about sending your economics guy to find that out ccp dmy hauling alt doesnt have any kills doesnt have any outgoings other than passing isk to my main pvp account i keep my alt in the starter corps so i can mission etc and fund my pvp without hassle so  what youre saying is this is bannable using an alt to make isk and not kill stuff is a bannable offence now nomassive usage of contracts to send isk using items which it can be determined without a doubt arent worth the isk thats being transferred over themlike jita you mean so everyone scamming in jita should be permabanned i agree but scamming is a part of the game for market macros measuring the time passed between the putting up of a rival sell order and the adjustment of their own measuring the number of refreshes requestedi agree with this  i think increasing the amount of time between altering markets would be a good idea meaning that traders can only update every 20 minutes  would make it less appealing to macroers i believelittle to no chat activity whatsoeveror certain kinds of repetitive chat this is sort of borderline i thinki dont chat on my alt  i dont like the people in the n00b corp and who else is there exactlyi doubt any isk farmers use credit cards to pay for their accounts not saying all timecarders are farmers but if someone uses cash it lowers the probability of being one very muchi dont understand your reasons on this so ill not commentoh and not supported why should ccp alter something that is a game mechanic and doesnt affect regular players more than what they are doing already
this is a lot of stuff in that post but most of the points can be addressed with thisfirst i said each description of behavior was just off the top of my head and ccp will need to do the refinement of these criteria but every eve player with experience knows that certain nonlegitimate players do certain things that normal players simply dont do or cant do even in the edge cases if ccp has any such tools active they havent told us and of course they dont have to tell us if they dont want to but in case such a thing does not already exist then it should and it doesnt hurt to make sure or askjust so youall dont get mixed up in details the proposal itself is putting a system in place to detect suspicious behaviors the specific behaviors themselves are minor details and entirely at the discretion of ccp also im not really understanding all the hate in the thread that inst accompanied by reasons explaining why coming from the same two people theres lots of reasons to hate me jeez just let me know which one if you just want a troll festival i will retaliate by stating drake and vista are doodooheads you will never be able to beat that
most people who actually care enough to help out put some time and effort into their ideas and not thinking off the top of their headsanyone can rattle off ideas on common problems few actually put some thought and effort into it to make it rational enough to be reasonable
the specific details of what behaviors should be monitored are not something anybody without access to ccps log information can really determine for sure i think ive said something like that twice already so you can see there really is no reason to get really specific about that at this point except just to give an example or a general idea

please bring them back the old trails looked awesome i didnt mind if they were jagged sometimes
so since you have absolutely no clue how the scanning mechanic works and the skillsships required to do it well how exactly are you qualified to comment on the difficulty level of ninja salvaginglet me put it another way to scan and salvage effectively you must train several scanning skills to v salvaging to v be able to fly and fit a covops ship which means training several ship and fitting skills to iv and training several navigation skills to iv or v in general the time it takes to train these skills to the minimum needed is roughly commensurate with training the minimum for lvl 3 missions this does not include the actual player skill required to scan someone down which takes some time and practice to get the hang ofjust because we dont train combat skills doesnt mean we can just train salvager i and be off and running any more than it means you can train missile launcher operation i and start running lvl iv missions
over the past 4 years i have had a lot of experience in many facets of eve i love this game due to the evolving nature of it coupled with the ease of changing from one sphere to another when wanting to try something different my previous experience as a csm alternate where i proved i could work constructively and actively with others should make me your first choice of candidate to vote for xavier hayes is my market privateerbuilderinventor character i have two other characters currently involved in wh space missions and low sec pvepvpill be looking out for issues aiming at improving low sec pirating missions and drones especially but will consider any other issue in a fair and openminded way i take playing eve seriously representing player issues to ccp is something i will do with a similar approach ill also be pushing fellow csm members to act professionally at all times be active and engage with players should i get elected chair i shall step down and call a vote immediatelyadd your intention to vote for xavier hayes below as a token of my appreciation for your support i will be entering all registered voters into a drawing to win 30 day pilot licenses t2 ships and other items to be drawn by an independent third party
a number of players have been asking me ingame if i am representing any one playerstyle in short im not going to bang on about what factions i am going to represent on the csm for the simple reason that any factionplaystylegroup of players that suggest good ideas will get my support thats not to say i dont have ideas of areas of the game that i think need some work eg sov low sec drones rply support etc unlike some other candidates my intention isnt to push forward carebear issues and facebookambulation crap which frankly i view as well down a line of issuesim a levelheaded guy who thinks csm members have a duty and responsibility to act on behalf of players in a professional manner at all times i have no master pulling the strings in the background and will push issues that will enhance eve for players
as previously posted in the op if you want your threadsite added just reply with the links and ill edit them ingive me links an ill add your name
thread link
wasnt that declared an exploit thoughif its still a problem maybe i can see if there can be some sort of transferrance of aggro caused by remote repping but i wont come up with the issue myself since i dont really go into highsec and probably wont come up with the best possible proposal but if it has support and highsec dwellers dont think its a stupid idea i will get behind it maybe you should post the issue yourself if you have something specific in mind
itll all be here when it is ill start by reposting pics already posted on the pl forums sometime today
1 although you may have to arrange for lark to disappear careful those servicemen are sly
ive only ever heard good things about mazz she gets my vote thumbsup
1  im shallow 
voting because maz is an awesome name
we already know what ankh thinks we have had her on the csm already covering issues raised previouslypeople are asking for your views we are after all considering voting for you and not ankh i dont think we mind waiting a while for themwe are still waiting patiently
hi erikwould just like to extend my thanks for your answers i will admit that take cares resistance to buckling under constant differing opinions is impressivegood luck to you on the big day
how can you reassure voters that if you are elected onto the csm eva aka ank isnt doing the work you should be doing it seems so far that she seems to think she is running again by answering questions directed at you how will voters know that you have the time and inclination to answer forum threads etc since it appears someone else is doing that for you in your campaignxavier hayes
certainly a more votable candidate than your normal persona will you be releasing the name of your main
1 youre not a cat2 name of main pls3 all you have lost is an ibis in pvp  in case this is your main if point 3true then doesnt apply
his got my vote
that you want to get things done is good in my book and if you do get elected i hope that you will stick it out through the negotiations and deals that you will have to make in order to get your points on top of ccps agenda you have certainly played the game long enough to know a lot about weak and strong sides of the gameabout some regions of eve sucks and others not well it was already covered above so i will just add that the way it is now gives a lot of diversity through the choices we as players make when we decide somewhere in eve to call home a good home for one person sucks beyond for another thats just as rl so i would like to hear more on what type of diversity would you be pushing foras for risk vs rewards i dont really get what you hope to achieve by pushing more people into lowsec what is the purpose of that by doing such a move eve could very likely en up having less players which would make the game smaller for us all if one wants to fight in empire there is a game mechanic for that by bribing concord to declare war on someone it sucks being on the receiving end of that but no complaints as its part of the game i dont really see that moving even more activity of combat typeie l4s into lowsec00 would bring anything more to the game its my understanding that still the amount of money to made in 00 by far outstrips what you can make in empire does it notlooking forward to your reply and i wish you luck but am not convinced that you have a clear enough agenda which actually will bring new value to the csm so i stand as of yet undecided
i should actually read the whole thread 
quotetrue
haha okay how will you send them evemail
id be interested to hear about what people think on the suggestion that the current election system is very likely to favour a polarized and thus ineffective csm having only one vote forces voters to vote tactically voting for a candidate that has a strong following instead of those they find represented their own issues best i imagine giving each voter as many votes as there are seats on the council would likely yield better results  better representation of the voters will more impressive vote numbers csm members will have more legitimacy than just a couple hundred votes by their own alliance better chances for less polarizing more consensus orientated candidates since they will be not the first but the second to fifth or so choice of many hardly any extra effort needed to implementwhile the second csm certainly seemed like a quiet but harmoniously productive bunch i more vividly remember the first instalment and the sometimes vicious disagreements that were fought out on various levels seeing as the political situation among capsuleers in new eden is no less divided into polar opposites elections in the current system will more likely wield representatives of those factions almost ensuring bitter rivalries being fought out in the council along those exact linesnow i strongly encourage heated debate in most places certainly in politics but you must not forget that the csm is not our parliament but our executive and thus should work as a team seeking good even if controversial solutions to perceived problems and then presenting them to ccp as a united front they should not checkbalance themselves mutually  this should be left to us capsuleers as their direct electorateoh and besides i really cant decide if i should vote for the take care or the star frraction candidate so i want to be able to vote for both 
if you give people nine votes youll just wind up with slates of nine candidates do you really want the council of goon management nothing against goons per se but theyre the ones in the best position to try i was skeptical of the system at first but it actually does make a lot of sense  it ensures that all the major groups get represented allowing slates would destroy that also strategic voting is annoying but its impossible to solve every system suffers from it bar none  its actually been mathematically proven
while i dont think that currently there were enough candidates from any faction to fill a slate nor that any single interest group such as an alliance held enough influence to convince anyone apart from themselves to vote for a monolithic slate i can certainly see the problem we might come up with some solutions to this though limit number of candidates per alliance disallow slates on forums and linked pages who knowsinterestingly goons have not fared too well in past elections given their numbers id like to see what maths say just how dangerous slate voting would be in such an enviroment
i think a lot more new players and bears would be willing to get into pvp if it wasnt a monster blobfest 90 of the time crime is fun we all want to be involved but industry pilots rarely have the means to fight a 10 lthat interbus idea is great though and id like to see that happen
fixed for you there mazzilliu is the greif candidate ive done lots of stuff spying metagaming pirating etc my killboards can be viewed on pandemic legion boards and my spy alts could be credited with the leaked info from dead alliances such as bruce rise puppet masters requiem and other minor alliances i forget to mention right now that pl has faced in the past ive also been a member of the sniggerdlysniggwaffe pirate corp for a pretty long timeoh and im a girl in real life an evil girledit oh and here for your entertainment is a really old link i found of one of my past conquests itt i made a now dead alliance black star alliance diplomat sing songs for blue standings then i didnt set them blue and we kicked them out of 00
well thats true enough even if they did though some people enjoy market pvp more than real pew and it can be hard to get your own blob going and solo pvp is a bit of a laugh if you dont have at least some support on callthat making the diplomat sing songs thing is hilarious though

i think you should mail petur
your post doesnt speak of that you submitted your application the same way you did for csm2assuming you did that for csm3 too you should email petur indeed
lmao it was not voted down because it was not important it was voted down as it wasnt a valid issue ccp are aware of the issue and are working on it csm exists to notify ccp of issues raising this issue would be a complete waste of time as ccp already know the issue exists the same reasoning was used not to raise the issue of eve not running properly on some mac configurationscsm exists to help ccp not to spam them about things they are already actively working on
the csm also exists to bump things up ccps priority queue and we all know what kind of priority ccp gives to anything fw related
youre right ankhe what they should do is retask the people working on solving lag in general to solve lag in fw only grow up
this is not on my top three but that does not mean i can not do anything about it and influence a changemy views of the matter is that fw need more depth content and meaning aswell to somehow opening fw to alliances as a former roleplayer i know there are a lot of roleplaying alliances that would very much like to participate in fw as an entity nope not me nope not me either participated in fw on the minmatar side in 2008 but nothing majorfaction warfare is pointless which is why i havent taken part if you really think that one needs to be in it to see it you are wrong
well it seems that erik finnegan is the only one that even mentiones factional warfare in the candidate description good for erik of course but bad for the game as a wholefw has a specific type of lag though that is a rather specific problem
yes
your not a man if your eyes are bleeding and your whining lolanyway yup bigger fonts would be nice

vuoto i dont understand your comment about drones are you saying they need to be on all afs if so wouldnt the enyo and more importantly ishkur consider that a nerf on them since its a drone frigate my idea would be maybe a limited dmg bonus for using t2 ammo or possibly a reduction in the penalty some t2 ammo has like at the momment my ishkur with t2 150s which isnt important does 740ms with a normal ab load javelin s 20 speed penalty per gun loaded with it into all 3 guns and it goes down to mid 300s say give af no speed penalty or lower it to in an af 5 or 10 or a reduction in the tracking penalty these kinds of changes could help all the afs and i dont just mean the higher dmg t2 ammo in the case of say spike s which has a massive range bonus have afs increase that as well or add say an af speed bonus would make af more attractive and useful as well as make t2 ammo more enjoyable to use in them galisonps i use the ishkur as an example as i can only fly the gal afs and use t2 hybrids so i havent looked at the t2 ammo of projectiles or missles but id guess their bonus and penaltys are about the same in general
judging from the big balance thread in the game development forum t2 ammo and t2 damage ammo in particular is going to get looked atboosted so i dont think any bonus related to them is really going to happen

meh liek what about three editable presets and maybe shiftclick and ctrlclick of the orbit icon would trigger the 2nd and 3st orbit ranges plus of course freely assignable shortcuts although ccp seems to avoid them for many actions to prevent macros
yeah the arbitray options never made any sense
signedpeople should remember to use the check support box p
that number comes from the easiness of using a raven for missions and the ecms needed in pvpnot from missiles in pvp so they failed epicly again
if you would be so kind to actually look at how many writes signed  supported but havent checked the support box you would see that far beyound 60 have supported this and then take into account that each time we reply we cant click support once moreedit have maxed skills on my caldari pilot and are quite effective but some missiles cant be denyid that they simply are useless no matter how you work them rockets standard cruise and too some exstand heavy missiles this if half or all missiles 
not signed until i see the complete raw crunching math hereand like others said adapt or die
i have been disagreeing with ccp on this since the roundtables at the 2006 fanfest where they first pitched their concepts since then i have put forward proposals to the csm on alliance inclusion options which have been accepted for submission voted on by the csm and passed to ccp i would like to see ccp finally show some willing to resolve this pointi play eve for the rp and for the community i dont care about your wormholes i havent even tried to scan one of the things down yet i also have little interest in t3 or most of the content released in the last couple of expansions to be quite honest fw in its current form splits the player base with arbitrary and absolute barriers between player interactionresolve your promise ccp we have waited long enough for you to think about it
kind of undermines the idea of a csm when theyve lied to ankheblahdyblah so much about implementing thisdisappointing ccp
couple mission failure with standings losses as well creating a resale market for the given items
dont even fly a nag but know people who do this really deserves fixing
haha i would like to see you try to snipe with citadel torps xdnot supported
i do not support this change  unless the change involves making the nag horizontal and not vertical the combination of the proposed changes  keeping the nag vertical will make it the best dread in the game and throw off balance
sigh i bet well be getting a cpu boost and another mid slot go ahead and throw a bandaid on the gushing wound
updated op to alter for ship hull only having room for 2 turretsinstead of 4 gun slots 2 gun slots with role bonus 100 damage bonus for capital projectiles
its pretty it should be useful too
supportedmake minmatar all turrets no launchers or give minmatar a ship bonus to every single weapon in game
i cannot belive it but i have to agree with the goon and say that naglafar is the weakest capital compared with the outhersit needs a change
anyone in a medium to large sized alliance has probably dealt with the headache of pos passwords if you want to let blues into your poses you have to give them the password and they have to set it if the password is stolen any hostile even with a negative ten standing can sit in your pos shields and bump ships or break lock on him until you change the passwordpotentially kicking out afk friendliesespionage is fun and all but the system just does not work very well i propose a new option is added to the pos interface where you can check a box and enter the minimum amount of corp or alliance standing in order for the pos to grant access
your idea is so wonderful mazzilliu you should get a million dollars
agreed
noif your blues spying on you then its your problem deal with it best way is to stop giving them your passwords
would be a great change
makes lots of sense imo
pos passwords are retarted mechanicseven more ed are pos passwords to use jump bridgesits really annoying to have to input a password over and over and over to use your own alliance jump bridges because you are not in the corp that operates the tower
been asked for many times
no support for the op support for the ideaisaac
this would reduce alot of friendly fire to supported
fix the naglfar
corps need more tools
no person who can change standings should be thoroughly trusted to be ceo of the corp id never trust anyone with standings changes unless i knew they could be directors do you realize how much power heshe would hold your fleet of ships could easily shoot friends because they were set red before they came to help eve is based on trust sometimes you get screwed over it no support isaac
how far you trust people should be a choice for the corp in question not something imposed on them by a lack of options
im generally against such powers being granted to individualsbut then eve being as chaotic as it is well standings mean nothing honestlyits just a name tag saying hi im your friend said person shoots youi dont have a problem with the role being granted to diplomats or something but i prob wouldnt use it
1 in before lavista vista
missile batteries definately need some lovingthe rate of fire is just too slow 24 secs is a joke the damage multiplier on a cruise battery is also too low
no no no no no  i dont use missiles but need every bit of cpu to work my low sec miningindustrial poss change the launchers but leave the cpu alone i would rather use amarr or gallente towers but they dont have the cpu i need to make my setup work the other towers have bonuses to silo and other things that make them worthwhile the caldari have cpu
i just realised all 3 missile batteries have the same rate of fire what givesall other turrets have different rof the smaller the turret the quicker rofthe other thing is there are only 3 different missile batteries while other turrets have 6 why are there no assault batteriesbatteries need a serious look at everyone has posted valid points and add them all up leaves me scratching my head

support this but would like some real punishment for actually starting a war without reason and then losing itlike it cost x mill isk more to declare a war which the winning side gets
ausser i appreciate your posts even even though they go against my proposition because it is now clear you are genuinely concerned about this issue and so am ii will attempt to be as clear as possible in giving you my reasons for posting this threadbut first lets take a look at the dev posts you brought up the posts by oveur are contradictory dreads being antibattleship then only antipos but aside from that i do not give them much weight because they precede their release and the concept of dreads was still being changedhowever fendahl confirms what i was saying dreads were originally intended as anticapital ships thats the concept they decided to go with in the end rather than antibattleshipcappos or just antipossieged dreadwhy i brought up the dread vs battleship example every ship class can be effective against a lower sized one with proper webpainter support theres nothing wrong there since it requires teamwork coordination i do not want the phoenix to be an antibattleship platform thats not the point of this threadthe point was why go with a phoenix which requires support to deal similar damage to a gun dreads firing at a carrier when you could use that same support and a gun dread to be effective against not only capitals but also some sub caps i do not want citadels to be effective antibattleship weapons i do not want them to have more raw dps what im asking for is for more effective dps when firing at moving capitals of all types so that their effectiveness is similar to that of gun based weapon systems as it was before the missile formula changethe graph i posted on page one gives a good picture of the problem if youre firing at a moving capital theres a very small window where citadels are better extreme short range at any other range guns are far far betteryoure right in that missiles and guns have different advantages and that against a missile dread you cant maneuver to reduce damage but when youre taking damage from multiple gun dreads you cannot maneuver to keep at short range  high transveral from all of them on the other hand the disadvantage of citadels isnt reduced by engagement sizethe problem isnt that citadel damage is calculated differently thats perfectly fine the problem is how much damage they lose compared to guns against moving capitals without any sufficient compensating advantage overall different weapons systems should be roughly as effective currently this is not the case at alli dont know where you picked up that i wanted citadels to deal 100 damage to moving supercaps i dont only that they be about as effective as guns and currently they are notlets put it this way given a choice between two weapon systems both of which are effective against pos and sieged dreads but only one of which is effective against moving caps of all sizes which would you train why explosion velocity is the right screw for this problem its the explosion velocity that causes the large damage difference not the raw damage nor the explosion radius however a simple way of making citadels effective against moving caps while keeping their effectiveness against battleships the same would be to1 increase the explosion velocity2 increase the explosion radius
lol exactly high sec towers need so many ships to remove
let them decay and if they reach a certain point make it like pos equipment without a tower you rep them up then can unanchor them and steal it if the corp is still active then they have a chance to keep the tower otherwise you have to work for it to steal it and there is always the war dec option for those that dont want to steal the towers
i support this
its uglytime for a makeover and i dont mean queer eye for the straight guy kindplease ccp turn the flying potato into something drone boat users are proud to show off
confirming im tired of flying a butt plug
are you flying an avatarleave alone the dominix its handsome and manly its also a giant spacewhale
whats wrong with the space potato seriously its hardly a damnation but its not that ugly a ship theres no real need to fix it
this i like the dominix lately
give it a giant whale tale
domiraven and moa hulls
no support play a different raceship if you dont like the dominix isaac
go post this crap on the game features and ideas please
gallente dont have a god given right to good looking shipswtt domi for moa
now there ill disagree with you  this is a forum for any everelated issue including graphics i disagree with the op but this is a perfectly appropriate place for this
nopecomplaining about how a ship looks is something that should be put there for the plain reason that it is to trivial for it to be considered here at the assembly hallthats like arguing the color of my shield is insulting and should be colored green or somethingthat and the op is an emoragerant
this
leave the domi i like it and if you dont like it fly a megathron it is lovely too and looks sort of like thighs and a cameltoe from some angles otherwise just enjoy the game
the domi is just a dronebag not meant to be pretty
leave the domi alone noaplus if they changed the domi skin loads of pple will start maonin about other ships p
and if someone wanted to argue for greener shields this would be the forum for it id vote against but the csm has the right to discuss absolutely anything everelated be it however stupid an issue if we start saying graphics whines arent csm business then ccp can say forum policies arent csm business with exactly the same rationale yeah a lot of stupid issues exist but im not willing to limit csm jurisdiction just to ignore a stupid issue id rather just give it the cold shoulder directly if theres ever a graphics issue that matters in futureunlikely but anything is possible i want us to be able to discuss it
fine ill grant you that muchbut then your inviting the most mundane things into the arena and that will start to drive you nutsyoud need alot of dry ice to keep that shoulder cold short of exposing it to space o 
ha ha yeahthe protectors are doing it for free i assume or are the carebears going to work for free so they can pay for their protectionim sure theres lots of people willing to sit around for hours waiting until someone jumps them

if you want to nerf local give all ships built in probe launcher builtin probesotherwise no
no the point is now you can see immediately if the miner is a bait ship because hell have friends which show up in local if you remove local as an infallible intelligence tool you wont know if the miner is bait until his friends show up the definition of risk is with infallible knowledge of who is in the system there is no risk without that knowledge risk is achievedthey do this now its called a gate camp
you want me to support local changes change how we gather intel then therein lies the problem cloaked ships would become the next overpowered ship then youll all demand that they be nerfed thus nerfing them into pointlessness so until you come up with a better way for supplying intel i wont support any changes to local directional scanner doesnt count in its current formisaac
1 cloaked signature impossible to pin down but shows up faintly on the combat probesit wont give away a cloaked ships actual location but it will give anyone with the nerve to bring a scout the knowledge someone could be peeking in on them2 thus far the complaint has been intel tools but i firmly believe that the current intel tools are fine if actually put into practiceadd 1 signature for cloaked ships and im sold otherwise no support and thats hard for me since i really really want to see this

rather than instant reallocation of sps have one skill drain into another and boost the other skills train speedfor example you have say industry level 4 and you decide you dont want it and want to boost your gunnery you have industry level 4 drain into gunnery level 3 or what ever skill you choose to reallocate sp simple really  
if you did it correctly you could have skill redistribution without abuse say you get half the skills put into a skill pool and that allows you to train twice as fast it gives you the benefit of allowing people to use worthless skills with a real sacrifice lose half points and without instatraining only train twice as fast
im proposing a simple quick bar of player status icons gang mates corp mates wartargets positively or negatively assigned standings alliance mates on the top of the local channel user listthis would allow pilots to notice corpmates and hostiles on local system more fairly and quickly if there are 20 pilots in the system people with names starting with z are considerably less likely noticed than pilots with names starting with a this is because scrolling the local player list is a btch the icon quickbar would show only 1 icon of each icon type no matter how many pilots with a similar status icon there were in local the feature would not alter the gameplay balance or in any way actually it would just make everyones life heck of a lot easier in systems with lots of players it would also allow you to make your local channel window smaller freeing more gui space for other stuffthe image below is photoshopped so imagine theres 99 in local not 9
boost local tbh
hmmmm i would support this with no local chat maybe then you dont know if there is 1 or 100 hostiles you just know there are some
yes as theres a thread for nerf local as well this idea would work perfectly there too but for now im just supporting my own proposal as its not really a gameplay change but a gui improvement
no theres too much easy intell in the local channel already
but the thing is spaceships do have easy intel radars pick up transponders and we should know exactl who is in a system
no
do they says who i cant count the number of times in a scifi showmovie an unknown vessel has been picked up on long range scans the first thing i would do if i owned a ship in lawless space 00 would be rip out the transponder
absolutely this is simply a more userfriendly way of accessing data that is already readily available
gameplay and intel wise in my opinion theres just no difference in having this feature i have a long experience on empire wars and 00 as well you always check the local if you know youre about to be in danger it just takes you a few clicks more on every jump and forces you to distract your actions every 530 seconds whenever youre in 00 or otherwise in war  and only if the whole local pilot list doesnt fit in the window so most often no change at all just more gui space for youand you still want to make life more difficult for yourselves if the nos are just to vote against the existing local channel pilot list i understand the votes but the gui improvement resistance i dont quite get so please enlighten me with more detailed opinions and explanations why no thx
if local is going to be kept as an intel channel this is how it should work
yes but i only support if both together this is a good idea if no local but with local it just means you dont have a few seconds to jump onto someone before they scan up and down local chat again
supported
no support id like to see what ccp has for changes for local before taking suggestions like this isaac
yeah but my objection had nothing to do with rp  companies who intentionally annoy their customers tend to be companies that dont stand up very well i dont see that this proposal would have anywhere near enough benefit to justify the frustration level you propose to add
and how the server will know if i am doing pvp or notif i am fighting something player owned the server will think i am doing pvpthen it will be very easy to circumvent your captcha send 1 drone against a ship that has aggressed you and you are free of the captcha it will not be hard to set up it would simply require 1 extra account in a drake escorting several macro miners shield regen and resists will do the reston the other hand a captcha at the wrong moment while figthing in a mission can spell doom for a regular user it the captcha appears when you are using gunsmissilesdrones they will be always a problem apparently you have a limited idea of who use macrosyes it will probably work for a time stopping small time macro users ie those that set up a macro and go to work study ecc but it will not deter the professional macro user people that has sweatshops where a single person follow 20 accounts with the help of macros they will have a person keeping an eye upon the 20 accounts and probably will even have a warning system to alert them if something goes wrong they are the big problem as they sell the isk for real money and use high end macros combined with low wage workers to squeeze every penny from the game

war mechanicthese are simply just ed upfirst off why would concord ever allow war in their territory isnt the whole point of concord ships made with the help of all factions to keep the peace and if they wanted war why are they not involvedsecondly why am i forced to take up arms and do pvp in highsec when all i want to do is pve and marketing i dont see a mechanic forcing people in 00 to do pve and marketing instead of pvp wheres my module of see i am here now you cant pvp but have to pvp until i decide to move or you have pved for 5 hours and even if it is so why again is it that when you finally say okey  it lets blow these idiots away pull out the heavy guns and go do something you have no interest in doing and really dont enjoy then it is impossible to stop the war in this way i mean if you declare war on some one and they destroy everything that you have come too you door and kill you then the war is over there is no one left too fight but not in evewhy isnt there a mechanic that says if some one declaring a war on some one else and isnt prepared to fight but just hide in a station that the war then is endinghow the  do you explain that some one is running a war against some one put dont have the capacity to actually fight and it is not because you cant find them gurilli war but because concord protects them in the stations there should be adding some different mechanics too the war systemfirst of a mechanic which state that if some one declare war on you you can pay concord the same amount of isk to disallow it meaning they decide the amount to start the war minimum of what it is now and if the opposing site is willing to match that no war will be allowed by concordsecondly if you are in a war and dont have a ship in space in the region of a office of the opposing force for more then 30min within 24hours the war will end automatically by default and the winning site will get the deposit set up too start the warthe last part can be removedthere should be a minimum player amount in a corp before it can declare war or be declared war upon say 3050 to make it a actual corp and not just a little gang of peopleas it is now it would be like me and 20 friends deciding to declare war on some one and then going at it this wouldnt be called a war but a gang fightthese are the alternative i can see from just disallowing a one way war meaning disallowing a war which is not wanted from both sides which would actually give more sense giving the background and the rules of nature when have you last seen a war from one country to another where there was no conflict of any kind to help start it
theres already a post for thatclick here
can i has your stuff
much as i hate griefers who use the wardec mechanic and have been their victim more than once i have to say no to all of the abovein rp terms concord regulates not prohibits wars prohibiting wars is unrealistic and in game mechanic terms a huge part of the essence of eve is involuntary pvp combati think youre expecting a victory or loss condition as it exists in other games eve isnt other games its more realistic you can stop wars the same way wars end in real life when the aggressor decides its not worth fighting anymore if youre having trouble you may not be fighting it the right way there is no universal end this war button and there shouldnt necessarily be if youre making the war worthwhile to your aggressor youre losing  be that fighting if the griefers are in it for kicks paying tribute money if the griefers are in it for the money or allowing the aggressor control of your other resources like moons or territory instead you can try making the war dreadfully boring to your aggressor by refusing to engage or dreadfully expensive by joining an alliance to raise the cost to them or dreadfully painful by hiring really good mercenaries to pummel them into the stone ageit costs an aggressor money to keep a wardec active even if no fighting is going on and they or you are blockading the other at stations you wait it out sieges take time a lot of timesimply paying concord off is unbalanced rich corps can act with total impunity toward poor corps under those circumstances at least under the current system if a rich corp tries to end a war with money the aggressor gets it and sets the terms which may include things other than money not concord  which is fair because the aggressor earned it a comprehensive contract type called a peace treaty a promise not to declare war enforceable by concord which can include a variety of terms besides money might be a different way to do this thoughseiges and long distance wars are legitimate  wars shouldnt be invalidated because combatants have few or no assets in a particular region at a timemany mercenary corps have very small numbers of members and those corps need to be able to declare wars to do their work legally and i dont like the idea of giving any corp immunity to wars because of their size thats an arbitrary unfair and very easily exploited mechanicas they exist now there are ways around the war mechanics if your corp is at war and some members dont want to be war targets they can leave the corp and form a sister shadow corp or for immunity to war declarations just return to the npc corpsyes the wardec mechanic sucks because its a paytogrief system and needs to be reexamined this has been said many many times but im afraid i dont see the logic behind your proposals even as a fellow carebear myself
this is not the game you are looking forhello kitty online is that way 
how come that every time some one adds a proposal that could remove some griefing stupid ass ers as you have to put something idiotic like this in the postgo f yourselfnow thats out of the waypersonally i feel there is a need to change some aspects of the war declaring namely that it is so easily exploited war is about taking others out that are in your way not to make casual pvp and pirating in highsecthis should be adjusted for thatpersonally i would just remove high sec wars all together or let it be a agreed to war mechanicthe pveers is what pays for this game and they are the onces getting the boot at every turn
the minimum it cost is laughable compared to what you get a free card to attack anything in polized space without any reason to do so 
what about the ones who think war is about making isk or the ones who dont like smart mouths in local you are in my ice fields and i want your corp to cease to exist i see your corp flying around in faction fit mission running ships and i want your faction mods one of your corp mates shot his mouth off in local to the wrong people and now you are all paying for his stupidity because your ceo refused to kick his dumb ass out of the corpsometimes wars are started over the smallest things about the only thing i want changed about the war dec system is the little babies that see npc corps has getoutofjailfree cards once a character hits a certain age say 6 month they have to go into a corp that can be war decced
dude if i smacktalk you on the street i am pretty sure you dont pull a gun on me and shoot my head of or start a wara minimum will have to be done for it to be worth declaring warnormally irl the problem would be other parties joining in and the fact that you can die and be gone forever that including sanctions against a country where as it is unable to trade with other countries etcif we got a mechanic in that would allow us too decide which corps we would like to sell what too in market then yes this would be fine since you could freeze those people outbut as it is now it is just annoyingand the whole idea with them hiding in a station or logoff tricks etc to avoid the actual fight is just lame if they started the war but dont have the man power to actually fight it the war should be oversince this is something concord allows normal drive bys just doesnt fit into the describtion of a war
right here is where i stopped readingno i take it back within some areas in certain cities in the usa i would pull out a gun and shoot you in the head if smack talked me on the street so please stop with the real world crap in an internet space ship game
well if hello kitty online wasnt what you were looking forthen world of warcraft is the other wayok ok on a more serius note yes something needs to be done about war dec mechanics  meaning people not beoing able to hop corp several times to avoid a war that they brought upon themselfs ie attempting to recruit another corps members smack talking corpalliance members or deccing a weaker corp then when that corp joins an alliance running off and trys to get away from the revenge dec

never been invloved in anything csm never even looked here before but in true eve fashion im jumping in feet first all the way from the top diving boardthis may have already been said and if it was then it wasnt said very well as it aint been sorted out yet not that i am saying it better the gist of it is they need an overhaul and to be on par with the main empire factions but true to their coursestage one is allow it into faction warfare no idea how fw works becasue ive no interest in the main empire factions expand that black rise hovel and give each pirate faction a system a forward operating base if you like ally it up raiders guristas sansha playing off agianst angels and serps maybe an advantage to latter to compensate for manpowerstandard fw mechaincs as i imagine them to apply corp has appropiate standing to the faction but also the corp memebers must be outlaw or the avergae corp sec status must be outlaw whatever is more practicalthe npc pirate factions will still mainly exist in 00 you will not be able to start the game as a pirate but as the four core racesnext thing on the list of how to make eve better for me and all when lp store was introduced i asked why could i not buy db mars from the raider store but i could buy an from the amarr story i was kindly informed by ccp greyscale i think that items in the loyalty store were placed there as the only way to get them as there arnt faction navy spawns to rat where there is pirate spawns that makes sense to mehowever from an in character perspective if i wanted a guristas faction fittings as i was roleplaying guristas i would have to go out and butcher my allies or buy them off contracts supporting people anti to my cause as they quite clearly killed guristas solution pirate items in pirate loyalty store put an increased price tag on them if you wishim not diputing the fact that the pirate loyalty stores are shiate as implants and faction ships are immense but with so many navy faction items about what harm is it for the pirate ones to there same stats its all just in our heads that db is better than tsallow production of the snyth drugs in pirate owned stations make it a mission arch or such ie go out and mine this gas go out and hack for this reaction maybe get dropped on my a long range navy patrol etc bring me back all the ingredients and voila heres some drugs keep them or an option to deliver them to my mate 100 odd jumps away other side of the world for bonus isk aka smuggling is now in its infancythis all came straight out of my head but you have the ball now run with it improve on it and support itvery much obligededit was editing for spelling mistakes gave up

much better than most of the useless guff that gets posted here
you know ive always wondered why there wasnt fw for the factions other than the 4 empiresseriously it would spice things up for sure
supporting boosted pirate lp stores
i am more thinking of why is this needed and will you reduce their dmg even futher to compensate for the lack of reload timeits a balance issue if you want instant ammo switching you will properly see a static type of dmg to compensate for it like kenexpl dmg and nothing else for projectileswhich i highly doubt will happend or will be wanted from the minmatar publiceditpersonally i would love too see minmatar only do ken and expl dmg d knowing as a amarr how easily i am thinked when meeting people knowing i can only do em and therm dmg it would be awesome to do the same to those pesky minmatars but a lot of balance would be needed for this to ever happend and it would destroy the difference in the weapon systems and make minmatar a lot weaker if dmg wasnt tweaked a lotand again why is this needed
having a constant feed to ammo in cargo but keeping the 10 second reload time for swapping ammo type would be good but tbh autocannons arent that bad or needing of a buff when compared to artillery
just be sure to switch their primary damage source to emjorm
the situation you describe is certainly possible using the market to generate a large amount of isk which you then use to manipulate gameplay but the openness and detail present in the market makes it so that it is just as possible and doable by any player  employee or no this is by designif youre talking about their access to the database as something in their favor so far as data mining to determine and predict trends it really isnt they could get the same information off any relevant webpage that you or i would go to all without having to go to any extra steps like writing the queries and interpreting the information themselves
once again thats entirely wrongthe csm concept was first made up just after eve was released it was never an anticorruption organization like nyt made it out to beand there was a minicsm after release where ccp selected people who would give them feedback much like the current csm
ok if you want to call any group of people ccp uses to get feedback from a csm v
actually it was called the csm the group was picked by pann and met online for a meeting chat with various devs including tomb the chat was largely unstructured and the delegates usually sourced questions from the players to ask ccp in the week or two before as well as during the meeting on irc the running joke was that someone had to ask about titans every session
one thing regular players cant do is buy or sell materials based on price changes on upcoming buffs nerfs changes in roid spawn numbers and batch numbers that said i doubt too many ccp staff are doing that why risk a job over isk that is easy to get as it is
might be a ridiculous idea but i thought id post it up or its already been thought ofso essentially what i was thinking of was maybe having the boss or fcwcs in fleets being able to set starbase forcefield passwords on mass rather than each individual pilot setting it obviously would only be useful in a few situations such as jump bridge passwords and setting it before you warp a fleet back to a safe posthere are downsides to this if someone got the boss flag and changed everyones password while inside a friendly nonalliance pos youd see a lot of complaints but im sure someone with a bit more know how than me would be able to think of a better way to implement something like thisanyway thats the idea anyone else
and it also means if your using someone elses jump bring or pos they only have to give the password to 1 person
thats like saying followingthe us government should really spy on terrorists they could like tap into their phone and maybe even their internet but i dont know since i dont actually know a lot about it
i dont even know where you are going with this

dang it now i have multiple candidates i am considering voting for
sure pirates hang out in high sec piloting freighters all the time effectively your proposal increases the risk for gankers while also increasing the amount of more or less mutual pvp ie safe things are safer dangerous things are more dangerous for me that makes the game less appealing but thats a value judgment to each his own what i find amazing is that this is a priority of all the things going on in eve you think this even rates mention needless to say i wont be voting for you and everything i suspected when i saw your corp ticker just got confirmed
so your complaint is that instead of the player with the kill rights coming and crying to the forums about being ganked he will be able to hire someone to go out and get his revenge for himi dont see how it makes safe things safer and dangerous things more dangerous unless you mean it is adding potential consquence to actions ganked that poor 1 month old player in his caracal taking tentative steps into low sec he contracts out the kill rights with some minor reward to bounty hunter  merc corp that hunts down the pirates without suffering a sec hit for doing it how is this a bad thingheartstones example may not have been a good one but that doesnt mean the ability to put up kill rights for tradecompetitionetc shouldnt be explored by ccpantipiracy corps are generally laughed at because in the end they become pirates themselves because taking offensive action in low sec or high sec against pirates lowers your sec status adding mechanics to allow players and corporations to actually take an antipirate stance would add to the gamefx good two shoes inc gtsi is antipiracy currently all it can do is set bait traps and not conduct an offensive campaign to push the pirates out with transferable kill rights gtsi can offer isk for the kill rights payforkill or even a service to complete a kill right paidtokillit is not intended to help piracy
to be straight i dont think its a terrible idea it makes antipirate possible which is good it makes kill rights meaningful which is good but it does make an already extremely safe game even safer i dont have a huge problem with it and if it was combined with some other proposals to make currently riskfree activities a little dicier i would be all in favormy issue with the proposal is that it is nothing more than an incredibly minor tweak to a problem few people have and that few even noticed it betrays an attitude of everything is fine just make it a little safer the csm was created as i understand to serve as a player driven honesty check and a means of surfacing major player issues to the developers this proposal indicates that heartstone like many of the csm candidates are not running for the position of honesty checker  player representative but are instead auditioning to be unpaid junior assistant gameplay developers im interested in a csm candidate who wants to listen to the playerbase and bring major player issues to the developers attention as far as minor gameplay tweaks out of left field that is what i pay ccp for
pirates are not the only ones who generate killrights many people will engage in low sec activity that could generate killrights for a number of reasons including for example a player who chases his target who may well be a pirate from 00 to low sec i have personally had many kill rights both against me and for me in this way the pirate if he has a sec status that allows him into high sec can then return the favour to the pilot should he happen to meet him if his sec status doesnt allow this then we are back to the actions have consequences thing maybe it wasnt in truth the best example of the theory in practiceto address your other concerns about me wanting to be a junior game developer i presented that idea to simply show how my thinking works the idea was an amalgam of what has been proposed before by the community in many forms for the last three or more years i took what i considered the best parts of various ideas and combined them to come up with a possible solution it will not be my place in my opinion to put such a design forward immediately to the csm for a vote should i be lucky enough to be chosen from the very respectable field but as a player like yourself i have every right to float my own ideas for people to consider and if it is considered a reasonable solution to an ongoing problem then i will with the communities blessing move it forward in the same way i would any other proposal that i considered to effectively and satisfactorily deal with an issue that people consider there is in the game to put it blunt i dont believe for a second that any one person has the knowledge or ability to unilaterally dictate the direction the csm should advise ccp in i also dont believe the entire body of the csm has that ability either without input from the playerbase the csm will not function and it cannot represent the playerbase i see the duty and role of csm as being a buffer between ccp and the players whilst at the same time allowing the players voice to be more focused and louder when there is an issue that the players want raised hope that helps
lark hit the nail the big reason people despise your views and carebears in general is because they tend to have a rather one sided slant scammers pirates etc more often then not understand the importance of the industrial aspect of eve and have alts to exploit and support it they just dont feel the need to shout it from the rooftops whilst your efforts to engage with the pvp aspect of eve throughout your time in the csm are laudable i cant help but feel you only do this simply to placate those who would call you out on it otherwise
it is obvious that those of us who understand the take care concept already got our answers on the other hand most of those who insist on hearing your views are not in the least interested in anything that comes out you or ankhe at first i was curious whether the arguments of your opposition would lead to anything constructive unfortunately i understand now that their only aim was to engage you in a rather shallow polemic about who has got bigger this or that carefully avoiding any logic that could lead them to a genuine conclusion about you and the take care partytherefore once again i offer support from me and my tiny corp to the take care objectives stand fast
were currently working very hard on our next movie and thus wont have that much time to answer the forum rabblefortunately the movie should answer some of the questions in this thread
one  ank they let you into afc wtf it is a bit surprising to me some of their members seem very rp focused you dont actually have to answer the questiontwo  can either ank or erik speak to what take care thinks should be done concerning industry and npcpc interaction to include standings interaction
i prefer not to answer with the full details but some unfortunate real life events of a former afc member are at the basis of it which requires me to be in the afc at least temporarilyshort answer before i go to bed plus it would be unfair to the rest of the waiting people too if i wrote a lengthy text on this more will come later once the rest has been answeredive been lobbying hard to get standings available to nonmissionrunners and think it is undesirable that there missions currently have a monopoly on standing with the exception of fw but fw cannot provide unlimited standing and neither can cosmos which is just missions imoideally i want to see carreer options opened up so players can research and produce for npcs and receive standings in return that and mining missions should pay more and the miningastrosurveying agents shouldnt hand out so many combat missions
insert platform hereim primarily a carebear i dabble in pvp i play eve for the people i play with not necessarily to win having the game be fun is my primary concern that being said ask me any question an ill do my best to answer it
was expecting this thread to be funny and full of trolls but im actually impressed
i would like to vote some griefer and or troll but are you sure you dont have a hidden agenda also what kind of hidden agendas do other csm canditates have
doesnt the fact that you tried to play yourself off as a girl in her midteens whilst youre actually a 21year old guy to get some attention on a internetspaceship gaming forum make you even less csmworthy than when you were playing incharacter to be annoying just try and get people to notice youim not naive enough to believe anyone running for any type of office even in a game but doesnt this totally disqualifies you from engendering trust or respect amongst your peers  going from juvenile prankster to voteworthycommunitymember seems a bit of a stretch
i always suspected that cat was a rp character i agree with the issues raised and will vote for cat at the csm elections  let me put it this way i have a feeling that this cat fellow is probably a safer bet to vote for than say vuk or issler
larkonis how goez the campaign did you have any luck shaking down the united for campaign contributionz neo spartans throwing you any rallliez or partiez fill us in
near 10 of your csm introduction consists of swear words voting for someone who is incapable of formulating his ideas without getting rude is not my idea of voting wise next to that youre unable to spell correctly the word sovereignty which is as it reads your greatest beef with the gamein short you come over as a rude angry twelve year oldmaybe youll get my vote next time when youve grown up a little bit
it is ok to suck to a certain degree still i feel that a 00 region should excel more than a high security system with lvl4 agents as i mentioned a high security system can probably sustain over 100 players 100 players ratting in 00 well i think you need more than one regionas for diversity id like each region to have some sort of speciality besides different npcs drone regions is a good example their npcs drop components instead of loot that is something unique and that is what i want to achieve for each and every region some people like drone regions because of this while others dont different riches same value  uniquenessbut my vision behind diversity is more than isk related looks feels and aswell as station and stargate models i want it all to be unique and special i want people to feel and see the difference between a screenshot of venal and curse diversity and depth is keywhen i first started the game i flew around wanting to see and explore space after a couple of jumps i noticed all the systems pretty much looked the same ive never enjoyed travelling ever since a mission runner in high security can make some serious isk without ever risking himself to other players in 00 you risk your life and ship to reap the benefitsin empire space one can get 4050m per hour without risking your 100m isk ship in 00 space one can get 3040m per hour by risking your 100m isk shipthe point is not really about i want to fight it is to make it more inline with 00there are many different ways to achieve the same thing i want it achieved how it will be achieved depends on ccp with csm influence aswell as you the voters dependent on who you vote on eg 1 do not remove all level 4 from high security only the once with quality 0 and upwards and spread level 4 agents equally around their respective region in some systems you can run 4 level 4 agents at the same time that can be changed note high security onlyeg 2 keep the level 4 agents as is in empire space but increase 00 spawn rate or size to make it greener

i see the official candidate list is finally announced with that i can move forward with my committment to drive the formation of the voice of reason party i will have forums set up by the end of the week and everyone interested in being involved including other candidates are encouraged to register and participatewith all the candidates this stands to be an exciting electionissler
1 interwebcredz she can read a thread folkscan you see it yetmr turrek any idea how many candidates youll make it through or are some of the more minor ones going to be left out unless they ask to be included
id be happy to submit to an interview
drop me a line ingame so we can set up an interview and thanks for running this
during the last csm race there was a csm public channel for candidates and voters to discuss issues about the election i think it worked fairly well so ive started it up again the channel is called csm public and ill be in there a fair bit feel free to jump in hang around and even advertise it a bit also candidates if you want to be channel operators just let me know and ill add you to the list
there was some questionnaire for last csm canditates that had something like 30questionsbut is there currently any easy way to compare current canditates perhaps a some kind of a table or a chart or
you can generally expect some people to ask questions en masse later in the campaign that said if youre not happy with the amount of info feel free to ask more questions of candidates and post the results theres no official media here just interested players a quick chart might be a useful tool though  ask 5 or 10 questions about big topics stick the candidates down the side the questions across the top and let players decide who they like actually this sounds like a fairly cool idea would you mind if i stole it
traditionally csm candidates are to face death itself in the form of a neverending stream of tough challenges by various forumites that most likely have already almost but not entirely made up their minds on who to vote for  and who not to this is a good thing here i goplease comment on every statement or on those you feel like commenting not just how strongly you agree or disagree but also how unimportant you deem the issue of course if you want to elaborate do eve is a massively multiplayer game there might still be some nutjobs playing this solo but ccp should focus on their strengths and not waste time and effort on improving gameplay for this minoritywhen all is said eve is still first and foremost a game as such every interaction should mainly provide fun for the player immersion and continuity are a nice illusion but they should clearly take the back seat to a streamlined gameplaywhile eve currently still has some bugs the game as a whole runs very well indeed sure lag is an issue but thats not going to change as players throw ever greater fleets at every new hardware and net code ccp comes up with instead focus on new stuff to make life in new eden more interesting and attract a steady stream of new players as well as keep the veterans happy roleplayers not just those that pretend they were a piloting a spaceship but those that talk the talk and walk the walk of their chosen roles are an important asset to eve to provide the universe with identity tradition and atmosphere they should be rewarded with gameplay mechanics that improved their ability to roleplayeve is a world of cutthroat competition and thus should reward most those who take the greatest risks and still succeed the current insurance system reduces the cost of losing ships to such a degree that the risk of combat becomes negligeable for everyone save a noob in her first battlecruiser this is absurd and needs to be fixed he who loses ships more should pay more for insurance making business sustainable for insurers oh and possibly improve ships the longer they stay in active serviceccp has pandered enough to the noob audience lately  it is time they get their sights back on the vets among us playing the endgame they are the one who create the great stories of eve that are so unique to this game and that will inspire the next generation of playerseven once wis comes to pass our ships will still be the main ingame representation for most players and groups there should finally be a way to customize their looks even if just with the choice of a paintjob template and a couple of colours this will not be a cause for lag as has been shown and players will be able to switch display off clientside since everything is random in eve every solar system tends to look and feel generic and almost the same exploration actually acerbated this it is time to amend this give regions constellations systems and planets some individual flavor maybe just actually fill those info tabs with some interesting background or better make them differ from another in a way that actually has an impact on gameplay npc corporations are an awful nuisance to all but a few they are a safe haven for gold farmers and griefers in empire introduce a rule that prevents players to stay in or return to npc corps indefinitely maybe after 5 or 10m skill points new eden is populated by trillions of npcs ccp should quit hinding them on planets but make them visible and useful npc traffic in population centres more and more varied interaction with npc corps and more importantly planetary supply and demand in trade goods would all be nice eve is a sand box not a theme park we dont want to be told stories but write them ourselves ccp should just hand us the sand and and the toolsmore to come
i have to be at work in a few minutes but rest assured i will be responding to this at the first opportunity back from work on with the survey1 i disagree ive spent some time in npc corps and they are populated not only with people who have just started the game but people who for one reason or another choose to play largely by themselves many of these people are industrial geniuses who frankly sustain the highdemand lowcost market of tech 1 ships modules and rigs they keep our markets going furthermore you could consider mission runners like myself to be largely solo players i will engage in group pvp and mining operations and will support my corp but most of my time in eve is spent by myself doing my own thing level 4 mission runners represent a very large portion of the isk flow in the game and alienating them would completely trash the ingame economy2 i think the question was poorly worded immersion and continuity assist in making the game fun for me thus improvements in these places help me to enjoy the game more however i agree with the sentiment that its a game and if youre not having fun you shouldnt be playing it3 i primarily agree operational optimization is obviously a priority because nobody would care if they introduced 20 new kinds of ships if nobody could log on to use them however new features are more interesting and make me want to play more than btw we upgraded our blade servers our networks can now channel the consciousness of the entire population of earth4 on the whole i agree the amount that i roleplay varies wildly with my ingame activities for diplomatic relations and recruiting i can get very into it in missions and mining however the mathwars aspect of eve takes over the immersion is lost and as such so is the roleplay i think that roleplay gives a reason to create conflict in eve without forcing conflict as it does in games such as world of warcraft i like that cooperation or conflict is entirely up to the participating parties5 improving ships that remain in active service is something ive mused over in the past but implementation would be tricky what if it changes ownership what if its unpackaged fitted and named but not undocked this would become too much of an experience points system that i think many people come to eve to escape from the insurance system is the saving grace of many newbs and does not really handicap immersion in my opinion variable rates based on pilot ship losses is possible but only if the current insurance system were also modified to account for tech ii losses assigning an average market value at the time of insurance something like that6 the deeper i get into this survey the more militant these opinions seem there is no endgame in eve thats part of the beauty of it there are plenty of veteran players who choose to spend their time in empire7 i think the system is fine the way it is there are plenty of avenues in eve for selfexpression you want new colors buy tech 28 indepth info tabs would be interesting but i find this to be hardly critical the sameness of systems is broken up by the star color background nebulas and racial constructs which is sufficient for me9 incredibly militant statement npc corps are also a haven for people who wish to escape wardecs and game politics taking them away would create more problems among the playerbase than it would solve10 i agree more npcs than the occasionally caravan fleet and racial police forcesconcord would add to immersion better supplydemand mechanics would boost trade11 i was under the impression we have the sand and the tools some people just forget that you need to get the sand wet to sculpt it into anything
1 disagree because of how strongly you phrased it eve is primarily multiplayer but we shouldnt freeze out the solo players id like to see at least half of all new content be at least somewhat soloable this is a fairly important issue 2 agree fully storyline is important but its secondary this is a very important issue3 in terms of performance agreed theres a pile of implementation issues of other types but game performance is relatively good and i trust ccp to improve it at every opportunity it cant be neglected going forward but its not something that the csm needs to push for this is a very important issue 4 mostly agreed while i find it kind of crazy its a legitimate gameplay style and a decently popular one it should be supported well though not at the cost of gameplay mechanics being implemented properly this is a fairly important issue 5 mostly disagree you need to be careful playing with insurance because its disaster relief if you lose your ship worth everything you at least have the cash to buy the next grade down of shipa bc to replace your bs and grind back up this is a case where gameplay trumps storyline i think id be fine with many changes to insurance  making it marketbased instead of base pricebased for example  but i think this goes too far this is a fairly important issue 6 disagree entirely this years noobs are next years vetsor this years vets given the prevalence of alting and keeping a steady flow of players into the game is essential to the longterm health of eve besides its not like t3 cruisers are newbie material this is a very important issue 7 agree slightly itd be nice that said ill take ccps word on lagginess over the forum communitys and there are also concerns over dev time that relegate this to the back burner also you lose the ability to tell t2faction variants apart at a glance this is an unimportant issue 8 agree somewhat again itd be nice but this sounds like a monumental amount of work for what is at root just a flavour issue i dont imagine the manyears necessary could be justified this is an unimportant issue 9 disagree entirely npc corps serve valuable roles both for allowing solo play among those who dont want the hassles of a player corp and for allowing vets to coach new players in a fairly casual environment yeah they can be abused but the benefits outweigh the drawbacks this is a fairly important issue 10 agree low priority but itd be nice to have civilian traffic kicking around instead of just interactable ships and a more natural structure for npc good trading would be useful too low priority but a bit of effort here would be useful i think this is a fairly unimportant issue 11 i suppose i agree but thats too vague a statement to really take a strong stand on it yeah this isnt a game with a railroad plot but there has to be some structure its about drawing the line between dev stuff and player stuff in the right place and the right place isnt covered by a neat little slogan this is a fairly important issue
although ive never really spent much time in lowsec never could master the concept of gate guns lol i certainly understand the griefing mentality for me killing belt miners and ratters has always been an extremely fun past time i love the roaming gang and fully understand that carebear tears taste wonderful my favorite kills of all time arent the titans or the motherships its the orcas rorquals jump freighters faction fit marauders and navy ravensjust because my sec status is 50 doesnt mean that i dont like to grief it just means i do it in a different neighborhood p

i too feel that drones are due some love they are a vital combat tool for almmost all gallente pilots if not all the other races they could use some spit and polish to make them a more usefull tool once again
im your candidate im a hardcore gallente with over 42 million skillpoints trust me ive used drones every once in a whilei believe that drones in general require a revamp including a better ui although ive experienced the previous iteration of the drone ui and i can tell you that the current one is much improved and more intelligent recovery methods of course if you automatically retrieved drones when you warped or automatically reactivated them if you jumped back within range of them that could be easily exploited into more ohnoes overpowered gallente pvp but having the option for the system to automatically issue a recall order to drones whenever the warp drive is engaged that seems like a viable solution to me sure it wont work 100 of the time but it means that you wont lose all your drones every disco ive felt the pain of being in a large room with 5 ogre iis deployed only to have the power fluxuate in my home and returning just in time to see those same drones die horriblyvote garthran he feels your pain in the matters of drones
no no im your candidate as im a hardcore gallente with over 43 million skillpoints seriously though drones are considerably better than they ever used to be but there is certainly some room for improvement the main thing is and here i agree with garthan that the recovery method needs looking at in regards to emergency warps additionally id like someone to finally find a way to stop them humping each other the recent change to the drone range scoop to 2500m rather than the 1500m that is was previously has certainly helped some of the problems i used to have especially with warrior iis where they simply wouldnt return to my drone bay and just pingponged across my screen until i shot them in frustration this has also helped when deploying sentries from the moros so in summation vote for me because ummm i have 1m more sp than garthan and therefore feel you pain 1m sp more

i have been disagreeing with ccp on this since the roundtables at the 2006 fanfest where they first pitched their concepts since then i have put forward proposals to the csm on alliance inclusion options which have been accepted for submission voted on by the csm and passed to ccp i would like to see ccp finally show some willing to resolve this pointi play eve for the rp and for the community i dont care about your wormholes i havent even tried to scan one of the things down yet i also have little interest in t3 or most of the content released in the last couple of expansions to be quite honest fw in its current form splits the player base with arbitrary and absolute barriers between player interactionresolve your promise ccp we have waited long enough for you to think about it

thank you for pointing out a problem with the wreckloot mechanics clearly npc wrecks should belong the the npcsoh im sorry did you have a different point
there should be risk in everything even minimal what risks are there in looting other peoples wrecks while in a npc corp getting suicide ganked100 support
yeah  youre a douche bag 
whoo i just won 5 isk of a corpmate i was sure that you wouldnt have a polite logical response thank you
what do you expect when you troll  ill give you 5 isk to go away btw  thanks for the bumps  it warms my heart to see my post on the front page
and yet no progress on this subject so far
100 support on this onei or we was the one who waited for the wt to undocki or we was the one who shot the mofo after he agressedi or we are the one who must pay for the damage to our shipsgranted we can do level 4 missions to get the money but after you have done 200 well after you have done that many come back and tell me you want to do anotheronce youve takin out the wts capablitys to fight back so you can safely clear up the wrecks you find that before you even looked at the wreck its gone and salvagedwe have all see the speed at which this can be done at 44 in jita navy in dodixie or btt in rens even efa in amarr
so many replies so few good arguments against this changeflagging the thief only to the corp of the ship that was destroyed is generally pointless that guy just had his ship blown up if he is lucky he is in a nearby station building another if not he just woke up in a clone far far away his alliance mates are probably fighting for their lives while his ship is being looted that means that as the game mechanic stands there is no risk to the thief flagging noob alts in npc corps will not stop loot theft any more than flagging can flippers does what it will do is force the thieves to watch what is going on a bit closer when they do make a mistake they will have their rookie ships destroyed since they are not really losing anything the risk vs rewards is still very lowi would go a little bit further than what the op has proposed i would like to see the loot thief flagged to both alliances and have his docking rights suspended for a short time just as if he had fired on someone this does not stop people from looting but it would provide a reasonable amount of risk for the potential gain maybe we would even see professional loot thieves flying well tanked ships i am not against the idea of loot theft just loot theft without risk support
vukim in perfect agreement with the part on motherships without a dedicated role for the shiptype the use of them is neither warranted nor practicaltitans the more that show up in game and the longer the debate continues i find myself wondering on whether they really are so bad or whether the bulk of the negativity comes from historic drama and damage especially since the majority of titan pilots go awol once they finish building the ship or finishing the isk race to buy it  i agree that for the class of ships they are they are very close to glass cannons then again  considering their intended purpose that does fit with risk versus reward if you want to take a big huge shot at a fleet you have to accept that if you take that shot you have to prep it as best as possible  or loose the ship in around 3040 seconds the doomsday itself has not been the magic red button in 00 for a long long time now in spite of there being a lot more titans now then ever before thing is that making sure a dd is effective takes quite a bit of preparation and some very solid teamwork without that it is merely a psychological deterrant something which any pro team can easily shake off andor work aroundat the same time it is amazingly easy to avoid a dd as long as the fleet is on the ball and is working together smoothly only the best possible baiting and trapping can really make a dd effective and given how much work and still  risk goes into that it strikes me as not being out of the ordinary for risk versus rewardive flown titans ive been in fleets getting titans thrown at them like silly ive been in fleets that killed titans ive been in lets sit and eat up dd so we can see if we can trap titan situations aside of the notion that a ship of such a size should be a monster in terms of hitpoints i cant say its been much drama back in the days of remote doomsdays  now that was something else p00 and all its toys are part of what ccp describes as endgame content a level where the rewards can be huge where the teamwork goes above all and where the risks reflect both the potential in reward and the intrinsic requirement of teamwork even the idea of losing an entire fleet in a minute does not strike me as being out of place considering the rewards and teamwork elements  if organisations are smart  provide for ample means and opportunity to replace that fleet both in terms of isk and assets typically within minuteswhat i do think is that here is perhaps a niche found for the logistical element of supplies and replacements in the light of supercapitals then again considering how hard it is to really wipe out a fleet maybe noteither way i am sure it is all a matter of perception and personal experience given how this week alone quite a number of titans and motherships went down contrasting sharply with the related subcapital losses perhaps we are making too much of the issuestill there is one thing which really nags me in the back of my mind which is the most sensible approach on addressing the topic of the doomsday itself the chanceheatmoduledamage suggestion that was provided while it did at first strike me as a very common sense idea it is also pretty visible that it has zero consideration for the really fundamental problem which lies at the basis of all this  human behaviourreduce the effectiveness of something which still carries more weight then anything else and human beings  overcompensate by bringing more of it and then doing it again with again more of the sameuntil some concept is put together which takes titans out of that negative spiral of human sheep behaviour no sensible solution will be found and that leaves at best only room for kneejerking type of fixes eve has had its share of those 
few others also started the same topic
to counter that there was an added 20sec warp scramble which affects the titan too yes more people will bring titans but that means more titans are exposed the problem atm is exposure levels and the risk of said exposure i say bring it on
1000 yes
yes a list i still want the four hour rule though or maybe something else to replace it but dont add all the missions to the list just a random selection of 34 missions and you can refresh the list every four hours maybe increase the timeras for the rest um yes sure most of itsupported
i endorse the useimplementation of this product andor service
i thought you already lost standings if you failed the mission or something
this ship sucksfix itsigned
i was going to reply to someone here to bump the thread but figured shamelessly bumping it would be a better idea anyway plus effort
this idea still makes sense
is posting good ideas part of some lame propaganda campaign to win a trip to iceland 
common sense really ccp
good thing to know that ccp devs are already on itbut its a good thing to remind them that we are still waiting for this featuresupported
good idea but i dont want to be constantly reminded every day that ive got x many days left before i have to pay ccp againso it would have to be an optional feature  something you could disable from the esc menu so it wont appear next time you log inedit forgot to support it
yes i support this feature either this or mediumlarge tractor beams makes little or no difference to me could even be both
it would be nice but you could have a similiar skill for salvaging one that will give 5 to your range would also be nice
now theres a good idea i support this as well
standings is a lower level of trust then assets when youre a large alliance and you have to set a load of standings and you just need someone on at any given moment able to do it
good idea
the corp interface is in dire need of some help and this is a baby step in the right direction
why there is no true armor tanking missile battleship currently so it wouldnt be overshadowing anything else and it would bring something unique to the table and khanid ships are gorgeous something like this857 bonuses  5 siege launcher rof and 10 armor hp per level of amarr battleshipis this prioritary of course not but it would be a nice thing to have at some point down the road 
if they ever implement a third t2 battleship i assume itll be khanid since carthum and viziam have theirs already that said dont expect it at t1  missiles as primary weapons in ships other than half the caldari and a third of the minmatar is a thing of t2 ships not t1
or it could be introduced as a new faction battleship i remember greyscale talking about adding the khanid arbitrator as faction cruiser this was a while ago but that never happened
oh yes sweet idea
i would love to see a t2 abaddon we already have t2 geddon and a t2 apoc why not a t2 abaddonwhat would we call the t2 abaddon if it ever comes out thoughsigned
khanid ships rock i dont fly battleships but i totally support this
very ditto id love to see this but admittedly its pretty lowpriority
would have to be a faction ship or a teir 4 bs never going to get ccp to give a t2 khanid bs

hi
best idea ive seen so far in regards to balancing the wardec mechanics i support this
citadels velocity is getting a boost no change in explosion velocity though
both of these make sense to me
in the chat box we have an option to show text only why not take this to the channels too
yup
indeed
yes ill agree that not having the small portrait square taking up all that useless space in the local list would be very niceespecially considering that i have chosen to not have portraits captured when rightclicking even though it continually does that anyway
definitely yes
i 3 my potato do not change plz kthnxbai
its a loveable kind of ugly no change needed
so sorry to have offended you with my opinionplease could you tell me what i am allowed to post in each forum thread because obviously what is listed by ccp is not as specific as to your criteriamaybe ccp will put a sticky on what you think should be allowed
for someone who is so good at trolling you sure have a nasty habit of not reading the rest of the posts madeotherwise youd see i retracted my position even though i still think its a whine post
it should be flouro yellow with hot pink hilights
now thats a brilliant idea
it may be hard to believe but miners mine ore because they need the minerals for production or isk also if you setup a bait you do it because you know there are targets roaming around who notice it and i dont know about you but a mining op running while hostile are around would look very suspitious for mealso with the barges having a paper tank how could you possibly defend agains a hit and run attack bombstorp alphastrike that takes ony a few seconds to execute with the attackers having plenty of time to set it up without having a logistics or other ship permarepping the bargesthe gatecams are being setup in systems with high trafic and good chance of getting targets just a detail you forgot to mention
youre missing the whole point it still adds risk because you dont know that your target is alone whether or not he is actually alone is absolutely not the pointi think a local channel that tells you who is in your system without fail is the absolute stupidest idea ever pilot 1 ive felt a disturbance in the force its as if a dozen ships jumped into my system at once and then were suddenly a threat to mepilot b yeah thats just local better dock
sarcasm what but i like looking at all my pwnage lvl 5 skills sarcasm offok less humor more serious yes please doesnt cause any problem doesnt imbalance anything and its seems helpfulsigned
nice idea
im in favor of this btw ive never fallen for a scam myself but it doesnt just affect traders and it most certainly doesnt just affect local i had a look on navy issue ravens yesterday and there where about 100 no im not being funny wtb raven contracts priced at 1  1mil isk ive read somewhere that the contracts system takes a heavy toll on the servers and im sure 100 bogus contracts does not help let alone all the poor sods having to filter through all those lame scam attemptssigned with paw
the channel spam needs to be stoped
hellothose who are familiar with the banks in eve know that they offer loans for collateral now the collateral is contracted and sometimes i have multiple items by multiple clients in the same station and i need to find the correct items for the correct customer wouldnt it be easier if finished item exchange contracts would have a revert this contract option where the person who accepted in this case the bank could pick the items that were contracted to it automatically and change a few parameters onlyi know there is the loan option already implemented but with a limit of 365 days and the fact that i cannot create the loan for the customer to accept but the customer has to create the loan just tedious in explaining over and over again is not suited for what i am looking forits only a minor change and i hope there will be a few people who would support thisthankssentry
alternatively make it possible for me to create the loan contract for the customer and allow an infinite loan duration for the loan contract
not sure about infinite but multiple years isnt a bad idea
i would support it if the loan just had a nonexpiry time make it so i as the corporation can loan out equipment to my corp members for an indeterminate amount of timeseems simple enough and i dont know why they made loaning via contracts limited in this way
these sound like perfectly reasonable changes id prefer the unlimited duration and having lenders be able to make loan contracts but reverting should work as well supported
hmm im curious myself why loans are restrictedbut then again 1 year is a fairly long time support for the topic but i doubt its a highpriority need for eve onlineisaac
i now have about 2 years of skills i have no current use of and havent for the same amount of time but its handy to still have them in case i ever need to use them againalso do you really want ccp being inundated with even more unneccessary petitions along the lines of i accidently deleted a skill  my friend deleted my skill when i was afk  i had my account hacked and all my skills deleted etcthe idea of accidently deleting my skills is horriblethe other part of your proposal to give sp to any other skills you choose from the stock of sps you gained by dissolving unused ones is nice i admit but not practicali could kill my amarr battleship 5 skill and remap it to another race like gallente in order to fly their capital ships and if you did the same with the gun skills etc you could hotswap skill levels whenever you felt like it it would mean a pvper would only ever need to train a quarter of the games skills then switch out to whatever they want for that particular day month year assuming you would put a time limit on how often you want to do itits not a terrible idea its just impractical and ccp have partially solved it with the neural remap function already
just to be clear as csm you would support fotm skillpoint reallocationsome setup gets nerfed no problem just reassign all your skills to the new great big thingis that your position
not supporting this one i sounds a good idea but dont think this will be used that much for beginners who have mistrained in the beginning perhaps older players will easily use this to remove a skill from something they dont use anymore so they can learn to fly something else way faster if this would be implemented than a proper set of rules should be implemented suppose i cant fly a bs but have lots of mining skills so i remove them so i can fly a bs after i have done some mission i remove the bs skills and train some mining skills this is not how the game works beginners will perhaps loose 2 or 3 weeks of training witch is really not that long
it is the year 3000 and what not dunno rly and we dont have an incoming hostiles warning system very much supported and for all you nerf local band wagon buddies why dont we remove lowsec and make mission runninghighsec mining the only viable income source in the game while were at itno thanks wow is that way
the part of this that i dont get is why people like to assume every ship has a im hostile broadcast beacon attached to it yes a ship should be able to detect the type of ships in the nearby area of space no a ship shouldnt automatically detect who is flying the ship and whether or not they are hostile
i like the idea of a changing world imho eve is still way to static and could read should be more dynamicplanets and moons dont orbit security status never changes this could use some improvement so i support point 1but the other points the need to be revisedlolmoodi smell a one man corp with 50 accounts in cloaked covert ops running 237 snagging away 00 spacelolmoodone final remark this would have a serious impact on the way eve online runs i doubt that for the moment it is even possible to implement this into eve
im not talking about instantly changing sec status im talking about sec status rising much at the rate corp standings do over a period of time to match the level of population this is to help prevent parking accounts to raise sec levelin empire that will preserve some hi sec areas for the players there in 00 as is currently it will create a hi sec system where an alliancecorp bases itselfeverything else will generally be in a state of flux
people base on the edges of highsec you would have a lot of people suddenly undocking in their expensive crap and dying because they dont know the new sec status systemwhich i think is totally awesome purely for greif purposes i just dont think ccp would go with it
reread my post very slowlyi didnt give a measurement of time if i had i would have said so2000 pilots squatting in a system for a day or 2 is just as easy as them rolling through townthis mechanic will either be abused or painfully slow
i suggest you reread my post very slowlyi do give an indication of time i give the comparison to corp standings yes very slow to help prevent exactly what you describe have you any alternative ideas to offer
it wouldnt be as sudden as that sec would creep up and creep down over a period of daysweeks
yes but one day after downtime some 5 system somewhere will all of a sudden become 4 and people too scared to undock in lowsec will be trappedalso if a 4 turns into a 5 outlaws really will be trapped
true how about this thenin a 5 system about to turn on the next dt a trend arrow is displayed on the system sec rating info top left of screen
people dont log in every single day especially casual players in empire also if youre in a station no sec rating shows unless you go through several menu items to look up your system
come on think outside the box for a moment its quite safeccp have stated they are looking for big ideas from the csm not tweak this not tweak that big ideas that alter lots of stuff about the gamedont make the mistake of smothering any potentially exciting change in the cloying material of current ui or minutia its ccps responsibility to resolve those problems not that of the playerbaseif the ui had a big unmissable box right in the centre of the screen displaying the sec rating with massive flashing neon arrows showing change direction and the change was so gradual and slow it took more than a day would you then be happy actually dont answer that it doesnt matterwhat do you people in general think of the overall concept
as much as i hate to admit this i agree with miss alt postss alotthe idea sucks and it would mess up the mechanic something fiercebut your not open to arguments your too busy pushing your idea
no as much as i would like to see a more dynamic eve online your idea is open to abuse and overall a bad idea not much to sayisaac
make market  corporation orders sortable by wallet division
yeah a wallet column would be nice  personal1234567 would make sorting easy
i think the entire corporation gui needs a relookredone not a bad idea though to addisaac
take the isk vote for someone else it isnt hard  meaning pretend you voted for him
theres no way to prove you voted for someonealso buying votes is awesome and i think its completely within the spirit of eve that guy just doesnt know how to do it properly
do you honestly think that a person like thatwho was an alt on csm1 mind you would get oni think it would be awful if it made him get on the csm yet it would speak volumes about the community sadly
scamming the scammerbest idea yet
give me 1 billion isk and ill vote for you
rent from pl space and get free rent if you vote for me
1 billion isk is worth more to us atm
thankyou for the link i will im sure like many others who didnt know about this be contacting and voting for bruceeve has allways prided itself on being open and real well for a game where your immortal and fly spaceships this is very similiar to the way democracy in the real world works also as much as ccp have said such acts arent condoned they have not ruled them illegal and something can and should be read into that my two penneth
im not worried about this  chip mintago xavier hayes and anyone else throwing around money like its going out of style are just going to succeed in making themselves poorer this is why secret ballots exist at least xavier is being somewhat smart about it not giving away anything if he doesnt win i remember being worried about this sort of thing when the csm project first started but i was wrong  its just not an issue
lol this is not a problem for csm to deal with btw dude politicians use bribing every election they promise a lot and give back very very little no support ccp doesnt have anything to change just dont vote for the dudesisaac
im accepting bribes for votes
lol why are you guys so afraid of having your free cards to grief nerfed a bit wars arent and never where meant to be random griefing licenses they where meant as a way to take down highsec poss fight over territory settle a disagreement or disrupt a 00 alliances supply lines by denying them access to trade hubsthere ought to be objectives to a war and a way to declare a victor and if you declare a war without engaging there ought to be some form of punishment for it because yes as long as wars have been around this has been the case if you start a war you better make damn sure you finish it because you can run but you cant hide from the people youve upsetall though im not sure this is the way to go about it ive not seen any better suggestions so farthus this gets my support
agreedgriefers always accuse carebears of whining but if anyone suggest cutting down on their lollipop allotment a little they howl like toddlers
well yes i do look at the contracts ive never gotten scammed myself but thats the problem my eyes are bleeding from looking at the bloody contracts
very simply suggestion make all one sized modules sized and balance them too their size and fitting requirementssized should be as normal small medlarge and capital sizedthis should be applied to every one sized module in the game
supporting my own thread
what the blithering heck are you getting at nowbecause if it is what i think it is your saying then hell no
i dont think this makes much sense not only is there no need for it but it would cause ccp some extensive time spent rebalancing each module and then theyd have to rebalance each ships cpu and powergrid to probably wind up close to how the game is todaysorry crest
i cant even tell what youre asking for but anything i can think of that sounds even close seems like a profoundly bad idea
he wants there to be a s m and l version of all modules in the game aside from some rolesepcific ones like interdiction sphere launchers and siege modulesso basically youd have a coprocessor l that would have different powergrid and cpu requirements than a coprocessor s which would be intended for a frigate rather than a battleshipatleast thats my understanding i dont see how it would work though or what it would improve
nice guess but i still have no bloody idea why or whati was thinking he was trying to scrap the high slot mid slot and low slotsomehow i dont think english is his primary language either just observing not trolling here
well that does seem to fit with the op its a hilariously bad idea that completely misses the point but i suppose thats no surprise in a crest thread
fully support shame the thukkers are no longer a real pirate faction or i would have flown for them in a pirate fw 
the thukkers would be a sweet faction regardless hehe
one way too solve this is too give the mission runner a key card that activates the first gate in the deadspace pocket that is then returned too the agent when the mission is completedsimple elegant and the scavengers can still scavenge after the missions runner finishes the mission and leaves the wrecks behind
x the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because i support ccps current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecksseriously how many mission runners spend the time salvaging wrecks anyway wrecks arent owned as such and the mission runner always has the option to start destroying the wrecks when a salvager turns upthe ninja salvagers need good skills to probe out mission deadspace if it bothered a missionrunner too much that mission runner could ask them to stop offering them an alternative if they continuedif you get my pointif you really wanted to salvage and do missions fit a decent ship that will allow you to do both at the same time salvagers have a hard job clearing nonexistant wrecks

im in pl leadership ill confirm that im a girl pcheck out this link it has a lot of my campaign infopandemiclegioncomforumsforumdisplayphpf91because ccp cant figure out
interesting and very quotable reallyankhesentapemkahs repeated raising of the skill queue issue resulted in the implementation of a queue in the recent apocrypha expansion suicide ganking was made more balanced without completely removing the practice battleshipsized rats were added to lowsecurity and 00 game mechanics will be the major focus for eves next expansion many smaller issues have been brought to ccps attention and will be worked on in the future such as factional warfare and the problems and repetition related to mining and missionsis it your contention that ank alone made ccp implement changes and features as you list above you seem to suggest that the countless players and threads on issues and the other csm members that supported and voted for an issue were irrelevant in the whole process its pretty relevant to your campaign as this is what you base your proven track record upon
sounds like a good candidate he gets my vote
tips hat
me personally id have a harder time voting for someone who took the game so seriously that they couldnt separate their real life from this digital fantasy landit is all imaginary and pretend after all but someone who cant distinguish the two in my opinion is probably more disturbed and untrustworthy than a player who is mature and capable of keeping his video game life separate from his real lifethat of course is just my opinion but then again i dont expect any character to be even close to their real selves girls to guys guys to girls s to preachers pirates to hard working goodhearted fathers nice miners to insane criminalsthe moment you step on the internet you start playing pretend some of us can simply take it farther than others
i kind of agree with that but telling everyone that in real life youre a 14yearol girl who still goes to school when youre actually an older guy theres something weird about that i dont think either this person is fit for csm and may have some issues
id love to see where that was said by cat would be hilarious hahaha got a link
larkonis ftw
larky we got ur back and our vote you not some  who sits in one system and call them self good lol what q joke they were and still are its kinda fun you talk so much smack united yet you never really leave ur little hole its cute even when i was blue with you guys at one time i thought you guys were ing ed empire space  you call urselfs so great yet ur sill in empire ahahahaahahhah you no better that a npc plz mate i owned plenty of ur corp mates and if i come back ill personally knock you on ur butt any way you guys are no better than comander preditor lol what a joke untied has become
larkonis you are a fine pirate and a fine leader you are fierce strong brave risky and shaken by nothing but this is not why these people are choosing you they are chosing you because they want someone new they want a person who will actually represent a large portion of the eve population the 00 guys care only for their own alliance and alliance battles how to make pos killing more fun or how borders can be better kept they do not understand that there is more to eve than just 00 life as for the carebears they are worse they only think of those in high sec space due to the fact they have no idea what life is like in the areas of low sec they only think of economy and industry when they think of eve they see isk rolling into their laps we do not have that luxury when we think about eve we think about ship modifications strategies diplomatics terriotorial gains camping and more i cannot even hope to think of we think of harsh and ruthless combat we are the ones that are truly free or we should be but by letting people ignore us and by letting them believe oh its just pirate scum we never get the respect we deserve by electing canadites such as finnegan who is anks favorite puppet if not alt nothing will change by electing mazzilliu we let those in 00 run our eve lives i for one am sick of itthe 00 alliances think we are pests and the carebears are scared of us and shut us out we dont have a voice but not any longer not if we elect larkonis if we elect someone who actually knows one of the greatest sides to eve he will give us our voice he will speak up for us though i barely know the man i do know through fighting him and fighting alongside him in a war against a moltov invasion that he is a man of determination and will not let up to anyone or anything so finally after ranting i throw my undeniable support to larkonis trassler and as with exodus i agree we have your back as pirating rum swilling wench defiling renegades we support you good luck
so as i did my application while being drunk i didnt believe that ccp would accept it but somehow it slipped through the cracks i will be taking this seriously now a relook at minmatar bses revamp of bounty system i would like to see the ability place a bounty on a person and any person can accept the contract and the person who has the bounty can attack you and you attack them in any security status like a mini war dec limit it to 3 people more control options for drones make the corp roles and titles controls a little more user friendly i want to see in ambulation the ability to get drunk and it having negative affects on you for a period of time kill mails when the opposing ship self destructs because sucks when a leviathan starts self destructing when it touched armor im open to all ideas and usually just lurk the forums because posting on eveo forums looks iffy i usually post on battle clinic i will be checking the forums daily in the morning and after work because my job blocks the eve online site post any questionsflamesideas in this threadthank you and have a good day
support this o les u got my vote
vote o great person will do perfect make us proud
les bains for csmcalamos votes for les
your vote matters
great idea as long as the wanted sign and the showing of the bounty remain
my vote
great guy would be a great addition to csm
would make bounty hunting a viable profession which i believe many players would love and loathe
bounty issue has been raised in the first csm and given high priority by the csm by diedre vaal with help from arithron documentation is available in minutes
votegl les 
it is indeed likely that minor candidates will be left out i had previously been using omber zombies thread at the top of this forum for the list of names i checked the official list today to find it contains 40 names i have 7 returned interviews in my inbox or already posted ill be working on sending more evemails tommorrow nightmorning ill post for each person that returns me answers im very glad i settled on a form layout given the total number of people involved
csm 20 will be meeting with ccp for the last time of our term in a couple of weeks we have a list of issue we need to prioritize so we thought wed give everyone a chance to help in that prioritization if you head over here you will find a google spreadsheet which you can editbasically you get to number issue 1 to 16 1 is the most important 16 is the least important once everyone has finished editing the page we look at the final figures and from lowest to highest we rank the issues for discussion why are we prioritizingwe have a time limit for the meeting so the idea is to get the most important issues discussed first some take a long time others not so long but this way we are making sure the really really important things get discussedwhat to editin the bit which says name you can put your name then in the boxes below that you can enter in your numbers 1 to 16 theres a total number of points spent at the bottom of each column to let you know how many more points you have left to allocateif we run out of name columns ill add morethe spreadsheet will be locked at 1600 on the 30th so try and allocate points by then the final points will be tallied and added to our own priority systemcheerscsm 20

bah i was just doing that cheers mate
i dont remember the csm voting to do it this way tries to find this in any meeting minutes but no worries the pilots of eve have every right to have direct involvementissler
read your email 
umm hide station environment and restore old graphic options are the same thing we might want to reduce the categories to 15 if its not too late otherwise good list
they are 2 separate things and were voted for separately
sorry there is no ad hoc vote via email process business is conducted at official meetingsissler
then your processes suck a vote is a vote and being able to have a vote without the need for a meeting in real time is a rather useful thing when you have reps scattered around the world i cant speak to formal csm processes because so far as i can tell you dont have any but if an email vote isnt good enough i suggest you make it good enoughseriously how has this body managed to go a full year and two councils without ever sticking in a sentence about roberts rules of order to make everything actually function itd be one thing if you worked everything by consensus but you dont  a full year later and people are still carping about what votes count whether you can abstain and other trivial nonsense that should have been dealt with in the first minute of the first meeting a year ago absolutely unbelievable
again read your email
1 solo play i dissagree solo play is important as well remember the actions of a single player can have effect on a larger number of players2 importants of immersion immersion and continuity are very important for a segment of players in eve they need to be always considered by ccp when changes in eve are introduced3 bug fixing verses features defects in eve can seriously reduce the enjoyment of the game stability isses can drive people out of the game lag has made some promises of eve never materialized huge fleet battles quality has to remain a focus for eve even if it delays the introduction of new features also new features should be tested until they are stable enough to really be enjoyed4 encouraging rp with game mechanics i love roleplayers i wish i encountered them more often i would support elements in eve that encourage role playing particularly in the area of player choices for example making some choices more rewarding when they are consistent with the backstory of the races npc corporations and factions in eve5 insurance not consistent with riskreward i agree insurance needs to be reviewed i recently finished a war where ship losses of some classes of ships were not considered an issue which resulted in some tactics i would have described as careless6 new player focus eve is hard and that is one of the things i love about it i would like to see more focus put on the middle of eve that i think represent the most players very few pilots ever really get to experience the end game so i would be cautious about that being a primary focus for new experiences7 ship customization it is embarassing to me that there are still no options to customize ships there are technical solutions that would go a long way towards allowing players to make their ships unique without introducing lag i think it is time ccp made this happen8 adding variations in systems and exploration encouragement systems need to become more unique again this is embarrasing for eve to have the same skybox everywhere with just a basic color change exploration also needs to be made interesting eve should make you want to see every system sometime in your life9 npc corps as safe havens i would support looking at ways to get people out of npc corporations in particular i think you could make it that parts of eve are not available to you if you have achieved some level of experience and are in one of these corporations either that or make a new class of npc corps that can be involved in wars in some manner npc corps should have more downside than they currently do 10 evolving npc interactions a long time back there was a reason to hunt the convoys that still can be seen near stations i like the idea of introducing more sophisticated interactions with the npcs we currently dont see for example opportunities to affect markets with actions against trade vessels or changing systems politics and affiliations with enough player actions11 player generated story lines there is no doubt that player generated content is the future of mmorpgs eve needs to tap the incredible creativity of the player basei hope these answers give folks voting a better idea of what i think and what the player base can expect if i am elected again the csmissler dainzefounder of the voice of reason party in eveceo tadakastu obata corporationfounder of the honda accordcsm ii member
1 while mmos are always about group play there will always be people who wish to do things on their own ideally it is best to develop content for both rather then 1 or the other if this balance can be achieved then nothing can stand in your way2 why cant we have both immersion and streamlined gameplay with enough creativity in both areass quality in both can be achieved3 so far i feel ccp has done a good job of fixing bugs as well as always bringing out new content new content is a must but at the same time bugs cannot be ignored while some bugs are difficult to hammer out and sometimes take along period of time they are still worked on ideally a team working on bugs throughout development would help clear them faster but that is not always feasible a good option is to prioritize bugs in a fashion that ones affecting the player base the most would be dealt with and all the while new content being developed a stronger quality assurance testing is also a good way to eliminate bugs before deployment4 i definetly think a more active reward system be implemented for roleplayers having done some rp before in other games it definetly increases the emersion of the game its not always felt welcome in some aspects of eve but none the less it is still done and cudos to those who keep it alive 5 i am not sure on this one insurance in most cases covers the cost of the ship itself in a tech 1 standpoint and not the modules in tech2 ships its totally worthless as it doesnt cover the cost of the ship while the insurance payout is nice a lot of the times its not worth while perhaps a system would be implemented to scale the insurance payout depending on premiums similar to auto insurance  6 7 i dont agree on the point of customization for colors id hate to see the hello kitty ravens flying around the universe while peoples sense of humour is sometimes entertaining you know its going to be overdone and eventually make eve look childish and silly instead of the dark gloomy deadly space mmo that we all love 8 we know that the planets are due an overhaul with visuals but step back and take a look at the scope of the universe there are tons of systems in the universe and while some feel generic some are absolutely breathtaking a good medium for making more unique systems might be to generate a randomization protocol that picks and chooses different items and tosses them together creating a more unique feel to future systems9 i agree with this to a certain point some people who play dont feel the need to move on to player corps and you cant blame them but in the end the isk farmers is an issue to be dealt with at some point making people leave the npc corps would be a feasible idea10 you commented on lag earlier in this survey and now you want ccp to toss more ships into space and cause more lag while it would make areas more realistic i dont think this would work out quite well id personally like to see more npcs in wis stations along with more interaction with them which would make things more interesting11 this seems like a good idea but from what i see a lot of alliancesplayers are already doing just this look at goonswarmbob
1 i really dislike need another friend kind of play because in eve it just means you should invest in an alt i want solo play to be doable and team play to be more rewarding important2 eve should be fun entertaining and involving not wait2hourstounanchor gameplay aswell as shoot x at y with z for xzy time very important3 finetuning of gameplay and content should be done but what eve needs the most is more depth and diversity throughout the universe important4 of course they should roleplaying makes content content makes depth depth is key to not get bored somewhat important5 higher insurance for those that die often makes sense but i do not deem this issue very important not very important6 one two word depth and content very important7 this is nice to have but not really important not very important8 depth and content uniqueness and diversity throughout eve amen very important9 i always hate how freighters can roam freely safe from war declearations i guess this could apply to high skillpoint players take a look on my thread started about freighters in npc corporations
interesting statements you made here especially considering your name although im not running i would like to put in my 02 isk worth1 its been found that mmos actually sometimes encourage solo play some people want to get their way to the top by their own blood sweat and tears as it is a multiuser game it does not need to be constant interaction you can reward group efforts but dont discount the soloists that grind away to achieve something2 to an extent i agree with this one the fiction sets the tone but theres a reason why roleplayers are somewhat rare explained below3 disagree the smooth gameplay should accompany the new releases if there has to be less new stuff per patch to make for a better gameplay so be it4 there are a few roleplayers out there but not that many the reason for this is simple there is always something more to be doing in the game its a viable alternative already especially with fw for those who roleplay but it should not be treated any different than any other role5 agreed there should be some kind of variable to ship insurance costs such as number of ships lost in the past timespan or security status of said insuree insurance is important to the game but at this rate no insurers would be able to stay in business for more than a day or two6 this is a business and as such the attraction of new clients is as crucial as any other business veterans already get lots of rewards wormholes capital ships etc i think its about time ccp focused on the new player and i commend them for doing so7 paint jobs is one of the issues i fought for during my term as csm delegate personalization should be allowed including storefronts with ambulation but has been given a backseat hopefully this will soon change8 individual flavor is nice but again look at this from a coding perspective coding something relatively simple the ascn titan the monolith the eve gate takes a huge amount of coding time for something that most wont even see during their gametime the skyboxes do need to be redone but other than that i think the game is fine as is9 this idea has been posted many times and shot down each and every time npc corporations provide many reasons for players to find their own niche without hassle ive played the political game and enjoyed sitting in a station while gankers orbit outside in addition if you did put the sp limit how many sps do you think it takes to fly a mackinaw raven industrial etc you would only annoy and alienate what seems to be 13rd of the players of this game10 npc interaction might be fun and has been proposed in the assembly hall the colonization thread but populating space with tons of ships would make systems even more of a lagfest nightmare could you imagine jita with shuttles zipping about in addition to the players theres a reason trade hubs no longer have even asteroid belts11 yes the players should have interaction with the overarcing story but should not write it themselves some prime fiction needs to be handled by developers to avoid contradictions and such i rarely see a day where a player corporationalliance arent in the login screen news and it makes for a good mix if it isnt broke dont fix itthese are just my opinions but as a delegate transparency has been my goal throughout my term of representation who knows maybe even some of these answers might shed light on reasons why the game is as it is for some players overall an interesting and interrogative query
is it just me or do the vast majority of the csm candidates seem too be pushing a pvp everywhere agenda
then vote for someone that doesnt
id like to point out that i dont push a pvp agenda i embrace pvp but its not my primary occupation and therefore not my primary concern
i also dont push a pvp agenda im openminded on issues and will support any issue i believe or am convinced about will enhance the ingame experience for players i wont be supporting facebook crap or the likei also wont be claiming to have personally changed x in eve for players this is just plain dumb and ignores the fact that countless threads were created and commenteddebated on issues by many players before a csm member adopted it some of the changes seen since the implementation of the csm were already being considered and this is clearly evident in the early meeting minutes with ccpill also be calm reasonable and mature in my responses both to players and csm members a professional approach on issues is what youll get from me
the pirate types may be the most vocal but theyre hardly the whole field theres plenty of other options if you look around
this is the truth many of us running for the csm are not doing so to push our own agenda those of us who have looked into what the csm is meant to be about and believe in it are here to help facilitate the communication between the playerbase and ccp if you have an issue or issues you want to raise then do so get in contact with a csm rep or two and ask them to support your thread if they say no then ask them why not bear in mind the number of issues that can be raised is limited so youll need to get some backing from the playerbase as well in order for the topic to be considered csm reps are not here for themselves they shouldnt be here for one group of people either csm reps should be facilitators and analysts
eve is pvp whether it be in ships or in the markets
there havent been much sign of that so far
i host a show on everadio every sunday around 1200  1500 gmti want to extend an open invitation for csm candidates to come on the show for a discussion the plan is to have 3ish candidates on at a time the discussion will go on between 1 and 3 hours depending on availability and how many people sign uppost here or send me an evemail with when you want to come on all discussion will be over skype
would love to but im at work
ditto
im interested but ill have to check my baseball schedule have you given thought to prerecording the discussions

no im spartacuswait wrong memelooks at the 101mil sp in drones he has without fightersdrones what the hell are they yes i use them a lot as youve pointed out the csm has already raised issues and got them green lit from ccp at this point all a candidate can do is bug them until they are actually implemented i know ccp were also looking at using the same reconnection system they have with probes so if you get warped out they reconnect when you warp back in  not sure what happened there ill be happy to crack skulls and ask why it didnt happenthe only other thing i think needs serious attention is the drone interface  it would be nice to know who your drones are shootinwebbingscrambling etc without having to actually target that person first
pss off seriouslymore constuctive comments to follow

100 agree
not keen on this as its a bonus that would basically be useless in 00 plus some people like to fly range fits with mwd
if it affects base agility this would be perfect for abs and mwsjust a suggestion i dont think this issue will gather enough steam to get any real action but its worth the shot
yes
its not yours till you scoop itkillin the enemy is only half the jobno vote to dumbing down pvp
yep ill sign that
i read that but that is not exactly a countermechanism instead it supports the human behaviour twist even reinforces itan fc has 4 titans ready to throw on the field for the usual triple dd  1 standby since they are going to have added time on the field he is going to make sure he not only has a dedicated carrier support group ready but also a second titan group  just to be absolutely sure he can control the field and what comes on it should his targets escape a dd or have a trap ready or even just be quick in replacing ships from a pos he will strive to control the situationergo again we are back to being sheep truth be told dds and titans are not the problem its us flocking them which is the problem if we want to work around that we should look into not making it worth bringing more then a given ratio to a field think of a game design element which kinda works like the nodes in eve when you dd so much the thing comes crashing down p
i love the mom changes for titans i say boost their defensive ability and just let them fit siege modules instead of dd afterall what the hell is the point of xl weapons without siege modules absolutely none bs weapons do more damage maybe ccp thought about fitting titans with siege mods and then scrapped it why else would they allow for xl weapons to be fitted
maybe your doing something wrong but anywayrule number 1  dont fly what you cant afford to losebs cost 20 times as much as a cruiser but they dont have 20x ehpthe more and more you spend on a ship the less you get back in terms of additional firepower and tankthis is true at any ship level and there is a reasonthe reason being if dps and ehp were proportional to cost new players would find it more or less impossible to get into the game in any meaningful wayyes moms are expensive but the 20x they cost over carriers is fair for the 2x dps and 15x tanknot signed
youre right battleships instead have about 10x the eft 23 extra tankable slots triple the dps and about 48 times the tank of a tech 1 cruiser not to mention a much larger drone bay and god knows what else ive forgotten titans do not get siege nor should they they do not get a huge bonus to hp over dreads no extra slots beyond highs and maybe an extra 1 mid or low theyre slow theyre stupid and theyre 1 and done their 1 weapon is so ridiculously overpowered and under performing its really a joke to even try to expound on the 100 post before moms are even worse because baring a cyno jammed system they have no greater role than a carrier in fact 2 carriers are about 18th the cost of a mom insurable have the bonus of rr each other equivalent firepower etc so the question becomes why a mom over a carrier oh yeah and carriers can dock which is far less risky than a cap ship maintenance array this allows the pilot to be far more flexible and effective for far less cost
supported just about everything else have small medium and large versions these days
why yes i would love to fit 160km tractors at 4 kms on my marauder
so would i already supported
implement it and make fitting requirements hard i suppose
no
i support this i also support yordas suggestion from another thread toquote from yorda2 gun slots 100 damage role bonus5 shield boost amount instead of missile rof36515 cpuend quoteit seems that this would clearly define the role of the naglfar and ccp could only object because it takes away the split weapon systems that they originally designed
supported but keep the nag as an armor tanker us nidd pilots would then have to train the shield skills according to your plan
le bumpenudgin dis to the toppa da pile as its important like
i dont see the problem if they system doesnt work very well then reform itbut dont nerf the  out of espionage in the process
meh then you have the problem of how can people sit a titan in a pos to open jump bridges without letting blues into the pos seen kenny do that alot  looks really paranoid but it works
need this nowas said before would also go for the time until skill training complete ideasigned
thumbed
100 agree
need to be able to access it either by each member and bring up their access for every station etc or by station bringing up which members have what access
this area needs looking at but hardly a radical idea
whats the big deal so you have to change your password every so often  cry moresupportedtheres some epic pl hate going on here its pretty obvious and its a lot more pathetic than a bunch of alt support account security is a serious issue above and beyond whatever is going on in 00 grow up hatersedit forgot the thumbs up
sounds like a good idea
good idea i need to change my password more
i too support account security
or just give graviton physics a bonus to tractor beams which would make senseeither way supported
piling on i agree corp management needs an overhaul and this is definately in the listfrom the we never have enough skills department you could add a skill for it pjk
ahahah citadel velocity gets boosted flight time shortened endstate goal you still probably should shoot the secondary in a capital fightand your explosion velocity on any cap moving over 20ms is still terribad woohooo for ccp fixing citadel torps and breaking them in the same patch qrthen boosting them for the sake of the naglfar wo any real boost except a reduction on time to impact
nah  these like gscs need some kind of upkeep associated with allowing them to continue to hog up limited spaceleaving the tower offline tying up a moon only turning it on to defend if you get wardecced is kinda lame
war dec the corp and blow them up
i like the idea of removing the tower after a month but i am worried that people will keep resetting the timer by placing a small amount of fuel in the towerinstead i would suggest that if a tower is offline at downtime it will take damage the damage should be hard enough that a solo player in high sec would have to spend at a good chunk of his time rring the tower to prevent it being destroyedid also suggest having the damage applied to the shields armor and structure even when the shields and armor do not hit 0 just to put in more work for the guy who didnt fuel his tower
also works but i prefer gradual loss of health after 24 hours of being offlined
cant fully support this sorry mate what i would support is a proposal to have control towers lose structure or be unanchored after a certain time period allowing scooping andor easier destruction the latter would be more important in hisec where dreadscarriers cannot be deployed
this is my topici support my topic
already raised in csm1
wantsigned
then lets raise it again and hope it gets done
uh huh a game with a stupid feature like that couldnt possibly last very long and certainly not six years or morehmm maybe it isnt that big of a deal afterall
you too what prevents you from opening the map and checking the number of pilots in system in the last 30 minutes and you know if the target is alone pilot 1 ive found a carebear mining oppilot 2 wait it could be a trappilot 1 checking map  situation a 10 ships on scan average number of pilots in system in the last 30 mins 12 nope it is note opening covert cyno jump in situation b 10 ships on scan average number of pilots in system in the last 30 mins 40 it is a trap x up we need numbers they wont know what hit thempilot 2 ok
youre right lets get rid of that too  but at least thats a little more iffy than a smackdabinyourface listthis is such a ridiculous statement i wont give it more than this derisive mention your logic needs work
personally i like delayed local maybe 15 minutes
delayed local for a period of time depending on your ship size
delayed local whether by time or ship size strongly benefits the hunterroamerinvader and penalizes localsrattersmindersdefenders recent speakers mode is a better solution and works equally for those already in a system and those who are jumping in
i am against this proposal right now as it makes finding the target you want to pursue for example enemy militia or your war targets pretty much impossiblehaving to be in the same grid as someone to know if you want to fight him or not is absolutly ridiculous the only people who want this are killboards who dont care who theyre engaging because they have no tactical or strategic objectives to their conflictsalso theres a huge difference between whsystems where everything needs to be probed and youre pretty safe if youre on your toes and ksystems where you have fixed things such as stations and belts where the attacker would have a huge advantageat the very minimum before this can be implemented you need to1 have a way for people in stations to scan the outside grid2 change asteroid belts so you cant simply jump someone in a couple of seconds as a suggestion make asteroid belts like cosmic anomalities you can detect them with 1 probe or the onboard scanner maybe having a survey scanner gives a scan timerange bonus to the onboard scanner to make it easier for miners  but you do need to scan them first  no more right click warp to them3 probing for ships with combat probes and directional scanner gives you pilot information alliancecorporationsec status  preferably early in the scan for probes not when you get a warpable hit
i think in order to consider this situation fairly we need to stop putting the onus on people to explain why the idea is so much better than the current system while everyone else quotesnipes them and instead go for a reasoned debate as to the merits of each system preferably avoiding subjective generalisations such as more fun or unfair here are a few to get you startedinstant local makes the game safer for players who want to avoid pvp already in game so no development time needed helps war targets find each otherrecent speakers local realistic allows cloaking ships to actually be invisible introduces more opportunities for pvp proven to work in wspace makes scouting actually require some skilledit just realised i was an idiot when quoting someone
if their is a faint sig added for cloaked ships id be 90 soldnot sure about the cloakcov ops cloak argumenta way to know whats outside the station before you undock would i think be needed though if local was finally fixdwhat about a gate activation warning if u hold sov3 in a system to all alliance membersor is that protecting those carebear 00 players to much still
a consistent numbervalue display is definitely a feature that will help just about everyoneand why they dont just write the decimals all the time is beyond meimho the same could be said when entering values on the markets sell screen and send money the screen should expand the value to the full format with thousand separators and decimals having the value written out is less of an issue to me
allways displaying the amount in millionsbillions to 2 decimal places would be enough to stop this kinda nonsense me thinksso 1989999999 will display 199 billionso 1999999999 will display 2 billionetc
part of the reason this scam took off was due to it getting posted on scrapheap imo
i think the exact words thing would be a good low budget fix to help mitigate the scamminghowever this is popular because it works it will become less popular as more people learn of it and fewer fall for it a post on cp claimed a guy had made over 10b in a couple weeks doing that i dont know about you but that blows my mission running income out of the water why wouldnt you do itone solution currently in the works in md is the creation of player made trade channels such as the scc lounge this forces players to actively app an admin to join the channel and gives the player community the power to enforce a nospamming rule with minimal risk of a player block grief voting folks out of the channel the more we look to player moderated channels and away from system nonmoderated channels for interesting trade opportunities the sooner we can just ignore the noise created by these spambotsbut thumbs up for words on the contract  its how we do checks and really any large sum of money in the real world
based on the fact that not displaying two decimal places in contracts is a oddity compared to the rest of the eve ui i support this
i think allowing the lender to make the contract would be greati am not so concerned about the time limit nor do we realy need the revert option if this reversed loan contract is implementedwhat would be great though i think would be a fee to be billed to the person receving the isk at the end of the duration intrest payment and a request extention or extend option next to the fail option that is there alreadythis option when used would reset the status of the loan after it has expired so new period and a new fee bill at the end of that
i think it would be an utterly dreadful idea for several reasons1 everyone flying the fotm2 at the moment sp dont equal levels because no matter how many you have you cant do everything your proposal would go a long way to changing that3 make your choice take the consequences a fundamental tenet of eve4 would greatly advantage older players over new playersnot supported strongly opposed
i petitioned to have two skills that i dont want removed just because they are an eye sore i have caldari frigate injected as well as small hybrid turret 1 i will never ever use these and just want them removed to prevent the eyesore that is my character sheet as for pooling and reallocation no effing way but pure deletion yeah ill go for that
and then people wonder why it takes so long before petitiones are answered
removing sp is pointless and something you will likely do when drunkreallocating sp will never happen
i dont see the point in this i have tons of skills i never use and have trained to lvl 1 sometime or another especially since i tried starting out as a minermanufacturerabout the flawless skillsheet and eyesore get real and stop training every damn skill on it to lvl 5 just to make it look perfect you are wasting your time
ok as long as you dont get 100 skill points backrecycle skill points at 50 would be coolas long as you dont have any other skills dependant on it
agreed no skill is truly wasted and you obviously at some point wanted that skillthe most serious problem i can see is draining off prerequisite skills while keeping the more advanced ones for example if you could drain off spaceship command without first losing all the skills that depend on it and there are a lot of them when you look at the interrelationshipsso no not now not ever
cant support this feels too much like respeccing in wow which then brings on the whole host of constantly switching specs for different aspects of the gamebonus lolz for feeling like you wasted 18mil sp on a shipgame mechanic that got nerfed that is the flipside of fotm  when you know some aspect of the game is too good to be true and go for it anyways be aware it may be rebalanced
here is the issuecurrently players in an npc corp can use logistics capabilities to aid players actual player corps without any repercussions or risks of combatwhy not make it impossible to use logistics modulesganglinks from npc corps to player corps gangs across player corps would have no problem repping each other while using npc capes wont help them anymore
solution  corp b gets npc pilot with ganglinks to give corp a something to whine about
fixd and supported
are you one of those sad people who likes being able to run around doing what you want with impunity without anyone being able to shoot backpathetic
well when you put it that efrims post way i guess it makes sensei guess im used to seeing whiners throw a fit when its obvious you should do like wise back at imalright i support but so long as its that way and not the other way
no im one of those people who points out the emorantrage posts who have horrible writing skills of a troll
thanks for phrasing it so well ill amend the op
as much as npc corps provide a certain safety mode players can also simply endlessly slip between corps to dodge wars i fail to see how this solves anything other than making dishonorable folks do more of what they already do jump corps to dodge war decs
maybe you can give me english lessons
nope i have really bad grammar and spelling myself  o 
i would also like use of logisticsganglinks across players corps to cause aggro  would you support this
at least the flamingtrolling is keeping this thread on page 1
if theyre ganged with a war target you can shoot themi see no problem here
untrue
thats the way it use to work has it been changed i cba to check in gameand the problem with npc corp logistics isnt that theyre possible its that repping doesnt cause an aggro timer so they can dock at any time when threatened
to redirect back to the central topic ignoring the flaming and the misunderstandingthe point here is not people slipping between corps or repping each other its people in gangs that have gang bonuses ie something that increases weapon damage or resistancesthere is no penalty to ganging with several out of corp people and getting stacked bonuses for a fight the person giving a bonus is not targetable as someone giving direct repping while it is only passive buffing there is no reason the person should be without risk whether passive or active if youre part of a fight youre part of a fight this would only make it so everyone in the gang is target able not just those who rep and shoot all of them it wont matter what corp they are in if they are in the gang during a firefight and nearby they can be shotthis should not hurt anyone if you still want to have an alt hiding in another system giving a bonus thats your prerogative but at least now he will blink red for those doing the fighting
logistics onto a war target currently flag you for aggression which is just fine gang links might work with a similar solution  anyone providing gang bonuses to a flagged player is also flagged  but thats touchier since its something that happens passively for that matter itd probably bring back the lofty scam convince a player to lead the gang steal from a can and have your buddy shoot the sucker leading the gang something might be doable here but youll have to be careful abut how you do it
i like shooting people
i support the op  running ganglinks should not be without riskhowever i think that rr on a target causing aggression doesnt go far enoughthe reason being that it is still easily exploitable you can undock rep dock when locked and fired on and repeati would propose that any form of logistics results in the same effect as shootingtackling the target  a 1 min timer which prevents them from docking
not supported i wouldnt really care about the sec status stuff but your moon minerals idea is terrible making them shift would force interruptions in the supply which would cause the prices to spike even more i dont really care if your tiny alliance doesnt have the manpower to take an r64 get bigger get a capfleet do not try to change the mechanics to suit yourselfsay it with me supply and demand you reduce supply prices spike and there are way more people out there whining about high t2 prices than there are whining about r64 lockdown
all i have seen so far is this sucks not really any informed argument as to why and possible alternatives so until i do see reasoned arguments i will continue to push this idea yes
state how please and lets think of ways to combat it instead
massive totally incorrect assumption there dont fog the issue with unfounded commentsi agree there may be fluctuations but the supply would also be be largely freed from megablob control unless of course the megablob are active then they can easily take locate and take control of the resources seems ok to me
heh i just realised you would have the classic mafia style drop land values through crime then buy out the lot game going onit sounds interesting in a way but if 5 can flip to 4 more needs to be done about graduating that line down currently there is too massive a difference between concord being guaranteed to show up vs guaranteed not to show up grey that line and dynamic shifts would be more acceptible
we can make all the informed arguments we want your hearing aid would still be turned downits not our fault your blinded by your self imposed brilliance
lol quite funny but only 110 and totally incorrect so come on any tweaks to this major or minor anything that can make eve dynamic limit only to security at first and let the big boys sit on the pots of gold or maybe another idea for moonbelt resources
hmm interesting idea and thanks for pointing that out yes i think another poster covered that too and you are right its an issue that needs addressing somehow im pretty much stumped thoughunless the idea of fluctuating sec ratings is limited by range to current areas classed as low sechi sec00 would that work or would that make the whole exercise pointless
i actually kinda like this idea but im sure it would be a major technical untertaking it would need to be balanced very carefully both in terms of how slowly system sec changes occur and how large population shifts have to be to alter system sec its a very radical idea but i think worth talking about i worry about ways such a change might make the game less dynamic however  high traffic could permanently eliminate lowsec choke points for instance id be curious about ccps opinionalso an interesting idea again would need to be very carefully balancedthis is the one area where i disagree with you sovereignty is a very touchy subject one that ccps already thinking about and i think there are other more elegant suggestions on the table for changing how its structured im a fan of the model where sovereignty is maintained by control of gates for instance but there are a lot of ideas out there and ccps already going to do whatever ccps going to do about itim giving you a thumbs up anyway overall some creative ideas herei was almost afraid that drake and i were going to agree on everything after the last couple weeks guess not p
1 empire areasim with tesseract on this a good idea needs careful implementation commentary needed from ccp too needs work2 asteroid beltsmoon miningi think that would work for asteroid belts mixing and matching those is a good idea i remain unconvinced for moon mining though3 sovereigntyas tesseract durberville mentioned if there is something on the table from ccp  maybe your suggestion wont be neededit needs more thought anyway imhooverall interesting out of the box thinking and worthy of more discussion i support some elements of this as stated giving you an overall thumbs up
i have a proposal that i think would go a long way towards making war decs work as intendeddeclaring an empire war should work in regions and should require establishing an empire based high or low sec pos in that region add a diplomacy module or some such that would be mounted to a pos the aggressed corp would be made aware of which posposes are allowing their aggressor to operatethe main point of this is that it gives the aggressed something to attack as was claimed in some other ideas some kind of victory condition that can allow them to win and end a war and return to normalcy by contrast a lot of merc and pirate corps use wars to take down pos and grief but they themselves have little to lose if they dont have a pos up or conduct any empire side logistics and can often therefore maintain aggression indefinatelyrecappingthe aggressor will have to defend at least one nearby target to maintain the warthe aggressor will have to maintain logistics to at least one pos in the effected areaid do this in place of the existing isk for war mechanic though perhaps requiring separate diplo modules for each aggressed entityissueswhat if an oligarchy claims all the moons in a region and becomes invulnerable to wara there would need to be a balance where a handful of low sec systems were considered within the range of such a highsec blockade either base it on jumps or ensure there is enough low sec within each empire region you can strike lowsec pos without an empire war might need some tweaking to prevent massive security hitsi cant hire mercsfriends to defend me if they dont have presence in the regiona correct this would work both for pirates and antipirates in order to operate in spite of concord in high sec you have to own at least one asset in high sec giving your targets a fair vulnerability to counterattack so if a merc counterattacks a pirate corp the pirates have a way to try and retaliate against the mercs too
well and of course im going to support my own idea
there are many changes to the wardec system that could be useful this is not one of them poses are annoying enough as a mechanic for 00 fighting they dont need to be expanded to cover highsec too
as intriguing as this idea sounds forcing wars to take place with established assets to defend it would cause alot of headaches and be too drastic a changenot supported but cleverill give you that
its an interesting idea it would certainly reduce spurofthemoment grief wars because the declarant would need to be engaging in soulcrushing pos maintenance at the same time and griefers that are in it just for the fun wont do thatdestroying a defended pos without the help of dreads though is extraordinarily difficult it invites blobs and soulcrushing fleet battles and i dont like the idea that it becomes harder to hire mercsi think this proposal is an unintended blow to the most legitimate use of wars to challenge a dominant corp or alliances control of resources requiring the declarant to maintain a pos makes it much more difficult for a small corp to legitimately challenge a big one for resources in areas of scarcity  a small corp can fight smart using small gangs but forcing them to defend a static position especially against a wellheeled opponent puts them at a huge disadvantagei like that this is a creative take on a difficult problem but not the solution to that problem
sorry but anything that forces people to do anything i will simply not support your idea would be crushing and cause a lot of crying isaac
i had to fly around to get all my skill books so you should have to suffer in the same way is what most of your detractors will really be feeling when they come up with an excuse as too why this is a bad ideaits not it would make much more sense than the current situation i also hate flying to agents in this age of ftl commsgood idea supported  trade issue is irrelevant skill books make up about 001 trade in eve
i would like to draw attention to the questionnaire that was sent out in the interests of the csm election along with my answersif youd like to participate in my interviews of the csm candidates just send your answers to me at simplelibertygmailcomwhat is your ingame namepsycholinks to your forum thread and site
this probably should be posted in jita park
umm wrong forum for this go to jita park this is for issues that need to be brought to the attention of the csm unless your claiming to be an issueisaac
this and it needs to include an intracorporate market especially for tech iiiii stuff
this is sullying the integrity of a meaningful and relevant office if the honest election of the guys get a free trip to iceland in exchange for repeating whatever gets supported in features  ideas cant be trusted why i just dont know anymore
such behavious seems entirely within the character of the game to me
just say you vote for him get the cash and then dont vote for him scamming is entirely in the spirit of eve too and he has no way of checkingthen again we dont have any guarantee he will keep his word and pay up either
starts setting disabled children on firedoes that get me out of it
no now you have to be secretary for the rest of your life and an extra term for every child you set on fire
a vote for omber is a vote for great csm secretarial work
i intend to vote for this guy 
confirming that xavier hayes and this character may be related but he has far more isk to spend on a csm election

hello heartstone long time no seehow do you feel about ice specifically ice mined sometimes macromined in empire purchased by nullsec and jumped to 00 in complete safety to support massive tower buildups and posspammingyou see rather than mine their own fuel it is easier with current jump mechanics to simply purchase from empire that way you dont have pvpers having to defend fragile mining craft with the generous bounties nullsec offers it is far easier to simply buy what you need from empireshould a needed resource be this riskfree do you think this allows nullsec alliances to claim more space than they use does it allow a deathgrip for superalliances which keep the small guy outif ice belts in empire were removed or severely cut from the inexhaustible resource they are today do you think that would shake things up cause fighting over resourceswould raiding an opponent to prevent him from mining fuel have an effect would he be forced to lock down his ice belt systems would this offer a reason for people to roam in gangs other than just killmails ie the ability to hamstring an opponenthow would you feel if someone proposed removing ice from empire
an intriguing statement if something unfortunate happened to any of afcs members pass on my sympathies also try not to be a stranger in corp chat afc  deleo have some deep roots  if members are going through hard times were there for themi look forward to eriks movie as i eagerly anticipate learning more about his eve history and playstyle
tbh id vote for someone that has actually played and experienced pvp instead of fw
id like to expand on my platform a bit more if tldr is the case my previous post is an adequate summaryi want to continue to make eve inviting to new players without reducing the complexity and depth that has caused the current playerbase to stick with it for so longi want to continue to reinforce soloable content in eve while the players in eve that play in small casual groups or by themselves are not the most vocal group in the forums they do exist and they do need love now and then weve seen many additions encouraging large group play and while i think large group play is great its not the beall and endall i like my tech 1 production it has low overhead minor effort and as a result small profits but i dont have to operate daily mining ops and 2 poss in 00 to do it so its fine with medrone aggro in missions a relatively small issue but one that many fulltime mission runners can agree is a problem in the past weve been promised fixes as random mission spawn groups arent supposed to aggro drones but it has taken a distant backburner to many other ingame issues we mission runners would like to be able to use our drones in missions without having groups immediately kill them and then fail to reaquire other targets when the drones are recalledi know one of the issues that is rolling through the forums is 00 sovereignty im going to say right now that i dont know anything about it and have not experienced it so i dont have an intelligent stance in it sorryexpanding faction warfare in pirates of the burning sea the port ownership system allows traders to deliver unrest materials to local npcs to increase the chance of the port becoming contested a similar system allowing traders and miners to participate in faction warfare would be great as well i recognize that the basis of faction warfare is structured pvp but many people would also like to participate merely for the roleplay aspects which i think should be encouragedexpanding npc presence in eve i am an avid fan of freelancer and one of the great things about that game is the presence of and interaction with npcs behaving as normal people might in eve the player is a pod pilot the elite of the elite chronicles tell us that there are many pilots and spacefarers out there who are not capuleers and yet except for npc police concord and the occasional trade caravan encountered outside a station civilian everyday normal people seem to have vanished from the face of the universe our only interactions with them are saving them from herons deep in contested sansha deadspace complexes or transferring them to a processing and screening center 3 jumps away for a meager reward i would love to see more npcs npcs you can talk to chance encounter missions rather than just missions issued from agents maybe a transport ship with a structure fire sits 25km off of a station you approach and hail him and he tells you about how hes the only member of a convoy to escape an ambush and he asks you to intercede on the behalf of his compatriotschanged insurance mechanics variable rates based on market averages determined at the time of issuance not the time of collection a system that possibly accounts for recent ship losses and security status when assigning premiums insurance is a great tool to help newer players stay in the game but it needs to be changed to make losses feel a little more realmore may be added later
ok if any one needs me i am in game as well most days from dt until late
this is an overview of my platform as a candidate for the third council of stellar management for more information on any of the points below just click the links why im runningpolicy user interface i will work for the implementation of a modifiable user interface to allow each player to play the game in the most comfortable and efficient fashion for them this will be carefully monitored to ensure that macroing is not made easier by this change  i will work for the implementation of improvements to existing areas of eves user interface especially the poorlyimplemented areas like evemail the ingame browser and the official forums policy csm internal i will ensure better communication between the csm and the player base both by creating more accessible reference materials for players to see what the csm is doing and by streamlining the assembly hall process to allow the csm to see what players want more effectively  i will look into the possibility of moving the csm debates to a publiclyviewable forum to allow better debate among csm members and to allow players to better see what their representatives are doing and why  i will attempt to create a streamlined process for small issues that dont require much debate so that they can be considered more easily and not ignored  if i am elected as csm chair i will resign the chair and allow a vote of the csm members on who ought to be our chair policy gameplayi have opinions and policies about many areas of gameplay but the below are some highlights  i will look into ways to make lowsec more habitable by players this will include both an increase in lowsec profitability through mechanisms such as new oresthread and better exploration sites and the ability to gain lowsec sovereignty to allow players to defend their space without losing as much security standing thread i will work to add new epic arcs to the game which will allow players to recover low faction standings with a significant time investment thread i will look into new skills which can reasonably be added to underused skill trees such as corporation management and trade with a special emphasis on the addition of charismausing skills  for all other proposals i will work to improve the game as a whole rather than one favoured part of it i will ensure that proposals i make are wellconsidered and reasonable and i will consult with players on proposed changes about methank you if you have any questions for me feel free to ask either here or ingame
what kind of charisma skill set do you think would improve the gameplay in eve or do you only think of changing the primary stats of several other skill trees into charisma
i wouldnt change any existing skills  it opens too big a can of worms in terms of players picking their attributes to train a skill and then not being able to do so properly and it doesnt make sense in terms of the fluff either instead id like to see new skills added mostly in corp management but also a few in trade or social leadership would be nice to add to but theres really no new skills you could put in there unless you added a new ship class under corp management theres room for half a dozen skills related to pos gunneryeg 5 damagelevel for laser turret arrays you control and probably eight or ten skills related to a new feature of corporate management id like to implementtherell be a thread on this topic in the next few days theres probably room for 23 new social skills such as one to make it possible to reject missions more often and 23 new trade skills which im drawing a blank on right now but ive seen a few good threads on in the past i think that theyd all help the game in their own right while also helping to balance the charisma problem effectively
ccp has stated that they know about these issues and have a team working on improving them while its good to reinforce these issues we arent supposed to be vultures about themthis seems to be the same thing many other candidates are trying to achieve realize that in these meetings we talk about some very sensitive subjects and they have to be reviewed before the public can know the results or even what was said also the mechanics may be debated but they are firmly in place and work so not much can be done about them some things might work but this is mostly spitting against the windthis is the meat of your run it seems you have some valuable ideas here and some improvements could stand to be made to many of these issuesin that i have known herschel since before the election where i was voted into office i think he has the potential to be a great csm candidate
go evesearch for it cat pretended for months to be a teenage girl claiming she was cute claiming she hadnt been able to play because she was grounded ad nauseum  theres a difference between pretending to be an internet hardman and indulge in ad hominem attacks like me say or someone like you say who just loves to talk post a lot for the sake of hearing themselves talk post and then someone who does what cat did and adopts a whole new personality just to elicit a certain reactioni dont personally care that he likes to pretend to be a teenage girl to annoy peopleget attention but that kind of behaviour makes me not want to vote for them or have them representing the playerbase as i find their motives questionable
you know i really do like to read my own writing but then again i admit that ruze is absolutely nothing like the player who posts through him hahahah 
thank goodness im not like cat at all i couldnt handle being so happily naive all day im actually far more dark and brooding all i do is roll cigarettes and shruganyway i dont really want to derail this any further but i have some remarks regarding some of the above postspeople came to a lot of conclusions on their own things like being grounded etc these were just excuses for me not logging on this char i planned silly antipirate ops which i could never attend and that was part of the joke i thought saying i was grounded was funnier than admitting i had stuff to do on another characteri dont think ive stated what my age was except maybe in rancer local i decided to go 16 to try and stop them asking me to post  the whole damn time as for gender i do refer to myself as a she mainly because i selected female when i made this character not to wax lyrical over my posts satirical but cat is the polar opposite of what a lot of people consider a proper eve player and that is where the fun has been a lot of the attitudes towards me have been generated by the forum populace rather than directly by me i can post once in a thread and the next thirty posts might be about my single post thats not my fault there are people out there that take me far more seriously than i take myself with that said though i mentioned some of my real life experience in an attempt to demonstrate that i can actually put my mind to something serious and do a good job at that
i dont think i got it but what is the top 3 points in your agenda to improvechange in eve 
you know based on the op in this thread id likely have voted for you but really the lengths you went to to maintain the cat persona frightens me a bit not to mention that it was borderline trolling i freely admit that i took the bait as well got smacked down for it too and made you break character to actually post a coherent replyi guess i just cant grasp your motivation for intentionally ing off a large percentage of forum dwellers the same people who are likely to bother with voting
cat just get some ideas out of your head1 what are the top 5 things that need to be rebalanced in eve2 should local chat be changedremoved3 how would you fix the riskreward system which is currently broken
my vote very knowledgable and about time we get some minny support in there 
vote
got my vote too
and my axe i mean vote sensible and implementable policies
one item i would really like to have implemented is a pirate module that temporarily jams ship communications so when an affected ship is attacked in high security space concord does not show its overprotective face and you blast the frightened little carebear with impunity this might be an easier change to implement than the concord bribery discussed earlier in the post and it would only apply to one ship at a time like a warp scrambler ohhhh the possibilities
im voting for istvaan i just cant figure out why
eve mails have been sent to all candidates ill update the lead post and a blog post of mine to be an index time to see what response i get
youve got my vote extreme
heres a list of a few game innovations id like to see added to the game and only adding one or two would be greatplease review and comment but if you comment please be good enough to explain your point of view  im not worried if you agree or disagree with me but i do want to see some more thought put into responses other than trotting out the ambiguous crap of well im not sure ccp can or will do that 1 ring mining yep weve got cloud mining ice mining and asteroid mining  i think ccp has a good creative opportunity in adding the mining of rare andor unusual materials from the rings of ringed planets example saturn2 renegade concord just once in awhile id like to see a rogue unit of concord just haul off and start busting empire heads huge potential for political story arcs from ccps side of things  nasty crap if you the player are in the wrong place at the wrong time but wtf ccp is always billing eve as a dark and cruel world so wheres the harm  3 player habitats much like those residences you see in some missions id like to see ministructures like these for players as an option launched like a pos in empire space you need standings and charters or anywhere in 00 as usual and the player always needs some pos fuel to keep the lights on i dont suggest as much fuel as a pos but that depends on how its designed and if there are any secondary structures or upgrades available for the player habitat great way to colonize 00 too which i know many folks are always yammering about4 rare materials in loot drops as an alternative to the infrequently mentioned concept of allowing high sec moon mining i think for the harder missions level 4s some of the loot drop generation tables could be reworked to include drops of moon minerals advance materials or whateverafterall these big nasty pirates come from homeworlds in deep dark places beyond the enlightenment of empire space so just how hard is it to rationalize that any particular ship let alone bss and faction ships are carrying some of these rare materials as cargoloot not hard at all5 reducing loot drops  see various forum threads on that controversy  allegedly as a means of rectifying the oversupply of minerals specifically rare minerals that would otherwise be coming from 00 sourcespersonally i dont give a rats azz  but in the interest of game balance 00 can not be the only source of 100 of all rare minerals andor advanced materialswhether its something like minimal amount npc sell orders of such materials not a real big fan of that or simply the rework of the mission loot drops see my 4th point above for high level missions  im just asking for a bit of balance in availability that has nothing to do with 00 supplies6 qships for those not familiar with the term its an armed merchant ship with all the external appearances to appear harmless while its heavy guns sit hidden on deckid like to see this kind of ship added to the game plenty of fun here and plenty of skills could be added basically i propose the ships graphics look just like various haulers of several sizes but that they are pure deception because they the qships scan that wayhowever qships captains could have some unique skills to learn that enhance their ability to fool any scan into believing they are a harmless hauler while the usual list of suspects would need to train some better scan skills or even a new skill or two to improve their chances of seeing through the qship deception adds a whole new twist to the ganking profession when you suddenly find yourself being gunned down by that harmless haulerenjoy debate trollify ad nauseum ad infinitum thanks in advance
1 are you intending to add new materials or just find already existant ones in different places either way it would be a neat immersion quirk but hardly seems a priority to me2 concord are pretty harsh i think that they would do a good job of watching their own ranks inserting random you die now events in the game especially in highsec would do nothing to encourage new players or entertain existing ones in my opinion3 ive seen these suggested before and having now spent some time in lowsec and wormhole space i can agree that these would be useful anchorable for the player not for the corporation limited powergrid and cpu incapable of moon mining or supporting reactors inherent cargo hangership maintenance array something to that effect4 some loot drop diversity would probably drive mineral prices back up question 5 and would create a small expensive but lowrisk source of rare materials i like this idea5 see above6 ive seen these proposed before and i have to again say i disagree the mechanics to create the deception would be a pain to implement the game says youre flying one thing when youre flying something else and what a person sees depends on his skills seems complicated to me and in order to gun down a ganker the qship would require some pretty good combat qualities im thinking around battlecruiser abilities to be honest we have transports already designed to avoid ganking by means of escape mechanisms if you want to kill gankers dont fly transports
ankh and erik appear to have put their third video online there is no official announcement out yet but you can access it here for a sneak preview
cutenot her or him but the whole idea of a take care political party
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
so much cringe
yes we got a new moviei really should have added a scene where we whack some trolls
im hardly their biggest supporter but that is completely uncalled for
understatement
agreed totally despite not liking what the take credit party represents for the csm an attack on someones accent of their nonnative language is pathetic in the extreme please come back when you can speak dutch and german without an accent
sarcasm yes finally somebody takes credit for all the changes that were implemented in this game obviously the take care party were the sole ones for credit for the 00 changes the skill queue and so many other improvements to the game aside from the fact that the party didnt exist before the new elections came uptake care  your party for all credit for changes in eve sarcasmsorry but that seemed amazingly egocentric considering that the csm is a team effort most of the issues you boasted about you alone didnt pass and the ones that didnt pass werent mentioned medals etc you had a good run now let somebody else take the limelight
bunyip i also raised this point in eriks threadyet to recieve a response from him though given the documentary evidence in past meeting logs you are suprised at the egocentricityim wondering why take care felt the need to start another thread for this announcementdoesnt erik have his own threadoh wait
weve merely stated what we have been working on and contributing to were not saying anywhere that we did it all on ourselves take your bickering elsewhere as it really isnt productive and i wont bother replying to these outlandish statements from now onoh and take care exists since july 2008 and erik has been my advisor for a long time now im sure you all remember my old campaign site got any more fantasieslive events  handed over to me by jade and wrote a nice addendum for that so checkapocrypha feedback  check who raced through the epic mission arc againdevplayer communication  check working even now to gather questions for petur and set up a system that the next csm can useskill queue pt2  check plus the reply i sent to ccp the first timeso what are you talking about that i didnt raise those issuesthe movie wasnt even officially released yet at the time due to technical difficulties with the flash player you may notice the absense of play controls i cant help it that some forum guy finds it and this turns out to be a massive troll thread eh as far as i can see siigari isnt a member of take care now is heseriously guys your negativity is astounding

1 every account of this game i know of states that its definitely not fun to play solo all the time but everyone goes out solo at least once in a while solo pvp and solo moneymaking ought to always remain viable options2 i think that luckily spending more energy on one does not really detract from the other since its completely different people working on the two3 just because people throw everbigger fleets at each other doesnt mean we should just throw up our hands and give up eves massive battles on a single instance are one of the biggest things that makes it unique and a top competitor in the mmorpg marketplace maybe improving the lag will not help people outside of the largest alliances but it isnt people running solo missions that put eve in the videogame news eitherthat said the new player interface still needs a lot of work to flatten the learning curve4 arent they getting ambulation soontm anyways they seem to do pretty fine on their own they are better at creating their own ideal worlds then the rest of us players some of the most stable and long lasting alliances in eve are roleplayers and i guess that tells you something5 losing ships has become quite a joke for t1 ships and large alliances with their reimbursement programs etc but for the little guy losing a ship is still a big deal also the insurance program helps keep mineral prices stable while removing it would make my alliances warfare options more interesting im against it due to the wider reaching consequences for evealso consider the fact that t2 ships are better preferred by players and their cost does not reflect the insurance payment so you could say a lot of ships in use today are already not very insurable6 ccp should pander enough to the noob audience to encourage a slow growth of players not too fast to overwhelm ccps capacity but not too slow to decrease the overall population considering all the eve ads im seeing on every webpage ever for the past few months ccp wants or needs more newbies i think this sort of decision is really more in the realm of the financial then the player vote7 having more features is cool dictors with the pl phage on them would be cool but i dont really care a lot about it and i imagine it would take a lot of time to go through every ship model to do the changes8 way too many systems to do this if they did that for every system they would have to do it randomly too 9 ok so we will have a crapton of alts and newbies in one member shell corps that will dissolve if they get wardecced eliminating npc corps didnt work for caod it wont work for the game10 more crap on my overview11 i thought roleplaying alliances already did this also eve politics itself is a storyline we are writing ourselves we got plenty of tools
1 solo play disagreed  the difference is not as hard as your statement suggests take the market as an example where massively multiple players make a difference without the use of any interactive mechanic like the corporation system i prefer to think in activities and content and there should always be a portion of the game suitable for soloplay because not everyone can or wants to wait for a bunch of friends to team upi also think you underestimate the amount of solo or semisoloplayers players that play mostly solo content such as missions exploration and solomining but are part of player corps or hang out with groups of friends in this game from my experience this is a rather large group and a group which is often marginalized here on the forums or simply brushed aside as lame carebears and whatnot solo pvp is a problematic part of the game which i hope should be improved through tradable kill rights redesigning the bounty hunter profession2 immersion agreed to some extent  we all hate grindgames and silly and tedious tasks unfortunately eve has a lot of silly and tedious tasks just think of pos setup and the logistics involved to maintain them the ui should be another focuspoint especially on the rd and industry sidethen again and as garthran has said the backstory is pulling all things together and provides the consistency for all activities when some action takes time eg anchoring then it should be for the purpose of someone else possibly interfering with it before you complete that action3 new content disagreed  perhaps not bugs but ccps gamedesign is not perfect and they implement too much unfinished content forgotten factional warfare notso epic mission arcs tech 3 and sleeper loot are examples of unfinished or poorly designed content while the game should stay moving forward i would rather have ccp finish existing things properly before rushing more halfbaked goodies out the door as i said in another thread finishing the existing content needs to be done in a way to still attract new players this demands both well design and the right marketing to sell the update as new stuffso instead of giving us tech3 which only affects a small upper segment of the players anyway they should have overhauled old content that annoys a lot of players such as the development of 00 space and sovereignty which we are finally getting at the end of the year the mining mechanics and lowsec ore problems and finalizing things such as factional warfare the extensions possible and required here can still be designed to make the whole aspect look new4 role play agreed  once again this is a matter of preferred playstyle but i think there should be much more social networking tools available that benefit all playersin general and roleplayers in particular we all know that the bio is severely limited just like the standing system which is also overly complicated especially if you want to sync it with a few of your friends or allies there should be more ingame tools available to give your character a personal touch a more refined history could mean success and criminal record and keep track of what your enemies and friends have been up to lately5 insurance agreed  insurance needs review some ships can be produced for around the same cost as insurance payout which is unbalancing in a conflict and opens the door for all kinds of undesirable gameplay on the other hand any changes to the current system should be subtle and cautious as long as the riskreward balance for factional warfare players has not been adjusted the insurance system is heavily interleaved with that part of the game and young pilots too require this parachute
the realworld car insurance system provides interesting improvement aspects the rates are higher not only depending on car types but also on the car types and any particular drivers crash history the region in which you live also influences the rates and the rates decline over time now thinking of eve ship types and pilots crash record are easy to determine as is the age of the ship to insure or the renewal of the insurance on the same ship the region in reallife could be simulated with standings as long as your actions improve your standing to the insurances faction this should largely apply for fw you get bonusses on insurance6 end game features disagreed  ccp should not focus on either group nor do i think they did so in the past but they should develop content for all players the sovereignty endgame needs a lot of work but the new player experience still is not what it should be learning skills are just an example of game mechanics that discourages new players7 customizable ships agreed  and ankhesentapemkah has found out that ships are already painted as their textures are mostly just greyscale with the client turning parts of the gallente ships blue etc and the interbus shuttle is not only another example for the paint job with a corp logo on there but the market price shows the importance of this aspect8 art work coherence agreed  ccp already has plans to actually show some constellation things in the backgrounds instead of the generic skyboxes we currently have likewise npcoccupied space should have more to show that than just some different flavour of rats at the belts and exploration sites9 npc corps safe haven disagreed  npc corporations are thriving communities of soloplayers which compose a much larger chunk of it than the griefers and spammers that give npc corps their bad name a lot of casual players simply do not have the time nor the interest in playerrun corps and i do not think this valid playstyle should suffer in any way because of some bad people that abuse the npc corps luring people out of npc corps can be done in more subtle ways than suggested there are other and better suggestions on how to aggravate nullsec war supply and makro mining can be complicated otherwise10 complex npc interaction disagreed  while the intention of this is amiable this would tend to foster solo play reminding me of the old days of railroad tycoon i think playerplayer interaction can largely be improved at less server cost and with more immersive drag and longterm fun npcs should be used as a medium to exercise impact other players and not be the goal for your actions per se take care has already pointed out factional warfare as a part where more environment and backstory impact could be implemented11 sand box agreed  all the npc stuff is nice but in the end it should be the player that is the one to determine the outcome to me personally colonizing wormhole space is a lot more exciting than fighting just another kind of npc read sleepers while big alliances already provide some playertoplayer content participating there has too many other dependencies i am all for programmable npcs that allow the players to write content for other players including rewards for both parties of course and similar tools like that
thanks for your replies everyone some surprises there i think and im glad for the extra information i hope others will find this interesting as welleditmayhaps i ought to clarify those statements are not my own opinions they are there to allow candidates to position themselves between total agreement and violent opposition some i do agree with others i find absurd some im not sure of and some i dont really care either way will make another thread with more of those i think
i disagree i think serenity omber and deirdra have all shown these qualities
i most definitely am not a pvp everywhere candidate im all about eve staying enjoyable for a wide range of play styles and interestsissler
help me here im a little confuzledim reading a couple of these posts and i keep seeing four little words popping up i have no agenda and it bothers mewhy dont you have an agenda how are we supposed to know what you support and dont support how are we supposed to know who you are and what youll argue forhow if you have no agenda are we supposed to know whether well vote for you or notmaybe im getting confused i thought the csm was a representational government government of course being used loosely for representatives to work the players come together and they each vote for the guy or gal who is the most like them who supports what they supportto vote for these people you have to know what their agenda is its the only way to know who to electhow does it work then if they have no agenda are they noncommittal are they likely to swing one way or another at the drop of a hat are they saying that they are open to bribery and coercion since they dont particularly stand for anything anyhowif you dont elect the representatives to speak for you why do you elect them to just take votes on a forum visited by probably less than 5 of the playerbase and conclude that this is majority opinion i would think that if ccp wanted majority opinion they could achieve it easily through simple ingame polls dont you agreeso change my mind if it suits you tell me why i or any player should vote for someone who is merely going to pose as an inefficient and probably biased though admittedly so ballot boxwhy should any player care for or support those who wont stand up for what they believe in and truly be representatives of the populationdo you have an agenda i would love to know it cause i dont think i could vote for a candidate that wouldnt stand up and admit what they truly want and desire
lets cut to the chase everybody is biasedi ran for the market discussion folks i also tried to represent the mac people however it was obvious that they werent vocal enough for the others csm members to even consider that they have problems too
that would be an example of representation though whether its representing a minority or a majority its still representing a valuable and necessary portion of the playerbase not just popular opinion
i have a clear agenda i have identified a segment of players that i intend to represent i have posted a lot about my thoughts and have my past actions in the csm ii to show that i have acted in a manner consistent with my platformif anyone wonders what i think or who i want to represent i encourage them to read my past postsissler
im not interested in focussing on specific areas of gameplay as what seems to be overlooked by most people running on specific agendas is how those changes have effects on other parts of the game they either have no interest in or dont realise existwith that thought process in mind i find i can sit back and evaluate each proposal in itself as well as how it will interact with all the other game mechanics of eve im not saying i get it perfectly right every time but i find that blindly arguing for x because it will improve ystyle gameplay without actually thinking about what it will do to the rest of the game overall is negligentso i have no agenda other than overall game balance and the improved experience of everyone playing eve
i largely agree with you consulting players is important of course but the single best way to consult with players is during the election sure its easy to laugh at 8 turnout but do you think 8 of players participate in forum debates youre lucky on some of these issues to get 8 players never mind 8 in order to represent players best they have to be able to judge you at election time  they wont keep on top of the assembly hall 365 days a year but there are some who will read your platform and judge you based on that id vote for a friend based on simple trust but for someone i dont know i want to get an idea of which way theyre going before i give them my vote this is part of the reason why i tend towards such long platforms  yeah the forum regulars know me but the average voter has to figure out what theyre getting based on nothing other than what i say they may not agree with all of it but they should at least get a sense of what i stand for and how ill do the job if elected as an aside this is why dishonesty is so bad in politicians  their word is most of what we have to judge them on and if we cant trust that our vote is worthless because the people cant judge the politicians until after the fact democracy is based on the people being at the root of the decisionmaking process but a dishonest politician shatters that link and subverts the democratic processi think a lot of the reason why the csm was formed was to cut through the static of the forums and get a better sense of the will of the players its easier to get the will of the players when the players have to think about policy twice a year and can just play the game the other 363 days but if candidates dont have policy they cant make their decision at election time sensibly its nice to be consulted but what it often boils down to is in order to have a voice if you elect me you have to spend six months as a forum regular conversely voting for a candidate with a known agenda means that you can make your opinions known and walk away with the ability to trust that your voice will not be lost simply because youd rather shoot things than type things none of this is to say that a lack of an agenda implies that youre a bad candidate oz can hardly be described as a bad csm member thus far platform or no im just saying that it feels wrong to me to ask people to vote for me without really telling them what theyre getting out of it some voters may like it and thats fine for them but i want to know what im getting before i cast my vote and i want to make sure that anyone who votes for me has the ability to do the same
it seems like the different sorts of agendas boil down generally to pvpers vs industrialists pirates vs carebears or however you want to define people wanting to boost their own style of gameplay but this is a videogame not a country and our differences are not so vast in comparison everyone wants to fix broken game mechanics noone wants useless ships noone wants ships that are better then all the other shipsoh and for the record im a 00 big alliance pvper with past experience in piracy solo pvping and some industry some of the issues i talk about will only really make large alliance warfare improved without making the game worse for everyone else and other issues i talk about improves the game for everybody i really cant imagine any csm candidate voting against a good idea that would benefit everybody just because it doesnt benefit his specific agenda more so i dont think its really that big of an issue
i read agendas not as broad demographic blankets ie the pirate agenda everyone has those its the basis for running my agenda is solo play carebearing new player experience empire space with a little low sec the agendas that many claim not to have are specific political affiliations ingame for example it would be hard to believe a member of organization x if he told you he is interested only in improving the game in general and not creating advantages for organization x generally these political agendas relate to large 00 alliances and in that regard i lack a political agenda i dont live in 00 because i hate 00 politicsi hope this has helped to answer your question
i would like to participate but i work a night shift and am generally asleep during that time period if we could arrange a prerecording at a later time i would love to participate

this probably should be posted in jita park
umm wrong forum for this go to jita park this is for issues that need to be brought to the attention of the csm unless your claiming to be an issueisaac
the many areas of eve online harbor different types of players carebear and pvper pirate and industrialists ect a big debate that has been going on for a while is how to get more people interested in lowsec00 space a lot of people are tired of seeing players sit in a npc corp and amass a ton of isk and other items without really having to risk much for it while some might view this as a problem others might view it as game mechanicsnow i am not saying that it wouldnt be nice to get more people out to lowse00 but it is intimidating hearing about the 1000man fleets beating each other to death with large clubs or in this case titans capitals ect it does seem very daunting hearing about roaming gank fleets and gate camps blocking your way seems scary to a pure industrialist which is why they stay in empire spacenow i play mostly as an industrialist in empire dont roll your eyes at me with that statement as i have lived in 00low sec for almost a year far back in my life in eve i was part of an alliance that tried to make a go of it in pureblind venal and tenal teaming up with iron and the other forces at the time while it was decent for a while things got to ugly for to long and the alliance couldnt hold up and eventually fractured this caused a lot of my alliance friends to split off to other corps and spread out throughout the game i moved back to empire and have pretty much stayed here just minding my own business the corp i was with previously joined another alliance and i partook in as much pvp as i could wanting to learn this fine craft and to become a more active member of the alliance core in the end things toned down a bit more and i still spend time in empire doing my thingswith that backstory out of the way lowsec00 space is a daunting area for people with little knowledgeexperience of what to expect there are a lot of people who are interested but dont want to take 1 step into lowsec and end up getting it chopped off 2 seconds after they enter i think a good step to fix this is to change the local to be more like whspace where y ou dont know who is exactly there with you friend of foe or it could be empty to me this makes it a bit more interesting for both pirate and nonpirate pirates will have to develop more finesse with their craft of removing people from their shipspods while nonpirates will gain a sense of adventuring into the unknown not knowing who or what is there it might garner a sense of security not seeing all the badass guys in local waiting to pounce on your meager pod
no local will only end up with less people venturing to lowsec
