one time a soul of fountain guy got snippy with me in some forum thread that i no longer have any detailed recollection of strike onethe big website states that you have a join date of 2002 indicating that you have access to a time machine you have clearly used this machine to carry the eve server back to a year before eve was launched and join then and yet you have never offered anyone else an opportunity to use this wondrous device strike twoi am posting in general discussion again obviously the worst forum on the internet thanks to your thread strike three tbh
in the summery pdf page 3 it is further defined asso i prefer to wait for that
tornsoul you fa relic who dug you out of the moltballs
can be much worse then this forumanyway do you also have anything you want to do in csm that not everyone else also wants now the only way you are different from part of the others is that you dont do pvpbecause if i look at your list then i am pretty sure every candidate says that
not so much a time machine as an alternate universe machine there was an eve before this eve in fact there was several also called beta 
ah in true ccp style the summary includes information not in the actual document
in fact i havent seen anyone specifically state sobut apart from that id naturally surely hope that other csm candidates would value the same issueswould be a great start on the csm if everyone would agree on what needed to be done  dont you think
ts your comedy value is below sealevel no chance man old lemons are still lemons d
make that two soul of fountain guys
i havent seen other topics like these havent been looking for them but i just guess everyone has those points you have then the simple question why vote on you when others got the same points if everyone agrees with each other this is going to be a really boring election
thats actually a pretty good pointi think that once the campaigning really starts to heat up a few topics will emerge that the different candidates differ on and over which much argumentation will ensue right now however i agree its a bit meh meh  not really anything that makes individual candidates stand out much from each othermaybe you can get the ball rolling by bringing up a few subjectsissues of your ownand ill give them a lookover and give my opinion
got to go sleeping so this is my last one for a while but for example1 how do you want to improve low sec and especially riskreward2 what to do against laggy fleet battles better hardware  more people who join the battle  same ammount of lag so i suppose that somehow you need to give people a reason to split their forces but how to do that edit and since you arent doing much pvp only pvp i do is losing my ship p same question for jita and some mission hubs lag
ah  good stuffand definatly potentially controversial 1 this one would take almost a thesis to answer tbhand my answer might not be in the direction you expectin line with my campaign motto the big picture this is what you need to look at first and foremostand one of the fundamental flaws with the big picture of eve is the current population distributionie way way way too many people in empirewhy is this well it must obviously be that for most people its simply better for them to be there and each have their own defination of what better isso what has this got to do with low secwell i think its not so much a question of improving low sec but rather give incentive to go to other places of eve  to be able to have a living to your liking in other parts of eveand when i say give incentive i dont only mean positive incentivessometimes you need to force or rather coerce certain groups of peoples behavior in order to obtain whats best for all in the long runill give a very specific example of this which cant stand alone mind youi belive that ccps view or at least their implementation of the current jump lineshigh ways is fundamentally flawed  and is a major component in why we have this f up distribution of people in eveway back when in the very early days of eve we had far less super highways than we do today many many of those where added laterat the time it made some sense as eve was less populated at the timebut even ccp realised something was wrong and did a bit of rewiringthis rewiring removed luminaire as the trade hub but simply replaced it with jitaccp simply didnt go far enough and i believe dont understand or disagree with what really need to be donewe dont need more jump lanes we need lessonce the above is solved i think youll see low sec evening out and it will no longer be a question so much of improving low sec as of improving every where else as wellthere told ya it would be long and its not even 110th of what i could add to the subject which is a bti of tangent from what you asked but never the less is part of the long term solution2while not much of a pvper it doesnt mean i dont have a clue about pvp game mechanics  and an opinionin fact ive incidently posted an idea exactly on a way to get rid of the blob some days agoit wasnt very well recieved im afraiddefeating the blobi still belive the idea has merit thoughsometimes tough problems require tough solutionsin the end its about tailoring the game in a way that takes advantage of human competetive nature in order to coerce the playres into certain patterns of behaviour thats to the overall advantage of the game  and ultimately the individual playersunfortunatly human nature is also generally adverse to change as i think the replies to my suggestion implies
get yourself listed in winterblinks thread as well tournsoul and good luck
definitely definition believereceivedbelieve competitive unfortunatelythe illiteracy is strong with this onei thought csm needed hamsters who could spell correctlyedit  members just became hamsters
oh woe be me ive been found out english is not my native language if elected ill make sure to make a point of it to not have myself appointed as the secretary or vicesecretary of the csm i guess i should add more humour to my list of things as we could def need some more of that 
you get trolled way to easily ts
it bumps the thread though  doesnt it
you look too much like me even the two words used to describe you are identical to what i would usegood luck in the campaign worthy adversary or future colleague
i get this overhyped duracell bunny  aura from you do you do 
welcome to the race tornsoul nice to see another familiar face in the contest good solid applicant and long term supporter of the eve community its a privilege to have you as a rival in this one torn good luck
in all honesty most people take spelling corrections as insults which they are notyou didnt so thats an extra point for youcheers 
double 00 space and add a blob of empire in the middle of 00 30 jumps from current empire and yourll get my votewell at least give it some thought
omg its teamspeak timmmmmmmmaaaay 
he dug himself out this chance to be on the front page is bringing all the dusty old timers outi dont know whether the campaign will heat up as you seem to expect and the truth is that you cant really formulate a strategy about what to do about lowsec until ccp says what their plans are with the factional warfare patch because that could be anything from a minor change like adding a few agents here and there to a massive revamp of the map and the distance and lowsec regions between empires to even worse who knows removal of concord and the all out switch to a pure faction system and then coerce empire dwellers out of empire wont make sense anymore if there is no one empireanyway good luck whatever
haha soul of fountain
oh and one more thing all you candidates have all these links to your nifty campaign websites but you know what were lazy and most of us wont bother clicking you dont see political candidates in rl on tv just wave and say hi please click on the link at the bottom of your tv to see my agenda no they butt into discussions and they get right in your face and they push their views so you know them without lifting a fingergo answer in the how would you fix lowsec thread and all the other threads that have sprung up recently people sheesh
youve got my six votes
ive always appreciated the work and honesty with which big has done its thing for eve at large and respect the job it has done for the eve communitythat said i think that while big does expand eve in unique and interesting ways big is not in it because they are altruistic the bottom line is big is a selfserving entity that happens to provide a unique eve service while that is totally fine i am not sure it waves a magic wand that implies your motives are nothing but for the betterment of eveas candidates started announcing their candidacy i started to wonder to myself where these folks have come from in case i missed something i took to looking up their posting history and here is yoursi want to see candidates who have been fighting the good fight long before csm and a free trip to iceland was on offer your posting history tells me you have done no such thing if we take away the postings in events which are big specific your posting history goes in the crapper lots of caod postsdoesnt really get interesting as for the overall community till your posts to market discussions and those are thin when spread across the years i looked at your gd postings and looks like you made five in all of 2007ill grant gd can be a hassle with trolls and what not but nevertheless some spend time trying to throw out ideas and discuss issues they place themselves on the line and take what comes some ideas are good some bad plenty of flames but many stay with ityour lack of gdships  mods and other gameplay related forum posts i find disturbing now i cannot see what ideas you have floated or how you handled the inevitable flames i do not doubt your sincerity in your campaign website but mostly it is kissing babies and gladhanding i want someone on the csm who has proven themselves in trying to better eve long before trips to iceland were a part of it part of that is the eve forums and i am sorry to say your attempts there are sorely lacking looks like another alliance interested in nothing beyond their own narrow world in eveon the upside for you this lack of posting history is not unique to you and although it concerns me more than a little at least you have a golden reputation for honest gameplay that is no small thing in my viewso i will wait and see best of luck to you just the same
while posting on the forums may be part of a candidates appeal i dont think it is necessary being loud and easy to spot on the forums can be annoying as it can be informative i think ts would make a good csm as he is intelligent and well thought out with his ideas he can come up with weird and wacky ideas that upon discussion dont come to fruition or they get changed based upon other peoples suggestions at least he does within our corporation i believe that shows someone who can accept constructive criticism and as such may make a few more posts i dont know i know more than most people that ts is a trustworthy honest and straight up guy so i agree with you there they are often rare commodities in eve im sure people can point at mistakes he has made but im sure the same can be said of everyone
well i am not interested in folks who are just loud on the forums some can and do provide well thought out posts that aim to improve eve overall some ideas are crap some good many need tweaks and that is all fine the point is if ts has this wealth of ideas i would have liked to have seen them on the forums weird and wacky or not it is all good often just the kernel of a good idea is enough to get fleshed out by the community to something that worksts and to be fair other candidates are advertising their desire for a better eve but till now they seem to have mostly kept these pearls of wisdom to themselves supposedly ccp reads the forums and will pay attention to good ideas im not so sure they really do as i have seen numerous great ideas come and go with nothing from ccp heck people were pining for sec cans to get cleaned up and everyone liked the ideaonly took ccp 3 years to get around to it nevertheless i think a candidates bona fides for their concern for eve would be better served with a track record of trying such than what amounts to an advert and just hoping they actually have a clue
unfortunately those who have good ideas dont seem interested in this csm thing probably because it requires travel revealing rl info and more work than neccessaryfor me the best candidate would be one whos had it with ccps crap and would be almost hostile towards them not with language but in pursuing the issues and making sure that stuff finally gets done determining what the issues are is somewhat easy take any thread that reaches 10 pages in 2 days and theres an issue being discussed in there the problem is getting ccp to do anything about it fasti hate their soon policiesi hate that we still have this overview bug that hasnt been fixed yet
it was fun podding you in tpar as you left the station back when we were in cfs if you win the csm will you make yourself available for further podding at some point in the future
welcome to the party
