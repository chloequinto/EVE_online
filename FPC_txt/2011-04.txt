cautiously supporting thisat the very least it will save on clone costs
yes please
i can see the pointif youre a pvp pilot with mining skills cutting those skills could save you isk since you wont need that additional few million sp invested in skills you dont want or need it would also alter the character market by increasing the value on lower sp better specialized characters the ability for new players to remove partially trained skills such as shield hardening skills that they thought were a good idea and trained part way only to find themselves regretting lateri like the idea of stripping bad skills
yes supportedon top of that ccp has this habit of changing game mechanics and certain skill prerequisites so that having certain skills is pretty much useless but yes you still have to pay for them when updating your clone when your skill point pool becomes sufficiently large clones indeed become quite expensive example of such skill could be tactical shield manipulation 5 it was discussed in great depth on forums and i think everyone agrees that this skill is quite useless and in fact harmless to have at level 5 but some people still do have it as a relict from old times when it was prerequisite for capital shield operation so removing or at least downgrading this skill would be very nice so yes definitely supported
 need for more topography within null sec need for more content customization and progression within null sec need for more resources that can be attacked that will also generate conflict need for more pve and pvp diversity within null secproposal remove sovereignty bills and replace them with a new resource that powers all sovereignty upgrades and structures limit the total amount of the resource that is available within the universe in a manner that will balance the resources scarcity so that while alliances will have to watch their stores they will not be losing their sovereignty every other dayback story certain stars shed inordinate amounts of their mass via ejection or solar wind these stars are rare and vary in their outputs structures were constructed on these stars that would harvest hydrogen from the solar wind these structures were akin to giant ram scoops once they have collected the hydrogen they then refine it to usable concentrations some of the hydrogen is used along with energy generated from the sun to generate large quantities of antimatter hydrogen and antimatter were then packaged together into removable charges that could be transported to other structures that needed power these giant factories are still in operation within high security and low security space however they have fallen into disrepair in null security spaceantimatter fuel cells these are the fuel cells created by the stations in low orbit around the sun they cannot be stored for longer than 2 hours in anything other than a sovereignty structure using them the production facilities in which they are created or an auxiliary storage unit they destroy themselves after two hours they are large enough that only a handful of them at maximum can be crammed into the largest industrials each one can power a sovereignty structure for a given unit of time they deplete faster as you install more upgradesservicesproduction facility online you must install and online a command and control unit to online the facility this unit might take the same amount of time to online as a small pos module the facility begins producing annihilation batteries as soon as this structure is online the command and control module is immune to attack as long as the ihub within the system is also immune it may be attacked when after the system has been conquered once the system is conquered the command and control module may be destroyed and replaced any fuel cells stored within the facility will be saved as long as a new command and control module is onlined within 24 hours of the destruction of the previous one
production facility upgrades fuel cell storage modules increase the number of fuel cells that you can store duh hypothetical numbers you could install a max of 5 modules that double your storage capacity heat dissipation modules increase the production facilitys manufacturing rate so that you produce more fuel cells in a given 24 hour period hypothetical numbers 6 modules that represent 10 of total production each all of these modules may be attacked at any time their destruction would mean the immediate loss of storage capacity and destruction of fuel cells or the loss of production rate if they are destroyed then a repair order must be given from the command and control module in order to prepare for the installation of new modules this could possibly use other resources and should take at least 24 hours there is also the possibility of limiting the number of repair jobs that a command and control module can perform at any one time this would mean that 3 destroyed modules would require a cumulative 72 hours for all of them to be back online these modules are immune to all forms of electronic warfare they have a signature radius equivalent to a cruiser they orbit around the stations axis that is perpendicular to the suns surface this gives them a nonzero angular velocity they have a physical radius that precludes the use of fighters or fighter bombers upon them their ehp should be balanced so that a moderate sized gang would have the ability to destroy a small number of them within 10 to 20 minutes but that a larger gang would be necessary to destroy all of them within a reasonable amount of time attacking these modules would generate a warning mail to the owning alliance there could be a potential delay addedreinforcement the production facility could be given the ability to reinforce itself once every 24 hours for a maximum of 8 hours during this period all of the modules would be invulnerable to attack and the facility would burn strontium there would be a variance timer on the reinforcement mode of  36 hours the owning alliance would set the schedule for reinforcement mode
alternate sources of fuel cells these would most likely be necessary in order to allow new groups to begin their conquest of null sec wormholes anchor structures that produce very low amounts of fuel cells concord lp stores very limited amounts of cells from concord via lp and a sizeable isk portion theft from other alliances or npc structures in low security or null security space see belowother options and possibilities auxiliary storage unit that could be anchored at a moon but it would burn fuel cells to use these could be attacked and destroyed at any time resulting in a total loss of their contents we could also explore the possibility of being able to move these storage units from moon to moon or system to system with some sort of cool down player outposts could burn fuel cells the more services you have the more they burn jump bridges could burn fuel cells fuel cells could be stolen from storage units or the production facility i have not thought out a way to do this but it would be nice if it used hacking and was limited and controlled somehow it might be necessary to increase the amount of time fuel cells can be unplugged in order to foster their theft wormhole jam  could be a structure that you anchor at a wormhole it burns fuel cells it also keeps the wormhole open far beyond its mass and time limitsnew nullsec agent system
what alexandra stormwing said the dramiel is the fastest ship out there no need for a nerf to that because its not overpowered in its speed alone but its far too powerful to be that fast i think its power should be nerfedthe dramiel is like they took an interceptor and an assault ship and slapped em together with the best of both worlds and you get a dramiel but that wasnt enough so they had to let it field 3 drones sure it has trouble hitting stuff when its vroming around at the speed of sound everyone else has trouble hitting it i dont see whats wrong with thatalso i think the rifter is in need of a nerf theyre popular but i dont see them used perhaps as much as one might expect however ive used lots of frigates in various situations and the rifter is the one i keep coming back to its just got the best of so many things its pretty fast and with 3 low slots you can fit it to go almost as fast as a slasher or other fasttype t1 frigate but it still has a fair amount of powergrid and can fit a medium shield extender with autocannons and an afterburner i find that with this setup and with nanofiber internal structures in the lows and maybe a weapons upgrade or two its hard for other frigates or evens mall drones to hit me even though they cant do much damage to my rifter with that gigantic shield extender on it i can even sort of outrun heavy assault missiles while orbiting within range of my autocannons and firing at my target this also happens to be within the range needed to warp scramble them ive never tried fitting artillery and using a microwarpdrive flying in a wide orbit to allow my rifter to track with them but i know it can be cap stable doing that ill bet that is also an effective strategy and would be particularly good at dodging missiles stasis webifiers and drones
the daredevil and cruor both cost more and have strengths and weaknesses which can be exploited price shouldnt be the only balancing factor
do people realize a dramial is a faction pirate ship that is woth 100s of millions of iskif other frigs cost the same it would make sense they get the same stats
why do people always want balance whats the point of having 50 ships to fly if theyre all the same there is always a best ship drake being best bc for example this game has never had balance and never should attempt to eve is more like paper rock scissors everything has its counter
heres an idea nerf skilled pilots too if you get too many kills ccp should start lagging you out to balance you with others then everything would be balanced and everyone would be just as  as every one else
i think the problem with railguns is that their dps and tracking is similar to artillery while their fire rate is more like that of beam lasers this means theyre no good for alpha strikes but also no good for shooting small targets i think maybe the solution would be to increase their range then they become particularly useful for destroying drones and smaller ships at long range that will go well with gallente ships since the drones may have trouble hitting the smallest targetsalso many ships designed for hybrids simply do not have enough powergrid this needs to be seriously looked at a great example is the ferox which is almost always fit with missiles when it is used this is not only because even its battlecruiser skill bonus is inadequate to improve railguns to useful status but also because it simply does not have enough powergrid to fit a full rack of them it should lose a missile hardpoint or two and have its powergrid increased by at least 10 i thinkalso i noted that the largest battleship railgun has substantially longer range than any other railgun even its other battleship size counterparts i wonder if that has anything to do with why the rokh is often considered the only good railgun platform since its the only battleship that has a hybrid weapon range modifier that plus the additional range of the battleship size weapon may redeem it
i think it would be neat to have some modules fit best in between frigates and cruisers or in between cruisers and battleships the benefits are twofold in that they can be used on a destroyer or battlecruiser when the frigate or cruiser modules are not enough or that they can be used on a cruiser or battleship when a pilot wants a smaller less resourceintensive moduletake for example3mn afterburner i  20 tf cpu and 20 mw powergrid  40 gj activation cost  4500000 n thrust and 1500000kg mass addition3 mn microwarpdrive i  35 tf cpu and 45 mw powergrid  90 gj activation cost  4500000 n thrust and 1500000kg mass addition30 mn afterburner i  38 tf cpu and 168 mw powergrid  160 gj activation cost  45000000 n thrust and 15000000kg mass addition30 mn microwarpdrive i  68 tf cpu and 413 mw powergrid  360 gj activation cost  45000000 n thrust and 15000000kg mass additionor consider shield extenders vs armor plates armor plates have inbetween sizes but shield extenders do not with the exception of the micro also the largest shield extender large shield extender is a comfortable size for a battlecruiser and a medium shield extender is a comfortable size for a destroyer i find it hard to choose between the two when fitting a cruiser as the large may take too much valuable powergrid but the medium doesnt boost shields by a very significant amount and there is no shield extender that does much for a battleship in contrast to the 1600mm armor plates which are most certainly too large for a battlecruiser to fit comfortably it would be nice to add more sizes to shield extenders such that they are similar to armor platesas a final example but not necessarily having covered all reasonable possibilities for destroyer and battlecruiser sized modules the armor shield and energy repair and transfer modules often times i find myself feeling that the correctsized module for my ship is too weak and i dont have room to fit 2 of them i certainly cant fit the next size up there have even been a few occasions in which i wanted to put one onto a tight ship fit but didnt have enough powergrid to do so i could fit the next size down but its usually so pathetic that it just fills the slot and doesnt really do anything those times i wish i had something inbetween the standard modulesthat is all tell me your thoughts on this proposal do you like it dislike it do you think itll affect the balance of the game do you have thoughtsideas to improve it maybe you have an even better idea to solve the same problemps i want to stress that i do not think there should be destroyer or battlecruiser size weapons or drones destroyers and battlecruisers have solved that problem by having more weapon slots than their frigate and cruiser counterparts they are gunboats pure and simple and their smaller cousins are for strategic uses battleships are too large to be similarly strategic and so are generally just gun boats exceptions to this rule are such as the scorpion which is a strategic powerhouse of sorts which is fitting for a large ship other than that large strategic ships are capital ships
think some more with stats like these the speed boost of mwd on bc will be about 1200 and ppl will be fitting these on cruisers too especially ab with speed boost of 600 on cruiser and no sigcap penalty second nanoage all over again
refine it a bit and then yes im game for this
i agree in a slightly different way modules could possibly not have ship sizes as such but a wider variety nd you can fit what you want if you can do itie why not have a frigate that is moded up to just go very fast cpu and pg upgrades and a oversized mwd it wont be able to do much other than go very fast indeedor possibly a cruiser that has a single 1400 arty on it its just a weapon platform for that gunobviously that is very extreme ideas but th eidea would allow a gretaer variation in ships that we seei agree with your idea of having mid size stuff for when you want somethign just a little different more variety  more fun
ive often wondered about this same thing a more overall variety would be nice it would definitely shake up the style of fittings we see eft warriors would have a fitting frenzy as long as the numbers on the new mods were properly proportioned i dont see anything wrong with it youd also have a market frenzy too but more options is always better supported
i had the same idea during my first month of evewhile i see the merit for allowing more fitting variety the downside far outweight the theoretical benefit the existing ship classes are quite well balanced around the 3 sizes for propulsion systems making changes to that would require a huge amount rebalancing work for many ships if it aint broken dont fix it
ironically enough minigin has yet to figure out that lying and trolling while complaining about accurate accusations of lying and trolling is not strictly speaking intelligent
what
eve would make a unique social experiment to determine if there is any truth behind dunbars number dont you thinkperhaps they need a group psychologist in addition to their economist 
its not about dunbars number though with regard to the members of the coalitions just with regards to how many leaders of various alliances form relationships they also dont have to be social relationships ruthlessly selfinterested folks wholl work things out to their mutual advantage dont have to be interested in each other socially any more than the board of directors of a fortune 500 have to want to have coffee with each other after work
you literally cant be seriousthere is no way
sanctums are easy btw for most well trained characters more stuff should exist that is harder from my experience its a rarity to find any kind of cosmic signature usually its a gaymetric site or a wormhole a system should be able to accommodate more not less a system in null sec should be possible to have 100 or more living in it that would take pressure off clusters in highsecnull sec already has quite a bit of conflict and i doubt making the majority of it worthless aint going to help neither would it encourage more to be in it
ironically the changes show how little forethought and analysis goes into some of ccps change as of laet dominion comes and were assured that theyre going to change things so that its easier to claim sov and so that more pilots can pack themselves into a smaller amount of space but even ignoring broken upgrades it turns out that you really cant support many pilots per system and the megahp on sov structures means that if you dont have all night to fight unopposed you need serious muscle and numbers andor supers so their proposed fix for this is to further reduce the number of pilots who can occupy an alliances space and make isk at the optimal rate its like trying to nail jello to the wall
this just in the nc knows their truesec sucks spare us the fake concern for the game if anything the ncs response is a good indication that ccp is right on the money with this change
trolling by using a fake quote instead of addressing my actual argument refusing to address my actual argument about the principles behind sandbox play and pretending that its fake concern so you can handwave it away a catch 22 whereby if people agree then youre right and if they disagree than that just proves youre right even more and of course a strange fascination and obsession with the nc out of all coalitions and potential coalitions shocka
i agree somewhat i think the solution would be a bit more complex but the basic idea is right its too easy for supercarriers they should be worth their money but not solopwnmobiles
rather than immunity give supercaps large values for sensor strength  warp stability theyre big they should be strong  just not invulnerable allow ships with siegetriage modules to gain superhigh sensor strength while siegedadd a new ewar module or script for ecm that will reduce the drone control number or bandwidth of the targeted ship thus you can shut down a supercarrier or drone sniper dominix by removing its ability to control dronesturn the super carriers primary strength into its primary weakness
i think the problem is that players vote for candidates who have lousy platforms voting players dont understand what the csm does and they vote for the wrong candidates top winner is a good example
umadbro
they could include an editor that allows you to create skins for your ships that will show on your computer alone and your friends could have the option to download the skins you made such that they can see your unique personalized ship skin
supported
that sounds like a complete waste of developer time go play a singleplayer game
the problem with this is that players could grief other players by creating a hundred trial accounts and using them to grief people without costing training time or real money then again the same can be done with rookie shipspersonally i feel that there should be an advanced shuttle that comes with your choice of a high slot and turret hardpoint a medium slot or a low slot and a small amount of cpu and powergrid it should be a bit slower and larger than the standard shuttle and obviously much more expensive though still it doesnt have to cost very much it would be a good way to transport cheaply through dangerous territory and still have fitting options
hulk drones would easily kill shuttle but i agree that shuttle seems too boring and should have some slots i think it would probably serve better as a quick duelingtransport ship for ppl to quickly get used to combatlosing cheap shipsmaybe even a good lvl1 mission runner or a transport for dust ppl
dont forget a noob ship can do what i suggested but better 2 guns with a mid and a low and a droneall i want is a lol ship to fly around shooting laz0rs that has an almost insta warp
you seem to be of the misinformed mindset that not many people spend their time in this game griefing others alreadybattleshuttles
not supporteda shuttles only purpose is to get the pilot from point a to point b
almost instawarp is the key while i dont think it would be gamebreaking to give shuttles a very very small armament they warp so fast and are so cheap that they need to not have much a rookie ship can fight a hell of a lot better than a shuttle but it cant warp nearly as fast
if you want a shuttle with fittings get a frig the faster frig of each race fitted with speed mods can reach the same speed and agility or more as a shuttleinterceptor even more so the fact it can be used for combat doesnt mean it cant be used for a speedy luxury ride
so its simple some of us will never sell or transfer our characters at all and some of us want extra security on our accountsso i propose that a flag system be put in place ie a lock to prevent any of your chars on an account being tranferred edit this lock would not be permanent to unlock a character for either biomass or transfer a grace period would be put into place say 14 days pending a quick investigation into the legitimacy of the unlock this is about the average time to recover a hacked account subsequently  unlock procedure would require a set of security questions to assure account ownership or use of those spiffy key lock usb things that were mentioned at fanfestbenifits  prevents hackers from stealing your account and trying to sell your characters for iskyour character will always be on that accountpeace of mindcons  a pain in the butt to unfreeze however people dont mind this if they want to keep their characters secure  other options  make an intensive questionaire and or something else to unlock the character later of if you want to transfer themdiscuss
i dont think a permanent character lock is appropriate but i do like putting a lock on your characters that impose extra clicks and difficulties to biomass andor transfer a character
y not
the problem is that a player could train a character down one path and then sack them and make a new one that instatrains down a new path i wouldnt have a problem with it as long as there is a substantial loss of sp like 50 and that there is also a maximum redemption rate like a million sp per week or if one drawback were increased the other could be reduced or even removedperhaps just allow the account to keep all of the sp and instatrain all of the same skills that the sacked character had or alternatively and for skills already learned or not elligible the sp can be redeemed gradually by allowing the redeeming character to train twice as fast until no extra sp are left to give out
i see what you mean i would be okay to somewhat of a drawback
hey bob i know we just had a corp thief xxdeathkillergoatxx steal all our assets but it looks like he biomassed his account immediately any idea what happened to all our cool stuffdunno ralph but i just totally saw a titan sailing across the system piloted by a 24h old character
lol but if we made an sp penalty as mentioned above say between 3050 that would negate thatmostly
i think the time factor is more important even if you got to keep 25 of the characters sp it could be enough to fit up the perfect skills needed to do something terrible and leave others with no way to track youwhat if you got to keep all the sp but simply only was able to apply it as fast as your normal sp 2x training speed till its used up how does that sound
given that you can transfer characters between accounts for a paltry sum the only on the same account argument seems fundamentally flawednot supported
seriously no because it would be too easy to create a character biomass collect sp rinse repeat even with a reduction people all over would abuse this to no end a terrible idea same with microtransactions for sp its just another way to cheat the system and thats what eve is not about thank goodness youll just have to put your time in just like everyone else so deal with it not supported
so i buy a cheap character with crap training in the exchange biomass him and use that sp to boost my own mainor im maxed willpowerperception instead of waiting for a remap i just take an alt character train up any crap skill with his own maxed attributes biomass him and use that sp to quick train skills with other primarysecondary attributes
no no and no if that were to happen everyone would have maximum sp by the end of the month
buy highsp character on bazaar transfer to my account biomass character and add their sp to my ownno would never be exploited at all
rather pay 10 per m sp and do what i want with and yes i would get full sp where i want in a few days so whatyoure the first ones saying sp is not important and that a low sp char can do the same thing or catch an older one fast so shut up
if i recall biomassing characters just sends them to a special npc corp and also repeated biomassing of characters will get you account bannedlastly no no and never going to happen
sp is important in the sense that it allows one character more diverse skills to choose from once that character enters a ship and fits modules then no all that sp doesnt really matter and a low sp char can catch upso you shut up
worst idea ever
id totally keep buying 50100m characters to biomass and make one super character with all skills in game
yes
then makes sense now didntsolution give that game more sense
hello there first of all something about myself i play this game since 2004 i was involved in almost every aspect of eve in last couple of years my job got overly demanding so i just couldnt make enough time for it well thanks to the world economy i am unemployed for a while so a month ago i emerged myself in this awesome game again this time sick of pew pew i tried something new i went all in sold my characters and seeing how that can be a lucrative business i started to buy and sell lowmid sp chars with some minimal margin and as i have a nice amount of isk i also deal in large scale trading if you bought anything in jita in last month you have bought something from me  only reason i am telling this is so i can assure all of you that this post is not about isk i invest 210 bil per day have around 40 bil in orders and assets atm and 10bil in wallet just in case now to get to the point  i had some issues with selling one of my characters lately i will link that forum thread so i can keep this one as short as possible herei might broke some rule with placing char that was still in corp at that time which i announced on thread and ingame to buyer but you can see it in every other thread people decide to sell char enter stasis and post sale add and sometimes you get bo so soon that char is still in corporate stasis and i linked some ingame logs so i can prove my point to all the flamers and to cover my back which was apparently also a mistake so to summarise buyer placed a deposit for my char made me reject other offers and to close the thread since character was purchased as you can see in that thread he also lied to me and wasted my time not to mention ruining my sale so i tried to be a man i stuck to a deal and offered after all that fuss to finalise the sale that was also rejected so i wanted to punish his insolence by keeping the deposit there is no single rule that defines does ccp allow deposit or their point of view on it now to the punch line i petitioned it ofc and i sadly dint have gms permission to paste that conversation here because apparently some things ccp want to keep in grey zone i asked if the other party was even getting a warning for what he did but didnt get answer about it only reply i got is to send isk back because of this rule that i have to paste here since it can affect character market in general a rule that isnt posted anywhere  its completely fine to go back on a deal as long as its made clear and that anything exchanged is being returned  so why am i making this thread simple with this rule ccp completely cover the back of ppl who can influence character bazaar and to warn all of you who are selling their character i will give you an example i have a 50mil sp char that i want to sell for lets say 1315 bil i browse the market before i put the add find all characters that can be direct competition and place a false high bids i contact seller in game and i outbid everyone offering 2 3 5 bil more depending on sp and post a lofty deposit promising completion of trade in day week whatever without direct competition i have now maximised possibility of selling my char for intended price and with successful trade i just withdraw offers and deposits because ccp got my back before you flame this i have to explain something everyone is this game is after getting money whatever you are spending it on or investing or if you simply want to fill that wallet till it explode we all want to make a good deal and amass wealth so majority of ppl will wait for some time if they can get even more than the highest amount they hoped for for their character who would turn down couple or several extra bil continued
as i said that sum i have returned is less then 5 of what i have it is insignificant to me and the other party didnt even get a warning this is not about the money this is about absolutely no protection for me or you as a seller of character against this exploit of rules that are not defined anywhere which can interrupt or stop your sale completely so ccp please make all of your rules available to everyone try to fill in the loopholes put more ppl on thread moderation i am still waiting 5 days since i reported for someone to lock that thread give some love to this high end trade that you earn money from i just had to get this out there sincerely dragic mile
so have you returned his isk yet
yes ofc gm ordered me to
did you escalate the petition to a senior gm
gm assigned was kind to inform me that i am obligated to return isk or to suffer the consequences i am parphrising since i have no permision to quote or paste our conversationi dont want to risk the ban because i know ccp will not be on my side here no matter if am the one getting screwedi just have to show this rule again if you ppl missed it in original postits completely fine to go back on a deal as long as its made clear and that anything exchanged is being returnedcan you ppl tell me if you have seen this anywhere anyone
i have seen this here why is this horror show in this forumwhat has been seen etc
i started this proposal because i have noticed that the ores in different faction quadrants of new eden have very disproportionate market values and because i believe i know the answer to balancing their market values from a general standpoint thats not to say that ore prices wont fluctuate and that ore from one quadrant can be expected to be the same value of ore from another quadrant however at current yields pyroxeres and kernite will always be more valuable than their counterparts plagioclase and omber regardless of the market value of the minerals they yieldi figured out what caused this when i made a chart of mineral yield for my own personal reference i charted the yield of each specific mineral by volume as it is mined and compared all of the ores together sidebyside here are some interesting figuresomber yields more isogen than any other ore and virtually insignificant amounts of anything elseplagioclase yields more mexallon than any other ore slightly more than half as much pyerite as scordite the largest pyerite yielder and a virtually insignificant amount of tritaniumnow here is the important partkernite yields about 80 as much mexallon as plagioclase and about 85 as much isogen as omber for this reason kernite will always be substantially more valuable than either plagioclase or omber unless either mexallon or isogen is many many times more valuable than the other which is virtually nigh impossible to happen due to the commonness of all three ores which yield these mineralspyroxeres yields several minerals about 30 of the tritanium of veldspar top tritanium yielder about 20 of the pyerite of scordite about 55 of the mexallon of plagioclase almost 40 of the nocxium of hemorphite top nocxium yielderthe high nocxium yield is the primary reason pyroxeres tends to have a high value but it gives a lot of mexallon as well so even if mexallon gets very expensive pyroxeres will likely still cost more than plagioclase at current nocxium prices are higher than ever causing pyroxeres to be the most valuable highsec ore by a substantial margin even surpassing kernitethe solution heres what i think should be done its just a rough sketch done by a mere player but i hope it helps or gives some insight into other possible solutionsreduce the nocxium yield of pyroxeres substantially perhaps by as much as two thirds or three fourths this will cause lowsec and nullsec ores which are high in nocxium to become more valuable and they will provide for the galaxys nocxium needs pyroxeres will still yield more than enough nocxium for most cheap industry such as industrials cruisers and ammunitionreduce the mexallon yield of kernite a lot perhaps by half and the isogen yield by a smaller amount maybe a quarter pyroxeres yields a fair amount of mexallon already but the main concern with kernite is that its yield is so high in mexallon and isogen that one ship mining it is almost equivalent to two ships mining plagioclase and omber sidebyside alternatively the solution could be to increase the yield of isogen from omber and mexallon from plagioclase or perhaps do both solutions to a smaller extentif these changes were made there would no longer be such a huge difference between mining in one quadrant versus the next one over and miners would not feel obligated to travel across the galaxy and mine in crowded areas just to get the most isk per hour
another option people should stop buying so many noctises until the noctis came along the value of hisec ores was pretty much plagioclase then scordite kernite pyrox omberin the meantime miners interested in making the most iskhr will move to where the more valuable ores are located
this is like asking the sec to fix the pershare price of stocks in the us in order to balance the various industries the stock market serveswhy should ccp implement metacontrols to control pricing it goes against everything they say they stand for as far as the sandbox concept is concerned game balance means that everyone can have a realistic shot at achieving something it doesnt meant hat they are entitled to have access to everything that everyone else has given to them
pretty sure in char bazzar there are chars been bought and sold all day long every day if you looked at the thread and had a little read properly you would see the link for the trade etc please dont flame while making your self look a bit of a tard regardsdeep
hint its not bagehi whos looking like a tard
file a petition you will get no help on this issue here unfortunately
you can talk to my member
this doesnt belong here wheres moderation when we need it
seems reasonable as long as the option is unintrusive
indeed i would see it as just 2 extra lines added to the same window where you put collateral and payment amounts if you were adding no bonus you would just leave both the bonus and time lines blank
nifty option
supported why not the same for item exchange contracts too
there is only 1 fix in 10 years or at the least 5 cpu architecture will be much better with the increased overall capability to do more work per cycle or more cycles  mhz  you will have basically lag free blob fights ccp knows it and nerds like me know it aswell they are optimizing the code and making it better which is fantastic they are doing a wonderfull job i started playing this game in 04 and the lag was omg there is 200 in local lag cant do anything ccp has done a fantastic job whiners wanna whine ccp you guys have done great o if you do not like the game send me all your stuff and log off 
i agree that performance will be significantly higher and that ccp is doing a good job but merely optimizing and increasing cpu power is not fixing the lag wich you should know as you proclaim yourself a nerd  cpu performance scales aritmetically while load scales geometrically 2000 ships shooting each other is significantly more demanding than 2 ships shooting each other x 1000and do you apply the attitude if you do not like it in real life as well meaning that instead of voting againts some political party you move away from your country
the core of the problem as i understand it is the inability of the eve core system to handle massive concurrency and take full advantage of parallel processing the code needs a mockup along with continual hardware upgrades
i just read this dev blog yesterday it made me very hopeful for a lag free future dev blog of hopeenjoy

forum whine
all niiiiiight long 
this should be very concerningthere are people who can help you with this
see consider the possibilities sure the specifics can be hammered out i just like the aesthetics of a personal shield tbh id be okay with pvp being very very hard on highsec decks say for example you have something like 15 seconds after drawing a special concealed weapon to get off a shot and if your target is tanked in any way you almost definitely cant kill him but im sure ccp can work out the nitty gritty who am i kidding im sure that the csm can help ccp work out the nitty gritty and point out any truly pantsonhead ideas
points 1 and 2 are key i think this proposal makes a lot of sense and i wholeheartedly agree with it also i like the idea of gradually improving it not just because it shouldnt happen all at once but also because stupid alliances not listing any names may venture into new space and frivolously spend billions and billions of isk to get its indexes up really high without even hanging out for a bit to make sure its actually going to be a good home and that isk comes from the taxes that we the members of such alliances payif you have zero incentive to move into that space then dont move into it by stabilizing everything you decrease the overall motion and war over sovereignty i guess it would work in a happy friendly game but not in eveps somebody failed macroeconomics not mentioning any names
i think that would be awesome sir
the anomaly change hurts the south far more than the nc hope that helps
as long as we have our technetium they cant
well i mean way back in the day it wasnt as if there were still coalitions and alliances who fought as a team but they just belt ratted a lot if their members needed isk and oh
take a look at dek truesec why would he be crying
we are like the one 00 alliance who benefits from that change
well it looks like youll get a chance to do exactly that unless you ragequit
gross
au contraire its fkin epic
im not sure i want to be represented by someone who would substitute roasted garlic for fresh garlic on whale steak
1 for being awsomeand for having a double post about the pos issue in a topic dedicated to getting rid of double posts how awsome is that
supportedthis should have been done 30 months ago but it died
supportedat the same time i dont think ccp will push the 6 month expantion to 9 because its on the box at best buy
your math is right but consider all the items to close distance take a bit of very simple strategy into account and the argument will not hold watter
yes ccps job is to ignore you and take your money anywayp
and since feedback is useless you can all ways post here if you have some time to waste the main problem being the we blasterrails players cant enjoy the gameho when i mean we im not talking for 1 nerds really playing with rails and saying to everyone and their cat theyre fine those ones should just stop drugs im talking about all other that post here saying some things wrong and who devs dont give a  about
so there i was in my blaster ship going toward the enemy npc i wanted to kill i wasnt in range i wasnt in range i wasnt in range then suddenly i was but before i could fire i bounced off his ship and was out of range again i tried to crawl my ship slowly into range of him but he just flew away so i chased him and matched his speed and with his virtually nonexistant ai he flew in a straight line and i got in range hit glancing blow with tungsteni had my blaster cruiser in a level 4 mission it was probably an ishtar or something and this machariel npc was orbiting me at like 3km it was hitting me but i couldnt hit it dunno why i was in rangeand then one time i was firing rail guns from a battlecruiser at level 3 mission frigates i popped a few but they closed into range and i had to get em with my drones but the real reason im mentioning this is cause i tried to kill one of those defender thoraxes and it just wouldnt die every shot took out like 75 of its armor but it just repaired it again before the next shot hit well i would have got it eventually but it started orbiting me within 20km and i couldnt track it anymore my max range is 40kmbut seriously folks a friend of mine bought several eagles on the market and reprocessed them to sell the stuff he made several hundred million isk in profit true storyalso true is that all good ferox fits use only missiles and they all fit on a drake
i think its a great idea it could save you from having to upgrade your clone and maybe keep you from loosing a skill you really want to keep a worthless one
the need is so that the op can transport his capital skill books on human mules free of any risk
yes i absolutely agree thanks for the comment
completely agree
a terrible idea i fail to see why people keep whining about things like this why would you want to remove a skill you trained it is not like its hurting you to be there decreasing clone costs rofl like people would delete enough sp to make that much of a difference in clone cost who would delete millions of sp worth of skills
i dont see why people think it will give anyone any unfair advantage it will not end of story there is no possible way it could do thatnow while i think theres absolutely no problem with implementing it i also think it would be silly to do i just cant understand people valuing a slightly cheaper clone over those useful sideskillssupported even if only slightly though i have no opposition to it
you dont know what the word balance means
i too have access to all of the frigs in the game with near max skillsdramiels are killing frig pvp please give them an exploitable weakness like the other faction frigs have
overdue dramiel nerf is overdue
wow i never expected to get this many replies thanks everyone for the comments feedback and supportid like to iterate a few points1 a lot of you are suggesting that there should be a discount for having the other characters running on the same account true you get the advantage of being able to run two characters at once if you use a separate account however if you put the character on the same account you can stop training it stop paying extra and still use it therefore i think it is nice to have this strategic decision available to the players and i think it would encourage slightly higher profits for ccp and that is why i think there should be no discount for training additional characters on one account also it just keeps things simple and simple things are much easier to implement2 some of you mentioned this being like microtransactions i submit to you that you can already pay to have two characters and you can even run them at the same time simply by having them on separate accounts this gives all of the benefits and more than you would get from training an alt on the same account the key difference with training the alt on the main account is being able to play the character after you cease training it and keeping things simple for folks who dont want to keep track of more than one accountand in response to mara rinn sometimes an inconvenience requires you to take a different path to accomplish what you want sometimes it prevents you from taking that path entirely it is the goal of the company that makes the game not only to make the game difficult in many aspects but also to make it capable in many aspects i think the differences between training an alt on the main account and on a new account allow for plenty of strategizing without forcing the player to cease training on the main character however thats still an option so it gives players more choices to ponderps i disagree 100 with the notion that ccp ought to allow two characters on the same account to be run at the same time there are lots of potential problems with this not to mention that it only costs 5 activation fee to start a separate account instead i dont believe ive ever heard of a paytoplay mmo in which you are allowed to have more than one character on the same account ingame at the same time and theres plenty of good reason for that
it doesnt have to be those specific stats the idea is to have a more powerful version that is better suited to destroyers and battlecruisers the main reason i bring up the abs and mwds is that a destroyer fit with a frigate module or a battlecruiser fit with a cruiser module does not get its full effect theyll get about an 80 speed boost from an afterburner or a 350 speed boost from a microwarp drive with the higher powergrid requirements itll be kind of tight to fit the larger modules on the smaller ships also you have the mass increase to worry about itll hurt less on the already massive destroyer or battlecruiser but on a frigate or cruiser it can really screw with their agilityi think that also takes care of what aineko macx said true ccp would have to fiddle around with the settings a bit and do some testing to make sure nothing is overpowered but i think itll naturally balance itself for the most part as the mass addition thing is really the mediatoras it stands you can fit a 10mn afterburner to a frigate and run it for quite a long time but the frigates agility goes way down while its active a frigate with a destroyer ab would go pretty fast but not as fast as it would with a frigate mwd and a frigate with a destroyer mwd would firstly have to have a lot of powergrid but secondly would need a lot of capacitor bonuses or a capacitor booster and would not have much powergrid left for anything else also it would be pretty inagile despite going so fast it would travel much faster than a destroyer with the same module but would actually turn slower because of this it could not make quick tiny circles around other ships like it can with a frigate mwdps due to the masses and sizes of destroyers and battlecruisers in comparison to their frigate and cruiser counterparts it might make more sense for the thrust and mass addition to be multiplied by 2 instead of by 3 no need to have frigates travelling in a straight line going 12kms or destroyers that can go fast but cant turn
so does anyone know how good the ded attractor ihub upgrade is
all i ever hear from you is im really bad at actually playing this game i need it stacked in my favouryou are not and never were entitled to sanctums or jumpbridges it was lucky you got them at all time to grow up and realise how bad they are for the game
upgraded systems can support more pilots than nonupgraded systems ratting anomalies and belts produces a decent income while still being available for defense roams cta and other interaction with people in nullsec switching to a jump clone or missionrunning alt in hisec means you are not available for null sec operations the tradeoff is clear and the current iskfaucet runs much faster than predominionthis part of sov mechanics is certainly quite broken and any future development must address the issue ensure that the issue is brought up by itself in the assembly hall and you will receive plenty of support from sensible players the change to anomalies appears to be an attempt to close of a huge isk faucet the messaging from the economist has consistently been more blowing stuff up less pouring money in that greyscale assumes reducing the spread of lucrative systems will increase conflict rather than driving iskthirsty pilots to hisec is unfortunate on the positive side knowing that the pilots left carebearing in nullsec are the ones too lazy to move back to hisec means there are more opportunities for cheap supercarrier kills
well yeah there are advantages to rattingrunning omnomnomnoms in nullsec but the point is that ccp claimed they were aiming specifically and deliberately increase the carrying capacity of nullsec space and are now doing literally the exact opposite and both times theyve claimed that the action and its diametric opposite is for the health of the game theyre rather obviously making it up as they go along im also sure that the sov grind will be dealt with sooner or later the csm is hardly unaware of how awful it is especially since many of the delegates have participated inled those godawful sovbashing sessions that id wager will be a fairly high priority for them i do think however that youre missing some important facts about iskmaking even if we ignore ccps bizarre rationalizations for their actions your average pilot can have a lvl4 mission alt and pay for it with plex without ever having to take their main out of 00 space for a minute even if they are in empire with their main it really doesnt take much time to get back home i can get from curse to hw in about 30 minutes and thats when im war decd and not setting the autopilot before i go to sleep or have dinner or whatever the problem there is that while it may potentially serve as a conflictdriver i really dont see it doing all that much we had coalitions and massive alliances before sanctums theres no reason to think that we wont even after the changes go through
thisalso im reading everything you type as though you spoke that way honestly its taking me far too long to even read one sentence it takes me longer to read one independent clause than it should to read a full paragraphyou do not have to type like this it is simply incorrect it is difficult to understand how you do not realize that you are the one who is typing incorrectly
and representative democracy is even worse dont be a moron
think about all those matter that dont interest even 10 of total population what would you think a vote for this matter would look likethis csm has 2 or 3 interesting persons inside everything else its just the result of nerds vote incapable to speakwriteread correctly their own language but its the mirror of this game like it or not its a fact
clearly shuttles need a doomsday death ray not a gatling pulse laserimma firen mah lazor bbllaaaahhhhhh
support id never sell any of my characters as i trained them all from scratch
you raise a nice counter point if i may offer a different pointwhat about a grace period with email verification and or 10 day waiting period on transfers
thats a reasonable compromise tho you cant call it permanent anymore supported
supported with the inclusion of a preferably longer than this waiting period to unlock a character im thinking closer to a month
i like it
i like this added security
ok edited the original post giving a larger grace period and other precautionsmostly this is for the security of accounts and characters isk and ships can always be replaced years of work cannot be
no commit to a character and deal with consequences
with their mass and signature radius they can be warped to instantly if a ship can lock onto a cyno lightyears away in a different system then surely they can lock onto a supercapital in the same system the fleet with the supercapitals can still defend themselves and fit the supercapital with a cloak but at least then it would take longer for them to ez gank and therefore allow more time for an enemy fleet to enter the system and attack
oh and that way its more likely it will be caught rather than having it hide in a safespot without the need for a cloak and then their more agile ships just simply run
rofl this is soo failur ships long range sensors are tuned to detect cosmic and celestial bodies ie things with insane mass and things producing a rediculous amount of energy and a super is neither of those things compared to either the size of a planet or moon or the energy expendature per second to light a beacon thats seen for 100s of lightyearsso on a purely technicallogical level your proposal doesnt work and in terms of a game element its sooo fail too youd have soo many pos kills from people warping to low sec poss that a super would cyno to so this is either a urgh i got d by a nyx rage post or an i have a nyx bt no skills yet to use it well bt want to see ships die near me post ill let the rest of us pick which one seems more likelyo
i disagree with geeshizzle maccloud but i also disagree with this proposal its a cool idea but it screws with too much balance in another game perhaps
ive read your op several times and im still struggling to figure out what happened and why youre complaining are you stating that people should be allowed to refuse to return isk following the collapse of a deal in the character bazaar despite the absolutely no scams rule
i think he is stating that there is a problem with people making bogus offers in order to influence character trades either preventing them by making a deal with the seller and then backing out or making bids on your own character to bring up pricenot that this is news to anyone or that anything could be done about it
i would also point out that a very petty player could play the market with such a rule for exampleplayer a sells an item for 15mplayer b buys item for 15m because he thinks he can make a proffitmarket drops for itemplayer b is now at a loss but thanks to this rule he can cut losses by demanding a refund from player ai wouldent say good post but it is an interesting post
sorry boys and girls if i didnt make myself clear english is not my primary language and i struggle a bit to explain this complex situation properly i will try to simplify it and use my best english here  i make a deal with you to buy your character i promise you enormous buyout 20 more than character is worth i deposit lets say 5 bil to you so you can close auction and announce that character is sold and i promise the rest of money in hourdayweek thing is now i can just drop out of a deal and ccp will order you to return that isk to me so you are at major loss there you canceled your auction you rejected other buyers and your time is completely wasted thats what i am talking about i hope it is easier to understand now because that happened to me i had a buyer for my character i rejected other offers this dude place deposit and back out of the deal so i lose isk chance to sell character and precious time and after that i am obligated to return deposit to other party that sabotaged my auctionand to gypsio iiiwhere do you see a scam there
the reason for the rule is fairly simple to avoid isk selling if people were allowed to keep the deposit money using the character bazaar to launder isk would be extremely easy start sale accept security deposit from isk seller then the character buyer cancel the trade you keep the isk a nice exchange of isk without any trade but the isk buyer would try the excuse i was selling a character the other side cancelled the deal but i am keeping the security
for those of you that dont know the concept that eve is a sandbox is a lie this is a quote from one of the wose situations look into it and you will find similar situations have happened a on a few occationsi feel that this is not right i understand that eve is the intellectual property if such things are required for the devolpers to run their story line then so be it i would ask that they do something to prevent players from being cheated out of theirtime and resourcesdisclaimer the oppenions stated are my own and not my alliance or corps
given the ridiculous tilting of the riskreward balance toward hisec in incursions as well as these events and most of eve for the last few years i have a hard time giving a rats assyou picked the losing side do better next timevery little in hisec is sandbox anyway concords tyrannical brownshirts always defeat the low status freedom fighters fascist hisec mission runners and miners always dominate the peaceful npc peoples and asteroids why should this be different
if you choose to support the obvious bad guy destined to lose because that is your own fault not ccpthe thing you dont get is sansha kuvakeis idea is 1 fundamentally stupid which is why nietzsche wrote a satire about it 2 if kuvakei won and his vision came to fuition the game would end 3 sansha sympathisers actually lost fair and square the only way it was rigged was through their own poor judgement or ignorance 4 despite that some sansha sympathisers did get it and played along anywaythe people that dont get it didnt really follow the story line were chasing what they though would easy capital bpcs whine and whinge because they made the wrong choiceyou cannot blame ccp for your own ignorance
i agree that hybrids are normally a bit on the weak side but you forget something almost all gellente ships are good drone boats ever see what 5 tech two orgers do for dps might want to look at your fits and skills the guns by them selfs arnt all gellente do
okay besides that fact that youre missing the ops point of his post i dont know if youre serious when you said that but only 4 ships of the gallente lineup domi ishtar myrm and vexor have a bonus to drones every other gally ships drones are the same as any other races drones fieldedlets take bss for example most of them have at least 75mb for drones 3 ogres iis if you want and many have more drone bandwidth than that take a typhoon for example has 125mb 5x heavies which is the same as a mega and more than a hype and can use nongimped guns or missilesthat means drone dps is comparable among all races on unbonused shipsyou cant argue that hybrids are fine due to gally having drones because all races have drones dont forget that caldari use hybrids as their main turret as wellincidentally thats all somewhat beside the point as the op was merely using that unresolved topic as an example for the fact that there isnt enough feedback from the devs on what we write here
well actually this forum is for the community to communicate with the csm im sure the devs read it on occasion but csm is supposed to be prioritizing from the input to present to ccp the ah is also a way to watch the csm to see if their presenting the communities agenda or their own
i think the problem lies here and it lies with the representatives people voted for we got some good ones and some bad ones but overall it doesnt look like the vote accomplished all that muchif you havent taken the time to consider several candidates and if you dont know what it is that the csm does then you should not vote its not hard to do too many people think the csm makes changes they do not too many csm representatives even dont know what the csm doesfor the love of all thats holy and not the amarrian goddess please research your candidate before you votei know its a little late now to say this but maybe i can awaken a few people in time for next election
i think the assembly hall is problematic because it implies a parlimentary system that can get results the csm backlog has something like 210 upvoted issues on it in theory team bff is going to be going through these and focusing on them which is good however the very structure of the assembly hall is something that causes disgust and anger towards the csm it implies legislation it implies that you can mash thumbs up and something will happen  and then when it doesnt happen or dies in the backlog after a csm upvote the entire process loses legitimacy as i said when i ran for office the csm is a focus group we have methods were investigating to increase its power and influence but if you look at the assembly hall you walk away with the impression that the csm can ram through game design changes which it mostly cannot

i dont enjoy pointing the finger but your figures are absolutely wrong the noctis did indeed have a strong impact on ore prices as did hulkageddon but before the noctis was introduced kernite was by a significant margin the top value highsec ore pyroxeres was second plagioclase was third followed finally by your generic scordite and veldspar omber was the least valuable ore i have been watching ore prices pretty closely for almost as long as i have been playing this gameand your second point about miners moving to where the most valuable ores are to be had is the very problem it causes them all to bunch up in amarr space because that is always has been and always will be where the most valuable ore is many miners are confused by the numbers and get incorrect value estimates for ore but many others do know how to calculate them correctly it is those others who cluster in the few good mining systems that amarr space has to offer it is a problem both for the miners who are forced to go mine in specific places even to get a halfway decent yield value and it is a problem for the servers that have to handle these minersit is not at all similar to the sec fixing pershare price of stocks not even from a physical sense as it would be more akin to god altering the natural resources of land in part of the world and the reason ccp should do it is twofold firstly the server load is inadequate due to miners clumping in one area and ccp likes balancing server load and this would be an easy way to do some server load balancing secondly as you said yourself everyone should have a realistic shot at achieving something the simple numbers are that miners in amarr space will typically make 30 to 60 more profit than miners anywhere else unless pyroxeres is the highest selling ore then players can get the same advantage in caldari space but anyone mining in gallente or minmatar space is at a very substantial disadvantage if it were minor only 1020 or if the fluctuation of ore prices actually caused the best mining regions to change from time to time i would not have a problem with it but this is simply not the case unless this change is implemented amarr space will forever be by far the best high security space in which to mineid like to add spodumain to this discussion nobody mines it nobody wants it it is fundamentally undervalued because it yields 33 of the megacyte of arkonor and nothing else in any significant amount thus it will always be valued at less than a third of arkonor which will usually put it near the value of veldspareach refine of spodumain yields 700 tritanium the most perrefine other than veldspar 1000 i suspect that ccp intended spodumain to give nullsec miners tritanium without forcing them to mine lowvalue ores but due to its large volume its tritanium yield is virtually insignificant if the tritanium yield of spodumain were increased to 70000 per refine it would yield 58 as much tritanium as veldspar and it would have significant value not high but significant
currently super capital ships can be used for risk free ganksit is not uncommon for a supercarrier to log off with aggro and dissappear before anything but the largest of fleets can dispatch itmy proposal is thissuper capital ships should never disappear from space a ship that large should require the infrastructure of an empire to support itadd a new pos module for docking supercapitals at a pos this will keep them safe from bumpingthis will force players to have said infrastructure to actually support these behemoths it might also slow super capital proliferation as people will actually have to support them logistically with fuel for the posthis is a rough idea but i think it has merit
do like the idea ofadd a new pos module for docking supercapitals at a pos this will keep them safe from bumpingi would say a form of locking clamp
i do like the ideai believe this will increase some risk to hot droppingsupported
cutting their base ehp and making slaves not affect supercaps is what we really need imo

howabout a system in which players who lose ships more often have to pay more to insure their ship that way highsec pirates and careless players will be at a disadvantage with insurance instead of how it is now where those who lose ships most gain the most from insurance

im going to go out on a limb and say that the majority of players that voted for mitts also love suicide ganking
if afk hauler alts were a more organised voting bloc perhaps theyd have someome to represent their special interests
would support this if insurance is also voided for anyone murdering the innocent belt dedspace and mission dwelling npc people of new edenalso on condition that the fascist concord mob enforcers are toned down so that the freedom loving forces that defend new eden from those raping her natural resources and terrorising the innocent npcs can realistically best concord in honorable combat

supported for graphical change only warp mechanic change is a waste of time ccp has much more important stuff to do being that they never do the important stuff warp mechanics will never change any time soon
this post sums it up imoi think it should remain exactly the same only once you warp you instantly hit max speed instead of completely stopping then speeding up to max warp speedi also think the same should happen at the other end you instantly decelerate to whatever speed you were currently moving at or 0 i know currently theres some drift as you come out of warpedit lul forgot to support
how about making it so that while your warp core is charged your capacitor doesnt regenerate that would prevent miners from warping off instantly it may have negative effects of capital ships though i dont fly caps so any input from cap pilots would be welcome
alternatively i propose ccp patches in a mandatory ocd mental illness test so that those who are unable to deal with an unused skill sitting idle in their skill list can be referred to the proper mental care facilities and recieve the help they need
you seem to be assuming that current ocd treatment techniques simply work and have no bad side effects but ocd is not treated so simply as would be a papercut or the common cold maybe oc isnt a disorder after all and people who are intolerant of it are the real problem in any case anyone who simply cannot manage their own mind without external help are simply maladjusted for living in this world but everyone else who manages to cope has an excuse to be a part of our communities i dont see why we shouldnt take small harmless steps toward improving the fun of some of the players isnt that what the csm is trying to do after all
i also propose ccp adds options for confirmation boxes and contracts to disable such text as yes and no for those unable to resist always clicking one or the other to make this a workable feature of course we may need to add ambigiously named checkboxes with neither positive or negative implications so that those in need of this feature are in fact able to use iton a side note id also like an option to make eve appear less wideopen so those suffering from rampant agoraphobia can safely become more immersed in the gametldr by no means am i being serious but accommodating insubstantial fringe cases quickly becomes ridiculous
i thought it wasnt just me that saw that part of fanfest theres no vid on youtube with the presentation on server performance etc cant remember what that actual presentation was called bt made me smile when i caught brian bossUFFFDs comment refering to this idea yaaaaaaay
this actually sound like a pretty cool solution i mean who doesnt like slow motion fight scenes
a while back i was in a fleet with lots of ships most notably a lot of maelstroms there was one nidhoggur nearby i compared the nidhoggur from several angles to the maelstroms near it and came to the conclusion that it was definitely no more than 25 longer this went against the ingame tool which stated that its axis length was more than twice that of a maelstrom but even the listed value isnt so bigediti guess i have a picture to prove it gotta love the print screen buttonplease visit your user settings to reenable images
boost all cap ship sizes the current situation is kind of silly given the attention to scale given to most other aspects of the game i really dont understand how this a was implemented in its current state and b stayed this way for so long
yea when a maul pull up to my carrier it looks way to big to dock lol
i have recently posted this in features and ideas section figured i would propose this in a more clear and concise and less cynical manner also i need to mention i am not a miner and havent mined in maybe a year excluding gas mining in whsthe issue with macro miners right now is that making a program is very easy using click bots these macro miners can sit in a few fields every day mining them and making it cheaper for materials as those who only mine legitimatelythe big change keep the same amount of asteroid belts we currently have accessible through the overview however change the amount of asteroids and the amount of materials inside of asteroids to a much lower amount example bring asteroid count in each field down to 20 of current asteroids lower the amount of material in the asteroid down 60 reason this will limit the amount of asteroids available for strictly botters and they would have to move systems often and cant occupy a single system 23 hours a day within a few belts keeping warp to asteroid belts should still be around only because newer players on day one and two are confused enough about where to go to mine through the rookie chat they can be directed towards the exploration agent for reasons explained below if they need more asteroidsbig change part 2 increase gravimetric sites in a system to compensate for lost asteroids that 80 of materials that has been taken from the asteroid belts would instead be spawned in many daily randomly placed gravimetric sites reason miners will now have to scan down grav sites in their system of choice with whatever scanning ship they own bookmark the locations then bring their mining ship to clear the roids there this does add a few minutes to thier normal routine but keeps it as the passive event they seem to enjoy doing macro bots will require someone to scan down and bookmark the very many gravimetric sites in order to add these bookmarks daily to their macro mining bots resulting in more legitimate miners having access to rocksbig change part 25 im sure many people will say a macro artist will just scan down bookmark and transfer bookmarks to his macro bots early in the day after downtime and do the same thing hes always been doing this can be stopped by having intervals either at fixed or variable times where the other gravimetric sites will spawn in their random locations reason i thought it was pretty clear that now macro miners will have to check in on their bots throughout the day and updating their macro fleets with bookmarks for new sites to continue mining players of all time zones will find good pockets of roids to mine out without worrying about macros eating them up or eating the good rocksbig change part 3 overview roid belts will have much more veldspar and much less more profitable roids in them noobie miners will be happy with their veldspar profit for the first few days before finding out how to scan macro miners will now only be affecting the tritanium markets with vigor and will be affecting the other minerals markets much lessa few things will benefit from this1 miners dont need to actively play mini games and keep their mostly passive methods of mining2 macro miners will have a much more difficult time and will find their illegal method of mining is much more involved now and for people who just use the free macros that use mouse click memory will no longer have working or viable bots3 exploration career agents will actually be used4 macro miners will flood the market with less material thus spawning an increase to their profits from the small amounts comparative to macro miners amounts of material they do sell on a daily basiscontinued on next post
5 scanning down grav sites for a human is not very difficult and will not take a miner much time to bookmark a few sites to hit up during the time they usually spend mining meaning the time spent spent scanning will not cut into their mining times much especially considering the materials they do mine will be worth much morethe real issue is that there is no real way to combat botting but ways to make botting much less effective without fundamentally changing the entirety of the situation the bots are meant to profit off of is the key to bringing balance back to minersi do not like mining and find it very boring  and i enjoy the cheap prices of my ships made by macro miners who flood the market with materials for people to produce the ships i eventually get blown up  but i think that even because of my reasoning for why i dont care about macro miners the people who are being affected by an illegal method should have a voice as well
i think you have a really good idea to halt macro miners in their tracks it would have to be implemented with care however maybe even in multiple steps in which the regular belts were thinned a bit and the grav sites increased a bit the reason i say this is because the economy at current is used to getting its minerals mostly from bot miners making the change all at once i fear would be too successful and ship prices would skyrocket until people got used to mining morealso the ship mineral costs are based on the current influx of minerals and might need to be reduced a bit though i would leave that up to ccp to decideeditheres an idea for mineral distribution by sec status1009 belts veldspar1009 gravs veldspar and scordite with the occasional plagioclase or pyroxeres0807 belts veldspar and scordite0807 gravs veldspar scordite plagioclase omber pyroxeres0605 belts veldspar and scordite with the occasional plagioclase pyroxeres andor omber0605 gravs all highsec ores plus kernite or jaspetlowsec0403 belts plagioclase pyroxeres omber0403 gravs hemorphite or hedbergite0201 belts kernite and the occasional jaspet0201 gravs gneiss and dark ochrei placed omber in the lowend belts both because the market needs a balance to keep mexallon prices from crashing and because it has a low yield anyway the low yield is also why i put it in the midrange grav sitesmy reasons for the stepping ore availability are1 so that any remaining bots mine a little bit of variety just to keep market mineral prices down to some semblance of reality2 so that newbie miners will actually get something for the veldspar they mine3 so that newbie miners who havent learned about exploration yet will still see that security status makes a difference in ore availability
i think margin trading can be fixed simply do not allow characters with a negative balance to make purchases or create buy orders and also dont allow those characters to be biomassed if someone wants to get rid of a toon with a negative balance and start over they have to make a new account and pay the 5 activation fee this is in addition to having to train the market skills again in order to be able to make a lot of buy orders and train the margin trading skill if it is still getting abused at that point and i mean above and beyond being a minor issue then simply raise the skill requirements needed to train the skillthose who currently have the skill can keep it since that wont affect players who make new accounts and retrain new trade toons but you cant continue training the margin trading skill until you finish its prerequisites because people could have inactive toons with the skill just started waiting to be activatedmost of this stuff is probably either already implemented or just standard procedure for this sort of thing anyway but there it is i said it the way to fix margin trading it might not be exactly like that or maybe its a bit more complicated but i think thats the gist of it
this would be awesome with two disposable characters and a modicum of common sense everyone could use the obvious exploit to create an arbitary large sum of iskget coding csms
lolthe game does not allow you this exploit go try it if u dont believe me
1i guess this guy from atlasfail err atlasdotfail err whatever cant do math or just needs to ragequit
i agree that the goonswarm federation is a problem for the csm but i think the problem lies in human nature while having an electoral college sounds good in theory in practice it fails due to the overwhelming ineptitude of the masses under it to elect reasonable delegates at any level let alone at the foundation where it matters most how do you fix it sad to say i think the only way is to keep educating people while implementing changes wherever you can that force them out of their secure little bubble of complacencyi dont expect the problem to go away for millions of years simply because i think it lies at the heart of our species and will require some serious mental evolution before it is fixeduntil then we deal with it as best we can i support the idea of the electoral college does that mean i support this thread i think so but im not sure ill thumb it up anyway
do you really expect people to vote on this and have it win he won with the most votes do the math people wanted him so they voted for him it wasnt just the goons that voted for himand to vote him out just because he is a goon all you would need to do is change goon to a race and you are a racist i imagine people voted for him because he has a lot of experience with null sec politics and personally i am looking forward in seeing what he does on the flip side mr atlas do you think anyone would want to vote for atlas if memory serves me correctly when the old atlas got invaded they took it up the rear and they surrendered some titans and super carriers a very large amount of isk their space and their name what did they get out of it nothing useful it seems better off making a run for it and suicide the super caps and get default insurance payout and reform later and one vote per alliance really lets not drink and post random crap cuz it seemed like a cool idea at the time next time mmmkay thhhhaaannnks
your suffering and incoherence pleases me 1700 votes for me came from gsf the rest from the community as a wholemore threads like this please i require a constant supply of agony to maintain interest in this game
there is a lot of stupid in this post but in particular you do realise that the mittani got more votes than there are goons despite half the goon votes presumably going to vile rat he also received more votes than anyone ever in the history of csm elections he is literally the sun king of evejesus christ stop postingedit actually i support this idea people in npc corps do not deserve representation
ah yes the typical whine i hear often when an idiot is describing people who vote for the other political party
was wondering if you were gonna show up to this hilarious thread
dont you want to wait to see how he performs before complainingmittani got elected because lots of people voted for him thats democracy for youtheres a lot more people who havent voted and goons only account for a relatively small subset of the total playerbase so well see what the future bringsand its true that its harder for smaller alliances or member of no alliances as i was when i got elected the first 2 times to get in but its possible
do you really believe that if mittens wanted to actually and completely destroy the game whatever that means that ccp would allow ityou sir have won the fool award and im guessing are in the running for a darwin awardsick  p
fight the power
currently if you have aggression you have to wait one minute to be able to dock or jump through a gate this is working as intendedwhat is not working is the bug of swapping immediately to another ship from a ship maintenance bay from an orcaa growing cancer in high sec is thieves stealing from wrecks presenting themselves as a target this is fine as the pilot can see what they will be shooting you with if you attack them that is until they bring in the ing orca altwith this ship and due to being able to hot swap to a completely ing different ship mid fight they get the immediate upper hand with ease oh and god forbid you actually be able to take out their new ship because before that goes down they just dock it back in the orca for yet another ing ship start to take out that ship too and you guessed it they put that one back in the orca most likely for a shuttle to easily escape the entire time your being bumped by the orca who you cant shoot and unable to warp out because of the bumpinghow is this ing balanced the thief risks nothing and you risk everything i propose a 1 minute aggression timer to keep people from swapping to a new shipedit removed my signature maroon color to not cause so much butt hurt
i disagree with transferring aggression to the orca but i agree with a 1minute timer on docking into a ship maintenance bay i think ccp wanted to put that in and forgot about itps what is this tue you keep mentioning
i took out the aggression transfer the tue was stupid text prediction on my phone
please take the red out of your post so it can actually be read i cant mock it if i cant read it
it is my style of writing if you dont like it then gtfo of my thread
i would like to thank suddenly ninjas honorless internet jerks and other hisec griefers for making umad broalso every time that guy switches ships he loses lock warp away
why didnt i think about that oh yeah because the orca is constantly bumping you ing idiot you cant warp away
rtdr
i agree with the guy above me this change only really hurts the smaller alliances where sov grinding is long and tedious nullsec is stagnant and lathergic bc of the broken sov mechanics no small alliance will want to move into crappy nullsec and not make isk especially with the bills that the new sov mechanics have a few big alliances will take the new good space kicking out the smaller ones and life will go back to the way it was as for the land of blues in nullsec if youre small you have to have as many allies as possible if you want to even have a chance to resist the large alliances sc fleet
lets nerf something that does not need nerfing typical failboat deving by ccp
clearly its the optimum time to start buying those mining upgrades and suck dem roids up
my major issue with this is that the dominion fiasco was supposed to be balanced out by allowing each system to accommodate more players than it could previouslypredominion a good ratting system could support only a handful of belt rattersdominion was supposed to fix that because zomg everyone can run anoms but actually even with all the upgrades systems can only support 2 or 3 extra guys in the havens and sanctumsputting the breakeven at 0508 reinforces that limitationif you want more entities to be able to break in to the end game you needed a much lower breakeven threshold so that individual systems can support more activity
so while everyone is going to go to the better space and fight over it does this mean i can take your crappy space and farm your 510 and 610 and 710
the level 5 versions arent bad from what ive seen it probably spawns about one extra sig per day the problem is that it requires some pretty constant ratting to keep level 5 military in a system so to keep a level 5 entrapment array online in a ty truesec system you will have to run lowvalue anoms constantlyonce the system drops below level 5 military index the corresponding military upgrades go offline and are useless until you bring it up again as a side note i am not sure the entrapment arrays under level 5 do anything we have a system that we only got around to upgrading to the 4th a few months ago and ive never seen a military sig in it
this is to remind everyone that is not a nerf sc post my only intention is to get poss relooked with the current change in game mechanics and tactics as it stands the hours it takes to online and set up a pos is not worth the fail it has in defending itself or the tcu anchored on it
oh yes thats very representative of the way i type quit being a troll you idiot as anyone can see you are fing it up badlyill admit its harder to edit my own typing than someone elses but its mostly correct and perfectly readablesimple rules the comma is a break in a sentence similar to a pause and a semicolon is a division between two halves of the same sentence you can also use commas to introduce a silent supporting idea as above and to create a list of up to 3 independent examplesjohn jake and mary went to the promrun spot run
i was just going over the many threads on how broken dreads are and i had an idea on how to restore some balancemy idea is thisi think that if ccp gave dreads a 1 high utility slot had a 150 bonus to heavylargeenergy vampire and heavylargeenergy neutralizer drain amount and range when in siege mode based upon the math this would give the energy vampire a transfer amount of 525 and the heavylargeenergy neutralizer would have 1500 with a range of 63kmalso bring the siege cycle timer down from 10min to 5min to put it more inline with the triage cycle timer this ould reduse the need to commit dreads to the battlefieldgive them a 5 tracking bonous per lvl which will alow them to hit things easer and allowing them to lock 2x more targets total of 4 when in siege mode will make there heavylargeenergy vampire and heavylargeenergy neutralizer more effective these changes would make the would make them dreadsmore effective in killing other capital ships and give them more use on the battlefield other then pos bashing this is my final version and no more revisions will be added
this is a strange and random suggestion and while i dont really have any idea one way or the other it sounds interestingyou have however either done your math wrong or stated yourself incorrectly 150 increase per level
this is about the only dread fix i would support its a relatively good idea and can help with making dreads useful for more than just possov bashing despite that being their only real intended purpose super caps and titans too i suppose as its reasonable to expect they can apply dps vs one or bothmake it just neuts as the nos benefits the dreads cap
ya i made a mistake it was ment to be a flat non accumulative bonous i have since corected this in the op
fix themeditthis thread is more about reraising awareness of how bad blops arei dont care if you support it or not but god damnit ccp this s been on the agenda long enough it cant possibly be so hard to change a ship around a bit can it read fix it properly not some crappy halffix that lets you get away with shoving it to the back of the line
good topictoo bad no content
its not my job to come up with ideas on how to fix  thats ccps jobeveryone knows that black ops are  so my proposal stands fix them
well its certainly not a fitting problem as they seem mostly to have decent dpstank capability they also dont have a targeting delay after cloaking and they have sizeable drone baysheres what i see as broken evelopedia lists them as having 5000s reactivation delay for cloaking eft doesnt represent thisthey cant use covert ops cloaks requiring a velocity modifier when cloaked  this starts out on the pathetic side and moves to the rediculous its also a nonsense mechanic just remove the effect of velocity from the cloak so the ship velocity is per pilot skill2 ly jump range  thats pretty limited make it 3 the rest can be handled in a full rebalance if it ever happens
cassus temon doesnt know how to fit a ship i think both the tank and dps on all the blackops are greatly inferior to their t1 counterparts when comparably fit this is due to a significant reduction in their base hp lack of a significant t2 resist bonus loss of the third rig slot all t2 is like that of course and loss of turretmissile hardpoints that said i agree this thread lacks content the purpose of assembly hall is create proposed changes fix them is not a proposal
black ops really need a boost come on csm guyz  edit the blackops boost was in only one candidats program and he wasnt elected o7
tbh black ops dont need a boost stupid people just need to learn how to fly them properly
they really could use a bit of extra jumpbridge range as well as bigger fuel bays
the black ops isnt supposed to have better dpstank than its t1 counterpart it already has cloak higher agility and velocity and can decloak and immediately lock up a target it also has better scan res than a t1for reference the widow can get an 8s align time 73k shield tank and 33 points of ecm while being cap stable and having the ability to dish out 809 dps with t2 torps theres nothing really wrong with that aside from it requiring all level 5 skillsand the 2 ly max jump that will get you past most gate camps but not much more im not certain its intended too
33 points of ecm you say clearly this man knows how ecm worksas for targetting delay after cloaking when are you seriously gonna be on grid before your target being unable to warp cloak means youre gonna be either warping to your target like a chump or jumping to your target because someone else has already tackledlit a cov ops cyno ontop of them so that point is mootthe only redeeming factor about blackops imo is the fact that with blops v and a dread guristas cloak you can align out in 3s but lol blops v thats quite the investmentid like to see some more utility on the blops as it stands its something of a miniature capital for covert ops why not give it a small ship maintainence arrayfitting service that can only be used by cov opsstealth bombersforce recons or something maybe let it store a stealth bomber or two makes it more like a covert ops mini capitalalso give it extra jump range per level or something 45ly barely gets you anywhere you really should be flying this with jdc vtheres really no reason to combat fit a black ops if you can fly one you can probably fly a carrier or are close to one which are more effective for hotdropping any day of the week honestly barring the redeemer combat hotdropping a blops is dumb
shoop da whoop
been done
ive long since thought a t2 shuttle would be a nice idea but not with weapons just give it some improved stats 1 low and one medium slot
quite a good idea supported
sounds like a good idea in any games i have played i never have or will sell my accountscharactershow do i put the thumbs up

everyone knows that war declarations need to be nerfed it gives too much control to the decing corp allowing them to dictate the terms and engagements while leaving the decd at their mercy okay maybe not as dramatic as that but whatever one man can disrupt an entire corpalliance for a week by decing themfor those that minemissioncourier or otherwise carebear and make money war decs can be annoying but confrontations can be avoided if youre smart about it watching local staying aligned etc basically you can still do what you want to do as long as your cautiousthis is not true for incursions since incursions heavily rely on remote repping and rring someone at war puts the repper at risk many read all incursion fleets refuse to take on somebody who is at war this is an area of the game that is effectively cut out simply because of a war decso i propose that war decs be nullified in incursion constellations and those constellations only this makes sense for the lore also i believe that the sheer threat of the sansha incursions overshadow any petty differences between corps capsuleers migrate to the incursion constellations to unite as one and fight back the incursions not to settle scores between themselves as soon as the incursion is over the war dec is reenabledthoughts suggestions flames
personally i think concords fascist mob enforcers should be disabled altogether in incursion space reduce sec status to 04 in all incursion systemsthen war decs wouldnt matter in the slightest
definitely support although i can feel for the potential for abuseallowing transfer through chatmail would change the dynamic of tracking targets but is much more logicaledit read above and changed so as restate rather than remaking points already made
i like the idea to attach rigs to subsystems instead of to the t3 itself in fact i think certain subsystems should come with rig slots and each individual subsystem could have all its rigs modules and other settings saved when its removed from the ship and sits in the hangar seems like common sense to meas for removing rigs i wouldnt mind having them pay out a small amount of salvage when you do remove them i think of it less as keeping the money you spent and more as an aesthetic improvement on that note i think that implants in frozen corpses should be removable to be kept as broken versions of the originals theyd have no practical use but would serve as trophies and might also add a new avenue to griefing as some pilots who die a lot may get a history for having or for not having expensive implants i always support changes that benefit the smarter folk most
no they are implants for ships its an added cost for improved performance and like was said before if you do that it becomes another module slot no skill or item should be used to take out said rigs otherwise people would use t2 rigs without any worry of losing the money for the rigs
im not one of the many players constantly trying to back this argument i wouldnt even use hybrids if they were balanced but it has become painfully clear to me from both the forums and ingame that fixing or rebalancing hybrids is by and large one of the hottest topics everyone is debating and complaining about and theres not all that much debate the topic has multitudes of supporters and comparatively few opposers i myself started out using hybrids and i thought that making weapons hit and do damage was remarkably difficult in this game but as soon as i switched to other weapons i found i could almost ignore the technical aspects of their mechanics and just shoot targets short range weapons hit close targets and long range weapons hit distant targets only hybrids are difficult cumbersome and usually not very effectiveso i am asking the csm on behalf of everyone i know or have only just met that likes hybrids so much that you please recognize that this is a profoundly popular issue and submit it as priority
redundant thread is redundant 
it isnt redundant he doesnt just want hybrids buffed he wants them buffed as a priority you see
i made this post not because of how much i or anyone else wants hybrids to be fixed but because the uproar about it has reached some pretty high levels and it would seem to be long past time to submit it as priority im actually surprised it wasnt submitted as priority last time aroundand once again this isnt based on my views i dont even like hybrids on principle but i support a game in which everything works properly and is balanced and weapons are first and foremost in this game just as they are in pretty much anything else made by human men
well yes really youre just thinking of the childrendown with this sort of thingcareful now
well having been based on ac carriers ie the uss constilation before it was taken out of servicei believe any ship that can house droans should be able to repair them internally simple logic really thats just the way it is in the real thingbut i agree carriers super carriers and titans should not only be able to repair there drones but virtually anything that can fit in there docking bay once again this is just the way it is in real life seems simple really i personally honestly believe if the ccp devs thought about it they would almost all agree i actually do have faith in the devs they have done brilliant work in creating this game and im certian they would be on board with this being a dev of sorts of other things i gotta tell ya were a pretty open mind bunch of blokes we really like new ideas and i think this one would be a good onein my opinion you know how opinons are lol its not the devs but who the devs have to answer too ie the gms managers and marketing peopleccp is struggling to just keep up here really the new code changes in the code time to impliment the changes debug the changes really gets there heads spinning i honestly believe there just snowed under add to that the new special advertised changes like dust etc there simply maxed out and will be for some time to come in otherwords dont expect anything like this anytime soonreally en great idea though and supported
like a cross between a pos and a ship while it cant fly like a normal ship its corporation can move it around somewhat freely by paying fuel costs for entering warp or jumping systems players can dock into its ship storage units if you put any on it and ride with it wherever it goes bringing all their stuff along in the ships cargo modules once again if you put any on it its equipment would be similar to pos modules in fact it might even be able to use the same modules it shouldnt use quite the same weapons and shielding system that poss use for that would allow players to use it as a ganking platform it should be balanced to be used primarily as a mobile base of operations for rich corporations or potentially as a supercapital in large fleet fights though its tremendous power comes at the cost of putting everything inside it in dangerperhaps it could be put in stationary mode in which its shield acts like that of a pos and goes into reinforced mode when its hit points are depleted or however that works ive never actually seen a pos get sieged but then if you put it in mobile mode you have to unanchor it for say an hour till you can move it during that time and while its in mobile mode its shields and armor would function like a ship and it can be destroyed as a single unit if destroyed all of its bays would be dumped into space unlocked and unanchored players in them could still undock if those bays are then destroyed the players in them and their ships and cargo are dumped into space the players and piloted ships would fade from view in 15 minutes while the cargo and unpiloted ships would actually disappear in 2 hours if not picked uponce you get the pos back to its new location you have to anchor it which takes another hour during the time its being anchored it is vulnerable as its defenses act like a ship until anchoring finishesi know it wont happen any time soon but im a big fan of the idea and i always like to hear support and feedback
i dont see the point in this could you clarify the reasoning in having this the docking part is too much tbh compared to an outpost as it takes a lot of materials time and risk putting up an outpost so you can dock having basically a dockable rorqual seems like you could get a lot of people docked in this mobile outpost then move to enemy space and let everyone undock like the trojan horse you should state what the purpose of the role of this ship would be because saying you just want a mobile pos tells me you cant be arsed to set up a pos and want to squat in a system before they come for you now if this was used in some kind of siege staging where it could only be used briefly while starting an attack on a system that might hold more potential but doubt even that would be needed
i dont want one personally at least i certainly dont want to be in charge of paying its maintenance bills let alone pay for the hull there are two reasons i want to see it implemented1 because regular large poss are runofthemill these days and even titans and supercarriers are fairly common i think at current isk generation rates some people have room for an even larger isk sink it would also make for some interesting news articles about what goes on ingame you know nobody cares to hear about soandso lost the biggest and most expensive thing in the game when theres over a hundred of them around and people lose them every week the way i see it in a game like this the most expensive item should be above the budget of most nullsec alliances and only the top few should be able to afford it2 linkage
disagree on the supercaps being a distinct warpable beacon  thats too unbalancing of a game mechanic but i would support adding a supercap activity overlay to the map

thank you mitanni for actually replying and giving an answer for me bc i can tell you that i do get angry at reading some of these post and think surely 2000 people replying on a topic would mean something would get done this clears things up a bit and i hope it helps settle down some of the forum trolls p
it is true that most of this stuff never gets changed theres a lot of player input toward changes but ccp is far too busy to implement it all no to mention how much work these issues alone would require to implementthe csm points ccp to the hottest topics and ccp decides whether or not to fix it but having lots and lots of support really makes a difference that way ccp doesnt only agree that there is a problem but most importantly that it matters a lot to the playerschanges do happen which are aided very much by this forum and the csm to name a recent change that originated here rockets had their damage increased im sure there are plenty of others but i dont know them off the top of my head
im not sure what youre proposing are you suggesting that an account should be able to maintain a skill queue and set of sp that all characters on said account can access
basically he sais that if you want to train 3 characters on the same account you can put skills from all 3 characters in 1 queue basically not breaking the 1 character training per account and still training all 3 sorta
the relative value you are referring to are based on the unit price of each ore the relative value i was referring to are based on the refined value per cubic metre kernite had a large value per cubic metre too but only in relatively small quantities attempting to sell millions of units of kernite would end up flooding the market in the few systems i experimented inill leave it to ccp to determine if miners moving to the more valuable space is a problem or not
i was actually referring to the refined mineral sell value in large quantities based on original ore volume if you are going by unrefined ore prices then your figures are inaccurate since they mostly reflect what local refiners are buying from miners who have inadequate refining skills and those local buyers fluctuate from time to time as well as vary by region if you calculated by unrefined volume versus refined sell value as i did and your figures still do not concur with mine then you need to recheck your figures i have checked mine many timeshere is a website that you might find helpful
while this pos module allows the storage of super capitals it requires that a pilot ejects from it firstthe module i am suggesting would allow a pilot to dock the ship while still piloting it this would be to offset the main suggestion that super capitals never disappear from spaceedit supporting my own idea 
i think all capitals should take extra time to disappear from space like an hour perhaps people should not be fielding capital ships frivolously end of storyi also agree that supercapitals should never disappear from space there is a reason you cant dock them that is because they themselves are a mobile station as such the player who owns said station and their corporation should be in charge of keeping it safe at all times
i just noticed the error now saraell tellon was the only person to win a prize that had the signature setshe is owed all 6 plex as noone else shared that prize sadly i gave them away already time to sell some ships thanks for pointing it out ive just talked to her and were figuring something out now
indeed sip told me of how my hardearned plex was given away but i now have two delicious plex sitting in my hangar
congrats to the winners d
thx  sip

what i learned from these stats is that im a baller

how can you be mad at a man with a cute puppy
your posts arent intelligent so i guess that means im not going to be flaming them
i support a cooler animation for warping other then the current ship slides here but i dont agree with much of the other changes put forthedit while were at it bring back the last pod we had with the crazy random 3 firing thrusters that looked like something you really were unsure about making it back to saftey
two years ccp two damn yearssort your crap out this is pathetic give us the old cyno back
i want to ride the lightning like the old days
omg  please do this ccp the current is extremely gay
is that the cyno i saw in clear skies when haffer was playing with his widow im new enough i didnt ever see one of those ingame so i wondered what it wasmuch cooler than the current bubble popping
needs doing
bad idea this would have too many negative side effects having logi flagged for repping on a gate or cap transfering each other would make the ships alot less useful in real war nullget a falcon alt or find a friend with a scorpionfalcon  guardian
highsec neutral support noaggro docking games is just sillygranted when i fly logi in a gang i most certainly do hug the gate and jump through once i start taking fire because i can i dont approve of this game mechanic but im certainly not going to stay on field and lose the hull on principle
pointless suggestion there is a list of seriously important things that ccp need to be working on this doesnt come close to making itimportant things worth spending time looking at
thank u for the useless banter it seems this forum is full of useless things

ive read much of this thread but it was difficult to find posts that added to the discussion my main concern is like other have pointed out that this would give more time for reinforcements which honestly isnt that bad of a thing in many cases as it works for both sides  but here my thought that may have been brought up before so if it has just ignore methe immediate area around the system should experience a similar effect one or two jumps spidering from the system would be given the same notification and have similar bullet time effects this doesnt necessarily stop people from using caps to jump in but would slow down reinforcements using the traditional methods of coming inalso would caps that jump fleets experience an additional wait time to jump in say the system was decreased by a factor of half time would the cap jumping in from a different system have to wait twice as long to jump

1its a change that really makes sense
so from what im getting the topic is soley about size not about changing the stats sig rad or anything like thatif so then make supercaps superto op your pic might have been necesary to make your point but it still stretched the first page beyond the confines of my screen
supported i remember my first cap fight where i compared my moros to the awesome nyx the next toy in my lineup wtf i was sooo disapointed when i saw how tiny it was the moros looked way more super make my super well er super plz ccp
im not sure what the current sec to ore is but i can agree with what you put and as for the gradual change  i didnt even think of mineral price crash of such an immediate action so that would be a good idea if your a miner you would be better at gauging my idea and thinking of a practice course of actionmy biggest concern with making this idea was like you agreed that newbs wouldnt know how to scan  and possibly scanning for ores would be a huge turn off for them as learning how to scan can be aneurysm inducing in the beginning i think the industrial career track should definitely be revamped to discuss and explain the ore sec to ore type ratio as well to help get newbs out of 10 for your sec breakdown your still inferring that certain ores should be in certain regions right
ive always liked the approach of moving all asteroid belts to grav belts ofc the bots will probably congregate to ice fields then
very true im not gonna touch the subject of the perma producing ice fields though  not with a ten foot pole
its possible to use also agents with mission of mining the gravi site its also a very good idea and why not to change at every downtime the place of the static belt a little the bookmark can be used for 24h only its more difficult for bots no 
even changing the overview accessible asteroid belts will still allow a macro bot to just warp to zero on asteroid belt and switch to an asteroid tab on the overview and mine whatevers closest not sure how to circumvent that with the asteroid belts available via oveview having so little in terms of ore i think that will be enough to put a damper on macro miners ability to flood the market with ore especially the higher grade high sec onesi always thought with the advent of whs more cruisers osprey for example would be hanging out in whs spamming dscan for those abc ores the fact is i spose miners prefer the relatively easy and safe low end ores in high sec to fit their passive playstyleitd be nice if solar systems werent so static like they were anyhow but thats another topic all togetheri had a discussion with a friend of mine who used to be a pretty dedicated and determined miner and his main protest was that scanning down grav sites would turn off a lot of people from mining i fail to see his reasoning for it as it should only take a few moments with a scanning ship like the one u get for free from the career agent would make mining challenging especially when miners will gain large increases to profitdo any miners here agree with that would having to scan down a few belts prior to mining make your day too difficult would you stop mining due to a need for scanning these sites down
has possibilities
well mining in anoms protect you from gankers who can easiliy sacn you in belt1 and even bots can mine in anoms too so no interestthere is a simple easy way to eradicate all bots no more local
scan something down only to get some roids sounds rly nah it doesnt sound like mining passive playstyle log in dock off fly to a belt and eat some friggin rocks thats what mining is about watch tv do the dishes etc pp mining is great cause u have to pay no attention in highsecu should keep that in mindthe only real way to fix this is to scan the ram for background programs dont know why ccp is not using this theres this b mmorpg using this technique too
cpp could fix the bots problem in one day if it wanted to 1 run a db query on a accounts that are online for 20h to 23 hours day 7 days a week 2 filter out all but them that do nothing but rat and mine 23x7 3 you have your ban list
did you move here from fd fail and diegood self motivation i wish all the people whos ideas went well in fd would repost here
im pretty sure you didnt read my posts then because i explained how anoms combat the way bots workbots can be made to log in and out after a particular number of cycles after a certain amount of time etc also the bots click through buttons and asset windows and evemail to make it seem like more is going on on the account
while i like your idea it isnt the stupid captcha one it wont stop bots it would for a few days while they get rewritten thoughthe current scanning bot reportedly takes 12 minutes to scan down a high sec grav site not long enough that a small group of miners could clear the belt
bots can run l4s you idiot nothing youve posted here is more complex than a l4
i cant help but feel that getting rid of the macro miners will have a horrible fallout when mineral prices suddenly skyrocket due to a huge decrease in supplythis may not end up being the case but we shall see
theres a courier mission bot but i have not seen any level 4 combat related bots theres also bots that rat but everyone ive heard of seems to have trouble looting the proper itemsthe only bots i see which are easy to make if you just download a free customizable mouse click memory program are mining bots the other bots are paid programs and their forums are filled with doesnt work threadsas for the scanning bot  what what bot are you talking about i cant even find information about one of these do you know how advanced something would have to be to recognize all the displayed information to make a scanning bot please cite your informationand it probably will i can definitely see shipsmodules prices getting much higher as less material is made available on the market ccp i think would enjoy this as they have been talking about their monetary systems insane inflation as more and more isk is produced
not gonna cite it would rather not be bannedtheres also the wonderful market bots which are quite aggravating
corina those who make outrageous claims and then refuse to cite their sources fall under a certian category troll cite sources or that is what everyone will think
this isnt a topic about market bots this is about mining bots after much scouring i couldnt find any details about any eve online scanning bot so unless you have some proof about this then your just trying to discredit my idea and hope people will jump on the bandwagon
unfortunately any form of proof that i could post links to sites selling them or using one myself and recording it would likely breach the eula and give me a banunless ccp comes into this thread and says otherwise im not going to risk itnow i like your ideas i really do but overall and over time it will have little effect on the macro miners compared to ccps current efforts which seem to be working slowly yes it would stop the click bots at least for a while but not the ones that use direct client interfacing
and correcting what i should have done from the get gosupport moving most roids to grav sites
ones that interface with the client can be discovered the memory click bots cant be discovered as it uses a computer function that is necessary to how we all play the game we click thingsthe reason this idea shines above others because it doesnt change gameplay much it uses methods already inscribed in the game the current click an sit mining method that miners do not want to change scanning for grav sites which is already in the game however grav sites are low in quantity in most systems this change increases the amount of them and contents of themtheres no need for invasive monitoring on ccps side which they would have to have a team of people monitoring and investigating and theres no need for captchas or whatever they are called which is bothersome for the eve community as a whole and takes away from rp elements in the gamethe only reason i would ever remotely agree to the use of captchas is to minimize system sitting cloakers but since that is such a trivial issue as it is i still wouldnt give my backing to itthis is the quickest and most viable solution to the issue even if it minimizes macroing to 75 of current bot miners who use the free memory click programs it would be a huge advantage to current miners
fof certainly need to be looked at again by ccp that is certainly something we can all agree on
make it more specific like a box for falcon kitsune scorpion blackbird griffin ect
interesting that you went for a really specific option  id be happy to see a more generalised set of targeting options but i suspect that what you suggest would make it a little op thanks for your support though
i think you misunderstand the nature of static exploration site talk to a wspace inhabitant about how successful they are at bookmarking their static wormholes and warping to the bookmark anytime they want to find the static wormhole in the futurethus a static grav site would continually respawn in a particular system constellation or region ie site a might be a static system site site b might be a static constellation site etc the respawn timer will control the maximum extraction per day static grav sites will respawn at any time current celestial belts are only repopulated during dt switching from celestials to static exploration site will remove the need for dt in this small portion of the game
very nice be nice to make mining more enjoyable especially ice mining
i agree that dramiel should get a small nerf in that case the antidramiel daredevil should probably get one tooi see some people play the risk vs reward card here but i dont think they realise the market mechanics behind nerfsbuffs if the dramiel gets the nerf the risk will be smaller  lower pricein other words risk vs reward is fixed  frigate class is balancededit i havent read all posts in case someone has already pointed this out
confirming dramiel pilots are the biggest gots in eveeve has not known such gotry since before the falcon nerfi love how fast they are its cool to be able to break 10 kms but the ship has too many other strengths imo dps nerf in the form of less drones
war decs are too cheap up the isk required  add a cooldown period it ruins game play experience
implement a debt mechanic to cover the shortfallwhen in debt you get an additional 1 tax on all taxable income  this goes to the debtorthis lasts until you choose to pay off the debtyou cannot delete or transfer your character with a debteither that or hide unfulfilable orders as suggested abovehoweverthe scam used is a perfectly valid and pretty clever scam all things considered as the part thats a scam is the part where you buy something for a vastly inflated price  do your research and dont assume that the current one or two orders are valid its not difficult to spot and avoid if you understand the mechanics of trading it can even be done without margin trading its just harder and riskieredit to be clear i dont support the proposal  the skill is useful nerf it perhaps but do not remove it
tell that to wall st
not supportedif you get burned its your problem im afraid that scam has been posted for months if not years and if you didnt know about it its just your bad luck there are far more legitimate users of this skill than scammers
neutrali dont care what they doas long as1 i get my skill points back to redistribute2 we all play by the same rules and changes are announced in advance3 the number of scammers goes down or change it back
i really like any idea that moves along the lines of stop filling my hanger with noob ships for me to trash
i would say that instead of receiving one automatically every time you dock with no ships you have to request one make a button in station services or integrate it with something else
bump why does the weapon system that is supposed to do the most damage over time railguns cap out and yet the supposed alpha kings artilleries can fire forever without bothering with cap usage
the defining feature of rails is range it therefore stands to reason that the gunship with the highest dps at 249 km the lock range should be a railboat if it isnt a railboat then something is selfevidently broken and changes are required

no just no you have another chance to cast your vote next yearyou say that the csm has become nothing more than a platform for big allianceslast csm could be considered nothing but a platform for empire dwelling bears and lowsec pirates no matter what they are it was an open election

mittens stands for freedom do you all hate freedom or something
you sound like you hate democracy youre not a terrorist are you son
the goons who voted blindly for their representative pay as much to play this game as you domittens and the other 00 candidates ran because of dumb ideas that were floating around within csm5 and ccp that would severely and adversely affect playerrun sovereignty holding entities like the one you belong to remember when they nerfed deep safes yeahsuggesting that an alliance with thousands of members who pay for their eve subscriptions has the same number of votes as some guys 1man alt corp is utterly ridiculous then again i cant say i expect intelligent ideas from a guy who belongs to a corporation with a dot in its name which in turn belongs to an alliance with a dot in its namedefinitely not supported
i completely agree democracy is a failed experiment too many of the wrong sort of people participating leads to the wrong sort of people being elected
i think the main problems with goons is they come into fi or ah and just shut down ideas and proposals without ever reading them or even understanding whats going on i think the collective knowledge of goons isnt high enough to make real decisionsjust imho hopefully this one can outshine the other imbeciles and show goons can do something with themselves other then be a complete and utter nuisance
maybe if your ideas werent so terrible we wouldnt do this
the goons beautifully illustrate the intention behind this game why hate them
stop behaving like thatmonkey fightand give the new csm at least a chance as others already said if you didnt want mittens to win you had to have more people voting for other candidates and not only nc voted him i voted for him after hearing the interview he did on the fly reckless podcast seems like a reasonable guy if you dont judge him for being a goon only deal with it stop whining its still a game and not rl
i did not vote blindly i chose between vile rat and mittani
also are you morons going to start grunting because you havent seen mittanis birth certificate
not quite
the mittani sucks here here i second the notion
this gave me a good laugh thanks d
yeahwho wants lawyer with expert knowledge of the game representing the player base i meanlawyerrepresenting  and speaking for players perish the thought
while i like your enthusiasm for creativity im not a huge fan of this idea for one reasonnew modules would mean new skills to train id rather not have yet another skill point sink it took me 2 years to fill out the current combat tree of skills if anything though i would want an xl shield extender as it stands armor plates are more forgiving with fitting than shield extenders there is no equivalent to a 1600mm plate meaning you have to use two midslots to get the same amount of buffer that an armor plate can do with 1 lowslot
but shields passive recharge armor doesnt but i get what your saying an xl shield extender would have some crazy pg req would be interesting to see a what drake pilots would change their fitting to to get it on there
supported  should not be able to repeatedly switch ships during combat to keep fresh ships in the fightmore than that orca should get the aggression flag so it can be fired upon you dont get to help in a fight without being attackable

if the orca can bump you so that you cant warp out you need to find a game more suited to your abilities
i have to say i agree with the orca proposalif you are engaged in combat  and flip out ships from the orca the orca should be agrod as well

isnt csm just the group of people that listen to forum whine and present it to ccp who also reads forum whineif anything it allows them to not pay someone to do what ccp peoples randomly surf around doing anyhowi dont think csm will get us everything we ever wanted or dreamed of as evidence of every other csm or even much of what they want but they report on what they presented and what ccp said they would be inclined to investigatewith csm we have had some things weve been expressing a want for  but ccp has their own agenda and that ultimately comes firstthis was in no way meant to bash or endorse either csm the fanbase or ccp

makes the game more interesting some days ill log onto eve and say i got terrible skill point placement and i just figured out what i should be doing following that i will go into a two month period where i refuse to log on because im terriblemaybe have a clone with x amount of sp not placedor maybe per character you have one resetor have the memory attribute penalized and have a new sheet of sp to work withiskmoneywhatever for a skillpoint reset
i have millions of sp in industry that i will never ever ever use again but i dont support this i made a choice which was right at the time when i trained them and now i live with that choice
what you actually want is to have allskillsatv in short you want the entire skill training system removed er good luck with that idea
i know someone who can reset your sp for youmeet him in lownullsec in your pod with an unupgraded clonehe wont even charge for the service
lolsomeone who doesnt know what getting podded in an alpha clone actually doesthis thread is dumb
i do not support i have tons of skills i wish i never wasted time with many of my hybrid skills for instance and despite loving the idea of reinserting those into projectiles and switching up to minmatar ships you just cant do something like thisit breaks the balance of the game any amount of resets over 0 is wrongthere would be plenty of 30msp characters resetting their skills and putting themself as instant titan pilots for alliancesachieving skills is part of the eve game and the choices you make in eve really do have a rewardconsequence to them
in the most recent csm election there were 54 candidates to choose from for 9 spots this is to many choices for most people to reasonably research each candidatemore stringent requirements for entering a csm election may be needed a longer write up mandatory attendance for a voice debate for example these would cut the candidates down to those most willing to invest the timechoosing between 25 or so players would be much easier
if you werent capable of dismissing 80 of the csm6 candidates within 5 seconds of reading their thread then theres really no hope for you
clearly ecm strength is applied vs sensor strength maybe its a little random but thats the general idea 33 is enough to reliably ecm a battleship or apply it to 3 cruisers with some degree of success the problem with ecm is the inability to target all factions with anything near effective strength using multispectral ecm all youre really doing is attempting to discredit my posts to further the strength of your own argumentsi may not have supported the thread but i have supported your idea that should be enoughdo you think youre the first to post this here im surprised obsidian hawk didnt point you in the direction of the nearest thread given he has a penchent for doing that self imposed forum moderation so to speak anyway its been done and i properly supported it that time you havent so much as stated what you think is wrong with black ops leaving the whole thread completely in the dark about what you hope to accomplishheres my thoughtcloaking for black ops is broken maybe it shouldnt be as good as covert ops or stealth bomber but it could certainly use some improvement in fact if it just had access to covert ops cloaks with a 99 flat reduction it would be good no need for a 125 velocity modifier which makes it roughly 100 ms faster than base with full skill still requires 100tf to fit the cloak and can warp cloaked as a nice benfit2 ly jump range could be modified apply a level dependent benfit to it that gives it a max distance of around 4 ly with black ops v this can replace the current 125 per level velocity mechanicif you had that the black ops would be serviceable and its slight reduction in tank wouldnt matter cripes its hardly even noticeable
agree no contentsome good info here lots of bad info hereive been playing with the widow on the test server for a bit its viable for solo pvp as is the biggest problem is geting on grid due to the lack of a covert ops cloakgetting off grid is easy as you can align while cloaked due to the velocity bonus you will be able to attain 75 of top velocity while cloaked and thus can instawarp off grid as soon as you decloak align time in a bo is therefore largely irrelevantsomeone pointed out bo sensor lock time clearly you have never used a cloak of any kind otherwise you would know that a noncovert cloak gimps your scan resolution on a bssized ship that sucks even without the sensor recalibration delay you wont be able to lock any subcaps before they warp out or put drones on you sebo w scan res script is required on a bo for solo work if in a gang where others will be doing the tackling then you can forgo iti agree the biggest problem is a lack of range on the portal and jump drive personally i think most portals and jump drives have too much range bo not included if you want an improvement i would recommend fixing the jump fuel conservation skill to include liquid ozone as it stands now it only applies to strontium clathrates which are used for titan bridges meaning the only use for the skill is for titan pilotsthis would allow for longer roams though not longer jumps
dude do you even know how ecm works using 2 jammers that each have 15 strength isnt the same as using a single one with 30 strength not even closeand yet thats what your post seems to implygetting on grid is easy the module you should be using is covert cynosural field generator ialso im not saying that the class isnt viable for its roles its the costeffectiveness ratio thats horribly skewed and its jump range is gimped to i maintain that this ship needs a repurposing rather than some crappy small buff to make it something likeclose to a dedicated covert ops hotdropping machine or maybe split it into 2 ships one for bridging the other for combat hotdropping like combat and force recon
seems like some peopel in here that have commented never actualy flown or tried to fit a sin
confirming i have a redeemer and a panther i think both are absolute  and serve no purpose in game they do look good in my hanger though the knowledge that there are more scs in eve than bos makes me feel all warm and fuzzy about having 2 of them at which point i of course try to suppress the knowledge that unlike scs bos are just a massive waste of isk
black ops do not need covert ops cloaks understand the mechanics of the shipthey work as intended though if i could ask for a buff or two1 slight range buff 1 ly would be nice 2 ly would be epic2 expanded fuel bay while this would be fun it isnt a necessity  at all covert haulers and fuel dumps make this a nonissue
i wonder how many people who post stuff like this have ever seen a blops beyond eft and their corpmates providing them with a covops bridgewhy are people too dumb to realise that thats 5000ms you know 5 seconds
lol people like you are the ones who spent all this time training up black ops expecting it to be an iwin button stop whining and put a little thought into how you utilize a shipedit grammar for the police
thats exactly what everyone who successfully uses them for their intended purpose is asking for
i never flown a bo myself but i was fuele supply in a crane on a covert roam oncewe had to take a gate between 2 regions cause the range of the portal was not good enough to take us 1 jump and my crane nearly takes half of the fuel bay when jumping true the portal as far as i can tell that are the 2 biggest problems with boand there is nothing wrong with the dps as i had a corpmate in a carrier who got hotdroped bu a bo gang and they got him into half armor before his cap repairs had finished a cyclehe only survived cause he was right next to a pos
im a very new player about a month and a half and am quite enjoying the new pace and approach of this game im pretty much pve and switch between mining and missions im not savvy enough to understand many of the topics in this forum im still in the learning curve lol just when i think i get it i realize its so much more complicated than i thoughti tried to get into eve a couple of years ago but i just found the learning curve too dry and walloftextbook and i just couldnt keep my mind on the task  back then i just couldnt get into it however this time it worked i heard about that incarna thing on youtube and thought i should see if i can handle eve now see if i can actually get a grip on the hardest mmo out there p well its working for me this time  the new player environment is far more approachable than it was before im not missing my old mmoim hoping that the player representatives are gonna be good for the incarna project so that its done right and creatively im keen on more fun depth to characterization in the game im guessing that a good number of guy players dont care muchat all about character aesthetics beyond their shiny ships and machinery but for me its a fabulous addition to see the manwoman character behind the machine  adding a bit of stylemore personality to player substance i admit im hoping for stations to have stuff like fashion boutiques with radavante garde clotheshair salons for new hair dyespubs where we can do corp meetings and maybe let drinks give us fleet buffs etc id just love all that stuff id also like to be able to customize my quarters a bit flowers a painting or two nice blanket on the bed but its not terribly important just having a cool looking character is huge for this game talking about this makes me wish we could also customize our ships make their paintwork more uniquewith publicity the incarna expansionproject could attract more players just like me thereby increasing subscription resources that the developers can use to improve the game etc all mmos need new bloodgood luck to this new csm6 player rep group i hope you do good things for everyone for newbies like me and the senior players we all have an interest in how things turn out thats for sureis anyone able to give a roundabout date for when in summer incarna starts coming out id love a general ideacheerssapphire fangborn
saph while im glad to see that you are enjoying the game this is not the place for boundless optomism nor is that kind of talk likely to go down well in any place on the forumsif you dont have a corp mine is recruiting im good at explaining things to people contact jaik7 ingame and ill refer you to my main its a sign of how cutthroat this game can be that i dont post on my main sorry if i havent reset the cspa charge on him yet ill give you a refundanother great source for info is evelopedia if you havent found it already another great tool you can use is called evemon which helps you to plot out the skill tree you want your character to work down if you cant find any info on what you want in those two locations you can even post in the appropriate forums or file a petetion by hitting f12 ingame
i too am hiring for the price of only 500 million isk you can joint test alliance with full capital and supercapital reimbursements join wololpub for more info but seriously theres really no bounds to how utterly horrible everyone here is view eve as a space bastardry simulator and youll be fine 
theyre too expensive in both isk and lp to justify their purchase or sale except in structured friendally buys andor personal use scenariosreduce their price to 175000lp and 175000000 isk which using a fair 2000 isklp metric would lead to a much saner 525m price point and not the 115b that makes such implants as the 6 armor wholly not worth it in comparison to buying an 8 akemon for 1band i dont care who you are an extra 1 damage in the cx25 is not worth an extra 850m135b over the 150m cx2 unless youre a trillionaire2500lp25m for the lowgrades and 37500lp375m for the midgrades is fair and makes sense where 250000lp250m came from i have no clue and it should be loweredalso while im at it  think up some new common joe mods for the lp store the concord cloaking device would be a good start
supporting my own ideapost
supported the concord store needs to offer items that arent just for supercapital pilots
not supported
not supportingmore items yeslower prices no
whatever happened to the logoffski proposalfix to logoffski proposalseems this is a major sore spot for alot of playersmy opinion if your ship get aggressed within the 60 second window after logoff your ship should gain the 15 minute wait before disappearing no matter the status of your connection or circumstanceterror
the only buff i would give shuttles is to make their warp speed even faster everything else is fine theyre not meant to be combat ships theyre meant to shuttle someone from one place  to another also slowboat speed needs to be increased a bit maybe 150 of current value
not supported shuttles dont need changingif you want something faster than a shuttle in space and warp with an offensive capability train up inty they make great runabouts
a carrier pilot can assign fighters to a shuttle
i think the ship the op is looking for is called a frigate

oh no my isks arent gonna be risk free
its an unfortunate side affect but thats what the war deccing corpalliance is trying to do by declaring war on said corp  disrupt their abilities to do thingsi dont think wardecs should nullify in incursion contested areas
i agree with this if concord doesnt want to get its hands dirty with incursions then the system should have its sec status reduced until it is cleared and has remained clear for a few days after the incursion has endedas to wardecs live with them they are the only thing that makes hisec remotely interesting which is why i moved to 00 and have never looked back
if someone wants to spend the isk to prevent you from doing something profitable thats simple interdiction and wholly in the unrestricted light and vein eve likes to cast itself inits bad enough that there are three highsec incursions that spawn for every one lowsec one which carries with it hazards from not only wardecs but gardenvariety gankers but now no one can stop your iskmaking eitherno just nothis idea intrigues me any i would like to subscribe to your newsletterand from an rp perspective it raises a decent point if concord show up to kill someone who ganks someone running a highsec incursion why dont they also help you kill the sansha the answer because youre their slaves doing their work for them ooooooh meta

not supported i think that says it all the system works well and consider once you put a change like this in place how long will it be before pilots demanded the right to swap implant in and out like modules some choices should just be lived with
the csm is the ing outlet for ccp like they would let any csm dictate game design they will listen to little issues of course but huge game changing things harhar the csm is nothing more then high demand companies putting a jobs email in their contact area this email of course goes right to the trash
this is a very vicious interpretation of our activities 
sorry i dont mean to discourage you and i do think there are issues in eve but i dont feel that ccp needs all this pageantry to figure out what those problems are i think the csm has a psychological effect on the players base as it makes them feel in control and maybe thats a good thing but i dont think people need to fear nc goons or any player affecting the balance of eve from a game design perspective
as long as 10 ships will be killing something faster than one people will keep trying to outnumber the enemy
deklein has a greater proportion of 065 or better systems than any region in the game that isnt a drone region
itt perhaps the only person who really understands competitive advantage
so you all promised to protect the interests of those of us who hack it out in null sec now ccp is on a null sec nerfing rampage what is csm 6 going to do about it
i strongly urge the mittana to quit in protest of this hate crime against the eve player base
nullsec rampage  poster in hyperbole shocker
the patch is being rushed in during the csm transitional period and given that were not yet seated were not yet in a position to influence this decision that being said we havent been asked what we think of it either i can assure you we will have a united position on this subject soon
thanks for the updatesee everyone now that we have a real csm filled with actual players who care and not a bunch of high sec noobs exception being vuk lau who did the best giving the situation of being surrounded by morons like csm 5  will actually get donei salute you sir 07
well an easy way to open negociation all leave your csm positionsthat would be clear enough for ccp
maybe actually wait till they even do something constructive before you tell them how f4nnytastic they aretbh most of the carebear complaints about the anom changes seems more a knee jerk reaction without looking at all the changes in close detail and how exactly they will affect null secthe oooh noes dont take my sactums away isnt an effective argument against itwe survived np before we had the carebear changes to spacepersonaly i can see good and bad with both sides of the coin ie i like the idea of true sec actually meaning something again but will it definitly make some space crap especially with the changes to plexs in null sec and the l4 nerf supposed to be coming or will it just reduce the isk coming into gamelower the prices of the market and opening up more space meaning more pvprisk vs reward is unbalanced just now with null sec actually being fairly safe if not safer that empire in some parts
indeed the long term consequences of this change are  in an immediate sense  unforeseeable it may act as a significant conflict driver it may not its important to also note that higher trusec means more than 2 sanctums so most regions will have at least a handful of systems which have a fairly reasonably amount of sanctums in themhowever it is unfortunate that regions like pure blind will be getting a kick over this well have to see how it plays out over the next couple of months once a change this significant is made the process of analyzing the aftereffects is long and arduous
yeah some regions look to be hit worse than othersprovi looking to be one of the really bad onesbut then again it was considered crap before but i think what cva when they had it did with itreally opened up a large section of space that gave newer players to null sec a chance to experience itwould this change make a drive towards that againwho knows but theres no doubt the current meathod with massive coalitions holding some space and renting out the rest isnt an ideal situation
i would assume the nons of them are giggling like schoolgirls
in cas you missed it ill quote it for you dear op originally by the mittaniyou ccp guys do know most modern alliances reimburse fleet ships and so the actual trusec of a staging system has absolutely no impact upon the combat strengthability to fight of an alliance at war rightso if youre in an good alliance you can still fight like you desire as a 00 fightbearyoure set mate
csmegghead recently put out a dev blog stating that we the nc are to blame for inflation because we dont kill enough and make too much isk does he not understand that a healthy wallet is a happy wallet what am i supposed to fight with harsh language what the hell is he on about so this is the reason for the anomaly nerf i dont understand all this i saw lots of graphs and economic mumbo jumbo and fast talk i dont really think it is accurate at all to be honestwhat are your thoughts on it
my thoughts110 and im being generous
fully supported no need to reward people for suicide ganking if anything give them 1000 virgins would at least be a funny gift for it
there are portions of highsec i can enter i should fix that
cosmetic however i feel cosmetic stuff should be able to be paid in isk as well as an isk sinkas much as i would love attribute point remaps for plex i dont think the total game population would benefit from it even though i really really really would like it i dont want to support it
bump
yes please if you did this youd have a hard time ever separating me from my ishtaredit support derp
add to that more mods like other weapon systems like a damage increasing mod for low slots

just reported all those people in the thread who were simply trolling also supported 
well there is the issue of titan bridging into a maxxed out system as well as other capshaving a large amount of ships jumping in does create a lot of server load straight away so this specific fix wont be able to resolve that as such but once in the system request load for every kind of movement will be subject to the time dilationalthough the server wont be as backed up as normal from fighting in system so jumping in would be a little quicker i guessand btw im glad youre in support of this mittani i see my vote didnt go to waste i would like this understood and known to all though im pretty sure the effect has to be server wide so affecting all systems tied to the server the system is on therefore in the interests of all players on in the systems hosted on the server it would have to only be implemented on a prerequested dedicated server only basically fill out those fleet fight notification forms before downtime pretty plzthis isnt a suggested feature just preempting what i believe ccp would most likely say if they did implement ithope that answered some questions for u tyme xandr 
think about it even the op wrote while slowing down cycletimes would not reduce alpha damage it would reduce dps hence allowing for longer battles longer battles means as the op wrote time for more reinforcements to enter the target system and time for those dead to reenter the battle the very thing you are attempting at fixing lag due to blobs is the thing you are encouragingyou are only essentially creating synthetic lag the newly increased cycle time versus existing nonresponsive modules and creating a system that encourages even larger numbers of participants in a battle if you are in a super and the whole world starts flashing red you have a much greater chance with increased cycletimes to opt to exit the battle via the old crtlq option which means fewer dead caps and supers hence the ops suggestion that there are no metagame aspects of this proposal are falsethis proposal would also certainly help the largest of alliances  coalitions and be another nail in the mid to small alliances coffins note i am a member of an alliance in a coalition but pointing this out to be fair more chances to turn the tide of a losing battle by calling in another group of people but now with even more time if you are calling people from further away another hidden metagame aspect of the proposal for battles where one or more of the participants didnt have a chance to monkey with game mechanics ahead of timeat fanfest did talk with the dev who champions this idea and pointed these realities out even he agreed that the consequences could be exactly what is explained above if anything this proposal should be called the lag on steroids fix
if i dont recall the whole war on lag is to streamline server performance to allow players to fight lag free but its been seen that the more headroom u give the more players enter and fight this although isnt a bad thing in principle as the perfect situation ccps technical team want would be to handle any size fight lag free theyre goal is to slowly close the gap from the current situation to this perfect state from what youre saying it sounds like youre very much opposed to wanting a beautifully streamlined system capable of handling any size fleet fight i guess the reasoning would be that opponents outgunned would have to actually fight fairly and actually bring in game tactics into use rather then metagamingintentional server crash tactics to succeed against the odds tell me another game where this isnt considered deliberate hacking or cheating as apposed to having the whole server locked down with 3 12 hours of lag not knowing if your multi billion isk ship has survived or not through absolutely no fault of your own your fcs or the games actual in built mechanics less lag benefits both parties of a fight u do realise this right less lag means in actual fact less server calls per second so more chance of being able to lock and alpha something off the field plus you do realise that ships logging off take time to align and warp out from the field let alone the aggression timer that has to go before the ship actually disappears from the system what you call incurred meta gaming aspects of this proposal im pretty sure everyone at ccp would call a c t u a l designed game mechanics fair enough game mechanics would be stretched to an extent but they wont be utterly annihilated by the current clusterfk situation happening i agree a large alliancecoalition that has stagnated and become carebares shouldnt be allowed to keep space by game mechanics but something like that would not by sheer behavior muscle up enough to fight blob vs blob regardless of being allowed more time to rally more members to the fight purely for the fact they just wont fighttldri love the fact people cry at game fixes that means they loose an edge they shouldnt have even had in the first place since when should a game be augmented to allow the continuation of bugs and exploits than actually played using the original designers mechanics
all this proposal would do is replace the current server lag with intended module lag six of one and a half dozen of another and because it allows for more people to enter the battle does not counter the essential element of lag the blob itselfquite the opposite i am in favor of streamlined battles that require tactics over solely numbers but as was stated in the roundtable on the matter if you open the door to 2000 man fights people will bring in 2500 open it to 2500 they will bring in 3000 this proposal will not change that and then you have traditional lag and now defacto module lag nothing accomplishedand though i agree with you that the evemechanic of crashing nodes when things go south is reprehensible nothing proposed here will stop other methods of deliberately causing nodedeath that is why many fcs prefer not to drop into lagfests if avoidable look at the prolonged dance just this week between nc and nc up north both sides decided to not drop into that situation rather then rather then risk their caps  supers with lag uncertainty and in countless other instances where a fleet was stood down because the enemy was already in position in a way current lag does force some strategy this proposal creates more of a freeforall approach to blobbing with even higher numbers of conventionals and capitals  supers yes  but with the reduced dps due to module times being increased the chances to kill a sc or titan go down before it deagresses we have seen fleets sent home for fear of crashing nodes when things were going in that partys favor or being told they were too far from the battle if the modulecycletimer does accomplish anything and last i checked there are many other elements that contribute to lag that this proposal does not cover those forces will now enter the battlebut yes if a fleet  alliance  coalition just wont fight it should die but that goes beyond the conversation here

supported1st time i saw a nyx awesome ship and wtf did someone shrink it 
supported supers should be super sized but even so i like the command carriers idea too
this idea is also being discussed in the thread proposal mining makeover
my problem with that thread is it proposes to change too much strip miners with falloff bonuspenalty scordite with bistot cores denser oreslower miningwhile those ideas might be good for changing mining into something more interesting and fun my idea is to make mining more profitable for non macro miners while keeping everything else the samei did read towards the end a similar idea was brought forward hoping mine is clear and concise and doesnt represent a large overhaul of anything
youd fit in with csm just fine discussed heaps of stuff about nda
well well well some ideas on here are more promising than others i have to sayesan has some fair comments and yes the initial design of fof missiles mirrors rl fof systems but im also in agreement with bumblefck about the fact its 20th century tech and not untra futuristic tech so here is my reformed ideas on thisfofs should be a 2 fold system on the 1 hand they shouldnt require the use of the ships sensors in pvp but there should be some tiein to ships sensors when your ship isnt being ecmdso basically when ur not being ecmd fof missiles should seek out targets set out on the currently active overview regardless of whether theyre locked or not bt not in any particular order fofs should also seek and hit other combat related things like missiles and drones sort of in the way defender missiles dowhen you are being ecmd though anything thats not broadcasing a fof signal aka things that are set as blue will be a valid target whether theyre lcos or not fof missile behavior while youre ecmd should act much like nbsi with a show all overview for itselfi would add that the fof damage should be reduced for balancing
interesting points thanks for your contribution i think a big difficulty is somehow reconciling the suggested improvements with the danger of them becoming overpowered but as you have said and i agree with you having said it a few times so far  reducing their damage output to compensate would probably work wondersagain thanks for the input and were getting some good discussion here
yes please
mining is fine as it is atleast the system behind many players like mining cause you dont have to pay that much attention while doing itthe problem is its not worth it fix macro miners asap they are the real problem if thats done take a look at the need of minerals and adjust them to make mining a good incomeat the moment its not worth to skill a hulk and start mining you can fly lv4s in a raven in the same skilltime makes more profit
that was maybe one of the only entries ive seen here besides moving a bulk of the asteroids to randomly spawning grav sites that i have liked
this whole thread is based around the idea that wardecs arent meant to be for greifing
well ccp did state in the past that wardecs werent designed for griefing so yeah thats the right idea
1 also i would appreciate the option of which noobship to receiveliang
maybe an option to get one at each dock as well i use noob ships sometimes to traverse some areas better to get caught by an intie eject and quick warp in my pod before they realize then to get the suprise almost immediately upon entering a hostile systemedited to note that each time u dock in a pod
supported just add a get noobie ship button when docked or make it a permanently redeemable item with a 15 minute cooldown
ok i added the get a new ship idea to my proposal as it seems to be the most pop may of doing thisthx for the input everyone d
make it so
well overdue been needed since mid 2008 hopefully the csm this time can get something done by ccppretty big hope

i call upon all eve podpilots to petition for you to just deal with it
you aint seen nothin yet
could you come to deklein and make decisions for us we need someone to make real decisions for us ohdear
yes hes not good for the community but hell be there until at least next year unless they catch him passing nda material to the goonies be careful though hes already trying to marginalize the assembly hall where we can easily follow if hes representing himself or the community
if your ideas were any good maybe youd control the csmyou lost the battle of ideas dwi
i didnt select support when i wrote what i wrote because i have little faith in csms ability to get things done anyhow i do believe they can bring forth our ideas and opinions but ultimately i feel ccp knows the problems and choose to do little with it anyhow
hahahah oh godhes obviously going to casually breach the legally binding nondisclosure agreement he signed or will sign just for the superficial benefit of his internet spaceship alliance to hell with the consequencesgod youre dumb things like this have real world consequences you know you cant just get another character irl
remember back in 2007 a letter your alliance wrote concerning another alliance the news even hit the nyt 
so your logic is thus mittani represents the alliance that stood against developer misconduct and cheating and therefore is certain to break a legally binding agreement himself despite yknow having made a living off the law
irrelevant i also wasnt playing eve in 2007
it was in reference to what the quoted post said you goons are horrible at having conversations if you cant follow a conversation then maybe you shouldnt be having them
jeez so we plan to stop people from entering the csm because they are a part of a group you dont like nowpersonally goons in general is better than most players in eve due to the fact they know its a freaking gameon the other hand who would you vote for and did you vote at alli think that most people would rather vote for a guy they know and can be predicted to do what he promises and its easier to trust a person that might be in your alliance or it might even be a friend of yours instead of some nobody who spews out promises like no tomorrowyou should know that its a mere 14 of the eve population that even voted for csm 6 so you can expect at least the alliances of the members supported them because of what they are known for if 100 of the eve population voted no single alliance could vote forth their candidate on their own
yes were just going to suddenly start spreading nda protected material now of all times the guys who no one likes who have been involved in every single csm are now going to just start breachin those ndas the other day i was walking down the street and i saw an nda and i was like  that and i breached that son of a  then the mittani descended from heaven and gave me a high fivewhat im saying is that you are dumb
id like it so right wing fascist closed minded conservatives who belive in intelligent design cant run for government but unfortunately they can because everyone is allowed to vote for who they want to the csm is the same the way i see the csm people like mittani and killer2 only got a few thousand votes each there were thousands more votes they didnt get than got if other csm candidates were better are winning voters then there might have been more competition i voted for killer2 not because hes in the nc but because i liked what he said and what he stands for mittani was second choice because i liked what he said too i bothered to read blogs and listen to pod casts so i could take an informed opinion had many of the whiners on here done the same they might realise that the csm6 represents not just 00 players but all eve players to much talking done here and not enough reading and learning
i dont believe it is possible to marginalize the assembly hall any more than it already has been
have you ever seen so many goonie bees around one hive guess they swarm when their queen bee is being talked about all kidding aside have you ever seen such goon participation in the assembly hall that is great but for the fact they want to marginalized it so the chairman doesnt feel the need to be obligated to represent the whole communnity that is what i would do if i had the big stick and was obsessed with an agenda i wanted to push hey this may all be hysteria hope so but warrents watching considering the chairmans past history
we luv2postalso we luv2own the csm
at this point these kinds of threads are just a waste noi dont trust the mittani either but whats done is done ccp isnt going to take an idea from any csm that will break the game ccp can do that on their own even if ccp did decide to hold another election for csm it would take them at least 6 months to come to that conclusion and another 6 months to make it happenat which point it is election time anywayso for the time being i say we just kick backrelax and watch and see what the new csm team does i am sure there will be many tears and threats to ragequitin which casecan i haz your stuffs and i need to go buy more popcorn
thread cleaned please do not discuss real world politics on the eve online forums
that obviously has nothing to do with our alliance having thousands of members of courseevery csm delegate was legitimately elected according to ccps rules concerning csm elections therefore there is no reason to start a new election
it is not a legitimate election if the mittanis character was not born in the eve universe i want to see the mittanis in game birth certificate
wait does he mean elected chairman or alleged chairman i cant tell through all the drooling idiocy
right now if someone has you locked they get yellow brackets around their icon on the overview if they try to harm youshoot jam etc they turn red id like to add one more mode to this  if someone is aiding youcap transfer remote rep etc the brackets should turn green if theyre both aiding and harming you like a tard make it striped redgreen or something this would make it a lot easier to see whats happening with logi etc in fleets and itd create no lagsince all the information is already being sent anyways not a big deal but itd be nice if this wound up on team bffs big list if you wanted to get ambitious you could also make icons for what the aiding effects are just like we get ew icons now but thats not a big deal
do this
yes
yes
why do you have friendlies on your overview in the first place
it would also show up in space which would be nice as well so give a thumbs up for a good idea noob
because youre a logistics pilot or youre paranoid about knowing that the reps are actually coming or you just like showing off how super powerful your gamingrigfromhell really is
brilliant

sure though id rather have red override green bracket than be striped
supporting a hersch post  winvedy good idea yes

i fly logi a lot knowing when the guardian feeding me is getting capped out and not transferring me any more is useful
i like the general idea it would be nice if the bracket icon could change instead of or in addition to turning green i have color vision issues and the yellowgreenred mix would make it really hard for me to determine who is doing whatother than that great idea
no reason why this shouldnt be in the game just make sure the colour is easily distinguishable from the yellow box id prefer a blue brackets because some shades of yellow and green are not easily distinguishable but thats for the whoever makes this for decide
simple and effective 1
0 good idea
this would be a really useful ui enhancementthe only caveat id add would be that if someone assists and aggros you they should still be redboxed
i like it thumbs up for a simple to implement yet very beneficial change

its a problem in lownull sec too station hugging carrier rrs a camper if it cant keep the camper alive he docks into carrier hops in a shuttle and warps off carrier simply docks if any threat to it is made lukka has been doing this for months there is absolutely no counter to it the best you can hope for is to survive which isnt that hard tbh lukka aptly named his carrier alts thanny risk free pvp of course he isnt the only one doing it i did it once just to try it out and yes it is cheating by any definition sadly the gms at ccp are not responding to repeated exploit petitions on the issuein any case there are a few solutions1 you cannot dock a ship inside a ship maintenance bay while under attack2 normal aggro rules apply you cant dock within 60s of an aggressive act3 docking in another ship transfers 15min playercorp aggro to that ship and adds a 60s aggressive action timer to them as well cant dockjump

1 internets for using white text i was starting to think you had a grudge with the color blind
thank you so much this is gonna be the best thing that happened to highsec warfare must exploit asap get it while its still hot
bump to get on the priority list
many botter are aware of the 3 strikes rule and use the character bazar to swap these characters outonce a ban has taken place a character should be un tradable for 6 monthsfollowing that it should show on the characters record
characters do not get banned accounts do how would swapping a character on the bazaar help at all
this is definitely open for opinions and suggestions to my original ideawhere i do believe mmorpgs need to have ways to simplify interaction i believe that local chat is no longer being used as such and is now a clairvoyance toolall local chat should worm like wormhole space if typed into it shows your presence otherwise it is blank or even an optional channel to jointhis may reduce the number of botting software as the majority of botting software utilize local chat to give inhuman response time to escapenow i do believe there was a mention of directional scan becoming faster and reaching further which would definitely balance not having local chat or in the least ease the transition i do believe though that the directional scan should get two modes of operation one being its current function and the other being similar to the draedis from battlestar or a spherical variant of current radar technology the mode would offer autonomous updating of the dscan so people werent mashing their scan buttons instead of playing the game that way pve guys still have a defense against sudden ganks but the autonomous scanner would be slower possibly 1020 seconds before making a full 360 degree sweepregardless i know people have been calling for local chat and dscan updates for awhile now
no
of for gods sake leave the nullsec kids their local if its changed ccp will be forced to redo the directional scannerproper directional scanning and combat probe scanning are one of the few things in this game that require some skill to do properly lets not do anything to make things even easier than they already are to the carebears out there
local intel works both ways nothing wrong with it imo the only people crying over it are the ones that seem to think 00 should be filled with easy carebear kills well it already is if you know how to set up a proper ambush wormhole space has no local for rp reasons no gates to report your entrace no ded this is fine as wh are not static and you actually have to look for themif all of a sudden gates despawned and moved every day and no longer appeared on your overview then mayberemoving local would only have the effect of giving recons god modeif you really want to catch those pesky carebears figure out where they safe set up sling bubblesand trap themid much rather live with the current mechanics than change them and hope that ccp would make a dscan that wasnt almost worthless also remember that the dscan had its frequency nerfed to 2 seconds because of lag issues
no most bots dont use local they read the data that is sent to the client so if local was changed to delayed mode bots would still be able to see if someone jumps into the system
in other words i cant get cheap kills because everyone in a system just cloaks up when i show up on local
in each system there are stargates installed by the four empires these stargates register pilots upon entry into the system and this information is made accessible to all pilots within the system thats the rp justification of local chat in wormholes there are no stargates resulting local chat only registers a pilot after a broadcast has been madelocal chat and dscan are fine the way they are you dont get much more from dscan except for shiptypes and direction you dont get much more from local chat except who the pilot is and what standing he is to youif your regular pve joe cant make do with these intels he isnt gonna make do or even make it
these appeared on evenews24 as a fake devblog but are actually great ideasdo thesesource
ok so give them a 5 tracking bonous per lvl and allow them to lock 2x more targets total of 4 when in siege mode that along with my orginal sugestion should fix dreadsfail for using alt to post
no neuts are already overpowered as it is
i know i knowthe hybrid issue has been absolutely beaten to deathhowever i wouldnt start a new thread this is the first thread ive ever started without a legitimate reasonokay the main premise for my idea is that hybrids as they are right now arent too bad in and of themselves blaster tracking and rail alphadps issues aside but they just dont work with the ships theyre on what i propose is instead of directly buffing the guns themselves give improvements to the ships theyre fitted onlets take a look at blasters yes there are fitting issues yes there are tracking issues and yes there is the problem of not being able to get in range to apply the dps alright lets see if we can fix the third issue instead of trying to increase blaster range which directly buffs the guns i propose that specific ship bonuses are given based on the gun type slightly more speed and agility per electron gun fitted i was thinking around 23 per gun slightly more shield and armor resists per ion gun fitted around 5and somewhat more shield and armor hp per neutron gun fitted probably 10 would doto me these bonuses would actually give a reason for the increased fittings costs and make the tracking and range issues somewhat more acceptable as you have different means by which to survive the approach and naturally i dont think the guns bonuses should be stacking penalized but open to different interpretationsrail gun using ships would also benefit from these bonuses for the corresponding gun types electron bonus applied to duals etc but other ideas welcomed
you want to give blasterrail megas a 70 ehp boost
not specifically but i do want to give a reason to fit hybrids if they dont boost the guns themselves i do see your point though perhaps a cap on the total amount gained through the boosts would be appropriate
passive shield tank myrmidom say wassup
the idea of putting ion and neutron blasters on an abaddon to tank it out is so absurd that i almost want to support it but no this is silly fix the gun characteristics themselves dont give them wacky nonsensical side effects
and perhaps a less ridiculously overpowered buff to hybrids might also be appropriate dont you think
okay apparently the hp buff is too much the specific amount is not supposed to be the main idea anyway thoughwould the hp bonus be more realistic set around 3 or 4and what about the speed bonus appropriate
getting bogged down on the specific numbers and ignoring the concept is just not very intelligent the idea behind this post is interesting just like many others that have been proposed and will be ignored by ccp
while i can appreciate outside the box thinking scatim has it summed up here in bold how do these types of buffs make sense even in a fiction world we still want the majority of it to seem logicalid amend to proper basic hybrid gun tweeks and apply better bonuses to applicable gun ships to make them more specialized make an eagle and a deimos really rock though the eagle needs more help than just the guns ftlog give the eagle a better hull design and add a midslot heh sorry ill save that for another thread
obligatory this is eve not wow consequence post
but i want to respec my priesterr i mean pvp toon

did you read every write upi doubt iti know i didnt
after reading the latest qen ive ran into a problem about player ignorance concerning me levels now i know that darwinism should work in eve and all but thats not really an argument against an improvement like this so since there is already a tool that can do this out of the game evemon blueprint section and it was mentioned in the qen lets just say that an ingame tool should be added for comparing materialtime requirements between theoretical blueprints with different mepe settings enteredit would work something like this there will be a window separated in two different sections one text entering box where you can type insearch for a specific blueprint when the desired blueprint is found and selected both sections will load default me0 pe0 stats for a blueprint each section of the blueprint compare window will have fields where you can change me and pe levels and see the results that will allow not only the comparison of the researched vs unresearched blueprint but of the two differently researched blueprints a reset to default button in each section of the window allowing easy loading of the predefined default mepe levelfurther iteration of this tool could involve saving presets for different blueprints and offering them in the research window when starting mepe research jobssupport if you like itcheersanti
absolutely not supportedthere are plenty of playermade tools out there for blueprint management so there is no reason for ccp developers to spend their time on one rumor is they have other things to work on
well considering the size of the suggested featuresfixes backlog how much time it takes for anything to be done and ccps work on redesigning the core of ui by supporting this idea it will only enter as a valid proposal that would be probably looked at somewhere mid next year optimistic supporting this proposal is just detecting the need for such a tool not forcing it to be done asap
a comparison tool is only going to benefit people who know to use iti would suggest that any me research job should provide a quote indicating what parameters of the bpo will change as a result of the researchie by researching this xxx bpo to me n each manufacturing run will save x capital cargo baysif they plug in a huge number theyll see some savings the clever ones will fiddle with the numbers and eventually find a number they like others will find reference to the x55 number and just use that the smart few will run their own calculations and know what me they want before they start the research job
only an idiot looks for an iwin button in eve closest thing is a supercarrierdid you know that the black ops portal is 54x more fuel intensive than the titan bride or jump bridges
it says 5000s i was pointing out that is incorrecthave you got a piece of barbed wire shoved up you ass or are you always like this
the unfortunate thing about that is that i can fit a t1 version of the same ship with the same cloak and lock in about the same amount of time i could handle loosing the instalock if they could live up to their description i think not
quite right i have never flown a black ops i was training for a widow off and on but never quite got myself into onefuel deep safe secure containers set them up in the systems you use and refill them once in awhile bookmarkss deep safes with storage etc have all been in eve a long time and a lot of people use them effectivelydropping a covert cyno to put your black ops on grid not going to worki only use eft to see how a ship fits and what kind of ehp align time and dps it can get just like anyone else saves you a bit of isk when you do finally decide to fit onea single ecm fails to jam a ship under its strength so i cant see it mattering if 3 have stacking penalties besides which ive never read up on it and you cant get a module that puts out 30 strength that im aware of most battleships dont exceed 26 points anyway so my original statement is correct in assessed valueim almost certain if someone suggested a perfect fix you would still stomp on their opinion and go all elitist youve posted contrary opinions and opposed most everyone in this thread perhaps youre just here to argue incoherently
personally i think the instalock is good and id be disappointed to see it go i could lose the velocity modifier and see a bit of a dps reduction possibly even lose a bit of armorshields in actual pointsfor that id expect to see a gain in the loss of holes in the resistances and actual covert ops cloaking rather than this fake cloak business lose the abilty to go beyond 99 cpu reduction for the sake of the instalock and gain a bit of agility as an added bonus theyre relatively quick already but with the loss of dps and armor it would be nice even a marginal 4 gain would be fair just dont tank the tank too muchi also noticed the slots assignement and powergridcpu are irregular comparing the black ops of each faction and their t1 counterparts that would be the first thing id look at in terms of balancing the class and trying to improve it
this post shows little to no understanding of the mechanics behind how these ships workalso an all level v widow with 2 jam rigs and 4 signal dispersion amps in low will still only jam at about 15 strength so i dont know where you got 26 fromregarding the covert cyno they have to be scanning your exact spot at the exact time you light the cyno 60 second duration 30 seconds if youre using a force recon it doesnt show up in system overview so they have no way to know wherewhen youve lit it however thats only when movingwith regards to dropping on grid think about what i said before you make yourself look even more ignorantalso lol doublepost

the general consensus is that the occupancy mechanic in factional warfare has little to no tangible impact on the game which reduces participation in that area of fw to the diehard few who run plexes for roleplay reasons and those who use them to try and find small gang or solo pvp neither group currently gains any real benefit from flipping a systemi propose the introduction of a new implant name it something like datafeed interface which would be cheaply available from the fw loyalty point stores and would require cybernetics i to use this implant would provide a moderate bonus to armour resistances shield resistances maximum speed and sensor strength it would only provide these bonuses while a player is a a member of a faction warfare militia and b while he is in a lowsec system his militia currently holds occupancy ofthis would be quite easily justifiable ingame by stating that the bunker in an occupied system broadcasts a constant stream of encrypted tactical data which can be tapped by this implant im not suggesting that the bonuses provided by this provide a significant boost but to merely provide an actual mechanical advantage to taking and holding occupancy within a system
well captains quarters should be on the test server really soon well actually it shouldve been there a week ago but they delayed it a bitmy guesstimate would be that 23 months after that it can be on the main server keep in mind that cq is pretty barebones just your character in a small room and they said theyd develop on that over the famous 18months so hopefully well eventually be allowed to interact with other avatars but i wouldnt hold my breath for thatim looking forward to it but i try to keep my expectations very low because ccp have a history of promising rather more than they deliver they even had a more extensive presentation of an older incarna last fanfestas for ship customization they actually discussed that at this fanfest youll be able to put all sorts of designs like corp and faction logos on them the current csm doesnt seem very keen on incarna although the smarter ones are at least resigned to it but i rather suspect that a lot more of their voter base are interested than they are willing to admit
this for the most part of course as long as 2 ships kill an enemy faster than a single one people will try and bring more people than the enemy in order to maximize their success chance in important fights however if the sov fights were split between lets say 10 concurrent objectives instead of one single big one youd be much likely to see the 1000 man blob split into 10 100 man fleets rather than pile every pilot in the same systemthe current sov system simply makes blobs mandatory to either attack or defendi for one im very much for activity based sov im no game designers so im not saying the following would be a good idea but what if the sov was an index based on number manhours spent in system x by uncloaked undocked not in pos shields pilots of a certain corpalliancecoalition i think this system would emphasize constant presence in enemy territory rather than assemble a huge blob for 34 hours every 2 days

couple things ccp has stated they want conflict drivers they want things worth fighting over and they want some space to be better than others because once again inequality does drive conflict and conflict is funpreviously truesec mattered in some regions and there was a direct benefit to owning better space it made generating income for your membership easier the introduction of anomalies was designed to get more bang for your buck out of space and make it so its not necessary to own large swathes of space in order to be effective they wanted space to be used and this provided a mechanism for even crappy 00 space to have some kind of value where previously it really didnt this change on one hand is a nod to conflict generation but implementation appears to be at odds with the original intention of making more 00 space worthwhile now the idea of making it so better truesec space is better isnt a bad idea better space should be better in terms of value and isk generation but the problem i see here is that while they made the best space moderately more valuable they made mediocre to bad space nearly worthless in regards to value why live in a constellation where its back to the good ol days in garbage space at all theyve dropped the bottom out and made owning that space worthless instead of worth less you see i dont agree with this list at all well the first one is obvious but the rest no these changes dont introduce a new dynamic they move space back to the preanomalies dynamic and reintroduced the concept of worthless space which we already experienced id be much more comfortable with this if the goal were a little more balanced and kept some mechanism in place to make worthless space worth something which encourages people to use it these changes appear to just correct a perceived imbalance that they never intended great space no matter where you are which is fine but the original concept of making space worthwhile was a good one and shouldnt be fully revoked
according to ccp drf is fighting over an awesome region called geminate due to its high security status and  oh waiti like the whole entrance for newcomer alliance rings a bell from dominions entrance for newcomer corporations which we all know how ended any minor alliancecorporation without decent connections and supercapital fleet wont hack it in 00 no matter how much devs want itccp simply decided that their dominion project wasnt what they thought it will be in the long run  no surprise here  and decided to scrap it under another improvement of 00 space and a cover story about upcoming good fights for the good space

carebears  seriously though i dont think itll be as bad as people thinki think more of the nah sayers are just a knee jerk reaction without really looking at the changes and how they might workpeople seem more concerned with their own individual wallets than having a game that works wellwe survived np before we had anoms and plenty of worthless space was well usedas i said before take the way cva ran provi as an examplewith the plex boost and the supposed l4 nerf it should hopefully make null sec more attractive than empireeven the lower end systemsboth balancing the risk vs reward and reducing the isk coming into game thus reducing market pricesit might also be interesting to see if larger alliances drop sov to save isk and then we have the possibility of attackers taking advantage of those sovless systems to cause havoci do agree it might not work out to plan but we shouldnt let fear of change rule our efforts to get a goodbalancedfun game

agreed drones again is the only weapon system which has a mod affecting tracking and optimal but nothing affecting damage
drones need love
supported  but the easier thing to implement would be to make the sentry damage augmentor rig a drone efficiency augmentor for all types of drones  combat utility mining and ewkeep the calibration asis on it as well
i really like the idea of rogue drones dropping drone implants
as long as they dont affect fighters or fighterbombers
true they should work along the lines of the distinctions made between drone skills and fighter skills fighters and fbs are technically drones and fall under the same training category and yet the skills modding drones do not affect fighters

part 1 of 2 im very very sorry scurrent server lag consists of a variety of different types of lag yes this proposal doesnt fix all of them but it does offer a fix for one of the more annoying ones for players on the client side and thats module lag as i can practically guarantee at least half of the players in fleet fights reactivate and resend module requests to the server when their modules stick and continuously recycle the increased cycle times due to time dialation would reduce the amount of rerequests for modules reducing the ahole effect as bosse i think put it lolthis is a proactive fix to reduce the amount of rerequests by players in combat thats the ideayes it is true that previous experiences in opening the limit to higher fleet numbers have seen higher numbers than expected but this is not a linear thing there is a limit to how many people can be rallied we just havent seen the top of that curve yet it doesnt mean we should give up when the going gets tough nothing easily attained is worth it this proposal will help reduce emorage from module lag which generally causes module reactivationsrerequests to the server thats unnecessaryso in summary yes this doesnt tackle module lag in a perfect world but when do u ever experience a perfect world scenario in the real world you dontthis proposal reduces the chance of emorage from module lag in large scale combat and therefore reduces the amount of rerequests for the same things in the server plus with the reduction of the speed of battles you reduce the amount of necessary normal activations compared to a full speed battlethats very true and it was never ment to the same tactics to cause node death will still be possible but and this is a biiig but massive amounts of server requests by players will be extremely obvious in comparison to players genuinely waiting for their modules to cycle at the longer durations if anything bosse could write an automatic program that can hunt down clients sending massive amounts of requests compared to a normal amount for a particular ship as scs will be putting out more requests to the server from fighters etc than an ecm bs for examplewhat bosse wants to do with these people is up to him and ccp but forcing a client dc with a relogging cooldown timer i dont think would be that harsh bearing in mind what that person is trying to dotbc
part 2 of 2no as i had said before the proposal helps fix module lag and reduce unnecessary rerequests yes you could say that the reduction in rerequests might mean lag when jumping in to a new system would be reduced but i doubt it would be abolished entirelyyou do realise that this fix is designed to augment anything in the node that has a time based element in its calculations that includes deagression timers so yes dps will be reduced but everything combat related scales to the same degree so you would have more time to kill that super because it would take longer to deagresssure thats if you want to jump a massive fleet into a less lagged system that it would normally be but the amount of request sent and needed to be recieved by that fleet to actively start pvping is a lot more than the fleet already loaded and on grid so current strategic decisions on jumping in still applies the increased module time would partially reballance this to what the original game mechanics were intended to do and thats what we all want the only people who dont want that are people who want to carry on using metagamingnodecrashing advantages they shouldnt really have in the first place currently in massive lag fleet battles your ability to pvp is irrelevent its almost purely guesswork whether youd live or die and youre totally at the mercy of random elements that 99 of people dont understand and cannot predictso at the moment yes its a blob fest that means if u blob bigger u winbut the less lag affects players ability to pvp the more skill and battlefield tactics trumps blob sizeim done now thank god s
good idea is good

go big or go home
i support this on the general principle that most videogame 3d models have the ability to scale them up or down readily attached to their code if ccp agrees with this proposal it should fall under one of the little things and be very simple to apply and roll into a larger list of updates simple and reasonable i would say that carriers in practice shouldnt be tremendously larger than battleships but the fact is that the stats in game of a carrier reflect a ship that is quite some measure larger and more powerful than a battleship so they simply should be larger carriers should rival dreadnoughts in size and supercarriers should stand as a halfway step in size or thirdway between dreadscarriers and titans if a dreadnought is 01 and a titan is 10 then a carrier should be no less than 01 and a supercarrier should be no less than 035 in terms of scale factor

yeah i was wondering what eleged meanthonestly ive brought some cheese along to go with the whine the election happened votes were cast somebody got more votes than somebody else i didnt get enough votes to get in boo frickin hoothis was one of the biggest voter turnouts of any csm election that means that this csm is the most representative of the eve population if you dont like the way the the most representative csm turned out perhaps you should get involved and run yourself next timeas for goons posting in fi and then the ah the csm is effectively a filter for ccp  if ccp employees had to wade through all the bad ideas that get posted there over and over again theyd have no time to actually implement anything goons shutting down the badgame breaking ideas which is what ive observed simply makes less noise for the csm to wade through so they can focus on the occasional idea with some meritone could call it academic rigour
oppeople have voted he got elected theres nothing to say nowno matter if you like it or not if you wanted to do something you should have done it when elections time was upthis kind of thread is ridiculousif you want to do something now the best you
i also dont thrust the mittani or you or that bearded woman or the pope or even myself an obvious poasting alt if there ever was one that is because this is still eve online and there is nothing wrong with machiavellian politics even if the defendant was chosen just because he is in gs its still a choice from a large enough player base thus democratically sound
i still cant decide if i am amused by the very concept of a petition of distrust or an alleged chairman perhaps i dont have to decide
have an eve client logged off after a lack of activity for a certain number of hoursthinks this proposal would help with reduce lag in jita a huge portion of jitas population is inactive inactives building up on gates safety to individuals who fail to log off for one reason or another makes sure afk cloakers are at least semi activei definitely dont support this being a 30 minute timer or something im recommending it be a 24hr timer it isnt so short that people can safely fail to log off and the game save them it also shouldnt be so short that basic automatic activities become unusable like auto pilotingthere are obviously some issues to support both sides of this but with some balancing of the timer it could definitely do more good then harm
i like the idea works for ccp too with less load
i think the complaint will come from afk haulers some of those hauls can be a multihour affair as fun as it is to haul a freighter full of tritanium 30 jumps most do that afk as long as it differentiates afk autopilot from just sitting there doing nothing afk seems good
create more uses for macro and there will be more of them not supported
i would say 15minwhy hours and then you see bms feast and cloaked stuff orbiting  see the differencethey are not inactive they are just flying but how make the difference between someone just exploringscouting and someone orbiting to avoid being kickedrequests clientserver etc if that stuff was that easy to implement they would do it but they cant add another problem source that will not end the first one
i would rather the image of the pilot would get a grey outline or something when they go inactive for 45 minutes or so i dont think forcing them to log off is really necessary
do it
good idea
good idea
1st in all honesty this post seems rather irrelevant to me i do not see how it would effect game play at all with the exception of putting yet another isktime sink into the game and while ccp has recently done away with some of them we still have plenty more to go around2nd i think it would be unfair to older smaller corps to charge for holding onto a name more and more as time progresses there are plenty of pvp pve and industrial corps that contain 5 to 10 members and have and will for a long long time they simply do not want a large corp so they do not have onehowever i will go with there are several probably thousand inactive corps in game eventually overtime if something is not done we will simply run out of useful names for our corps thus as someones else mentioned i would be in favor of a timer the timer lasts a years time ie the last member to log off for the corp a year ago this second day ect would be the last person holding the corp together so essentially the corp is dead as none of the members are active all assests the corp has should be divided automatically between the players based on estimated worth including stuff in impound if sufficent isk is avalible between the corp members accounts to pay for the impound blls and cash in teh corp walletonce done then the corps members get auto ejected and then the corp is killed offthe reason for the split in assests is simple we all know players who were gone for a long time only to return at some year or 2 later date when ccp improved something they could not stand they worked hard for what ever thier corp had and loosing such things would be a major turn off to thems3
if this is an actual problem and i dont think it is id attack it from the opposite directionif a corp has no open offices and no members have logged in for over a year someone who wants to reuse the name or ticker can pay concord a nominal bribe 1b isk perhaps to liquidate the old corp
well the idea is simple pilots can use ships wrecks asteroids stations and other stuff as cover making combat tactically more interesting
something like this would cause the server to  itself
this would be great for gameplay in a singleplayer environment alas that is not eve the server chokes when calculating the lifespan and flight path of missiles in large fleet battles can you imagine the server calculating lineofsight cover bonuses for ships at the same time players currently abuse missile launchers to deliberately cause lag you know for a fact that they would set up defensive screens of anchored modules  a pos and then put their blob behind it giving the node an aneurism while they were at it and then theyd spam ungroupped missile launchers just to spite the server great idea unfortunately the hardware and social realities regarding it make it a big nono no support here sorry
hmm i was wondering why eve would not be able to implement this while black prophecy already has done this which works fine with 20 ships in a small area
because in eve there are often many more than 20 ships in a small areaalso black prophecy isnt made up of decadeold code stacked on top of decadeold code like eve is
just pointing out that it is possible with 20 ships in another mmo for me immersion is breaking when i can fire through 2 asteroids or ships and hit the one behind or better yet shoot my lasers through a station i do not think a line of sight has to be calculated in the missile case as an object in space is created it simply hits the object in front of another as i see it only the collide mechanism between objects has to be rewritten which can be difficult but not impossible for there is one active now if this collide mechanism contributes to a lot of lag it would be more difficult but i dont think this is the case here for how many collisions take place during a battle that contribute to lag now that would be an interesting question regarding the implementation of cover
20 is one thing but this is eve 2000 would be a more relevant number to quote in some battles this would need to work well with at least 1000 though and the server breaks around that level as it is not supported
you seem to forget that a collide mechanism between 2 objects in space already exists it would be interesting if lag is contributed by this mechanism if so rewrite it and maybe add the cover mechanic as well
the collision mechanics will apply to the guy flying into something they wont affect the two hundred maelstroms locking him and sending a volley of 1400mm at him with cover mechanics suddenly those 200 maelstroms are affected by the 50 wrecks on the field the 300 ships red and blue between them and the target because if you bring in cover chances are you bring in screening too and all of a sudden the server has thousands more things to keep track of it falls over too soon as it is a cover system would be truly horrible
not supported because of lag issues but the core idea is sound  its damned stupid seeing ships shooting through a space station to hit something on the other sideeditimplementation idea  use some kind of shadow casting to see what shots get blocked
whose definitionplease do this ill stick a carrier in npc corps so i can get 15mins of free aggression as often as i want
your reading comprehension fails jones i didnt say the person docking into the carrier or the carrier get kill rights on anyone im saying everyone aggressed to the docking ship suddenly has 15 minute kill rights on the carrier too that said its the most complicated of the options the first two simpler methods are better i thinkas for cheating its an exploit because its doing something with game mechanics that were not intended it is cheating because it renders you completely impervious to counter attack you attack targets at will get into trouble instantly dock and there isnt anything anyone can do about it its no different than if you found a way to glitch a cloaking device so you could lock and attack while remaining cloaked
based upon how youve the you is important here defined exploit id say the reason ccp hasnt been responding to your petitions is because they define exploit quite differently if this really was an exploit per the ccp definition the people that have been doing this since carriers were released over 5 years ago would have long since been banned and the exploit fixed just because you disagree with it dont believe it makes for fair play fair play in eve of all things or cant find a counter to it of which there are several does not make it an exploitwant to know what real exploiting looks like leave fw and go to 00
the last big exploit i remember reading about was in wh space people were getting perfect turrets ac that hit for full damage at 249km before that it was pandemic legion cheating with local hacks or some crap involving a monkeythe largest one i cam remember occuring was the free moon goo exploit that went on for yearsbefore that the whole t20 tinfoil preferential drops and insider information on game mechanicsas for the hot swapping of ships using a cha its not an exploit its just bad game design it was bad in lowsec but there was always a slim chance you could bump the carrier off station or just dont pvp on stations the ability of the orca to project this limp wristed tactic into empire while hiding under concords skirt is terrible

ccp should have something like a contest for tattoos plus hair dues what do you think
maybeif it was judged in the same way as the recent ship design contest players voting to select finalists ccp selecting the winnerswouldnt necessarily solve this issue would give me an official route to submit my own recreations of old tattoos through if it comes to that but i think the only chance of such a thing being among the winners would be if submitted as a complete pack the contest rules might only allow individual submissions however
i thought you were on zeros side in this argumentor any other argument for that matter zero says ccp doesnt control the game you say ccp is attempting to break the game to stop you youre contradicting each other the fact is that ccp will change the game not break it to save the game if they determine thats what is necessaryit wont be the csm it wont be forum warriors it wont be trolls such as zero with their lies fake logic low intellect and overabundance of posting it will be ccp ccp making the final call to preserve the game and their income and you can pound your tiny fists on the wall of reality to no effect this is not the real world this is ccps worldregarding your comments on inferiority seriously you can look at your group and call another inferior all you have is quantity with a very low percentage of that quantity processing any quality and of those that can be considered to have desirable game qualities there are even fewer worth having a conversation with unless one is very very drunk youre a core of good enough surrounded by the slow witted dregs of society the only thing you have to fluff your egos is mutual appreciationwindjammer

i hear tale that the devs are looking at ways to improve bookmark efficiency reduce lag etc here is a thoughtimagine bookmarksfolders can be owned by players corps or alliances corpalliance leadership can determine who can access or edit these marksfolders these bookmarks are all stored server side  in a single place as such updates to bookmarks are immediately available to those who can access them this completely eliminates the need to even copy bookmarks into cans for security reasons if a player leaves a corp or alliance their access to those bookmarks inherently goes away additionally short of a player flying to those corp marks and making their own personal bookmarks for those locations a corpalliance could also prevent normal copying of those marks the old way personal bookmarks remain the same but just need to be made more efficient ability to share bookmarks with your alts  rather than copyjust some thoughts cheersmarne
agreed certain questions or decisions that ccp wants the community to take part in can be enquired by direct votes that gives a better result on what the community likes
less than 10 of the eve playerbase could be arsed to vote on something that affects everyone and that was the largest turnout in history how is this going to help at all
way to break immersion obtuse isd members writing about csm as if it were ic is bad enough
i may have a simple solution for ccp to consider as i believe the author is not so much worried about her mouse dieing as she is about the shear time sink required on thisccp could probably easily add  keep exsisting routes  as a check box when switching products on a factory as for the storage facilities and luanch pads they could have a simple create route delete route and add in  create multiproduct route  with say an increase in link total m3 as it has to account for all manner of possible products and combinations there ofjust my 02 isks3
nice story but ppl cynoing in show in in local too 
fixed like warp on dscan under x distance
there is a reason why the population of null is 11 and wh is 2 and high is 80 of the population its because they want to feel safer taking the wh and 00 comparison both make good money and same pvp rules and what not but no one wants to deal with the local delay bull if they did they would move to wh where they wouldnt get their sov systems taken
local is fine it doesnt need to be fixed because it isnt broken
the sansha incursions has enraged the other pirate fanctions and they too are now on the offensive to drive out the capsoleers who have invaded their space guristas angels blood raider serpentis and drone incursions will now occur throughout nullsec and lowsec with the increased war brought on by the pirates concord has sent out agents to nullsec to help curb these incursions in retaliation the pirates have sent out agents to combat concords new police actionswhat we get pirate faction sansha like incursions in nullsec and lowsec adding in new pirate faction capitol ship bpcs carrier dreadnought super carrier and new pirate faction capitol ship class modules fighters fighter bombers new concord agents level 15 in nullsec space that give missions specifically in nullsec against the pirates new pirate faction agents level 15 in nullsec space giving missions against concord in nullsecwith the expansion of concord forces and agents concord will need to cut down on some spending to pay for this expansion into pirate space all pirate bounties will be reduced by 50 across eve highlownullsec lp points for completed missions will increase to help alleviate the reduction in income for players
1 support would like to add that any system with an incursion in it would turn off all moon mining also level 5 mission arcs that would require capitol ships to complete and yes you would fight pirateconcord capitols using the new sleeper ainot too 
no you want lvl5s in 1 sec to totally crash concord lp valuepirate lp are already lucrative enough as is no need to crash the market to make the rich richer
concord lp already crashed missions in player owned space would be a nice way to help make low truesec space actually worth living in i guess
having 1sec lvl5s paying 150k a pop will crash it further its not worth living in because of the yerrness change anything else and it still wont be worth living in fixes nothing while bringing down incursion site running as collateral
the idea is to bring more people to 00lowsec and flesh out the incursion model to include the other pirate factions if the only thing you are hung up on is your little piece of isk pie being shared then present and alternative to concord funding players to fight the incursionby no means is concord set in stone it is just the most reasonable faction to pick since they are the only ones to hand out bounties for pirate npc kills tweaking bounties and lp is just the sort of thing ccp likes to do when giving out new content the current direction theyre going to remove isk faucets would make this idea more reasonable spread out the isk potential and not make more
i think low and nul sec should have some very good missions in there something to really get the toons to go in therewe need something that will get players want to go to low sec like very good rd missions or better rewards for mission better than the ones they have maybe later that special tshirt for you toon character
more stuff should be in null sec for a draw agents with missions would allow supporting more players in the same system and add variety instead of the same sanctums or whatever else missions with storiesbut have a agent be generated in a systems with a station and have them upgradable to get to the higher desired level quality based on truesec maybe have them a different faction from existing ones of local npc settlers and residents of null sec who are outside the bounds of any of the 4 main empires having some kind of unique rewards in a lp store that cant be had by the many navys of empire and vise vesia being that beyond the borders of their space its not like the main empires are going to have any vested interest in spending resources to protect people who are not their own or giving rewards to those who doalso add to that have the agent be customizable by whoever owns the station race bloodline and name
are you aware that concord missions existed in the past and were removed because people running them was recovering security status too fastpirating has already very little consequences you want to make it even easyer
how about deploying the patch on a test server to see if their are any problems before you deploy to tranquility
you know its sooo crazy it might even workd dunfortunately they do and it doesnt work anywhere near as well as they hope it doessadface
so far i have four production colonies each producing two different p4 specialized commodities ie integrity response drones nanofactories etci noticed during hauling and importing the p1 commodities that the capacity of the launchpad is just not enough for the p1 stuff that i put into them usually i just put in enough p1 stuff to last at least half a day which is well over launchpads limit of 10000m3 i know i could use the customs office to hold the excess but i dont want to be bothered with having to constantly monitor 4 different production planets to see when i could start importing the excess to continue production since each ship load of p1 stuff is carefully measured to produced at least half of the p4 components needed for final production and generally i dont like my measurements to be disrupted by something as simple as a launchpads capacityso can you guys please upgrade the launchpad capacity to something like 15000m3 or at least give us the option to upgrade the launchpads ourselves as we would with the links
as i see it launches are there for low skill pi having more skills obviously allows for upgraded cc and thus a space port to upgrade the cc to have the launchpad having the most cargo would make the other two pointless i would recommend replanning your planets to have materials routed differently and stored in other placesit works fine for my planets ill usually have a space port for imported materials and another for exportingdont take offense to this but this seems more of a gimmie this rather then an actual thought out idea to changing how pi work i never had a problem i just calculated an amount to run reactions on a planet and dumped that much in everything being made went into a 2nd storage place so its more of a deal with it issue sorry
firstly look at the capacity he is talking about he means spaceports not launchpadssecondly he is talking about production planets not extraction planets so routing is not so much of an issueto go from a p1 up to a p4 requires a fair amount of capacity and it would be a darn site easier to have larger spaceports instead of having to drop some material in onesome in another etcdont support just increasing the capacity but an option to have a double capacity at appropriate cpupg does appeal
same here using 2 space ports or 1stock center only for stuff transit between extractorsprocessors but i wouldnt say no to some space port capacity increase at the same time you upgrade your command center double it at lvl5 skills
no the capacity should be decreased probably swapped with storage to make that useful
bite the bullet and join the rest of new eden in using dual launchpads for your p1p4 production planets it works and lets you do 24h of p4 productionalthough having said that larger launchpads would be hella sexy
that would be nice wouldnt itsigh

the past csm didnt represent a lot of players and the current one shouldnt be considered a absolute god of them neither the players are the players no one but the players are themnull sec has few stations as is in the lot of it the author of the thread picked up the most densely packed regions hardly be considered a measure of all null sechow is a space empire supposed to exist without stations are we to consider npcs the only ones permitted to do so how about each player makes free space what they want of it with no buggards telling others what should be stations are the one place which things are safe it seems odd to make sov 0o space stations different then any other how about have all stations attackable let no one be safe you want to empire war and loot a null sec station null sec can loot your base wherever it is

warning below is a long postbackground due to recent conversations with some of my more industrialist friends it has been brought to my attention that ccp intends to enhance the industrialist side of things with a store front name branding of ships and items and the likeapparently this was all gathered from their watchingviewing of fan fest blogs vids forums and the like oddly despite selling literally billions of isk a day making stuff doing pi and the like they seem to have more time to read such things then i domaybe its my life style but enough ramblingobviously as most industrialists tend towards the topic changed to bpos research bpcs and of course invention out of which several really good points were brought up1 what good is name branding anything if at the end of the day its still the same old shipitem anyone else can sellthe answer is of course for those of us more pirate like then others like myself i know who the easy rich fat targets are aside from that not a damned thingso over the last few days i have thought about that and being one of those that have been around a long time and having million of sp to my name i have the same problem many do training skills just for the sake of having them never intended to use them even with a year and UFFFD break i have 60 million sp and damned sure it would be 90 million or better if i had not taken the year and UFFFD breakso i have come up with some suggestions to do the following1 make name branding usefulstep 1 new skill  science  tech ii bpo creation give the ability to create a tech ii bpo out of a tech i using the invention method i am thinking something like a 25x training skill and could only be trained if if you have say 80 million sp to start with most of which dedicated to industrial and scienceits really very simple you take your well used and heavily research bpo for that nice fat isk making domi raven or other tech ii possible ship and stick it into the invention slotat level 1 of the skill you have a 5 chance of making a perfect researchable tech ii bpo a 5 chance of making a locked tech ii bpo of poor to moderate quality a 40  chance of absolutely nothing happening and a 40 chance of loosing that perfectly good bpoat each level of the skill your chances of making either a researchable bpo or a locked bpo increase by 5 thus at lvl 5 you would have a 25 chance to create either and only 25 chance of total catastrophe this of course should be possible to mod further using decryption and other invention related items i was thinking somewhere around a 70 total to make a tech ii bpo either locked or researchableresearchable bpo one that can be researched as normal at any lab anytime as you see fitlocked bpo its stats are its stats its like a copy in that regard but at least it can be used indefinitelyof course this still did nothing for name branding but at least it gave the industrialists something to do with their skill points
step 2 new skill and research options  science  tech ii bpo modification gives the ability to rewrite some of a rsearchable tech ii bpos attributes at certain labs preferably in empire only and only with the assistance of a research agent or maybe with a special lab only in low sec00the skill the skill allows a person to change attributes of one item and give them to another section of the same item as an example take your average tech ii ship it has hull armor shields cargo bay drone bay engines etc etc etc you could look at the bpo and just like you can adjust the attributes of your character you could adjust the attributes of the bpo take some off the shields and give them to armor thus making it have higher armor points then before take some off the engines and give them to the power core thus giving it a better overall amount of power the possibilities are limitlessagain the skill should be reserved for those with 80 million  sp and most of that dedicated to science and industrial areas again make it a super long training time its worth it after alleach level of the skill allows one point to be removed from any one area and given to another area only 1 change should be allowed per bpo ever so if you do it early on thats it your done you really should wait till that skill is trained to max to change a bpoi know i can hear some screaming but wait that will unbalance the game  shut up for a minute i am not doneobviously i already discussed research options above but after further consideration everyone has complained about the lack of things to do in low sec and by god this seems like one place you could kill 2 birds with one stone make it a research lab in low sec only boom now the industrialists have to go to low sec at least occasionally make the research on such changes hyper long as well ie say 10 days per point changed so 50 days total for such researchstep 3 new skill  modified bpo construction  industrial skill  allows an industrialist with a modified tech ii bpo to actually build such an item again hyper long training time chance based allows a max of a 50 chance of the bpo being followed exactly a 20 chance it will still make some adjustments to the areas it was altered in a 20 chance it will not follow the bpo at all and simply make a tech ii item like any other tech ii item and a 10 chance it will make the biggest ball of crap ever seen ie a totally useless version of a tech ii itemok so now we have a viable reason to have name branding but ya know what those of us who seldom if ever do industry are not going to simply give up our piratemercpvepvp like lives and go research something dun be ascared i got something for us as wellstep 4 ok so those new tech ii ships and parts are rolling off the self like clock work hundred of them go out into space but wait i just bought one and aside from having crappy shields on my all new tech ii apoc geddeon domi or what ever i am not able to use that ultra great power core yet or that enhanced armornew skill  modified ship command possibly multiple skills for each race class and the industrial ships again this should be a hyper long skill set dedicated to those with 80 million  sp and obviously in this case those with a strong lean towards either combat or ship skills as an added benefit this skill should make use of the modified ship and improve upon it at max levellvl 1 would allow for 21 use of the modifications lvl 2 42 use of the modification ending with lvl 5 a 104 use of the modification so lets say your flying that uber tech ii domi and your preferred ship building has created a ship that has crap shields normal everything else but a bigger drone bay at 1st you would be able to fly it but aside from the crap shields you would not see the bigger drone bay as you skilled up you could use the full extent of that drone bay plus 4 more then the design called forthis gives those combat oriented players a reason to stick around and gives everyone something to strive for it gives the hyper older players a slight edge over those who are simply just oldi know some are concerned about lag effects but if they intend to implement branding reasonably this should create no more lag then that will and worst case scenario they can always ditch the new turret effect for a whiles3
basically what ive been hearing from you guys is that you think the bonuses dont make sense okay how does the ship slowing down in space without reversing thrusters make sense or anything else that doesnt conform to physics the higher fittings costs denote additional functions so why not be able to do what other known modules can already do which is not out of known physics phones have camera functions now for instancei would love to fix the guns themselves but ccp isnt going for it what im trying to do is provide a means for the ships to be able to actually function given the gimped guns from a strategic standpoint it does make sensemelee or closerange fighter needs to be tougher to make it to the opponentlong range fighter with weaker weapons than other long range fighters compensates by at least being harder to killbesides i think an addition to the original post may ease your mindsall bonuses apply to base stats only
im not active here much but i keep seeing and hearing people talk about mines and i see and hear all the shutdown responsesi hear1 it causes lag because of floods and floods of mines2 people drop them at gates and cause massive grief3 theyre overpoweredi bet these are the main 3 objections i hear these are crappy objections all of these can easily be corrected1 if its causing lag then limit the total number of mines this is easy to explain a mine uses a type of em field to hide itself this same field causes too many mines in proximity to each other to simply stop working there ya go a eveworld simplification to stop both lag on the server and explain why there arent thouseands of them everywhere2 mines are hostile intities gates shoot them on site solved3they were overpowered because they were hundreds and hundredssee number 1 not overpowered anymorewhip out an old copy of homeworld to see how mines work if you are in doubton to other thingsbooby trapsanchoring should let us deply hidden passive defenes for mining vessels iehow about stuff like1 cap suckers deployed in astroid belts2 directed gravity well generators based on their own cap and power they could hold a ship up against a rock for a defined amount of time rendering it disabled for a bit3 repulse blastsknock a ship 30k away with a blast of some kindill never accept we cant do it as a reply it can all be done id like to hear were considering that again rather than just an outright rejection of decent space combat tech there is zero technical reason why it cant be done for this game its just a matter of choosing whether or not to do itfaxx
please explain how a group selected from such a high voter turnout election could possibly be considered unrepresentative i dont understand it myselfrelative to previous elections
by definition a representative sample reflects the composition of the parent group which was specified as the playerbase as a wholeincreasing the sample size does not automatically make it more representative or reduce bias and can in fact make it less representative and more biased if sampling is conducted without due carehth
whine less vote more  next time were already pretty united the commentary about a 63 split or whatever is uninformed nonsense eve has so many obvious problems with it that theres no need to advocate controversial positions we can find common ground that the entire csm can rally behind
you hush up with your logic and your sense and let the angry people be paranoid
the best thing about antinc people being smug is that they just got nerfed and most of nc and goonwitest space is sitting pretty happy yet sing the praises of ccp for nerfing the nc  you
come now dont go spoiling their fun with reason or facts
and here i thought you were ignoring this because you were smarter than the troll known as zero i stand corrected and a little disappointed i hope youll perform better in the upcoming year i was anticipating some genuine entertainment as you seemed to be a bit more intelligent than your predecessorwrite to supporttentonhammercom let them know that if you cant believe in the credibility of their writers their site becomes devaluedwindjammer
well at least youre dedicated
guild chathey man darkenderrr did you see datamined loot screenshots from the upcoming raid patchno way link me to ittentonhammer link you mantheres no way this  is real its on tth everyone knows they write nothing but fake 
id be a lot more on board with this change if it upped good systems but left the worst systems upgradable to have sanctums at high cost if you wanted to develop it enough i want to see people living in that garbage space and not in empire which i thought was the point you can surely have better space without reducing the value of not better space to near zero
we already have too much isk coming into game and not enough going out  just increasing the incoming isk will hinder the game even worse than the proposed changes
this isnt increasing incoming isk the patch would reduce it from standing levels as opportunity is removedin theory in reality people will adjust and the isk flow will likely remain constant the reduction of isk in this game and the introduction of economic scarcity is vitally important im just not convinced this is the best way to accomplish that
it really isnt individual wallets it is the amount of isk alliances and corps spent on systems based on the new mechanics only to have them changed six months later for instance my corp built a station and fully upgraded a system mostly as a location for members to rat so they could afford to continue throwing ships at the drf forces we have been fighting for the better part of a year now now this nearhundred billion isk investment will not pan out and will negatively impact our corporation and many other smaller corps like ours for months to come that was a lot of isk that would have been better spent on drugs and hookers let alone something useful because ccp changed their mind far too late older corps already were established in more neg space and had funds stashed away that can be blown on ccps mistakes this little adventure did little more than to give hope to smaller newer corps only to throw it in their face as soon as they had fully invested in itas always game changes favor the wealthy older players at the expense of those less fortunatedrive conflict my ass the smaller guys wouldve been better off to move to take better space if ccp wouldve left the game as it was a year ago
if mittani and seleene do not spend their time educating the devs on the mechanics and reality of null sec i will feel like my votes were wasted if they can convince someone to iterate on sov i will do a happy danceif you didnt vote for them they arent representing you hths
too low contrast didnt read
op wanted to use the moron tag but could not spell it correctly
as stated visuals supported mechanics denied that said i feel there is another distinct benefit to having ships reach their warp bubble speed almost instantaneously upon entering warp at that speed we can make it much harder to see ourselves warping through planets and other celestial objects something that has always bothered me but i let it go as a necessity of the current warp systemupdate your original post and edit out the mechanical changes and you have my thumbs up at most in terms of mechanics id support is having ships reach maximum warp speeds the moment they enter warp and thus having maximum warp speeds reevaluated to maintain game balance

you dont understand how pricing works hint it is no more difficult to produce a dramiel than it is to produce a worm supported whats funny is the opponents of nerfing dramiels are using the same nonarguments that precede every obvious needed nerfgeneric stuff that could be applied to literally everything
while dramiels should defiantly be better then tech 1 ships and faction it should probably brought in line closer to other faction frigsas it is dramiels stand as overpowered compared to the others or the only one that doesnt suck major dongs considered how much it is used looking at the stats the big difference between drams and other faction frigs is the base speed 470 to 300 make them all closer to interceptor speeds of the respective race then that would do allot mabey 50 km slower so that the frigs that are specialized just for speed have some edge in that category being the preferred role of a elite frig is something small not going to speed tank and be fast add to that gurista need a equal boast to the damage of missiles to that of other frigs instead of being gimped with half the slots and no base boasts to firepower
war decs need a refresh
im not quite sure how it works for alliances but corporate war declarations have to be initiated via vote the minimum voting period is 24 hours which means that the war declaration wouldnt be issued until 24 hours after the vote even if one person has 100 of the shares and another 24 hours after thati think its just push butan with alliances which would be horrible oh hey bob lookie here a freighter carryin officer mods war dec the corp
it should be possible to render the own ship little bit differentso even if im out 30km i want to be able to see my ship yea even a frigatte i mean the own shipsize when scrolling out should be nonlinear to the rest of the universelets say the graphic is lying to me and rendering the ship bigger as it isthe ship is almost any time the center of my universe so if its minimum size is always seeable for me its just more comfortablethis can be an additional select box in the graficsettingsgreets flower
oi biatch i resemble that remark why you no love us no more on topic op is a moron mittens only took 1700 goon votes meaning he would have still gotten into the csm even if not one single goon voted for him christ he would have only just narrowly missed on the chair even think on that

eve has never been a sandbox i dont know what youre smoking minecraft is a real sandbox
qft heres a person who understandswindjammer
i say ccp controls the game zero says the players do its that simple really he even goes so far to say that the players control the game so thoroughly that the players are going to smack ccp on the nose with a rolled up newspaper and tell them to stop chewing on our slippers a quote from zero in the first paragraph of post 2 of this thread and that isnt even a reference to all the players no its a reference to a newly elected and heavily biased csm which doesnt in anyway speak for the majority of players like ccp isnt going to look at that pat the little miscreants on their heads and send them packing so the grownups can plan how to change the gamezero dedicated to his name head firmly in the sand crying out there is no gravity i can flywindjammer
i cant believe this is actually an issue for so many people so what if the vherokior have slit eyes its not like you cannot model around them i didnt have to try all that hard to make this toon look attractive despite what revoiution suggests about the bone structure the charecter editor is pretty powerful  sure there is an overall theme to the various races looks but there are plenty of ways to make any of the races have an attractive avatar im actually glad the vherokior turned out this way i like the look far better then the khanid or the jinmei
i didnt vote for you last election i wish i hadplease i am begging you do whatever you can
at first i was peeved that i could not make the face i did before as with my main goodbye long intaki hair but now i am mostly ok with itwhy the support i dont like that no approximation of the characters i had before is possible
for everyones information op is a notorious troll and has brought up this topic before just ignore her and let the thread die
pretty sure that it doesnt matter who proposed it a lot of people agree with the idea and if you dont like it you dont have to say anything
the point is that it is not proposed in order to contribute anything to the game but simply to troll a lot of people do not agree with the racial connotation in it at all
would like help for my khanid
im sorry i never read that if the voting was accessible in stations then more players would vote sure its slightly taking away from immersion but i for one dont find myself particularly concerned by the notion i dont think ive truly been immersed in any game for well over 10 years games i was immersed in way back whendragon warrior i  iiphantasy star i  ii  tried iii briefly but never got into it as it was at my friends housefinal fantasy iiv or v  cant quite remember which ones i play and i lost interest when it moved to 3rd person modeysmore like that though i cant remember themgran tourismo iii  iv were good too as was ace combat iv and armored core silent line and last raven lots of other good games but my spark was lost sometime around when final fantasy went to 3rd person 3d mode a lot of anime influence seeped into video games around that time which i found i didnt much like the old storyline short movies were cool the new ones not so much something changed and i lost interestnow i play games for other reasons experimentation is part of it as is social activity and experiencing what the developers have to offer seeing their work sometimes im really impressed like with eve here sure i dont play much usually just log in and chat with a few friends though i may sometimes run a site or do a quick few missions or even do a bit of pvp and like now sometimes i just dont feel like playing much anymore and decide its time to take a break once a year usually this time im going a little further than the past two and selling my mains and an alt ill still have one character training and doing some trade in jita when i feel like it but otherwise expect to be mostly out of the game for the next few monthsimmersion theres real life too this is just a step between that
thats why a representative republic is far better of course in the united states weve been transmorphed into a representative democracy when they turned the us senate into a second house of representatives with the 17th amendment
99 of the time players do not know what is best for them
what im proposing is very simple and clear to add a little delay for pos jump portal arrays between ships jumpinglets say we have a situation when two ships are staying near the jump bridge ready to jump then the first ship jumps normally but the second ship needs to wait a little before he will be able to activate jump portal arraythe delay could be 30 seconds or 45 or 60  the concrete number doesnt matter i think that even 30 seconds will be enoughsingle ship moving from distant 00 sec system to lowsecs and using a jump bridge system of his alliance will not feel any difference jump by jump he makes his move but if a gang or blob of many ships needs to occur quickly at some far system  they will have to wait for some period of time untill the last ship from the gang managed to jump through a bridgethe bigger is a gang the bigger is a time of its jumpingthe change is supposed only for poses not for titans titans bridge on cyno is fine imhoadvantagesit will be not possible to gather a blob and to move it 50 jumps from home system in short amount of time if you dont have a titan and a cyno readygives more time for incoming roamings to atack poses claim infacstucture or to make any other quick invasionsis easy to implement mechanics is similar to reactivation delay of a module or sensors recalibration delay after cloakfits to backstory for instance the jump portal array needs some time to accumulate an energy to perform a jump  some stuff like thatdisadvantagesclaiming alliance members will whine discussing
fully support the idea
agree with davader 1
you have my support
this will definatly boost the midsize roamings which are cool so i support this as well
mmm good idea
could the csm put it on their priorities list to either get ccp to stop supporting the mac client  or to actually fix itpersonally the game has been almost unplayable since the incursions patch  and nothing substantive has been done to fix it this is not acceptable and extremely frustrating
seriously i want pink hair
yesin general we need way many more colors available for our barb erhmm characters 
stephanie is that you
noes 
or at least for gallente characters supported cause why not and while youre at it add green blue and so on
as a clueless mission runner early in life and quite ill informed about the role of factions and their standings in eve ive naturally made quite a few enemies in the npc world these roadblocks have always proved frustrating especially when the opportunity arose to tap into the valuable pirate factions and research agentscorrecting for bad faction standings has always been a vexing problem ccp made a reasonable first step by allowing people with poor standings the ability to claw their way back into favor through grinding low quality level 1 agents but there does exist the possibility for more reform the current system especially for people with quite bad standings is extremely time consuming repetitive and doesnt offer itself to much interaction with other peopleproposalfactional amnesty would allow gang members the ability to share faction standing increases from storyline missions  using the mechanics already in place that allow corporation standing rewards and loyalty points to be shared between playersto prevent significant exploitation of the mechanic players would cease to receive faction standing increases once theyve achieved a standing of 20 before skills for the faction in question this would allow players without the diplomacy skill the ability to access higher level agents but any further faction standings increases would have to be at the players own discretionbenefitsplayers seeking a way to repair damaged faction standings especially characters with severe penalties would have an faster avenue to rebuild than existing mission mechanics for active participants gangs would help encourage cooperation between players and lessen the repetitiveness that would normally come from solo lowlevel mission runningenterprising thirdparty mission runners could profit from the ability to share faction increases with eager clients whose faction standings are below the 20 thresholdthe mechanic would provide a far faster way for players who want to run missions but lack standings for the gurista  blood raider  sansha triad as they are the only pirate factions who currently lack a bridge faction like ore or mordus legionin an academic sense this proposal would use mechanics already implemented for running missions in gangs and in theory does not openly seek to invent new or untested solutionspossible drawbackscurrent isk sinks involved with lowlevel mission running including mission ships equipment the diplomacy skill set could be negatively impactedimplementation of this mechanic might have the effect of further marginalizing bridge factions as players seek out mission running gangs more useful to their immediate needscourier mission botting could see a perceptible increase if this mechanic were to be implemented as players look for ways to benefit from this reform with the least amount of active input
i like your idea youve exposed some benefits some possible drawbacks and it seems its something that ccp is capable ofsupported
possible drawbackwith the current mechanics for access to missions and a friendalt willing to share his factions standing with the opposite faction the effect of killing ships of a specific faction would be lessened by an extreme degree the friend running faction missions for the opposite side would not only give you faction standing but corporate standing too so as soon as you get to the 2 standing threshold where he could no more help you you will be getting immediate access to level 3 and probably even level 4 missions thanks to your corporate standingit would become possible to almost freely accept missions where you kill members of a faction and repair instantly your standing that said the idea isnt bad and it is worth a more in depth analysis so supported
so you think that bin laden should be welcomed into the us if he was to have a friend working for an allythe only change that is needed is for the all missions to have a caution sticker attached so warnremind people that anything and everything they do will have lasting consequencesno to easymode standings grind option
while this would be a very power feature i think it would certaintly be one that would vastly improve the game for some peoplei  like almost everyone in eve  have multiple accounts i tend to trade stuff between my characters using contract however i have to go through a 34 step process if a feature could be made to allow you to automatically accept contracts from certain players  and make it a very involved process to set it up to prevent scamming via this system  it would have alot less clickingor maybe accept contracts that have no negative reprocussions if i am sending something to someone but i do not require anything in return isk or item wise after x mins the contract is automatically accepted  gives u time to go back and fix the contract if u screwed up 
the availability of local intel makes isk making in 00 relatively risk free and safer than highsec so its most definately broken no idea how to fix it without breaking a whole bunch of other stuff though
youve either never been to nullsec or youre angry because you cant get cheap kills00 is hardly safe ever heard of bubbles
ok lemme explain how it goes1 neutred pops up in local2 warp 2 safe3 cloakhow is that not relatively risk free 
the real issue with the idea of removing local is that the only players it would penalise are the real onesif you removed local then dscan would become the new defacto local window with regular dscans being performed to alert you to the presence of others in the system not counting the lag you would have bots scaning at regular intervals always able to get away however the real player sitting at his keyboard would probably more often than not forget once in a while and get ganked so i hear you say boot or ban accounts if they scan at regular intervals unfortunatley studies have shown that humans will appear more scripted than automated programs as we tend to find a rhythm whereas a bot will run on a random generation sequence which will appear much more random than a human playerso next time before you suggest something ed how about doing a little research and anticipating the outcomes of the various solutions rather than just crying because the guy in nullsec who cloaks in his tengu or warps to a pos that he has got set up evaded your 1337 lazors
both the real and the bots wil suffer equally directional is hardly a drop in replacement for local youd need a scout on every gate to even get close to the security local gives you
again i am terribly sorry that youre unable to get cheap kills in nullsec because people are more observant than before but ccp doesnt need to nerf local just to appease elite pvp types
i dont give a  about nullsec pvp i just take offence to people like you that think ratting and doing anomalies in nullsec space is somehow dangerous while having access to 100 accurate intel i dont support the removal of local just to replace it with a pimped out directional scanner u dont see me thumbing up this thread anywhere do u 
you certainly imply that you support removing localhave you ever lived in nullsec seriously
why do u ask do u need directions on how to get there 
p like it
well as title say would be great to put in contract pi installation would create a new profession pi installer or pi optimizershould increase the description field size in contract creation panel to be able to put more details on output etc
its easy anyway this would barely change a thing

i disagree most people i believe do not expect failure on their part as for the people that do may not understand completely how the csm works the success of the csm relies heavily on the players to bring their opinions concerns up to them in the best way possible a group bringing a well organized proposition with enough support behind it to the csm i am confident that it will be noticed by the leaders that have been elected to speak for the people to ccp although with enough negative reinforcement and lack of support for a csm no matter who is in charge it will always seem to be a fail csm i also do not understand why so many fear that having a nc majority on the csm is a terrible thing granted it is in all likelihood that issues concerning the nc will be brought up sooner or with more ferocity but that is not just because they are on the csm that is because a greater percentage of people voted for them and those people expect something done about their problems just like you also them having a big portion of the counsel does not do much else then help bounce resolutions off of one another for their more common goals there is no big vote at least not an official one to my knowledge internal votes may occur but nonetheless it doesnt matter if ccp doesnt agree with the outcome the only thing i can see people worried about the makeup of any csm is that from time to time ccp may bounce confidential ideas off of the csm to see how the player would feel about these changes the idea may be good but not appeal to the individual or the entire csm at the time just bad timing on ccps part if i left something out or seem to be misunderstanding something please quote me and explain thank you
1 psh facts are over rated
see this is a good example dont let this happen help tentonhammer save itself write to them at supporttentonhammercom and let them know what you expect from a web siteone question thoughguild chat arent guilds those things found in wow something you want to share with the rest of uswindjammer
thats the joke you idiota lot more people who read tentonhammer or other gaming sites like world of raids mmochampion joystiqcom and so forth play world of warcraft than play everyone very enraged online if every single user of this game were to unite and boycott tth because of mittanis columns it would be a drop in the bucket compared to the horde of readership that view the site for news related to other more popular mmo games it is therefore highly unlikely that the above scenario will ever occur and it will most certainly not be the result of one anonymous manchilds internet crusade against the mittani or his puppyedit i play wow
also your lol you play wow nerd post is highly original and weve never seen its like before yup
son lemme tell ya bout my top100 bc raiding guild and how we stole all of our strats from ej then made fun of them on vent because were that coolps hows ej doing lately
question you do know the difference between an opinion column and a news item right would you ask people to write to the ny times if they published an opinion piece by glen beck im not sure i see what the issue is here
the problem here is that windjammer is an evil antiamerican terrorist who hates cute puppies because he is jealous of our freedom 911
lol 1 for your joke not your cause
its simply devs favoring anyone that is not in the nc yet again my question is why do they hate a player developed null sec so much if you dont want it used ccp just remove it from the game already
is all i hearear plugs
geez  could you use yellow  green  purple  pink  anything but that red going blind trying to read it
yeah logging in to quote this the point is that nerfing bad space back to worth 20 of running l4s in empire is a terrible design choice  not because of the intra00 balance but because of the balance of 00 against empire space making some space worth more than others is a good thing but if players invest a billion isk into a systems upgrades 2 sanctums and 2 havens should be the minimum they are getting out of it with better truesec enabling more of those more frequent faction spawns more plexes and so forth
so he took the time to explain the flaws in ccps schedule of changes the random haphazard and fickle way that they introduce changes the lack of forethought and analysis that goes into such major changes the undue deleterious effects those have on the playerbase and your response is to simply troll its predictable but not terribly amusing it does however show that youre absolutely unable to answer in any real manner which is why you can only troll about it
because of lvl4
what do you guys think the csm can do about patches or fail patches or failfail patchesnothing they wait like you and download the new version like you nerdsfeedback thread is opened to every one do you expect the csm to be your secretarylet them work on serious business for what they are intended to wtf now
i live on the bleeding edge of geminate so from my personal perspective it takes some imagination to see why we need more conflict drivers but ok thats fine really but now our space is suddenly worth very little we not only lost sanctums and havens but we even lost our frigging hidden hub that was always fun for the lulz of being swarmed by frigs even though its barely 24h from the change we have had many people myself included evac all non pvp and even some pvp ships to highsec and im hearing about people joining bigger alliances to get access to better space so that sucks there is vauge hope that we can get better space but given our size its slim to none some people are holding out to run complexes but because of our location most of them escalate into unfriendly space does not always stop us lol the current state of affairs war makes chasing down escalations ever more difficult of the last 5 i had 1 did not escalate and 4 went into the o2o supercap graveyard pocket eww i dont show up to fleets and roams any more because i only ratted the isk i needed and now i am trying to focus on other ways to make isk none of them involve 00 which makes it kinda hard to fight for itt not worth hanging out there just for pi i am listening to my alliance mates on team speak right now and its making me sad a bunch of them are talking about lp conversion instead of fighting off russiansoh god one of them just said he might start mining again please make it stop
in reference to your comment on if the null sec players having 310 accts and if they should be counted as one or many i feel that they should be counted for how many accts they have i may be biased since i am one of these kinds of people but i like to think of owning an acct as owning a piece of stock if a person owns a great percentage of stock in the company even if they are not with the main corporation they have a say in what goes on in relativity to how much stock they own just a thought

am i somewhat of a jerk for putting this below here to some degree yes but i feel it is necessarydisclaimer  i still love the game and i still love most of the individual devs at ccpmy problem is with the company policy dictated by a few people that might not even have anything to do with game design at allwere patient we can wait we want qualitywe dont care about your socalled market research that tells you rushed and unpolished new features would sell better than older sturdy polished contentthat might be the case for wow clones but not for eveyou had some major dips in subscription counts after each new expansion lately and those were the expansions with heavyduty advertising and plenty of new features which didnt quite work right and most of them still dontoverall on average the subscriber count slope didnt get steeperin fact one could argue you have been losing momentumsave your money that you spend on advertising word of mouth got you your userbase word of mouth will keep getting you a larger userbasecustomers you get from shiny new stuff that doesnt actually work properly anyway wont stay long enough and by the time you pumped everything full of barely functional junk you will have alienated a big portion of the user basedidnt the last fanfest reactions tell you what the userbase wants didnt you hear the cheers after the announcement of minor polish stuff learn from your mistakes ccpits not too late to alter this selfdestructive new policystop rushing out unpolished junk and focus on fixing whats broken before proceedingthis goes beyond the commitment to excellence its actually a plea to whoever inside ccp has eyes to see and ears to listenyou need to try and convince your boss to convince your boss and so on and so forthas long as the mindset amongst ccps leadership is that shiny junk sells old polish doesnt the eve vision of future will end up a resounding floptake a look at sales charts spank some accountants do something just stop this madnessto support this threads idea click the check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on checkbox under your post text input boxits right below check here to preview your post and right below the character selection and post reply buttonif you forgot to do it at first you can edit your post to select that toops
quoting just because i dont ususally type this much
like i was saying somewhere elseits more of a question of picking between shiny new junk vs polished old awesomebasically between chasing for new subs vs making old subs stick around longerwe all feel quite clearly about shiny new awesome universally loved and polished old junk which almost nobody cares about but also were not annoyed by it too much eitherofficial ccp quarterly economic newsletter q4 2010 page 8

this is the sort of thing thats tarnished eas reputation for nonsports games and has greatly annoyed star wars fans in generallucasarts has taken to doing this tooits a natural businessmans reaction they want to start getting a return on the money theyve invested right now and are extremely averse to continuing to spend money on a project in developmentthis mentality has no place in the world of gaming however youll note that part of the reason blizzard got their initial good reputation was their staunch refusal to do just this in fact they wont even put out a release date for one of their games until the cds are actually being pressed and theyre sure thats when itll be released this annoys retailers who generally just make up a date on their own but avoids the perception of schedule slippingive gotten the impression theyre sliding into it a bit since the merger with activision but there can be little doubt that their dedication to releasing only finished working products and not allowing that to be compromised by anything including pressure to meet a schedule is one of the reasons theyve had so many smash hits over the yearselectronic arts on the other hand who is known for pushing things out unfinished is also known for abandoning support of games while they still have bugs and also for buying up developers and then eradicating them westwood studios creator of command and conquer is one example right now they look to be starting in on this with bioware dragon age 2 for examplelucasarts did this to kotor 2 apparently even to the point that when the developed asked to be able to add some of the cut content in with a patch later lucasarts wouldnt let them they also did it repeatedly to star wars galaxies and to a considerable extent the game never really recovered from it the stuff that was missing at launch actually broke the game when it was added in and they redid the entire game system twice trying to fix it which drove off all their subscribers the force unleashed 2 is another good example as everyone ive talked to that played it was vastly disappointed and thought it was massively overpriced for being as short and unoriginal as it wasand yes i am scared to death about swtor as a result of those two working on it and have been ever since bioware got bought by ea x

id like a little more clarification on this if ccp advertised more with the last few expansions and garnered more subscribers than normal wouldnt it be logical to say that the dips would be larger you say it yourself the subscriber slope maintained normalcy meaning there werent any severe penalties for this unfinished content however i only have you to go on though perhaps add a link to the chartgraph you used to come to this conclusionim lazy and grading papers at the moment i appreciate your thread and your commitment to what you feel leads to eves improvement
damn wrong character but supported anyway
i support this thread with big letters
sure yes ultimately though we all pretty much know how this is going nowhere
i wouldnt mind if for smaller things like graphical fixes and mechanics stuff that they put them out separate from the big stuff that way they can spend the time they need on new big things and still give us fixes regularly
subscriber count graphs available in the qens
fully supportedits not that us the players dont want change or new things theyre welcomed  but it should not come at the cost of poor qualitytheres been lots of small things that need fixing which have gone by ccps radar for a long time because they seem to mostly concentrate on new features and shiny new thingsa quality game with attention to making existing content work properly first and foremost  then only adding new shiny things once theyve been fully and properly tested with feedback from players listened to is what is most needed
do like what else is there to say
well from a longer strategic standpoint at least you can only bait and swtich people so many times before they stop coming back to be a part of the peak the new content is not causing bumps in subscriber numbers to stick and if growth is about the same ignoring it then you could say that its only old content thats pulling it along if development keeps ignoring solid longstanding content eventually that growth will decline and pumping numbers with new failed content will no longer be able to keep up
old topic but with you as the resident evangelist  we might have a chance
youre right the reverse can also be true thats why i think incarna will greatly increase the retention rate of subscribers but its also understandable why many players are sick of hearing about it as nobody can actually play it
supported tired of broken features ccp needs a new qa team as well
gonna support this and also a support to the old forums which we use nowi understand ccp wanting to do new things and stuff but to me the only team at ccp that has accomplished anything of real value to the community and the game is team bff and their small fixes patch that got people excited and that was a large success i for one really really like the new contracts system i also will confess i dont use evegate i never wanted to use it and still dont use it but the new forumwhich is now dead is integrated into it what i would have wanted was a redesign of this website to make it for functional along with a kickass search feature the new forums went through 2 rounds of testing and didnt even survive their first real weekendit is telling when several upstanding community members whom myself and others look up to for their opinions are telling the company whose game they play to stop and slow down it indicates disappointment and unsatisfaction
speaking of which i heard whispers of unconfirmed rumours that ccp actually lost a noticeable portion of their former testers not so long ago fuzzy on the details as to why though so basically theyre running with an understaffed and overworked qa teamwould love to get an official denial of that but appearances do lend a lot of credence to those rumoursit would certainly explain a few things
i fully support this akita eve should be a highly polished game where the bulk of new content is generated by the players
seriously though how do expect a company which cant even manage to properly setup a new forum to really be able to get even more complex things done right im not trying to be extremely rude but these problems specifically the forums do speak towards the actual planning execution and management of operations a top to bottom reassessment of the workforce is probably a good prescription for the current ailments of ccpjust saying
ive been thinking about this im not going to blame qa anymoreweve seen that when people do point out problems with features that they are ignored and pushed through anyway and you might get a ban on top of itthis is a management problem a lack of resolve to quality
i think so too a lot of it smacks of them having a bonafide american style corporate exec in there somewhere it affects everything below them because someone like that punishes anyone that tells them anything but what they want to hear tends to be cut off from the reality of whats on the ground and thinks he knows better than anyone elsethis type of person will get an idea and force it through and literally not allow anyone below them to question itits death for a company in the creative industry because you have to listen to your customers the key point is being able to pick out the difference between people just saying they dont like it because its different and being legitimately upset about it in my experience most mmo makers seem to lose that ability after some years as they grow used to the idea that people whine about everything particularly on the forums
that job opening was posted on feb 14th of this year thought id clarify not sure if that changes anything probably not thoughproof linkedit  how long have the new forums been in the making
reminds me of the dev team during the age of shadows expansion for ultima online
tbh thats what im starting to think more and moreits not that qa fails to do their job its like that there isnt qa at allmost middlerank devs are probably good chaps that try to do their jobs as good as they can im sure but stuff gets kinda hard when the department that is used to make the customers not raeg cant even do basic testingthis whole new forum incident couldve been avoided not only by some basic qa testing but also by some proactive testing provided by the security department aswell
given that theyre a port of an existing open source forum software and from looking at them id guess about a weekthat link though illustrates something rather important they are in fact hiring in qa and the way theyre going about doing it says a lot about how the people running the qa department thinkfor starters they call it an internship and have it set for a short fixed period of time with an option to double it its paid though they dont say how much that and the job title implying its not very much additionally no mention is made of the possibility of moving into a permanent position no mention is made of benefits eitherthis means one of two things either at least part of their qa department is made up of glorified temps or theyre doing a try it before you buy it sort of thing get someone in there and see how they do without a longterm commitment regardless of the intent the reality is probably somewhere in the middle they hire people but let most of them go only hiring the ones they really like on permanently they may in fact deliberately let some of them go afterwards because by continually hiring new temps they can pay them all peanuts and get the work done without all the costs and strings of a real employeeand frankly there isnt a company in the world that hires at all unless theyre short staffedan exec having a large portion of qa liquidated to take the fall for his bad management would be a typical business practice too
ccp really need to break the management fail cascadeit is more important to keep your customers paying their subscriptions than to get new customers stop masturbating to the total subscriptions graph start paying attention to the cancellations graphi have seen this behavior firsthand from a company which was run by an american used to the overpromise underdeliver sellatallcosts school of management all the people who told him the product was not fit for sale were fired thats me and two others after release when it turned out the product was not fit for sale the company folded and the idiot in charge still blames me and two othersso temphiring qa folks is an indication that theyre looking for yesmen not testers i took my resumUFFFD to fanfest with the intention of going home with a new job did not apply for any jobsccp this time it is the entire player base calling you on you bulldust
if were honest theyre both important people are always going to leave for one reason or another and you have to be bringing in new people to replace themthe key point being to build on your existing base to my knowledge every game thats ever decided that it was more important to attract a new base than to keep their existing one has ended up going nowhere its very very difficult to turn a game into a hit after launch if it isnt almost all the way there to begin with
quite true there is a statistic but the life of me i cant locate it that a newspaper has a better and easier chance of acquiring previous customers as opposed to brand new ones so they devote much of their advertising in that direction separate fields entirely but i think the example works just as wellit frustrates me that i cant find that stat
my father used to be customer service manager at a major us newspaper and he once told me about something hed seen that indicated that people who had a problem and then had a good experience with customer service were more loyal than if theyd never had a problem at allhe also mentioned that the booth sales department i worked for at one time had been shut down because they mostly just sold people subscriptions with a super good deal and then theyd cancel once the deal ran out some of them would do this over and over again cancelling their subscription every time the deal ran out and then signing up again at another of our booths that they foundthey came to the conclusion that those deals were thusly a lot of junk and stopped offering them and then all of a sudden the booth sales department was doing jack all so they got rid of them
thanks for the discussion i quite enjoyed it
havent we been trying to tell them this for a while now
5 years in and 2 accountsim not a big fish by any means but im pretty much done with this game which is a shame because its the best game ive ever played
indeed we are
something that just occured to me earlier someone i think akita said something to the effect that it was about two or three years ago when the signs of the management problems started to appearnow read thissurprisingly google did a pretty good job with this one
not supported i want them to deliver not listen to burned out old ers who cant let go of the game and who think just because its no longer fun for them its over for everybodywhat i wish ccp would do is every time someone makes a public i quit post on the fourm their characters are biomassed by a gm when the subscription runs out but thats just a dream of mine
soyou say you want ccp to deliver yet you troll a thread asking them to deliver instead of just saying they do
supported for reals
my thoughts exactly
so much this the batch of little fixes was one of the best things introduced in a patch for quite some time now if you would only give the si interface some polish for matars sake
so did i but all they told me was apply for the position posted at the site they werent making an effort to get people really even if they did i wouldnt have signed because working as an overqualified underpaid intern with no securities in a frozen hole is not my thing its bad enough they tricked me into coming to fanfest saying yes to the nth wakeup call thread
hell yes ccp is starting to look like ea before their image review raping everything they get their hands on for quick returnive got myself a deadline ill wait till summer august and if by then the most glaring issues arent solved hybrids gallente op 1400s seriously arty abbadons stupid op supers that make all caps obsolete industry changes ui ill just find a new game to play or focus more on studying physics i can only wait so long i really hate ea for ruining so many cool universes now ccp is doing the same thing its the exact same path theyre taking
no
if you head over the ex ccp employees blog youll see all of them agreeing that ccp internal communication is their achilles heel that teams act like they live in a void with little interaction between them and several other curiositiesi was considering asking for a job ccp as economist helper or even as coder but the wages seem horripilant and their pension system is not integrated or compatible with anything yet it requires an amount of 10 iirc years just to make you eligible to get itheres my ms paint approximation about the next months in eves subscriptions market even if ccp changed their ways and approach to quality players discontent inertiaplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesas you can see the trend is exhausting increasing volatility on the upper graphthe yellow lines show the slope changes in the 123 zig zag the cyan are some areas of support or resistanceand getting more whipsawing which is another sign of trend exhaustionthis trend will peak either at the current high or a next lower high not drawn then there will be a sharp drop down to the lower supportit will break because we will be in summer low subs period of the year and an even sharper drop will happenafter a rebounce typical bottom w formation if ccp changed their ways they will slowly begin rising up red lineif they stay as is well see a further drop blue line to dynamic support and then who knows

a bit frightening how much this represents my own view reallylets just hope that after the nth time they listen statisticspast experience suggest otherwise but heres to that thing hope
depends on how far up the chain it is if its a guy somewhere in the middle sooner or later he wont be able to scapegoat or spin the numbers or anything and itll come back to himif its someone at the topit might come back to them only in the form of the company going down in flamestrying to get an exec like that to see reason is much like trying to reason with a conspiracy theorist theyre so dead on certain that theyre right that they just discount anything you say that contradicts them
i kind of doubt it is related to the new share owners as posted above  afterall those were issued to fund dust514 along with lots of money from eve   meaning someone was already losing touch to the player base anyway i support akitas proposal
statistics can be fooled for example if they count in the accounts that have received some kind of free gametime how many would have just clicked on a email to reactivate for freeplus do they count in the trial accounts which playtime last 14days
supported for the brief time ccp might listen before reverting back to stupid business logic that ignores common sense about this basic idea
not supported as your ridiculous arrogance is too overbearing
cant do anything but support this any feature new or old is pretty worthless if it isnt good enough or doesnt work properly it also greatly decreases the players enjoyment of the game makes them look for other things to do and diminshes their trust in ccps capability to deliver on any future featureiteration of an old feature you arent developing games in a void you can either deliver competative features and gameplay experiences or youre going to get stomped on by the competition ccps attitude of it doesnt matter if its crap now we can iterate on it later is damaging the game they simply dont ever iterate or develop their features to full potential they do some basic bug fixing and usability tweaks and call it a day and move on to develop the next half finished feature youre left with a game where there are tons of things to do but everything is a bit lackluster unbalanced and under developed or has obvious content holeslately there have been signs that all of this might be changing but the new forum fiasco shows that it might have been just a reaction to the complaints and subscription losses of last year instead of an actual change in development philosphy and thinking in ccp leadership
supported new forums were a joke one that seems to be old at ccp
agreed also the new forums are they kidding has issues with firefox eve gate does as a whole and the new forums were very unsafe in the basic writing up of them and barley any smartphone capability really
and there i was thinking ccp learned from the 18 months communication fail

hell yeah thumbs up

akita t makes a post incoming threadnaught
eta until the next discrete offer from ea
that graph allegedly contains only paidfor active subs trial accounts and expired accounts not countedim almost hoping youre not right
supported i came to this game because it was far more finished and stable than any mmo ive played before i dont want it to lose that
allegedly 
free cat
i support the idea in op i dont have much else to say other than that i was unfortunately correct about them forcing us out of our pods which i dont like not at all
yes very much agreed
agree
ccp will you ever learn or maybe it is the players that should learn and just dump you once and for all
i too am gay
i find myself in the unfortunate position of agreeing with the mass of idiots ive defended alot of ccps decisions like the whole 18 month thing but for the sake of us all please do some security checking next time
its sad when a developer doesnt understand what their game is about stop taking us in the wrong directly and doing it in the wrong way please
supporting a great insight
agreedunfortunately though it seems to be a growing trend that companies dont listen to their customers or even their lower ranking staff members and just seem to blindly carry on with their management view of the world

this is the solution to the current problems of ccpthe game never let any investors in neverstay small and deliver on your promises  dont let yourself be fscked by greedy capitaliststhe future of eve online looks very dark eve onlinevision  greatdelivery  what delivery

i support this notion
supportin tis
yes i do suport this with all my 6 accounts fix the old broken and half functional stuff please
excellent post and i echo it wholeheartedlyhowever at this stage i must be realistic they have to release incarna this summer even if it is just cq they have to they spent way too much time and money on it already to scrap it now otherwise it is in risk of becoming a neverending vicious cycle by the time they improve and polish it what they improved is now outdated and needs further improvement and by then it is outdated again we saw this in darkfall  by the time the game finally released if thats the right word it was still badly outdated in every respectwhat i would settle for and even be happy with is them wrapping up incarna both cq and stations within this calendar year just release it such as it is and forget about it ccp just doesnt have the resources or manpower to turn that part of the game into a fullfledged scifi sim theres no shame in that you cant be everything to everybody and then the rushed releases of new stuff need to be stopped new stuff period needs to be stopped including dust how anyone can think that game will do well on consoles is beyond me focus on the game itself focus on fixing stuff thats been broken for a long long time
i must agreeeve is suffering terribly from poor management as someone who has managed groups of deveopers in the past i understand that herding cats is sheer simplicity in comparison but it is a job that must be done and competentlyccp your management of the software development process from a to z is terrible no worse than terrible  it is embarrassing stop breaking things that work go back and document your code base get your developers to reuse objects instead of building new ones from scratch every time go fix the things you have broken before you start making new things you are on a downward path that will lead to your inevitable demise and i enjoy this game too much to want that to happen
as someone who have cancelled his account a few times and came back a few times im sure of one thing the new toys are often a good idea to come back to the game and pay 1 month of suscriptionbut they are not enough to make us pay for the next month if they are not finishedcause when you come back to see something new who looks cool youre still gonna look at others things and remember how awful where some others things who needed fixesand theres even more risk that after a few days  weeks you realize the new features who looked so cool is not that cool and it would have been better waiting more before releasing itbtw tell me if im wrong but we never asked for new forums right  we may have asked for improving current one but never asked for changing all things moreover to something most people dont like at all and i didnt even talked about the bugs hereps  im waiting for captain quarter on the test server but im not waiting at all for it to go on live serverim just curious and want to see if its really without any interest as i though or if i was wronghowever i would be way more interested by seeing a real incarna with real useful features appearingthe cq we dont care about for us its just an idea of what the future real thing could becq is a little toy thats allgive it some useful features that we dont really have if you want results on long term if not youll only see numbers improving on the 1st month and thats all

akita t speaks the truth i cannot possibly agree more
i approvethe development of the game has reached a point where you cant just fix major concepts with little changes to this and that ccp you need to at least listen to what your players are saying if needs be setup small councils for 00low secempire etc that you can have a chat with and see whats going on dont fly them out to iceland but at least talk to themif you keep going down this route you are going to rapidly start losing the older players and that might end up working its way back into the epress do we really need to remind you what happened when you asked for the best game of 2010 votes or whatever it was
commitment to excellence mk 2 lets push this all the way
yes yes yes and yesccp is not 10 guys in an attic anymore ccp is a 600 employee multinational company its time they started acting like oneless vision more sight
i support this proposal
that approximationgraph is kinda scary
akita and calathea are absolutely right on all accounts ccp is being monumentally stupid and is throwing away everything they have built if they dont step back from the edge of the cliff now then it wont matter if they dont jump off it it wont matter if they plan on backing up later because the cliff face is going to give way and everything is going to come crashing downi love eve i have eve tattoos i want to see eve continue for years and years and years i want to be able to introduce my kids to this game i want it to have the longevity and the vision and the expansiveness that made me love this game in the first placebut no no ccp would rather follow the stupid stupid market trend data from other mmos most of which failed by the way and push out crappy new content to try to get more people at the expense of those who stayed with them and supported them from the beginningeve is not like other mmos eves community is different eve is different we dont need shiny new features to keep us happy we dont need new stuff to keep having fun eve has no max level eve has no top tier epic gear we the players are capable of keeping ourselves busy without new things to play with fix the stuff that needs fixing take the time to iterate upon all the stuff youve introduced where are other t3s where are the fix to factional warfare where is the industrial expansion where is the blaster rebalance why hasnt the dead horse pos thread been applied yet your game is dying on the vine while you try to expand your vineyard stop focusing on growth make a good game and it will grow watch eve never fades remember when that was what you committed to when your trailers were proud to be made using actual gameplay when you showed eve as it was instead of some tarted up studio gimmickyou dont need to expand the game in the way you are look at factional warfare what did it add to the game it was a big deal and you put so much effort and marketing into it to try and get people interested in eve and provide a quick injection to your subscriber base but that didnt work because you didnt tend to faction warfare and take care of it i doubt you could fix it now if you tried it is a dead feature incursions are going the same way they are something that absolutely just didnt need to be in the game they dont add to the game what the game needs they clutter it youre taking a beautiful idea and covering it with clutter and unnecessary additionshere is something that needs to happen now every time a new expansion comes out ccp needs to plan ahead to take care of the features they release and monitor them and iterate upon them and build upon them for years until people stop complaining about it and start asking for new features if ccp cant commit to taking care of their existing features then they shouldnt be adding more this is like parenting 101 its not rocket surgery turn back ccp before its too late
with respect akita i think you are preaching to the choir the reality is the internal structure of ccp notably fail management heirarchy based on being a cool dude and nordic and a lack of business wide unified development approach too many side projects and scrum nonsense juxtaposed with vision which is neither particularily realistic or technologically viable with the current codebase im afraid its as good as it gets tbh when everyone has a carrier in 18 months time im pretty sure not even incarna whatever confused jewmanji that was ever supposed to be will reverse the trend long term start looking forward to wod in approx 18 years time light a candle for eve if you want but you really need to accept ccp doesnt have the will or the financial backing to do what needs to be done  completely revise the codebase and entertain the prospect of a topdown business wide clear out even if they could raise the cash to hire 500 more specialists nobody wants to live in iceland and work for peanuts and the subscriber base propping it all up wont tolerate any major rebalancing of the economy or the core mechanics all the managers in the mmo industry are profit focussed and arguably such a radical change in corporate culture would only hasten the demise of ccp as a private company anyway moaning about half arsed rcs might make you popular on the forums  but im sure pretty much everyone in the trenches at ccp knows what the issues are
i think ccps new mantra should be deliver excellence not one or the other
yeeeessssccp spend a few expansion cycles iterating properly iterating and fixing your existing content rather than pumping out big useless bugridden features
i agree on what is being said here
yessss yelling at ccp for their inconsistent product is the new bottingrmtprojectilesmissionnerf finally were gonna see some progresss
two months left on my last subscription crew checking inone thing id like to point out is that the problem with the forums is not that not enough time has been spent on them theyve been in progress since what october we were told theyd come out in february they betad around then twice and i believe this is a team of 10 peoplethat many dev hours is plenty of timethe problem is that ccp is terrible at project management theyre terrible at running a businessi think the best thing that can happen to this game is that ccp runs out of money and its investorscreditors force a sale to ea who cans everyone moves development away from an icy rock in the middle of nowhere to a place where actual talented programmers live voluntarily and successfully employs even the most rudimentary planning and roi methodologies
ouch harsh
or ccp smartens up and keeps the old feel of a small company putting out a great product while still making a massive great mmo perhaps their eve future gets delayed by a couple years but at least at that time they will have a happy player base willing to tell their friends about what will be the greatest mmo ever i would love to see some devs or something post in threads like this to show ccp is taking a stance on the issue i dont think they do this enough and it feels like they dont want to acknowledge their recent incompetence as an issue even if thats not what they mean to do

afaik ea tried once didnt happen
if theyd believe in eve wouldnt they be rewriting it instead of incarna in my opinion the incarna tech theyre developing is primarily for the world of darkness mmo and of course theyre making it on eves expensei really do hope world of darkness ends up like the wow clones that didnt make profit
i think we can agree that most of the incarna pieces delivered so far have been crap out of the gate including the character creator which has been mostly fixedbut still ccp continues to feed us crap and then iterate on crap until it tastes less like crapim tired of crap
i think that eve has tremendous amount of potential and practically limitless possibilities for expansion of the eve universe but at the same time eve has an enormous amount of flaws it seems that ccp is really focused on delivering new features but without a solid foundation and care the potential of eve is being wasted
are people expecting ccp to do a full reverse and work on the backlog what do you think the chances of this occurring are if theyre full steam ahead on incarnawhat happens if were all proven wrong and the vision ccp has touted does indeed garner large amounts of subscribers will players admit they were wrong or will they continue to say that ccp is moving in the wrong directionit seems easy to predict what could happen in the coming weeks and monthsstep 1 new forums back up and running with security loophole fixed sans aesthetic changes or other suggestions players have suppliedstep 2 threadnaughts about ccps lack of commitment listening to player feedback most likely speadheaded by akitastep 3 ccp eventually makes some of the changes called for by the playersstep 4 threadnaughts created saying its too late and these changes should have been made some time ago players will enjoy the new changes regardlessstep 5 ccp releases captains quarters on sisistep 6 threadnaughts created detailing ccps lack of committment to the core aspects of eve and walking in stations is not the future of the gamestep 7 ccp offers their reasoning as to why they believe it is players disagreestep 8 ccp does a slow rollout of incarna beginning with captains quartersstep 9 players respond with thats it when they should have seen this coming with the implementation method of incursion threadnaughts generated about waiting so long for so littlestep 10a incarna allows players to physically see the avatar they create fulfilling the basic psychological need of attaching to a human faceformfamiliarity eve is now touted as the full scifi experience subs increase dramatically vets will dislike the attitudesopinions of incoming players threadnaughts generate about ccps shift in management and design doctrine not conducive to quality spaceshippy gamestep 10b incarna is an utter failure next age of shadows or new game experience debacle players on the right correct side do not hesitate to point out they were right and will show ccp where exactly things went wrong even though its far too late happy to see theyre correct and accepted but without a spaceship game they call home leave threadnaughts generated lamenting of the past how great things were how great they could have been and asking for suggestions on another game to play perhaps world of tanksstep 11 life goes onstep 12 people will think im a troll or a moron for writing this or providing a disagreeable view against the norm of this threadstep 13 life goes onfor fun and to stir the pot
extremely harsh by this time eve as whole will be long since dead and the only pilots in space will be chribba and his alts i wholeheartedly agree with akita and the fact that we need less new shiny unless ofc we are making it in our sandbox and using it to blow up the other guy ccp  you have done a great job getting us a game outside the mainstream of wow and its predecessorsclones you have to keep this up but not through the addition of crap features that you leave to diesome of the fail of your new features can be attributed to going completely against the general rules of eve  mayhap you should reread themrules of eve as i understand them0 trust no one not even your alts  theyre all out to get you1 if you cant afford to insure it you cant afford to fly it2 trust no one3 if its too good to be true its probably a scam4 that guy whos quitting and will give you 3x what you gave him wont trust no one you see the pattern herefw and incursions  wait what im now suddenly supposed to trust that the guy in a bs ive never flown with is not going to omgwtfpwn my logistics cruiser really might not be so much fw though was busy doing other stuff when that came about
maybe ccp thinks that eve is the perfect beta testing framework for other projects

ccp going downhill nonshockerwhat ccp really needs is some competition unfortunatlly there is none for their niche market sharesupported anyway
not really but some more attention to it would be niceand some decent qa work before anything goes live is a mustif this happens while the eve of that day is still recognizably similar to the eve we have today then i would be content not happy but content problem is from where im standing i dont think were going to get there if things keep happening the way they seem to be happening more often in the more or less recent past
since when has ccp ever listened  a constant barrage of new ideas and schemes being implented only to be nerfed 6 months later shows a certain lack of forward thinking what is worse are the instances where the player base warned ccp that what they are doing is wrong and then were proven right anyways good post akita

ccps attitude and behaviour surrounding 14 just proves to me how much lip service they are paying to their customers and the gametheyd rather forge ahead in their own direction and damn everyone else which would be fine except they took steps towards player involvement in the development processeither use the csm or lose it ccp
i am not by any means a true oldschool player but i have been playing with many accounts for about 2 years now and i have consistently kept up with the forums and various other sorts of evenews as a result i have a lot of respect for the older eve community and comparatively little respect for ccpi really dont want to have to think about canceling my accounts anywhere down the line but undoubtedly i will if eve loses the bulk of its most important player base  those people who have been with it for years perhaps from the beginning and care greatly for the game as a whole  not those who have wandered here looking for their next mmo fix which undoubtedly eve will satisfy for a year or two before they cancel and move on to something elseso yeah supported

specific gameplay issues are not that much of a problem players can adapt to it fairly quick lets take a look on your examples hybrids are not that bad i use them on my alt almost exclusively and all i can say that they are not that useful but they still have their use gallente are not broken one of the best pve and pvp ships around ok maybe capitals are much more useful than the capitals from other races but thats basically it 1400 are not op they are only a tool used to fight in lag where rof is not important abaddons are used because they can have the most raw hp which is also important in lag supers are op that ill agree with you industry ui is screaming for changesthe bigger problem is screwing customers over their recent nerf of anomalies where a lot of small alliances lost their invested isk which is in fact a very big deal for smaller entities ccps lack of understanding of 00 warfare and player mentality wars over sanctums anyone their hilarious reimbursement policy based on our logs show nothing principle and nonexistent customer support are making the biggest impact so far weve got only hints of a fight against bots and that the lag will be more tolerable with the new hardwarebuilding core code one more drop in the almost full glass of bad decisions and irrational ideas is the new banning rule of the alliance tournament come on seriously   its a minor annoyance that will affect small amount of players but it shows that the idea itself wasnt even discussed inside ccp for potential flawsdownsides it was only driven by how cool does it soundbtw the idea for nerfing 00 pve was influenced by their lead economist who only had the statistical data from the economy but failed to notice or didnt get the data from other ccps departments that in the q4 of the last year and continued to this year we had major rise in the amount of bots primarily mission runningratting ones im talking about thousands of them

recently i got the sense that progress was being made weve had iterative releases notice taken of incremental improvement bug fixing not been with hiccupsthen bang ccp shoots its self in the footas someone whos worked in the software development industry for over 18 years and reached the position of principal architect on multimillion pound custom built systems i know that poor quality costs you more in the long term that cost is not just in monetary terms either but prestige missed deadlines and good staff it will burnout your best people those that care and go the extra mile one day they will turn around and say  this im offsome people are blaming open source others microsoft but good or bad systems can be produced with any technology no the fault lays with with poor management
a few days ago some guy i know from working with game dev was talking about other icelandic developers some of which have financial interests in his company which is a small indy place they are just backing hes a pretty big ccp fanboy so i give im a go with talking about how the mismanagement is driving them into the ground and amazingly he actually agreed based on talking to one of the partners now youre thinking ok who caresanyway the person in question is generally referred to with a name starting with an h and not including the ccp prefix and has been around forever this person claimed that ccp was pretty much killing itself by making people like him work on the business aspects while the technical and game dev side was being overrun by business types or game devsthe ones that cant code who have no clue at all and just want to do gimmicky bull to please investors he wanted to realign to the early days where there was a more involved steering from the highup technical types but was struggling with the howjust thought id put that out there  im sure hed never confirm saying that but i felt it nice to know that at least one of the oldguard had a clue trust me dont trust me i dont careget rid of the bodies stop hiring community tools and yesmen who are just going to continue this stop listening to all your commercially interested partnerships and start looking to do things fresh python was a great idea and made eve possible all of your other infrastructure choices have been based on partnerships and money lets stop screwing the consumer who is paying for that experience middleware is not the solution either at the end of the day wed rather have a small company doing less grand expansions who cares about dustincarna when the core game is rotting we want the quality and gameplay back  you dont need to be the big playa to do thatat the end of the day if you make that choice too late after dust fails and your investors run youve lost the game son

at some point in a companies journey and growth reestablishing the concept of what made that company successful and unique is needed for a reality check and to get back some of that focus and grit we were promised in the beginning usually this happens when you write your business plan for the yearas for the polish bitpolishing a turd does not change the fact it is still a turd use some focus to pull out the the things that actually need polishing
yes please stop rushing out things before they are even close to being ready and when you test them listen to the folks you ask to test them if you arent going to listen to your beta testers why even bother having them

what she said because its what we think
totally agree way too many times have i seen very noticeable bugs on the test server such as the mackinaw being bright yellow weeks before final release yet they somehow make it into the final version and only get fixed when loads of people start making noise about itim really getting tired of ccp not listening to us what is the point of the test server if bug reports are not even acknowledgedoh and will we ever get remade ships like the scorpion or new t3 ships or comets are you just going to leave everything unfinished

i support the name change idea as long as they kept people from being able to constantly do it over and over again and having some sort of name history would be nice
as long as spendingyourchildsupport always links to that character regardless what name the character is going under these days and it is impossible to change name to one that anyone has ever used sure knock yourselves out with the name changes
im not sure about allowing a name change every year heres a potential problem with that after several years of allowing players to change character names once a yeara player has changed the name on his main character three times and has a large employment history corp recruitment usually involves a lot of metagaming so a recruiter would have to go about investigating what is essentially three characterson the other hand if ccp allows a onetime name change and requires a real currency fee and the name change clearly shows up in employment history and is visible through limited api then i guess its not a big deal if its strictly a vanity name change and not a clean slate where you keep all your sp and whatnot greatif you want a clean slate sell your character use an alt to buy a new character with a nicer name and the skills you want done
thank you for your assistance and your support
in the words of yoda you have to unlearn what you have learned thats all well and good but actually removing accumulated knowledge seems kinda odd to me i dont support this at all however if it was something that happened then you should lose the sp for good not be able to reallocate it as op has stated and obviously lose the isk you spent on the skills thought really they should just lower the cost of higher grade clones
halariously enough that was exactly my pointreported for trolling the trolls

i support this idea
yep
interesting and solid idea but the default colours should not be redgreen but something else more easily differentiated by colourblind people
better have red green for the majority of people who are not colour blind as it is really fast to see the difference and make another alteration like bracket typeshapeflash ratewhatever workes best as well so that colour blind people are also covered i sympathise with those that cant fully diferentiate different colours but for the majority that can its pretty much the fastest goodbad indicator there is especially in crowded informationrich enviroments given that it makes no difference to someone who is colour blind what colour it is i see no reason to rule out useing colour for the majority that can see it and simply add other tools for those that cant
that could work too i guess
i have been saying this since incursion 10old and new obsidianthough as you can see ccp is almost there with intaki just give us our damn hippy hair back and we are good to go
for the record this thread continued on the new forum
especially the hair is quite bad gallente is missing much of its former unique styles and the hair models available are mostly completely unfitting for minmatar characters
no proper intaki haircuts not clothes
i wouldnt be surprised some of the noob corp posters were a bunch of people from a secret ccp forum trolling teamp
more specifically this blog from 09

methnuaght the best cap idea ever
proposing removal of 24 faction standing hit for killing misc unclassified objects in missions some types of frigs ammartar navy detectives etc fighters launched by carrier various sentry towers random structures in mission site all incur a 24 faction standings hit if you kill them this includes the amar pos which need to be killed as mission objective in gallente antifaction missionsit makes no sense that some random frig would incur 24 hit while a whole spawn of bs incur 002at one time they all incur 00 standing hit but then some wise guy figured that instead of putting in the work to make up specific standing hit values for each one its easier to just lump them together and slap on a big 24 valuemost missioners have a phobia of doing faction kill missions because that one random frig or mission objective pos structure cost the same faction hit as 120 groups of faction bs spawns someones laziness has shaped eve for the worse this should go
the structures make some sense if you think you just killed a whole bunch of potentially innocent people who were not shooting you although that argument doesnt work with turretsthe frigates and fighters should probably get a tuning but i would like to see the structures maybe not turrets stay the way they are there is not need to kill them in most missions
i think perhaps you missed the part where the structures in question are the mission objectives
yes and also voting as dialog mechanism is way too limited to replace complex subject discussions and complex solution development for instance
whose responsible this
that would be the guy that made the op at the top
the question would still come back to who poses the questions for the masses to cast votes for or against csm is supposed to be the filter that the questionsideas go through as well as an early base touched by the devs when they come up with their own new ideasas for abusing the nda    that has happened and some of the guilty people were caught if not allnah as nice as the concept of everybody having a say in everything is i think that the csm is the way to gomoh and can obvious trolls such as the grammarians and the umadbros take it someplace else 4chan or myspace or whatever rocks they crawl home to at the end of the day
this helps out on the blobbing via jump bridges but still does nothing to pop the rancid tit of jita out of null secs mouthi still like jump bridges just being removed or only alliance members can use their own jump bridges betternot supported
adding a delay inst good as it makes it super easy for campers on the other side to  them nice and slow one after the other thus the change wont happeni believe with he cost to upgrade system that a revision to the bridges length and be able to chose the destination from the bridge points would be good with changes like these say a 10 second delay could work as a 50 man gang still would take a couple minutes not 5 seconds
dear csm i dont understand the way you voted on hybrids do you feel csm can only vote yes to concrete proposals why can you not vote to demand ccp develop a solution is it fair to put the responsibility of balance square in the hands of the community i think ccp should do what we pay them for and that is to develop csm you overrate your own importance of you think your only job is to present ccp with ready made solutions it is negligent to ignore the persistent cries of a wide player base who recognise the hybrid issue

if ccp and transgaming could get their act together and use the mac os x crash catcher rather than a rollyourown wed have an easier time reporting crash bugsat present our only option is to turn on exceedingly verbose logging which slows the game down by an order of magnitude
although i dont play under osx those that do shouldt be handicaped further
i represent this statement
lol stealth osxsucks
i agree i have to run the eve client repairer everytime i want to play the game just to get it to run then it crashes about every half hour do something about it please
its a waste to put a client on an os that is not designed for gamingeveryone i know that wants to play games on their mac dual boots to a proper operating system for gamingccp dropped the linux client and linux users adapted no reason to spend development time for a niche market
the mac client is actually maintained by a thirdparty company that ports the new game information over to macaccessible codecomplain to that company as they can actually then fix the errors in the macinterfacing not ccp or take off the skinny womens jeans and ridiculouslyrimmed glasses

that small irony aside  i think i agree with most of what you posted there nice format and presentation of argument too something i wish i was better atthose massive dips in the chart are actually mostly new users that get drawn in by the advertising campaigns and cool artwork then drop as they realize the game is too hard or doesnt meet their expectations no surprise there what is a surprise is that we still havent hit the 400000 players in one universe that was advertised some time ago is that chart actually accurate where does it come fromnot that important reallysupported by the way but with the usual reservationsi like new content and id like to see more the new avatars are super nice and the coming incarna features should add greatly to the immersion qualities of the game or at least make it so station spinning isnt quite so uninteresting for those of us that have a hard time with immersiononce we see the release of the incarna expansion promised for a long time now i would like ccp to drop any new proposals and begin working on polishing current features i intend to put up a thread on those features id like to see worked on redone and released fully functionalthere are bugs and graphics issues that i see as a problem too one is the effect of light on pos structures environmental occlusion specular effects or whatever it is it has to go i have a nice pc with a gtx 460 gpu and shouldnt be having issues like that my pc is quite capable of rendering everything in the game and doing it very nicely yet entire pos towers become big blobs of white light that flicker and mess up my game experience at times this happens to gates too and has been occuring offandon with regularity since the release of dominionthe new client from 141 or whatever latest patchhotfix is also tremendously slow to start up a full wipe of my pcs shadow cache antivirus sweep and defrag has done nothing to fix it it takes about 10x longer to start the client now and till the hotfix crashed 1 out of 3 times after the hotfix it just went back to maybe you can log in 3 times consecutively and maybe you cant it still takes forever to get to the splash screenaside from those and whatever internet maleficient is trying to hack my computer possibly succeeding i dont have many problems i had to change one of my accounts passwords and fulllimited apis 3 times last week and im still not sure if i got past the keylogger i also dont use a lot of the same game mechanics that others do nothing sov related no faction warfare blob warfare etc there are possibly many bugsglitches which i have never experiencedeither way i am in agreement that a great many things need to be fixed before eve and ccp can or should move on to develop further expansions eve could see a year of minimal releases of new content with all that weve seen in the last things need to be addressed first to satisfy current and past subscribers and many of them are on these forums in threads like this oneship rebalanceindustryposfaction warfarenew features polished character creator is working like a slug and i think they mixed up the facial models ie ccp needs a defragetcbugs and glitches cleaned up this goes with above suggestion of a defrag as im convinced many of these are the result of poorly compiled code or database issues functional and working on sisi to completely sluggish and missingimproperly placed features on tq is suggestive of this i know the vherokior nose wasnt a pyramid shape before so what happened caldaricivire features and gallenteintaki buggered toonot really important but vherokior tuckuntuck pants in boots option was messed up too with recent patchlots of fixes need to be looked at
no you mental midget learn to read  what akita wants and the rest of us want is for ccp to go back to what made eve and ccp great for so long and to stop listening to people whoa dont play the gameb dont have a clue about gameplay andc dont care about the game saying stupid  like polished content doesnt sell as well as new content shows a real shift away from what ccp used to beedit to add you do realize that our posting on the old disabled forums not the new shiny forums
supporting this because there are a mountain of things that id like to see ccp fix rather than working on new crap that will come outofthebox prenerfedunderdeveloped and never get looked at again
hold on a second why are we even starting this proposal if it may not be able to be seen by everyone seeing as the forum button on the website redirected to the new forums for the short stint they were operational what happens when ccp switches back to the new forums and this gets buried as a read only thread

seriously ccp get your stuff togehter
well to be perfectly fair i seriously doubt it will directly convince any of the higherups if they even get to see it and i also sort of doubt many of the lowertiered devs that might agree with it will actually do something about it other than you know what they probably already were trying to do without it anyway but in this type of situation every little bit has a infinitesimally small chance of helping so you know why not just do itps beats singing fake praises to ccps current direction
quality  quantity who ever said that ccp games is becoming another electronic arts hit the nail on the head clean house and get rid of all the untalented money grubbing sellouts that only dream as far as the next quarters earnings that kind of sheisty 1980s business feck all aditude has run the global economy into the ground dont think that those vampires wont suck the marrow from your companies bones and move on to the next feast after you are used up
i wholeheartedly agree about this
polished content sells wait till second life in space were only wod beta testers
supportedccp needs a new eve centric direction that makes eve great adding things to a game isnt a path to greatness when you dont follow up or fill in the blanks eve has many blank spots and broken features that if ccp fixedaddressed would be new selling points instead of half truths about things you can dowould want to do in game im sure wod and dust are to blame for eve being neglected but it isnt them alone ccp took their eye off the ball in search of more money from eve instead of trying to keepmake their product better
ccp did it ea is their rolemodel i thought that ccp statement is a common knowledgewill support but hardly anything will change after second commit to excellence thread i think

i would like to signal my agreement with akita t she is saying what needs to be done
im hardly aware of what actually needs to be done havent played the game long or deep enough and i dont care to read it all but i know that most causes for games are good ones  unless theyre proracist trolling or something lol
the user base may be patient but i doubt that the people who hold ccp by the balls will be as understandingiceland is all but bankrupt their three major banks have enslaved the people of iceland by borrowing and reaching far beyond their gdp ccp has to increase their use base and show they are successful even if the game is rotting from the inside just keep painting over the dead wood and hope no one notices
tbh considering that ccp gets nearly all their revenue from foreign sources they have some protectiondoesnt mean they werent affected tho
would be ironic to see ccp sink like iceland for being greedy wod dust5123123 d

not supported this threadnaught is full of over dramatic bs ccp listens and fixes stuff better than almost any company out there stop whining that the fix you want for your style of gameplay hasnt been gotten to yet
im sorry would that be the crashfree please and also hold the incomplete features gameplay style you are talking about would you also like fries with that or maybe supersize it and how do you think those same people will react when income starts dropping as our slightly pessimistic estimates seem to indicate if ccp cant resist their pressure now how do you think theyll do it then and what abominations will we end up forced to live with 
supporting this because it deserves to be supported even though dear god 96 pages and ccp still rushes crap out the door what little remaining faith i had in ccp just died i think

fix lag so we can pile even more players in a system they are always fixing lag lag becomes irritating when therere only 100200 in system like after dominion when 50 vs 50 fights were almost impossible now we can pile over 1000 in system with manageable lag

from herefrom page 6 of csmccp meeting minutes
i wonder if 100 pages of hate might get ccps attention
yes
seems you win
this is feeding a symptomthe symptom is everyone crowding in one systemwhat we need is 200 people in 10 systems fighting for sov and with each other not 2000 people all in the same system  2 systems not fighting each other if you blob you should fail and lose sov yes you are going to need to organise and run multiple fleets to win fun stuffthis is the only way forward which is sustainableit however requires devs to grow a brain and create a multifaceted sov system not based on all sit here in one system and grind timers this is not fun and is not a sandbox and will always cause this problem a first step helpful step in this would also be for the nc to realise this is the problems and stop blobbing and whining about the lag they cause and then demanding action to fix the symptom they createdas such i do not support this idea as it fixes nothing
supported currently lag turns a large fight in to a multiple billion isk dice roll and anyone coming in to the party late doesnt get to play id rather be annoyed at extremely slow moving ships than the hellish conditions currently going onalso eve bullet time may knock out one of the reasons to blob people dont like to mention if you fill a system with your fleet the enemy cant load before they are dead and the grid holders win by default swap that out for a situation where people would have to fight or flee in slow motion and they will either live with it or come up with ways to not have everyone on grid at once
a buffer is nothing without something backing it up a tank only matters when youre being shot at gank always helps who cares if you have double the ehp but paying for that with having half the dps one third the speed no dronebay the agility of a glacierbeing obvious bait is not a roleare you aware that a rail thoraxor even a laserax outdamages an omen at that range the same is true of a caracal or a shield rupturenot only do those ships outperform it at its intended role but they also have the flexibility that it doesnt there is no reason to pick an omen over another cruiser unless you cant fly them

thanks for the bump
i think we need more options for api access specifically control over what parts of the api the key has access toi propose a new api key level called custom that would provide checkboxes on the website for us to select what sections of the api will be available through that key additionally it should allow us to select what characters on the account are available through the key though it does not have to provide these on a percharacter basisthis would make it possible to strip down a key to just your charcorpkillmails so that you do not have to provide a full directorceos key to killboards many other advantages would be gained by having a customizable apii think its important that the full api key stays intact and that an additional key is created for this or the limited api key becomes the customizable one

supporting for reasons ive repeated too many times to reiterate here
to be honest if gallente could fit a full rack of neutrons on more regular pvp ships without completly giving up their tank it would be enough for mei kinda like the ideea of close range face guns even if i might get kited to hell if the other guy is smart but you cant really fairly compare neutrons with 425mm acs when you cant fit almost any tanked gallente ship with neutronsalso not being able to fly 5 heavies with any command ship or even the t3 with drone subsystem seems pretty dumb to me not that i ever fly those
if you think gallente are fine youre dumb gallente desperately need to be looked at and the issue of balancing is close to the heart of csm6
most of us know it makes a very long time these threads exist and that ccp doesnt admits something must be doneits a long road before they do something but knowing youll put this on the table soon is a good step for all of us
best news i heard all weekand may i suggest that csm6 purchase a megathron model from eve store and paint spanking megathron on the side and bring it to all csm meetings whenever someone says gallente are fine spank them with the mega
white tree is dumbjust single handedly boosting something because some test guys yell about it doesnt mean it needs boost actually some gallente ships are outright ridiculously overpowered in many situtations compared to caldari which has like draek and tech 3 draekif you think caldari are fine you are white treeplease ignore
tell me more about these overpowered gallente ships i must know their names
a blaster mega is fine for what its made to doif you can use it after what its made to do and if you just can htfu a little and have balls to take more risks in pvp then you are fine with a blaster megathe blaster mega is just an example though
this is the truth  caldari ships especially rail ones suck much more than any gall ones  at least those can be fitted and still use some drones and moves faster so maybe buff both races  add a giga huge matar nerf and balance should be just fine
i like the way ive historically agreed that caldari needed improvements to their t2 lines never really disagreed with that but me supporting needed improvements to gallente is apparently the same as me telling caldari pilots they dont need attentionthat being said there are a grand total of 1 gallente subcaps thatre called for on fleets the lachesis unlike caldari who do have some decent options the tengu the drake the scorpion the falcon the blackbird the manticore etc etc if you want me to go into your caldari thread and and support your changes to caldari then post a caldari thread this is the gallente thread i am posting in the gallente thread
i can support this
thank you both for your support  i hope that together we can help fix fof missiles and make them a weapon system to be proud of
it isntgive them some time to set their agenda and wait the report from next summit before you post things like this
omg please 3
i and a fair number of other players feel that the recent updates blindsided the userbase not only was pirate jamming streamlined read made rediculous without prior testing on sisi but the new serverside fitting management change happened without any player testing or feedback not only is it incredibly cumbersome to deal with fittings that do not fit within the maximum 50 delete saved fitting import from clientside wherever it might be but a fair number of users now have no access to their fittings at all because the fitting migration window flatout does not work select fittings to be saved or select none click ok and nothing happens the window stays put unresponsive until you close it every time you click browse in the fitting window it brings up the same useless migration window preventing all access to any fits at allthis is made worse by the fact that the mac client in the past was never able to import or export fittings and that the fittings that were saved with the client data were not and still are not accessible at all in any folder ive searched through everything and i do mean everything i never found where the fittings were supposedly saved to so basically all of my fittings are now effectively gonehad ccp put these changes into effect on sisi prior to implementing them on tranquility these issues likely could have been sorted out and the affected players would not be so ticked offthreads here here and now here have already been made with a number of players expressing their supreme discontent with the situation and yet neither mod nor dev has responded to either of themthe complete disregard for seeking and responding to player feedback on this issue is needless to say quite disturbing
it looks like some dev in ccp has gone rogue and somehow managed to implement his vision of eve i mean like wtf no sisi testing complete turnaround in null sec vision they had basically no qa and on top of all that no meaningful communication about why things change wtf happened and so on my faith in ccp competence is being hit quite considerably i cant remember from the past 6 years so  crappy expansion and yes i do remember bootini seriously ccp get your  togehter before it reaches that big fan in the bottom
does nobody else see a problem with this does nobody else feel the need to hold ccp developers accountable for their egregious and willful ignorance of product testing and customer feedback
i dont see a problem with it in fact for ccp to do otherwise would be for them to break the habit of a lifetime so not supported sorry
so its ok for ccp to have completely broken an important feature of the game for many people and not even acknowledge that people are really ticked off about it sure now its only fittings maybe later though it will be bookmarks and all of your bookmarks will become completely inaccessible some day they may break another important feature without having it up on sisi for player testing and feedback and put it through to the release where many people encounter the problem and have to raise a ragestorm about itits not only about the fittings its about what this screwup means for future releases and thats a problem

i agree that new features bug fixes or game design changes should be tested in sisi first this gives people time to find issues npc ecm for example or at least get some idea of the impact of a change on their gameplaycsm should at least be consulted about whether a proposed change can go straight to production otherwise all nonsecurity related changes should be tested in singularity first

windjammer the players control the game as much as they should be allowed to ccp must and i repeat must maintain a certain amount of control of the game or it will spiral out of control
in any good scifi game movie tv show books even game bored the security forces respond to a threat with perfect force needed which concord does very well what i have noticed that they do not do is rep a ship getting ganked wouldnt an organization meant to keep the peace and proved help to someone under an illegal attack attempt to do more then kill the person who is attacking them give me your thoughts on this csm people and playersi am not saying we need to keep the ship alive but concord should rep a ship under attack until the attacking ship is gonedont say its a bad idea just because you do just this thing if ccp wants eve to be the best most realistic mmo out there then they should fix this issue in some way
this wont help unless you want a rr concord ship arriving immediately before others as soon as concord arrive they jam the ganker the point of suicide gank with anything other than smartbombs is to get it done before concord arrives
but instantlyappearing remote repairing spaceships would be so realistichow about when youre attacked concord show up 310 hours later proceed to photograph your wreck gently make fun of you for not fitting a tank and report your loot as stolen then absolutely nothing happens to the perp that sounds much more realistic
sounds a good idea but theres so much more that needs to be donelow sec moons harvestinglow sec end ores random spawnofficers spawn maybe at cruiserbc size and not easy to get down without at least 1 bsmission sites protect from scan could make more people come and we can always get a way to spank them but at least they have a chance to succeed and we will just need to work a little bit more than just get the ing probes out and warp tochoke points like gates with random spawn of local faction forces if there is any station in that system according to the number of ships involved there are so many things to be done so many ideas its just up to ccp to polish the ancient content and give some freshness im pretty sure this would profit to the whole community and not only a few onesgame style
surely it has been proposed countless times but here it is again destroy the ugly ship designs and start anew with shader 20 getting dropped and new nebulae being introduced shortly it seems like the right time lets not forget they originated from a very early version of the game back when ccp had a small team with limited talent and imagination 8 years later its about time we get an update by the way its not because a ship is named scorpion that it has to look like a scorpion
what you dont think the raven is a work of art the dominix isnt the most amazing space potato of all time syah youre probably right they need some new redesigns and far higher res textures go all the way ccp lets get some tessellation in here as well
not supported those timeless classics should be preserved the space potato must be immortalized
i disagree with you on this they redesigned ships in the past to make up for mistakes and theyve changed textures before to add detail and improve the look of the game were not asking them to replace these ships only to change the designs to fix small mistakes and create more detail for the game moving forward by taking advantage of newer advances in graphics technology
i find it sad that as long as its been since the newer tiers of t1 ships have appeared drake cane hyperion etc that we have yet to see these ships in missions my proposal is that ccp create new missions that use these ships or at the least edit existing missions and incorporate these newer ships into themthoughts
tier 3 hulls like maelstrom hyperion and abaddon are used in epic arcs new normal missions havent been made in a long time
which is ridiculous considering that mission runners make up a significant portion of the eve playerbase but eve if they dont want to create new missions at least make them avalable to replace other ships in the current missions
dont like critique
recently individual income in 00 has been nerfed repeatedlyfirst you nerfed officers by keeping the same spawn and drop rates but making the officers require multiple carriers to kill or worse in terms of individual income a gang of subcaps this leaves individuals unable to kill officers they find unless like me they happen to be quite welloff already and own several capitalcapable accounts the average singleplayer is forced to split the loot at least two wayssecond you nerfed belt spawn characteristics cleared belts now seem to take at least half an hour to respawn as with the officer spawn stats rat spawning mechanics seem otherwise unchanged meaning even good truesec i tested in a 08 system systems still spawn tons of worthless cruiser  bc spawns but now because of the respawn timer change it takes far far longer to get a system chained up and profitable than it used tolastly you nerfed sanctum spawning the 08 system i checked tonight had only one lone sanctum in it piles of havens and worse sites but one sanctumi assume these changes were put in place in order to nerf botting income since most bots in 00 beltrat but look at it from a nonbotter perspective i still want to make money in eve online a sciencefiction themed space mmorpg but now it takes 3 hours at a time just to get a system chained up for ratting theres far less sanctums to go around even though upgraded systems were generally overcrowded even prior to the nerf and the only remaining nonhighsec mission running alternatives incursions and exploration both require massive time investmentsincursions usually require you to move your ships all the way across eve before you even start making money this takes a lot of time and you generally have to be able to play eve for the 23 hours immediately following downtime to actually run profitable sites something not everyone can actually do for me living on the west coast of the us incursion fleets usually take place between 0400 and 0700 not the ideal time to be playing eveexploration requires boatloads of time spent scanning multiple accounts with very capable characters and competition for valuable sites is intense one can often scan for hours and not find a single profitable signature that someone else hasnt beaten you to this is particularly true on weekends since more people including myself are able to play eve for longer hoursto sort of sum this up belt ratting now takes too much time for the casual player sanctums are now more overcrowded than ever and are less accessible to the casual player exploration takes up too much time for a casual player and requires an extensive array of characters and ships to do solo officer hunting and incursions are for the most part postdt activities which most people dont get to participate in unless they can literally plan their lives around eve downtimesof all incomegenerating activities i would argue that various forms of ratting are the most accessible to casual players exploration market games import export moon goo projects etc all require even more time investment in terms of time spent probing micromanaging market orders setting up cyno chains for logistics flying freighters around etc etc etc the recent changes then have made even the most accessible forms of income generation less accessible to casual players this is going to make more casual players want to bot than ever before the more exasperating and time consuming you make income generating activities the more incentive there is to automate the processi know ccp frown on people submitting specific proposals for game improvements but if you want people to stop botting youre going to have to provide some kind of practical alternative to those of us who dont feel like replacing our real lives with atkeyboard goldfarming to be continued in a 2nd post
here are some general points that i think could use some rethinking 00 income sources are finite as opposed to infinite like empire sources in 00 the population of an area competes for limited belts sanctums cosmic signatures production slots in theory etc while in empire every mission runner gets unlimited private missions there are brazillions of available slots for industrial stuff and so on the entire space empire 00 sovholding game now revolves around supercaps supercaps in turn require giant sums of spacebux which people are being strongly encouraged to earn somehow several isk making opportunities seem skewed in favor of those who can play eve immediately after downtime find a way to remedy thise what you cant do is continue with this everyone buy supercaps t3 cruisers and machariels if you wish to remain relevant in pvp nerfs income streams makes iskmaking even more horrendous bans bots bans iskbuyers expects people to keep paying 14 realbux  month to play goldfarmer online approach not everyone bought millions of npcseeded guidance systems the week before tyrannis
maybe bot people will code more advanced bots that actually behave like humans random intervals random clicking spots but randomized so that each bot will have its own bahivoural pattern bots could be having a break opening links pasted in corp chat troll on forums hell maybe they can manage to have a complete set of bots to create a corp and whod chat with each other about different ingame issues working together for a common goal file petitions about lost ships etc d
ah yes the casual player cant afford to replace his own personal supercap losses by belt ratingthere are people in this game that think this is a problem somehow holy 
you realize that the cheapest standard fleet battleship setups cost several hundred million a pop now rightto elaborate ratting today in a good truesec system 08 with an extremely capable ship i was making about 5 million isk per 20 minutes 5 million that means to afford losing say a maelstrom now requires about 13 hours worth of rattingthat seems a bit ing steep would it require less time doing exploration probably less than 13 hours but my point is that exploration incursions etc arent things you can do in short sessions or in the case of incursions even at any time of the day
maybe the faction items drop rate and their meta or small officers spawn rate could get a little actually the more rats are killed in one system more chances you have to get officers spawns when you see full belts disappear in a few hours in high sec and none in low sec of course your chances to get some profitable loot will come bigger in high sec with 0 risk to get spankednow if i do agree the individual income will be lower i also think ccp didnt get the job done if they wanted to nerf the isk income in certain zonessystemsregionsis this the way or the first step to make big alliancescorps share the titanic isk incomes with members i dont know but obviously the individual or small roamers gets hurt in his wallet while the sanctumsheavens runnersmoon harvesters etc will not see that much change and far the ones who will not feel the paineditmy question for you is why the hell a 00 pilot would rate in high sec even if hes a casual oneyou have more chances to get gankedninjagriefconcorden in high sec and there is nothing you can do
not supportedthat fleet setup should be replaced by the alliance so whether the pilot can easily replace it or not is inconsequential if you cant afford to lose it you probably shouldnt be flying anyway or so it goesyou want better space with better isk fight for itelse get the top to share the moon incomeclear case of working as intended it getting rid of bots is a nice plus
5m isk per 20 minutes in a 08 system then you are really doing something wrongwhen i read the topic title i expected an incoherent rant why botting should be ignored etc but actually i was pleasantly surprised because he is right these things that according to some are done against botting hurt normal players alot everything that hurts normal players promotes bottingi personally consider at least 80 of the botting problem to come from supercaps they are needed to compete in eve sov warfare today hell they are the most dominant factor the most realistic way to get your supercap army is simply a few bots
the phrase chicken and egg springs to mind herebotting and sanctumfarming enabled mass supercap production so now its we need botting and sanctum farming to compete with those guys who have all those supercapschanges to the eve economy will always be nonlinear but there was always going to have to be some point at which the isk gusher was throttled back sucks to be the guys who didnt quite get their nyx but noone said life  or eve  was always going to be fair
in other words the only pilots who should be able to take part in fleet pvp are those belonging to alliances sitting on vast passive income streams such as technetiumneo moons gotcha
thismaybe folks will start to be a little more cautious and extra careful about how they spend their iskies ehnot supporting
incorrect the correct reading should be fly only what you can afford to lose supercaps were meant as alliance level assets not personal toysi dont know where you got the idea that you were entitled to have your personal supercap my terms of service sure didnt mention itthen again if i wanted one and was in a big alliance like say goonswarm then it stands to reason that i could fly to get whatever space i wanted to support my supercap habit or get better 00 or whateverthe only response to botting is one strike banning the only response to waaah waaah i want my supercap is htfu and go fight for the land that would give you one
i dont think you get how this game works which frankly doesnt surprise me in the least you have no corp or alliance tag no killboard history whatsoever and the only things that pop up when i google your character name are a bunch of whiny antibotting posts on these forumsfirst since you seem obsessed with the idea of ratting for supercaps rather than for money to spend on internet spaceships in general lets clear something up noone well a minority of people really enjoys owning and flying a supercap theyre a  to buy a  to maintain turns out not being able to dock or go anywhere without an army of cyno and logistics alts is a pain who knew and with a few exceptions dont see much use for tasks outside fleet combat which generally consists of jump into a system watch your corpmates shoot undefended structures while you assist with meager sentry drone damage its a running joke in our alliance that buying supercaps tends to rapidly free people from the shackles of playing eve online and not without good reason for the most part flying supers is really boring id also add that certainly in our case supercaps are not funded by the alliance there are some small subsidies involved for say fighter bombers etc that add up to a bil or two and thats about it it falls to individual members to provide the rest of the cashso you say why in the name of god are you trying to afford an absurdly expensive ship that has little practical use to an individual alliance member the answer is that if as an alliance you dont have a giant army of these dumb ships available youre pretty well hosed as far as your ability to hold onto your space let alone take new space is concerned they are literally a necessity and due to their extraordinary expense even the richest alliances and i count my own as one of them at this point om nom nom technetium cant afford to bankroll their construction in large numbers while still paying their massive sov bills and funding other player programs like reimbursements which by the way are increasingly necessary due to the aforementioned individual income nerfsthe fact that even a techrich alliance cant afford to fund supercap construction on a large scale should say quite a bit about what other alliances can probably affordbut all this is missing the original point of my post this isnt a supercap focused post its a why is ccp trying so hard to keep poor people in 00 poor post fun fact most people who rat or bot for nonrmt reasons dont do it to fund personal supercap losses they do it to fund normal combat losses like vagabonds yeah really exotic stuff its the sort of person who isnt rich and who loses a couple of hacs each month hence my frequent references to casual players that suffers the most from these nerfs
sounds like your problem of having supercaps and them infringing on your fun is well on its way to being resolved then another good move by ccpif you cant afford the ships you fly then you probably shouldnt fly them by the way if your alliance leadership is making unreasonable demands then that would be the problem as welland if they are encouraging or facilitating botting then you should report themfinally there is more valuable space but you would probably fight for it instead of just be handed it to youi see a lot of problems in your post and proposal but none of them is you not being able to make enough isk and none of them is solved by your proposal eitherbut hey i dont get eve the game that is supposed to be hard after all it is i who is whining about my personal supercap or it being hard to get one or about how casual people cant afford top of the line pvp ships with fittings protip there are cheaper ships out there than vagabonds what ill say is that last i checked this wasnt hello kitty online where you get handed alliance level toys that make you miserable the alliance doesnt pay for and you seem to hate yet you still somehow needi would recommend if you want easy mode with respawning ships at no effort to you that you should probably play battlestar galactica online the ships there respawn when destroyed and no need to grind for plex or nasty supercaps to make you miserable either
no really are you being intentionally thick why do you keep rambling about botting for supercaps when the point im trying to make is as simple as making it harder to get x will encourage people to find and use illegal workarounds that will allow them to get xnoone said eve should be easy but when it gets to the point where affording totally boring spacemiddle class stuff requires that you spend as much time playing eve as you do at your irl job people are probably going to find something better to do with their timealso what exactly do you take issue with when it comes to my actual proposals if you can call them that which were1 make 00 at least onpar with empire space in terms of individual income generation for casual players by implementing some form of private content much like an empire mission or the 1010 escalations that occur off sanctums occasionallywhere you get a bookmark to a site that is yours other players cant probe it out2 reduce the strategic necessity of supercaps so players feel dont feel the same level of obligation to bot for giant boring ships you and i agree that there should be fewer supercaps and they should be reserved as highlevel alliance assets not made available sometimes through botting to every pilot who wants one3 find a way to avoid limiting certain activities to certain specific times of the day thus favoring whatever group of people happens to be able to play eve at a certain timei dont see how you could honestly think any of these things is a bad idea unless of course you simply dont have any experience with any of them and are simply talking out of your assid also like to point out that my issues with individual income are only with the effects of ccps most recent changes starting with the officer buff nerf depending on how you look at it i had no problem with the level of income that was available prior to these changes so dont put words in my mouth re me whining that ships need to be free
nice argument you got therefirst 00 is at least on par with empire space already and depending on its true sec vastly superior i dont believe all space should be the same or you should have free candy dispensers everywhere though there is also npc nullsec with agents who pay a lot better than empire of course there would be risk involved second this is already reducing the strategic need of super caps if nobody can afford them then there will be less of them i dont think ccp is done with working on that but getting rid of easy personal supercaps is a great startthird agree on it being screwed that things favor those who can only play after downtime that is a decent proposal and you should probably release it on its ownthere you go by the way i dont see the logic behind thinking that officers should be as weak as regular bs when their value is far superior or that all income generation should be soloable more crying about not having things silver plattered to you imhoof course you had no problem with previous income it was ridiculous by any measure with the described situation of personal supercaps and cyno alts for everyone  why would someone like you who plays the game on hard have a problem with that and again you act as if there is no way to improve your lot there are plentylet me think 00 is about wars so why not fight for better space naah that would be too hard for hello kitty online wouldnt itfinally the solution to making it harder to get x will encourage people to find and use illegal workarounds that will allow them to get x is not making things easier but banning said people and the alliances that encourage and foment this some work has been done in the subject i believeplease forward me your tos and eula i am interested in the version you got that promises free space high class for casuals with no effort and caps for everyone
tell me how a fully upgraded 08 system with 20 belts yielding 15mhr in belt rat bounties and having one available sanctum is equal to an empire missioning system one can support exactly one player at a passable amount of income a couple of people making awful money in the belts and thats about it oh by the way all those upgrades and maintenance fees cost a buttload of cash whereas the empire dwellers pay nothing for a system that can support an effectively unlimited number of ratters oh and they didnt have to conquer their space eitheras far as risk yeah youve got me nailed down im a totally riskaverse eve player i p much never leave highsecexcept for the fact that tons of people already have them and its only newcomers who are getting screwed by these changes ok yeahi will if i have to its p dumbagain i dont know if you noticed but the value of officer spawns is unaffected by the changes to officers the value of the drop is related to the rarity of the items in turn related to the rarity of officer spawns in general whats changed is the value of finding an officer spawn to most players where a lucky newbee used to be able to kill an officer if they found one and profit from the lovely loot now the newbee has to call in either 10 of his newbee friends or pay some rich  like me who has carriers around a large portion of the drop to actually collect any of his isk the value created is the same only now its either split between more people in the case of an average ratter or requires previously unnecessary hassle to collect if one is wellequipped for the rich guy its a pain for the poor guy its at least 50 lessprofitable i dont see many people winning on this onesome form of justification here would be nice i really doubt that the majority of funding for most supercaps came from ratting income but you seem to enjoy focusing on the people rat for supercaps gimmick rather than the average people rat for most of the things they buy anglenot arguing that botters shouldnt be rooted out and dealt with never disputed this point im merely suggesting that maybe the way to deal with botters is to and this was kind of a leap i know um deal with botters you know as opposed to nerfing all ratting income into the ground im sure darius can find a technical solution when hes not snorting wasabe
but yeah until ccp can find a technical final solution to the botting problem i dont see why the rest of us should have to deal with crushing nerfs to a good way of replenishing our iskreserves in a timely fashionpersonally my question to you is this why do you hate botters so much that youre willing to sacrifice a bunch of your potential income to see them become less though still profitable ironically as far as the ratting changes are concerned botters are the leastaffected portion of the population since by definition they dont care how long it takes them to chain up a system and make money its free
christ thats awful you can do better running l4 missions in high sec
i realize this post is intended to be about botting but its also leaning very heavily toward a disagreement about the recent anomalies changes so i dont feel too off topic saying what im gonna say despite my omision of bottingsometimes i really get the feeling that people are not aware of the costs of living and owning space in 00 and im not just talking about the costs of ships and time to win patrole and keep it im talking about upgrading systems paying upkeep on those systems and cultivating them to produceover a year ago when ccp changed the way sovereignty worked it was a god send no more pos spamming no more we killed 20 poses in the system this weekend but they managed to anchor one before downtime  now we have to wait another 48 hours for it to come out of reinforced mode to even try to take the system again it made more sense it made gameplay easier yes but also more fair and accessibleand with that new system of ihubs and sovereignty blockers as well as entrapment arrays and leveling up systems militarystrategicindustry levels and capabilities just about everyone except the ceos and directors of 00 alliances managed to overlook something owning a system isnt really owning a system its more like renting a system and if you want that system to be useful strategically as well for industry and ratting you have to dump more money into it both in upgrades and in dailyweeklymonthly operational feeseach upgrade for a system runs in the hundreds of millions on top of that the higher you go up the upgrade tree the more it costs the the bigger they get 500mil for level 5 upgrades for level 5s you need a freighter read freighter not jump freighter to transport them so thats billions in upgrades as well as risking billions flying a freighter through lownull sec or else you have to trying to find a wh that might make it a little bit saferthese were all risks that make sense and were worthwhile because the reward was the understanding that doing so provided a reliable source of income the problem with the new system in which truesec in 00 systems determines the anomalies present is that its taking systems that used to produce and turning them into isk pits because we read the population of players in 00 thought wed be able to have reliable ratting in any system we upgraded stations started popping up everywhere  even in places you wouldnt have dreamed of putting one preihub because it was never worth it  the upgrades made it worth doingnow a 04 system that used to provide enough isk in tax from ratting to support its upgrades is almost empty  theres not a single haven or sanctum to be found the six belts hardly provide enough rats for a belt chainer because of the longer respawn time of the 14 anomalies present 2 of them spawn a couple battleships at the endthe way i see it the problem is more that theyve made the requirements for havenssanctums to spawn in the system much to low if there was at least 1 haven or sanctum in a fully upgraded system no matter the sec status that might make a little more sense but paying billions in fees and upgrades just to have 8 more hubs and dens  which new pilots grow out of in a month or two  seems counter productive to mein my opinion ccp might as well remove haven and sanctums from null space and stick them low sec  then well have a lot of good fights and the global amount of isk in the game will decrease to a ccpapproved level because of all the replacement ships people have to buywhen i first got involved in the game i loved it because it was a sandbox game where the developers didnt want to control every aspect of it but now theyre trying to reduce and control the amount of isk in the game theyre trying to incite wars for space  the greatest thing eve pilots could do is go passive and refuse to pvp until changes are made nonviolent protesting
a couple of thoughts 1 how many havens does your system have from personal experience only counting bounties chaining sanctums easily earns 30100mhr chaining havens will earn you 2560mhr this is plenty of isk and i would claim that every 2 anoms more than supports 1 person 2 i dont think ccp meant for belt income to happen via chaining up belts personally while i fully admit that it greatly increases income it feels like an exploit i wonder if the changes are made to limit chaining or belt ratting overall ill test it this weekend 3 atm super proliferation is a huge sov warfare problem if they can limit null sec income to be more profitable than lvl 4s but not stupid gushing faucets that make isk unimportant im all for it i think thats one of the first steps needed to reduce supers would it be so terrible if a 200 man battle with 20b in losses actually took the participants 5 hours as opposed to 1 hr to recover
please
idont even
right because we want another wow clone for which we would have to pay for new expansions and blizzard has time and resources available to devote to a competing product at a price that ccp can afford to pay and valve is actually interested in devoting time and resources to an mmo something they have no experience with as opposed to working on new games like halflife 2 episode 3 et al sorry but im going to have to say no not only havent you expressed any supporting arguments for such a proposal to be made you havent considered any of the implications of eve being outsourced to another company for development if anything quality would probably decline rather than improve by adding third parties into the process if that was your point
qualityi dont recall blizzard publishing beta stuff nor valve
soon to be successful troll is soon to be successful
valve has no experience and no interest in developing mmos this lack of experience would lead to quality problems as they grapple with juggling two different genres at oncebizarre creations was known for project gotham racing they were then tasked with making a 007 espionage shooter with absolutely no experience in that genre what happens when you force a company outside of its area of expertise failure bizarre creations went under after the 007 game flopped we lost a good company because of thati suppose you havent experienced the many bugs that wow has had over the years neither have i to be honest because i never played again after trying it for 7 minutes and 53 seconds its a boring dull mindless grindfest of a game but ive heard plenty of people moan and complain over bugs and balance issues that never seem to get resolved blizzard has more staff and more money they can afford to have more people to work on fixing bugs as they ariseccp does not have that kind of money they cannot afford to hire that many developers just for finding and fixing every problem that may arise they cannot afford to pay blizzard to do it for them because it amounts to the same thing they have to go to war with the army they have right now not the army they want or might have in the futurepoint being its unreasonable to think that outsourcing development for the sake of improving quality would even be a practical option for ccp i wont stand here and defend the many bugs that seem to have gone overlooked for a very long time or their blatant disregard for player testing and feedback but outsourcing to another company isnt the solution to the problem
umm no

those of us in fw know that its broken hell id wager even those who arent in fw know its broken almost no one plexes its filled with carebears and carebear alts whos sole purpose is to run missions in intysb combos and get maximum reward for almost no risk system occupancy has no meaning and new players are completely lost when they get in because the nature of pvp is so centralized that spies are both useful and plentiful making it impossible for newbs to get past security measuresfw is supposed to be about pvp easily accessible for all however the mechanics work contrary to this purpose and after talking with some of my fellow fwers ive come up with some fixes that i think would make fw a more enjoyable experience for all1 give substantial lp rewards for plexing plexing should be a great if not the best source of small gang pvp in fw the gates limit ship sizes that can come in and there are so many around that it would help spread out available forces however almost no one does it why there are no incentives to plex you have npc ewar that completely imbalances pvp situations in favor of the system owner and you get zero rewards from plexing besides vp which basically amounts to bragging rights over how much time you spend orbiting a button giving people an actual tangible resource lp that buys rewards to fight over in plexes will greatly increase the amount of people willing to do it2 greatly increase the lp rewards for killing enemy ships the current lp rewards for ships are a joke eve revolves around gang warfare and yet the only people who get lp rewards for ship kills are the lucky person who do top damage on the kill lets make it actually worthwhile to go out and risk your ship in constant combat with the enemy militia3 nerf fw missions so we have these great resources with which to stimulate pvp in fw namely the ownership and sale of fw specific items like the tier1 navy bs and exclusive mods in the fw store however the primary method for acquiring these items is through regular missioning that has been perfected into a science that makes sure there is almost zero risk involved for the missioner there are people who have alts in fw just to make money they do nothing but mission constantly never participate in fights and get killed maybe once in a year due to some freak accident theres a reason you see over 200 in militia chat and can barely get 15 into a pvp fleet hell one pirate corp in gallente fw space has fw alts specifically to run missions so they can make isk to buy things to kill us with theres no greater risk than gang warfare for the faction warrior yet he has no reason to pvp as such because he could make even more isk being a carebear with an interceptor and a stealth bomber or just a stealth bomber if youre in minmatar or caldari fw more people will go out to pvp if theres actually a reason to do so4 give large rewards for both system ownership and capture beyond just plexing for reward people should want to capture systems so that you actually have an interest in stopping enemy plexers as well as doing your own plexing there should be some bonus to system ownership like increased bounties and sec status boost from rats or any number of things and have them apply to players with good standing towards the relevant faction not just fwers also captures should give lots of lp to those involved in the fight and successful takedown of the bunker5 create penalties to losing systems there needs to be some cost to players in losing systems the most tangible would be losing docking rights at all stations in an enemy controlled system for players with bad standing towards the occupying faction andor relevant npc militia corp this would make fw relevant in its designated space and also make it much more difficult for outside entities to come in and spoil the fun for everyone without picking a side and sticking with it
if fw warfare is about pvp and easy accesibility to all then its already accomplished its job easy isk to replace ships missions and free wardec lots of targetsrecruitment ad if you want to awesome pvp without killing your sec status then join fw free war dec easy isk missionsspecific comments1 farmers would then plex same complaints would continue2 nobody does plexes because they are gawdawful boring farmers would still do them because they would bring in substantial isk rewards and they would still bail at first sign of trouble  leading to more whinage by those people who like to fight3 and no they wouldnt fight for a plex they would move on to an empty system and run an empty plex there instead nobody is going to fight when they know they are going to die this is what happened when caldari alts ran plexes to raise standings and then make billions off of cosmos missions the difference now is that fw missions pay better for the time invested than those same cosmos missions4 and finally you are proposing to ruin my second greatest source of income  opposing forces running their missions these guys drop better loot than most shadow serpentis faction spawnsother than that lp for plexing and idea wrt docking rights should have been implemented from the very beginning btw if you want to keep farmers from exploiting fw missions and perhaps plexes then put a penalty on not completing a mission when it opens up such as redesigning missions so griefers like me can ruin them like cutting the net where you can take their documents and then ransom them for additional isk
except that because plexes cant be run while cloaked all you have to do is run down the plex if they dont want to fight and follow them around if you want to grief someone now you have to follow them around constantly and they have the luxury of being able to cloak up and finish their mission any time within the 12 hours they get to complete it if its centered around plexing then it means that you can continually deny them their opportunity to make isk without having to destroy your life in game or out in order to stop them so their choice is to either fight and try and get the lp or they can not fight and get nothing
cloaking isnt the problem and camping one mission 237 versus following somebody around 237 to deny them plexes is the same thing boredom resolution of conflict due to other side bailing should be faster than 12 hours and the amount of time it takes to close a plex while orbiting button 1030 minuteswouldnt it just make much more sense to put a poison pill in each mission and perhaps plex that kills their rewards if they dont stand and fight
maybe but then wed still have an entire mechanic without a purpose
which mechanic plexing  occupancy missions  isk or rp thwarting of enemy forces you can also make isk running plexes loot the tags devs should add in lp rewards and if you make one mission count towards occupancy the same as a plex then it too would have a double meaning
occupancy doesnt mean crap right now and frankly missions are lame
it wasnt some kind of intentional balance to give ppl more standing hit and there was no lore justification some guy saw the bunch of misc objects with no standing hit and decided to lump them all together as a big 24 hit instead of manually choosing an appropriate hit for each one and entering in the values it had more of an effect on player behavior than whomever did it would realize people werent always so phobic over faction kill missions
personally i avoid faction missions like the plague this makes it rather difficult to effectively run missions as you have to swap agents all the time the problem isnt only that you take a faction hit but that it is such a high faction hit and compared to faction gain none is highly unbalanced currently the only way to get faction standings increased is to do the storyline missions which also impact opposing faction standings in a big way they are also rare with exception to onetime runs like the datacenter sites and the cosmos missions ive got no more than a handful of storyline missions between all my accounts in 3 years of playing part of that is that i am not a grinder and part is because i stop mission running when i hit a faction wallid support the removal of any faction standings hits suggested i recently spent something like 240 million repairing the standings on a character with 48 amarr and worse than 1 caldari for all those negative standings they got a whole 20 minmatar and 13 gallente give or take i managed to get the standings to a little better than 25 amarr and 07 caldari using the data centers and cosmos and still had better than 1 with minmatarpoint is negative standings are easy all you have to do is look at someone wrong the positive standings are either 1 time or slow in coming incurring massive penalties to opposing factions either way its time we see some balance heresupported
not supported youre attacking a physical asset of a major faction of course youre going to incur a decent penalty for doing so and if youre complaining about taking a lot of time to fix standings youre doing it wrong very wrong
a frig is a frig it is no more of a physical asset than any bs it shouldnt cause 120 times as much standing hit as a bs you bring a good point in that 002 hit for a bs should be increased this does not mean 24 hit for a frig does not need to go
agreed
this is short and simplefor frick sake   we need a way to monitor planets in some other manner than actually logging on accounts add the info to api eve gate   somethingpi is annoying as it is atleast let us monitor it without having to log inlike the skill training programs that are available fro both mac and pc something like that it would show us how much time is left on extractors and it would show amounts coming in but most important of all   it would show us the storages how much space is left in storagethat is all
recently there has been some anger towards recent business practices what has been lacking from these threads are quality commentary made by ccp as to the issues at hand i think it would give finality to a lot of players if you were to clearly explain your motifs and how you are going to change or not change in the future i dont mean some cute little dev comment but a nice thought out explanation for the recent degradation of the game people that play eve care about it and its fate the forumexplosion is one of the first signs all failing mmos have and we are going through that right now it would be great to know if our message is getting through to you 97 pages later or we should stop fighting it and play another gamethank you for your time i severely hope its the former
agreed hire a damn forum pr guy to keep us apprised of the game were paying you for take for example the last ship design contest over 3 months now and still nothing announced and in the official thread there is page after page of players demanding to be informed of at least some reason for the hold upits not that im not understanding that ccp is trying to run a company here but when you dont respond to the people that are your very bread and butter it just looks lethargic on your part
as an american who does study the english language quite a bit i can vouch for the others in saying that you are indeed butchering the english language with your overzealous use of punctuation you should go read an mla style guide available at bookstores or at your local library some time before defending your poor excuse for grammar and yes their examples are exactly indicative of the way you type ive had a number of english teachers over the years who would cringe at your abuse of commas and semicolons had any of them graded any of your assignments i can almost certainly guarantee you would have received a d at best the incomplete statements and the sentence fragments are all indicators that your understanding of proper english punctuation is tenuous at bestthe grammatically correct way to punctuate your post is as follows according to the official mla style guide underlined sections are where corrections were madeas can be plainly seen i have eliminated all incomplete statements and sentence fragmentsalso i noticed a disturbing trend in your posts you tend to put an apostrophe before an s in order to pluralize something such as lots and commas when they should read lots and commas respectively that said your rules are a bit inaccurate but ill leave it to the mla style guide to correct your misconceptions as it seems there are quite a few of themplease be kinder to the true american english rules of grammar there are few enough of us as it is who actually know what were doingthis is not trollingthis is the plain and simple truthps as a word of caution to everyone i see people use the nonword alot a lot see what i did there this is not to be confused with allot such as allotting more developer time to fixing known outstanding issues rather than new unwanted features hinthintpssit should be whos a contraction of who is not whose which is an interrogative possessive pronoun or adverbgrammarnahzee
well that was enlightening but i think i already covered this in the crime and punishment section it seems i was using old english or the queens english as taught in school and recent changes i am 3435 have modified even canadian grammatical standards as can be seen in the new canadian editorial standards they still teach the queens english in university in canada by the way despite it being completely defunct and out of print when you get out my landlord is an english teacher or was now retired and confirmed my usage of the english language shes read a few of my essays when i asked her about it last week she said in no uncertain terms tell the lot of them to f off and stop butchering the english language shes a bit old fashioned and a little stubborn i convinced her that i would modify my english for your sake here on the forums while keeping some practice with my original use of the queens englishincidently my english mostly sucks because my only use of it is forums like these where everyone uses commercial english and in game chat in local my friends prefer voice to chat so we almost never actually type anything this has resulted in my losing practice with sentence structure where i am struggling to make sentences sound and look correct this is much easier with your english naturally as it is a simplified form of english intended to allow for easy adaptioni adapted in about 45 minutesanyway on with the thread though i may point out that i would now modify the op slightlykeep csm and introduce playerbase voting like immersion put the polling on the forums where well see only 10 of the playerbase voting why only 10 because the trolls have managed to remove every interested highsec mission runner and carebear from posting here through careful use of harrassment tactics is that surprising not really look at how ive fared with my posts here if it isnt grammar s who no longer recognize the english language its umadbros qqers and the like attempting to inflict psychological stress on the interested who hold contrary opinionsin three years ive watched the carebear population on these forums dwindle and die with just a few last holdouts like myself to carry the torch granted im not exactly carebear material but i dont troll them flog them flame them or try to make them leave and give up posting i occaisionally even support their ideas and discussions and post a few suggestions of my own to help give weight to their argument getting the playerbase voting in game would bypass the need to log in to the forums though it may be unneccessary with the new forums i have noticed that you can stay logged in on them and are not limited to a 5 minute logout timer like you are here creating a post like this one quite often finds you logged out at the end of it and you lose everything you typed to get there as soon as you click post and it redirects you to the logon screeni dont even know what a carebear is never figured out the definition on that one it seems to be used in a wide variety of cases with no real solid idea of why it is being used in one case as opposed to another personally i dont care for the term or even like the show and certainly dont match any of the personality traits of those silly bears i might have 23 years ago but then i was only 11 going on 12 and completely naive at the time if you want players to vote put a polling system in game it will have greater exposure and ensure more votes are cast
because there are obviously no issues with direct democracy
wow the op doesnt sounds like hes motivated at all by hatred for the composition of csm6 huhs they need to add a thumbs down flag for posts
sure all you experienced with mail lists know how unrealistic it is to manage them id like csm to address it with ccp and either come up with a way to have a list of people with access to it that shows their name corp and history and a remove button or simply link it in with the apistanding system same as say a chat channel can do
hiin 2008 i attended fanfest it was a very enjoyable experience met lots of internet spaceship nerds just like me at one of the presentations kudos was given to 2 devs who had introduced stackless python and as a result battles of over 1000 ships were possible without too much lag it was awesomesome time passes and ccp release a new expansionpatch i think it was dominion and the lag was back with a vengeance 100 ships were enough to kill the serveri would like the csm to ask ccp if these 2 individuals are still working for ccp and if not is there a possibility of hiring them to look at the current code so they can work their obvious magic on the gamethanksrevjim
this wont help smaller alliances in fact it will hurt them large alliances in the face of such a change would simply plan the invasion accordingly with titans as waypoints instead of jump bridges defenders already have plenty of time to recover from a sudden attack on their sovereignty poses have a reinforcement timer provided youre not negligent on the upkeep and outposts have multiple reinforcement timers an ihub or an outpost makes a system impossible to take in 1 daylastly if the jumpbridge network of your enemy comes so close to your systems that youd get no warning of an impending blob youve got bigger worries than their jb networkthus i dont support this as it does nothing to help smaller alliances deal with being outnumbered it just makes the process of projecting your force more tedious even more time spent travelling instead of fighting
imo a little delay isnt a really bad idea but how you got from a little delay to a between two jumps minute is a mistery for me put it at 10 seconds as absolute max if you want something realisticmaking it fit in the backstory is not an advantage i can also make it fit to the backstory that the 4 empires take over all 00changing all 00 space to high sec is also easy to implementwait what roaming gangs claiming infrastructure no idea what you mean by that but i assume taking down ihubs or something are we now talking about roaming capital gangsyes and how many sov holding 00 alliances are there who dont have titans themselves and dont have more than enough friends with titans
haha i like how all the supports come from people with no corp  alliance tag this idea is horrible the bottom line is that the last thing eve needs is another set of timers for players to wait outgives more time for incoming roamings to atack poses claim infacstucture or to make any other quick invasions  are you kidding roaming gangs dont shoot pos you drooling  nor can they quickly invade space try knowing anything at all about sov mechanics before posting your pubbie hurfblurf nerf nullsec nonsense
not supportedso i guess your stealth bomber camp isnt that succesful you can already get the pos password with a little spy work google then you can fly into the bubble as you fail to kill anythingnerf jump bridges the big boys will replace them with titans at the end of the day the old guys with more isk will still be raping you the samealso what is this noble concept that ty nullsec pirates should be on equal footing in somebody elses trillion isk empire pretentious madness
you will still need 2 clicks first one to select item and second one to access it doubleclick just jumps to default access field
i think hes suggesting that either we need to retain the ability to spin our ships in stationor he wants a skillpoint reimbursement for training that skill to level 5
i want to be able choose not to load the station environment seems to me just an useless sink of graphics processing i mean when im docked im not really playing the game hence waste of 3d rendering
ccp has stated several times that mac users actually represent a surprisingly sizable percentage of the eve subscriberbase and that dropping support for mac would result in substantial lost profits that said i do not recall the actual statisticsedit it should be noted that i have not had nearly as many problems with the mac client as others seem to be having mostly its the fitting management and the jukebox randomly skipping to the next track on the playlist which has been a known issue since dominion wtf
for many mac users the current state of the client renders the game unplayable anyone that can play eve under windows via bootcamp should until ccp and transgaming can at least commit to stabilitysupported
its terrible i sold my gaming pc because i wasnt playing games except eve anymore and bought a macbook because ccp supported macs now my client crashes all the time and at the most inopportune moments the worst part is i cant even get reimbursement for it so i am stuck flying t1 ships because i have a good chance of loosing it even in obvious cases where client crashed while i had aggression and i was in a sleipnir a sb probed me out and killed me i could have tanked this sleipnir and waited out my aggression no problem but the logs didnt show anything going wrong so im sol now regarding eve and contemplating rebuilding my pc
i never supported myselfand i am a dude not stephaniei just saw a stephanie though
you certainly do think outside the box
by golly i think youre right those videos of darius johnson giving a presentation hes 20 minutes late for while drunk off his rear are obviously a smear campaign similarly the video hangin with the goons is an out of context bit of libel im sure when mits said he went to iceland on an 8 day bender that what he really meant was he went there to confer with others on how to best serve eve in an informal setting and enjoy some of the sights to be seen there these people are obviously misunderstood and clearly upstanding pillars of the community seriously like anything else in life some are and some arentthe parts of eve they like what about the parts they dont likeand those other csms were comprised ofokay but its a little hard to see how theyre going to do anything but succeed when you look at the first item theyve chosen to spot light time dialationtime dialation has been in assembly hall for some time
sounds good heres hoping i am impressed with the upgraded intercommunication being used by members of csm6 about freakin timewindjammer
im very excited and looking forward to time dilation thank you csm and ccp for taking this up
yeah td will finally get rid of black screen of death and let people fight fairly albeit a bit more slowly this is a great idea and i look forward to having hit sisi where we can give it a test
finally my two favourite things weed and milk combined into one mixture of own
time dilation change that we can believe in
been wondering that myself and seleene seems to have said very little about anything since the election
small scale pvp is good for super large 00 alliancesit gives pilots somethign fun to do when not blobing and fun is why they tollerate cta taxes camps and station bashesthere needs to be more 1030 man fleets acomplishing real goals and getting good fights right now hot droping moms that are more mobile than roving gangs make small scale pvp pointless and more of a diversion than a real tacticwe need objectives a 1030 man fleet can acomplish that will aid the blob or help move a soverighnty war past the stagnant nature it is currently ineditsujestions on how to achieve this and what limitations should be in place for encouraging small gang warfare should be discused more please post your ideasalso a clear statment of what small gang players want out of small gang warfare would help statementsmall gang warfare in 00 is lacking and requires more small scale objectives to foster this style of game play small gang 00 warfare should promote the followingencourage small gangs to form up give small gangs rewarding objectivesenable small gangs prompt a response from other alliances encourage gang on gang warfareadditions or qualifications to the above goals

i wonder why the csm sees no necessity to comment on the glaring security issues of the new forum and the way ccp handles thisjust in case you missed it
ccp sreegs is darius johnsondarius johnson is a goonthe chairman of the csm is the mittanithe mittani is a goonyou do the mathtinfoil
i correct you in thisccp sreegs is sean cdarius johnson was sean cdarius johnson was goonccp sreegs never was a goon he is ccpthe mittanii dont care about the mittanithe mittani is hyped and yet have to prove himself what hes worth being a member of the csmto the poster of the topicthe csm is not the eve police you totally misunderstand the concept of the council of stellar management
as much as we think were fairly organized keep in mind we officially took office less than a week ago we will weave magic we will build dreams and the stars themselves will bowl into a neat line eager to offer themselves as furnaces for our dark work but we the realm builders require more than a second in the aether to complete our tasks trust me when i say we will begin to put forward documents ideals and objectives very soon but in the meantime let us get our ass grooves chiselled out of these comfy new chairs ccp has given us before we start collectively issuing statements pertaining to our opinions on subjects that were not fully informed on
who knew white tree is the roleplayers csm representative
yeah that was what i expected from this csm
pl and rooks  kings are highsec noobs  also vuk lau ragequitting is not  who did the best giving the situation of being surrounded by moronswhat nc has the largest amount of good moons thus they will be the least affected on a alliance levelyou sir are an idiot
you sir are jealousvuk lau is nothing short of a god damn hero he had to put up with the idiots in csm 5 and still managed to bring out some of the best changes to this game his coalition is built on friendship and it gets results we are constantly challenged by nap trains who like to exploit and use gms to try and pull the wool over our eyes yet here we are still holding our space and winningso put that in your pipe and smoke itsilencedamn right you have nothing to say bff loser
herp derp loud noises
good thing all that moon goo goes directly into the pockets of people flying rifters hurricanes and drakes huh protip it doesnt dont tie the nerf to individual income to alliance level income other than taxes theyre not related that much the nerfs on the ground level are already starting to squeeze individual pilots regardless of where theyre located in 00 or what alliance theyre in unfortunately we need to gather more data on how this is changing things before the csm as a collective entity can say we dont like this or this is finethe opinions you want will come in time
damn i was so used to the test forums that i tried to upboat you
due to the fact there are more titans then bops i feel as there is a gapping hole in bops as they are easy to build but obviously have less demand then a 50billion isk ship
wow another great crying rant from an old school eve online playeryawnnnnnnno the old eve online wasnt better just like ur glory days werent either you just think they are but ur lying to urself you just want to blame progress on ur problems so get over it also akita u remind me of captain hindsight south park lolinstead of addressing the obvious problem why dont you explain in detail a solution no i guess its just easier to whine edit oh wait i forgot my solutionkeep on doing the great work ccp more content features etc dont let the haters tears get u all wet
i didnt say the game was better back then obviously over time some things eventually got polished so all the old stuff is better and we have new stuff alongside it but the new stuff is mostly crap or suffered from meltdown soon after it was introduced or was recalled soon after going live or worse it arrives featureincomplete buggy as hell and even more annoying and it remains mostly like that for oh at least a few years the glory days i was referring to do not relate to individual content pieces but the mentality of the dev team actually followed constantly improving on the old stuff bit by bit while also trying to put some new stuff in when ready instead of the current situation where most old content with very few exceptions gets neglected while huge grandstanding displays of upcoming features which never work as advertised became the normif you cant understand the difference sorry for youthe obvious difference being that i have a pretty decent track record of foresight as opposed to just hindsightalso you appear to completely lack the powers of captain hindsight yourself how about you learn to read what was written in the op  what a coincidence  that was exactly the same thing i said the only difference is that you seem to think that lately ccp has actually been pushing out the same level of quality they used toi got news for you they arent doing that anymore
this game is a jokeccp realised it about 2 years ago

eve online has evolved big time from when it first started and has become more complexeve online has had major improvements with stability except forums    graphics ui gameplayeve online supports a much larger community then before and has done a pretty decent job of keeping the servers running goodso intergrating new featurestechcontent to this highly evolved stable populated game isnt going to be easy and you cant and wont plz everyone so you as the player should have the knowledge not to expect perfection and should be reasonable when u criticize ccp is smart so they probably will follow the markert research over amateur form rants because i would do the same thing lol and word of mouththats a great theory but advertising is a proven way to sell a product
so is word of mouthand just because eve has grown doesnt mean it should start becoming a heap of halfbaked bugged featuresi mean yes it evolved quite alot since the day i set my foot out of cistuvaert the first time back in 2003 but in these latter years the quality of releases have decreased to a level where its starting to become unsustainable
dude ive been playing for a while and hit the wall last year wisincarna has been the carrot keeping me going my mule is tired and sees the stable up ahead i fully agree with akita even if it means another year or more even if im long gone the game needs the stuff already introduced fixed then start adding new content
perfect example on how do things right is what team bff is doing with their lowhanging fruit approachso many tiny feature updates and additions yet so well received on the community
population increase  critism increase probably the same hatersplayers ratio as it was when eve started out so proportionality the majority of players think eve and ccp are doing greatand grim i had to look up bff and all is i can say is we need this in eve online bff game
whos asking for perfection were merely asking for stuff to be delivered after proper testing and only when its slightly more featurecomplete than a mere skeletonheck they could even release it as a skeleton if only they would quickly add some meat to the bones afterwards but they dont even usually do that anymorefacepalmyou havent really been paying attention to any of the arguments about the posted graph have you well well see how ccp reacts when the subscriber numbers fall further and further away downwards from the almost constant growth line seen so far in the past 6 years or so of eve history except very recently
well ccp is doing something right because theyve had a steady increase in pop few dips here and there and they manage to do this without your input or knowledege so if i need advice on how to make or play a game ill defenite take ccps advice over yours srry if you dont like the game then leave noones forcing you to stay for such a stubborn critic you do seem to stick around alot why does it always seem the haters have the most passion about there causes while the other players are just enjoying the game
ccp was doing a lot of things just right past tense now ccp is only doing some things right  theyre doing the exact opposite of what they used to from a development focus standpointbecause of that shifted focus combined with underestimates of development time and pressure to release new stuff at the estimated deadline as opposed to when its ready to release quality has suffered and most of us have noticed itand the dips here and there are getting more pronounced and more frequent as of late  you do know how to read a graph dont you 
actually this is mainly due to them recognising the math of how their business workswhen they saw that their average retention was 7 months they started aiming at those 7 months average retention 7 months new subscribers are best found with big flashy expansions of hyperbol that never delivers new subscribers demand shallow new features to retain slightly longer subscriber count can be grown simply by decreasing churn for 79 month subscribers churn can be combated with higher signup rates and more advertisingfixing stuff that people only notice is broken after 7 months is pointless from their broken perspectivesomeone forgot to tell them how powerful word of mouth is spreadsheets tell you what you want to hear
supporting not telling me youre going to make me a lovely 3course meal of epic proportions and handing me a corn dog
akita t being one of the best market analysts ingame just hit the nail straight on the headnot hearing her call means wanting to hurt ones own stream revenue101 support
its not as if i have an issue with ccp fixing bugs and imbalances akita i can appreciate making something work better as much as the next personmy issue is with how youre going about it first youre a jerk i dont care how long youve been in eve theres no reason to be a jerk since it wont get you what you want fasterhow are you a jerk you ask see this thread for more details look at how you respond and approach ccp staff with your problems youre a smart ass and a smug jerk about it how can we trust you to champion a cause to ccp for us when you cant even act like an adult to ccpyou started this thread by saying  were patient we can waitwell then hurry up and wait and as far as quality goes buy yourself a bottle of chteau margaux 1995 and drink yourself into a coma then you wont care about anything anymore just like you think ccp doesnt
akita said it perfectly no surprise there  i wouldnt say ccp is in a downward spiral yet but they are getting very very close and need to clean up their act asap
all the little things that make the game fun are the ones that got me hooked years ago now broken and deserted to sit in the pile of to dos
i support this
i have to be a jerk about it because otherwise all of this will be swept quickly under a rugit will eventually be swept under a rug anywaysure yes we can wait as long as we are reasonably sure that eventually the things will be patched up and polished properlyright now we have no reason to believe that would ever be the case so just waiting is pointlessso yes i will be a jerk as long as i have to be for as long as possible
utterly supported
yes we wants
this is a bad trend line agree with akita the game needs iteration and polish more than new features

as you wish i do hope you succeed just remember that you get more flies with honey than with vinegar also remember that it isnt usually random ccp members who are responsible for the direction of the game so acting harshly towards them isnt always the correct course of action so be a jerk to the right people namely the ones making the decisions and not the guys just working 95 like we all do they have little to no control over what happensso to recap be mad you have a right to be in this case but take it out on the right people at ccpgood luck akita your success is our successsupported
supported not that it makes a difference as ccp stopped listening to its players a long time agoeg sanctum nerf which was a screw you approach to s system we worked hard to develop as a corp already our corp members are leaving on the hisec train would the last corp in 00 please turn out the lightsi cant remember the playerbase asking ccp to nerf 00 but they did it anyway i did however see the player base asking over and over to fix a hundred problems that are a real concern and guess what i have been getting my mmo kicks here in eve since beta i have brought dozens of new players to eve just by word of mouth and i am sure they in turn have brought new blood into the game it has been a sad thing though that for the last cpl of years i would advise anyone new to stay well away and after summer this year i too will be hanging up my eve hat as i have finally had enough of the new ccp
supported with the way eve is set up free download and trial word of mouth ingame and outofgame is going to be one of the biggest factors determining if new players decide to stay around and making sure all features are up to par instead of just adding new features and moving on to the next expansion is the way to get older players to tell newer players that eve is worth staying around for
actually that was repeatedly proven wrong you actually do catch more flies with vinegar try it yourself some time that was my point all along too if i failed to make it clear enough from the start id have to apologize and see what i can do to make it clearer earlieri still love the game i still love most of the devs i know anything about at ccp the problem i have is with upper management or more precisely with their development focus  schedule and the results it encourages
i generally agree with the op the trend to put out new shiny content in favor of that old stuff is worryingbut im glad that this seems to have been heard at ccp to a certain degreekeep on polishing the old stuff slow down on the new and shinyold and shiny can be quite cool tooi think the thousand papercuts are a good start so is the overhaul of the uii sincerely hope poses corp management and cosmos sites are on the list too
as you can see the official ccp position is that they are committed to excellencewho in here still believes that after the latest fiasco the general perception already was that ccp cares more for quantity than quality as of late and this is now more than ever obviousexpectation management can be improvedha 
there is no signs of excellence coming from ccp or eve currentlyrushed through crap that dosnt work or isnt wanted is not excellence

thanks but please put a check in the support box when you reply  you can edit your post to do this
l2closequotes bro your ocd coping problems arent the games problems suggesting pointless features whose only purpose is to satisfy your ocd cravings is pathetic and in no way helpful to anything admittedly my suggestions have been more then a little absurd and ridiculous theyre on the same level of pointless fringepandering stupidity as your original proposal if youd managed to fail to grasp the entirety of the sarcasm
id love to see this added but id prefer them to fix important stuff first faction warfare nullsec a sensible antiblob solution all manner of balance tweaks
this idea needs to be strongly put down because of reasons beloworiginally posted in a thread in general discussionstime dilation will not workformalizing lag as a game mechanic really that is really really the worst way possible of fixing the problem the problem of whoever brings the most wins thus making everyone blobing as big a blob as possible it will not fix the problem only easing the syndrome simply because of people will always try to bring as many as possible into the fight and the system will always be stretched outside its limit formalizing lag time dilation can ony ease out that much of lag and people will just keep bringing in more and more people until the server cannot afford the workload again moreover it simply sounds ridiculous and immersion breakinglag is a natural product of the current game design itself the fantasy of unlimited numbers of ship fighting together vs the realistic capabilities of the internet and the servers as long as bringing as many ships into the fight as possible means easier wins people will do it time dilation wont work instead ccp should think about the game design itself is the concept of an unlimited amount of ships fighting realistic perhaps 1000 vs 1000 will not be too different than 2000 vs 2000 simply because the screen and overview cannot contain that much information perhaps it is not 1000 but 500 how should we discourage people going over 500 maybe we can create some mechanisms to eliminate the advantages of bringing in more than 500 ships etc etc i am only illustrating an example i am sure there are better ideas than this one i am sure someone can think of many more better ideas but time dilation is the worst solution possiblelag cannot be solved only designed outlag will always be present as long as the mechanics do not change people will just bring in more and more until the server breaks even if the server can run 10x faster than now the game mechanics itself is to blame not the coding or network itself but it is relevant i think it is not a hard concept to understand the game mechanics simply need to be designed to accommodate realistic numbers instead of not limiting the number of ships on grid at all which simply encourages bigger and bigger blobs there should be at least some sort of discouragement of simply spamming quantity of shipsit is pretty stupid to be honest if not hard limits on the game itself max number of friendlies ongrid max number of ships doing effective dps to a target etc the game needs designed unlike the current no design design which will always always be broken by bigger and bigger blobs
awesomeidea
pretty much this  and if this restriction was put in place they might as well just limit the number of people in the system and skip this whole idea altogether
a simple yet beautiful solution great idea
this is certainly something i would prefer when time dialation gets to a certain level i would like to stress that jumping a new fleet into a system with time dialation in motion would still have lag from all the differing calls to the server needed it would affect the fleet jumping in most and not the fleet on grid so even with time dialation in effect theres a strategic decision to jump people into a system much like there is nowplz plz plz read the entire discussion before posting all of these have been discussed to an acceptable state so far
honnest to god read the whole discussion before posting if youre all for immersion the id have to say this a bit of eve fiction about titans was that a whole planets tidal forces were affected by merely the presence of a titan too close to a planet let alone 40 of them in the same system along with dozens of supers and 100s of carriers releasing insanely collosal amounts of energy in a struggle for domminence that level of activity and energy release would affect the fabric of space you could even say the mass of all of the ships on one grid would be soo collossal that itd cause a gravity well that woould cause a time dialation effect no sht you tell me in what situation in real life that wont occur my 5000 tank devision beats your 50 tanks seriously no way my 50 tanks should beat your 5000 tanks grr i hate the real world sum1 should change the way physics and logic works so that i have the advantage alwaysim sure your idea would work if no one had any vested interest in anything on this game but if that was the case then eve wouldnt be eve if the concept u want above is really the game u want i have a simple solution for you go play a single player game the fact 1000s of people appear in one system is because they all believe in the need to fight for a common goalthere is an upper limit to the amount of people that a finite sized group of individuals can call upon to fight for a common goal it wont scale to infinity and if you think it will then u should check urself into some form of commonsense clinic or failing that just announce yourself as clinicly insane as you seem to have the desire to be as absurd in your views as everyone else in those institutions
i think this is a interesting idea and worth trying
this is a mash of all the stupidest most unfounded arguments against time dilation first you mention that most incorrect and abhorrent of insidious fallacies the classic if you fix lag then people will just bring more this is beyond ludicrous it firstly assumes in these huge fights people are being held back to avoid lag when in fact as most alliance members will explain when high stakes are on the table they try to bring every single person they possibly can and secondly it acts as an argument against even fixing lag at all because the better the servers get at coping the more people will come so ccp may as well not botherthen you suggest a different solution perhaps an incentive not to fight in two huge fleets this is a good idea in itself but is not a reason not to try time dilation it is also an idea that should be discussed somewhere else as it is gameplayrelated and not relevant in addition large fleet fights are something intrinsic to eve that a lot of people are proud of and want to take part in we are all scifi fans who have seen it on tv and in movies why shouldnt we enjoy it in the best scifi multi player game that exists ccp agrees with this pointanother two points you make at the end of the first paragraph are that the idea sounds ridiculous and immersion breaking these are highly subjective and many will disagree with you also even if you are correct i know thousands of players who would put up with a little ridiculous immersion breaking if they thought itd let them control their ship and have it actually respond
very very well said hired goon and just fyi calathea sata is sooo obviously trolling on the eve general discussion expect the same here im sure sooo fail
many detractors seem to have the mistaken impression that these giant fleet battles are caused by sovereignty mechanics almost every single big fleet fight ive been in is caused by both sides springing traps on each other for instance one side will use a carrier as bait to trap a super cap once the super shows up they get tackled then they spring the trap however the super was also actually a trap and its support fleet jumps in from this point on it is little more than an escalation as both sides scramble to get additional forces on the field to prevent the destruction of the fleet they did not realize was at such a great risk this spirals out of control until the system ends up with 2000 pilotsmany of the huge fleets that jump in are reinforcement fleets called into a battle that was hanging in the balance
its so insane it might actually work i definitely endorse this productservice
say it all in the topic title i find it hilarious that the character creation date is called date of birth its like the character was born an adult with the knowledge of how to fly epic space ships this is a simple change to will change date of birth in character sheet  corporate member details  other areas to a little more reasonable date of certification or something to that effect date of birth is a real immersion breaker
may as well
supported better rp text
this should be easy to do as well i already suggested it in one of those thousand little things threads but i might as well support it for added visibility
makes sense
would be nice if they actually fixed the employment record as wellstill missing a year from mine
i think planetmoon size changes were great and honestly stations need that same love stations are small and in no way indicate by their size they could hold anything but a couple frigs in them as of now capitals looks ed coming out of a station with some love to stations it would be reasonable to get give that love to other caps and definitely super carriers need a big boost they need to be at least 75 of a titan in size no bs should look like its 75 the size of a carrier how the hell do all those fighters and drones fit in a carrier slightly over the size of a bshas the csm addressed this at all
i think its hilarious that my machariel is almost bigger than my archon and my archon is only marginally shorter than my nyx

would anyone use it if you can hide your characters corps wont ask for a custom api key in which you can hide potential spies if km is only available to full then i would suggest it be moved to limited then again if it was only km you are interested in then the kb site would only track that part so your assets and other stuff are still hidden really this also wouldnt work too well for programs like evehq as it would be requesting for information in which it wouldnt be available and since its only available for you to see again whats the point the only use i have ever seen for a full api key is for programs like evehq and evemeep i dont see any need for a custom key
well usually there are several people with access to the webserver and most ceodirectors dont want to give all of those people access to their api key people are using alts and giving them director access just to avoid giving their main chars full api to all the web developersit could also be used to give api access to your market items only to say evecentral and not give them full access to your contractsskillsetcand yes i think its important to keep the full api key for the reason you mentioned
im in one of the largest alliances in the game and they wont let me join their ops or include me in their reimbursement program because i only fly gallente ships when i asked about it they said that people like me are what is killing the alliance and ordered me to train for a different race
this is a simple thread to try and have the option of black hair returned to the caldari deteis bloodlinethis was an option that was available for the bloodline before the new incarna avatars were introduced and was a part of the sisi testing right up to the last release version the one that was deployed on tqfor those of you who are not playing caldari deteis i ask that you think before deciding doesnt effect me dont need to vote and lend your support to those who are in needmy hopes are that enough support generated here will allow the csm to present this to ccp and a future patch will give the deteis people the black hair dye they request
supporting my own idea
supported
not playing caldari deteis so doesnt effect me just kidding everyone even in the eve universe has a basic right to black hair dye supported
doesnt affect me sorry not a real gamebreaking issue many more important things to consider first
this first iteration is very limited supposedly by the summer we will receive many more options and many of the older options we had with the old character creator reintroducedthis first iteration was for everyone of all races and didnt have anything for particular races because it was initial release dont fret youll have your racial choices eventuallyill give you support anyhow despite knowing this isnt the final version of the cc
then i can only hope this will help to show the design team that deteis players do indeed want black hair and have it added to the summer update
watching forums and fanfest videos its apparent that csm is a bad thing even more so when ccp actually knows and regards some of them as friendshigher chance csm will support ccp intead of players if they are friends even more disturbing is that csm as meny others in the game supports only a few direction  pvp mining etc but not pure high sec pve  which means that ppl like me that rather play with ppl then against them and really hate pvp get beep over most of the times  every time  csm was put in place to allow ccp to know the players a little better but to date csm has never atleast it seems that way to me even responded to any ideas or questions in regards to any high sec pveer  100 they never commented me in any way or form which they will never do ive got so meny ideas and question but so far i think only like 2 of my posts remain of 10 the others have been removed despite no rules have been broken which makes it appear that ccpcsm does not want some questions to see the light of dayi say remove csm in favor in ingame voting and like limit the voting to 1 vote per email so that those of us with more then one account cant vote more
grr this post was supposed to be a reply to another topic but accidently became a topic on its own p
i assume you had the same objections to every other csm that existed yeah especially the ones which were composed primarily of highsec players or pve oriented players yeah you did take up this charge when pvp oriented players had no representation in the csm iterations in previous history because your argument here is based entirely on the idea that there should be fair and equal representation and not that because this particular csm doesnt represent what you think are the interests of your group that it is now somehow suddenly a broken institution this is what youre getting at yeah
i have said nothing about how the csm today or before was composed what type of member  have not and will not as i dont know and honestly dont care about that partwhat i did say is that for ccp to bring in friends as csm members can be somewhat of a scewed acti also said that i feel that what csm has taken up with ccp feels to a much larger extent oriented everywhere but high sec pve100 non pvpin addition i mentioned posts that were removed without any broken rules which in any case is odd and then i stated what i think whould be best for the player communityi was not directing anything towards our current csm but to all of those that came before as far as i know our current csm hasnt really had time to do muchi will say another thing yay post hasnt been removed and someone actually took the time to read and reply
what members of the current csm are friends of ccp
cant name names as i didnt hear any but i was watching the fanfest videos on youtube where it was mentionedit was in conjuction with the new csm however i cannot confirm it was about the new csm or about an old onebut which ever it was it feels not good
the csm is just a sounding board that ccp uses on occasion the majority of csm iterations have been either entirely or heavily majority pvehighsec interested entities especially the early onesthe more important issue is that regardless of who sits on the csm they still have no real power just like during the csm 1 elections many of us pointed out that no multi million dollar company is going to take direction from a handful of customerskeep in mind that ccp wants to make money keeping existing customers happy does that but bringing in more customers does it better especially when the majority of ccps customer base has been in eve long enough to run out of things to do
so you cant confirm if you actually heard or knew which is which and what is whatyou have no idea what former csms or current csms opposed your so called line of thinkingyeah nice waste of air and trolling that isif your going to oppose something put some backbone into it or walk awayno facts no background no proof waste of time
it certainly seems that you have no idea what the hell youre talking about
yeah
considering theres a patch notes link a little to the left on your screen and a general discussion and features and ideas board that ccp regularly checksno not really
thats just it its been active in the features and ideas board the issues and workarounds board as well as the general discussion board especially where a dev actually took the time to move it into the features and ideas board all of this and not one single actual response from the devs to show for it so yeah id say its an issue because they most certainly are not checking these things out regularly mind you people have been complaining about it since the patch went livealso the patch notes came only a bit before the patch went live but the features in question were never on sisi to be tested for such flaws and the 50fitting absolute limit was not clearly stated in the patch notes initially it seemed to imply that you would still be able to access clientstored fittings as before this was not the case at allif a dev had actually responded to the issue then i wouldnt have felt it necessary to bring it here to try to get the csms attention on the matter
absolutely supported thanks for checking out my thread on the features sectioni think part of it is very simply that the new forums are being switched back and forth and its hard to get any momentum going at the moment when dealing with people also going around and hitting in game locations about the topic will definitely generate interest if we could at the very least get a reliable forum to make this work on
wait so a little link means that you dont have to go through proper playing test and playing input about your features and you can just insert things that they supposedly want but cant be bothered to properly test before implementing because theyre trying to hard to stick to a schedule and making sure that somethings are done correctly and for the right reasons
i for one despise the damn thingim all in favor of backing up fitsbut for it to eat and consume and crash out my fits listseff thatsupported
how to hold them accountablecancel your subscription
i hate the freaking new fitting thing i have a load of fits now visible i have no idea wich are new old mine corpsthank you ccp for delivering something uselessedit supported
but i wont get my money back for the 60 day timecode that i bought and activated not long before ccp caused this whole snafu without warning which is exactly what this is so no cancelling my subscription will not hold them accountable unless i can get them to refund my money if i am in fact wrong about this please say so and point out to me where in the tos or eula it says this
you are preaching to the choir elfa your post is in agreement with what ive been saying im not the one complaining about or denying ccps ability to control the game im saying they have the ability have the responsibility to use the ability and will use the ability they have to preserve eve by doing whatever they feel is necessaryno group of players player advocates or single category of players is going to change thatwindjammer
 likemaybe ive just been on facebook too much but i wish eve forums had a like button
the new forums have a thumbsup button for posts or had before they died again
technically if thats the case they would also empty your wallet confiscate your assets imprison and possibly biomass you your corpalliance whom gave you material support would have its assets impounded wallet frozen locked out of markets and members arrested on sight but thats taking it too far both parts including yoursas game mechanic immediately warping in concord rr does make sense except it can be abused  when youre about to die for whatever reason have someone make the ultimate sacrifice to call in concord to save the dayitll need work supported in principle
ok first off concord has the same long distance travel drives as the jovian instant appearance into any place they just have to click the jump here button hence the delay till they show up but maybe the rr could come from the empires ships that are on station at every single high sec gatebut the rr by concord could only be in major hubs cause a super space force like them would want to protect the source of their incomes main source of income aka hubs and 10s9s would call for the rrthat would make sense for ccp to do in my opinionand also everything gets abused in eve some how eventually people always find a way to use something to their advantage its the way games workand most of u sound like a bunch of kids in middle school dissing some other kids idea grow up
1 same reason why their sentry guns dont rep a ship being illegally attacked in low secthey only punish not protect2 news flashkeeping a ship alive is what repping does derp 3 u want more realism okfor starters anyone who has ever illegally attacked a ship in low sec suffers the same sec penalties for all their alts after all criminals can use fake ids or high sec alts in this case and they can also operate under the front of a legal business high sec mining to support their illegal ways under the relative safety of the same concord theyre against when they pirate4 and the best part after all this u still call everyone else kids when they poke holes in your stupid notion of realism in a science fiction game5 oh and lets not forget that ure okay with abusingexploiting your own proposal but at the same time an existing and intended game mechanic is not okay just because u hate it6 therefore your proposal just all boils down to a modified quote of yours cause face itu just want more safety while ure hiding and collecting easy isk in high sec and still be able to pirate and get away from the same concord that u take for grantedbut plz continueid really love it to hear it
concord provides punishment not protectionrepping wont help anyway as now targets are oneshotted in most cases
yeah concord isnt ems
it was a good idea then it remains a good idea it is full expansion in size though so i doubt we will see it any time soon
i lold so hard i shartedtrue story
because the current low sec ghost town appeals to you
doesnt go nowhere near far enough though if low is to be synonymous with drugs then harvesting and production should be possible only in low  restricting usage beyond what is already in place is nonsensicallow should be the underbelly of eve with crime cartels smacking each other around for control
maybe a pos module such as a narcotics factory better ones available from angel cartel etc or were you thinking of lowsec stations having drug refinery services in them
because its the above mentioned plan or nothing
id rather see more sweeping strokes for low tbqh i dont think the drugs alone are enough to change it still any change is good change if it makes players reconsider their playstyle and opens new avenues for profitpvp
null sec corps and thier altsalt corps supporting passive isk generation and sov like mechanics in low secdetails at 11
have it so the refineries can be killed then passive income goneedit also there was no sov like mechanic its just whoever makes the spice controls the universe i mean whoever makes the drugs reaps the profit
im sure after incarna to match the amazing characters that we will be walking around with they will work on ships once they fix incarna
i agree at least edit them in so we have a little more variety
right it couldnt be that much more effort to open up the scripts to allow the newer models into play sure some adjustments to ai and such may be needed but overall it would add just a bit more variety
wait higher tiers of ships are not in missions no drakes myrmidons hyperthrons or the likenow that i think about it i cant remember if i have seen those in missionsthose ships are pretty ancient they were not new when i first started the game i am not even sure the lot of tech 2 was either
its interesting since no1 of import ever seems to reply to anything
why is it csm feel they can delete all evidence of their actions is debate so dangerous for the community authority may not be challenged  i call censure a vast majority of csm voted no to a hybrid balance despite widespread recognition of this problem among playersthey argue that no concrete proposal could be presented to ccp why is it they feel they can only vote yes to detailed proposals  is it fair to demand the community develop the solution i say they should demand ccp do what we pay them for and that is to developcsm overrate their own importance if they think their job is to present ready made solutions and all ccp has to do is implement their job is to point the way not paint the whole map
hybrids will be balanced soon enough right now lag is on the agenda
a lot of topics are on the agenda not just lag hybrids are pretty essential for those who have no other weapons caldari for example get rockets fixed and they have missiles gallente have blasters and rail both need a checkup see the problem
i exclusively fly gallente for now and yes i see the problem however there are issues that are more pressing and it is never a good idea to have only one weapon system trained anyway if you are a gallente pilot like me try going with projectiles or now works surprisingly good on some ships the myrm in particular of course hybrids will have their day soon enoughedit and yes this is horizonist posted with pricechecker alt by mistake
seems to me it should make most sense to use the appropriate weapon system on race ships why would you think its never a good idea to train only one can you use more than one at a timedoes it not strike you as absurd that hybrids suck so bad its better to use arty and projectiles on gallente shipsyour solution to the hybrid problem is dont fly with hybrids seems to me you only illustrate the pressing need for a change
i agree on all points hybrids are horrible especially in comparison to projectiles which to add injury to insult do not consume cap i was not offering a solution simply a patch for gallente pilots until ccp chooses to fix hybrids for us training projectiles is a good move for future crosstraining anyhow
ccp and or csm pulled a cowardly stunt by stomping on free debate ccp should move all development to china and the forums along with it im sure they know all about censure out there
i am bumping this rather old thread to see if there has been any traction to this ideain short its a distress beacon feature which allows each ship to launch a distress beacon in case of emergencies which last for a minute or two appears on a system overview and will also send an alert to your corp or alliance teammates in system depending on the players personal settingsthe response i received when i first posted this was quite positive of course its not completely watertight as there are some concerns around abuse systemplayer load or whether this is superseded by other workarounds someone mentioned fleet based alertingessentially this feature is not for fleets its for independent travellers moving through space that need assistance it allows someone to be the herovillain in the game a little more often it should be present on all ships it should have a charges that can be purchased in the market and there should not be more than 1 per ship yes it can be used by pirates to spring traps etc there can also be rules around its deployment for instance it would only be viable in lowsecnullsec space which would allow corps and alliances to more effectively police their systemsso i am reposing this to seek a positive response from the csm to put forward to ccp for reviewkind regardsoriginal post followsi posted something like this a couple of years ago on one of the forums and it seemed to get a general nod so i have decided to step up and submit something to the council for their opinion on thisbackgroundi run a multi national multi timezone multi language and multidexterityie some diasabled corp now some of us are very good at typing in english but for the most part there are varying degress of this alot of my members also dont have the benefit of using teamspeak or eve voice et al due to a numebr of factors and reasonswe also work in nullsec and lowsec systems this puts a number of my members at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to being attacked as they sometimes find it difficult to communicate quickly what it happenning and where they areso one thing that might be able to work to give an edge is the ability to trigger a distress call to alert corpmatesalliance members or others in the system that you are under attack andor need assistancethe concept setupa player can customise how their distress call works this can be done at a ship level or a player level still undecided essentially there are three options i have thought of1corp alert2system alert3alliance alertyou also have the option to receive or ignore distress calls based on the three opions above mechanicsyou are under attack and you want to trigger the distress signal this can take the form of right clicking on your ship and selecting send distress call or a hotkey depending on your preferences and the preferences of others the distress call will be then sent outother players who have opted to receive the signal will get a dialog box on their screen similar to the downtime countdown box informing them of the person who triggered the alert and the system where the alert was triggered the location of where the distress was triggered will be warpable and will display on the pilots overviewbut only for those who have opted to receive the signal in the first place this will allow pilots to move as quickly as possible to their comrades to provide assistanceobviously there are a number of things that need to be reviewed such as whether to expand this feature to include blues on your likes list whether agressors will have this feature as well how to avoid people crying wolf preventing abuse network and bandwidth overheads etc however considering the wide diversity of players that play eve i believe this will be a welcome feature for all players as long as the paramaters and rules of its use are balancedthoughts anyone
btw if you go to evesearchcom and search for distress signal feature you will find the complete thread cant repost it herethanks

i would like to see what ccp does with this idea could create epic stories
i like this idea i would alter it a little though 1 id have it create a warpable beacon viewable to all in local 2 id have it automatically put your name corp ship type and system into local corp and alliance this provides just enough information to get people interested and by having a warpable beacon you create all sorts of potential traps as well as create a bonefide mechanic to get help
bigger balls lol originally posted in features and ideas but i will just go ahead and post it hereheres an ideamake every ships destiny ball the invisible balls of physics collision bigger so ships cannot blob without creating a distance between the ships eg frigates will be 1km in radius cruisers 2km battleships 4km titans 64km perhaps a blob of frigates will therefore be ships 2km apart from eachother minimum a blob of battleships 8km from eachother a blob of titans 128km from eachother the distance will always depend on the smaller ship so a frigate can be 2km from a battleship a battleship can also go next to a frigate until 2km smartbombs or bomber bombs will then need corresponding balancing of causethe distances here are only an example for illustration purposes it can be smaller or biggerthis way blobing will actually require more skills how to distribute ships to ensure they can all get optimal ranges ties well with formations too think about form into a concave arc so everyone is 30km from the target for example how to distribute several rrs over the entire blob to cover everyone how frigates can fill into the void between bigger ships to do additional damage etc etc i think the potentials of this idea is brilliant i think this is an elegant solution without breaking immersion and will actually improve the fun and skills of gameplay this is much better than time dilation in my opinionthe rp explaination would be ships collision in space is fatal to the structure thus gravity emitters are installed on each ship to avoid other ships or astroids coming into contactthis ties well not only with formation this ties will with the borked ship sizes as well  if implemented we can see bigger capital ships that are true to their original sizes ships no longer collide into each other breaking immersion instead it would be the gravity field that is bumped isnt it just elegantthis would be an better alternate to the idea time dilation which i think will never workthe reason it fixes lag is because bigger blobs no longer have so much of their current advantages and fighting in blobs will now actually require skillz and that itself would be the penalty to ship numbers the distances created between ships will form a natural barrier to bigger numbers unless you are will to spread your ships into a thinner arc for examplenew things can get tied into this as well new leadership skills  fleet formation v reduce the gravity fields of the ships in fleet by 3691215 so more ships can squeeze in a tighter space for example
the reason it fixes lag is because bigger blobs no longer have so much of their current advantages and fighting in blobs will now actually require skillz and that itself would be the penalty to ship numbers the distances created between ships will form a natural barrier to bigger numbers unless you are will to spread your ships into a thinner arc for examplenew things can get tied into this as well new leadership skills  fleet formation v reduce the gravity fields of the ships in fleet by 3691215 so more ships can squeeze in a tighter space for exampleedited into op
is this not an issue for guns that work under 4km in cruisers like blasters they are already pretty poor surely this will completely kill them
the numbers in op is just an illustration perhaps they are too large 500m 1000m 2000m might be more realistic numbers they will of cause need finetuning
i think that would stress the physics engine a lot when someone in the middle of a large fleet goes mwd everyone will start bouncing around like crazy when caps warp together and end up inside each other the game hiccups when they burst apart what you are suggesting could easily be used to bring down a node
i think youre approaching this from the opposite direction of where you should beturn off the bump let ships collide and damage one anotherdamage to each ship would be based on their total resistance to all 4 types of damage though em would be a small contributor in this multiplied by a factor which is correlated to the ships mass an errant frigate would be a puff of smoke on the side of a titan and a lot of laughing on ts3 but a tier iii battleship colliding with a freighter would be fairly devastating to both pilots the battleship totally destroyed the freighter not far from itand there you have it the more pilots in the fleet the higher the chances youll see them destroying one another before you ever engage them
so when people undock at jita everything is constantly exploding hilariously good plan i would personally sit in a heavily tanked ship right at the undock and have a bunch of alts repping me
you sir have an excellent plan
sonerf blasters loworbit frigates and make bumping easier
so you want ships to be 64km away from a titan and how do you propose jump bridging would work or even corp hangarship hangar access to work if so far from the capitals or hell even logistics would have trouble being so far spread apartit would only reduce lag by the fact everyone would quit the game the next day as that just kills any sense to do that if their invisible bounce ball is that big itll collide with other ships and  will just bounce all over the place maybehopefully you explained it wrong but the way you did it means the physical bounce area of a ship would be gigantic this would not fix lag it does not put less stress on the node the grid or anything it just forces people to smash their faces into their keyboards and quit eve im sorry if this sounds like a flame but it is honestly a horrible horrible idea and i cant fathom why or how you could come up with this idea with what logic to support this idea that it really would help reduce lag if you limit the number of which people can fight you are basically saying that a few amount of people get to fight while the rest can go  themselves thats a very lame idea you might as well also suggest getting rid of clone upgrades that it will help reduce lag because it will thin the crops out blobs are here to stay because thats how ccp designed it to alter it would change gameplay a great deal and the object of improving a game is not to change the game so much that its a different game but to improve on the small details to make gameplay better
in shortfrigate in fleet means everything 2 km from each othereverything larger then a cruser cant get into a pos that has modules inside floatingjumping trough a wormhole wouldnt couse problem becouse everyone sitting there wouldfly off with 999999 mswonderful ideame not likey
it is ed that the hand holding risk averse high sec dwellers make more money per hour than those willing to risk 00 in any sense level 4 missions should be moved to low sec and 00 should get uning nerfed instead of making 00 a desolate wasteland of space make people want to fill every damn systemthen again moving level 4 missions would have high sec dwellers crying to the high heavens that they might actually get shot at once in a while dont even talk about ganking in high sec if you dont want to get blown up dont spend 3 billion on a ship to do level 4s 30 seconds faster and expect to be perfectly safeedit also deklein is one of the riches regions in the game when all things considered so all of this talk about fighting for better space is irrelevant there isnt betteralso i do have a supercapital class vessel and i log in maybe once a week to that account because it is so boring to fly who knew my space  is bigger than yoursedit 2 why is retarded filtered that is plain stupid
i skipped through most of the replies as its the typical person who smokes eve as a joint and believes getting high on eve just so they can be like zomg this isnt wow yu n00b gtfo this is ceriouz  its a game not a job not everyone has 5 hours a day to make isk some people just wanna get on and pvp and if they pvp all the time theyll eventually lose a ship insurance isnt going to help much checking the recent report only 11 of the population lives in null 7 in low and 2 in wh rest are carebearing their asses off in high make null have lotsa money avaible to be made then thatll get more people to move out there and that means more money to buy ships which means more people to shoot at thus the circle of life of eve continues and instead of shrinking it grows iirc thats what ccp wants is for more people to blow  up cause that keeps the game going and yes if people want the money they are most likely to look into bots itll be safe in the crappy systems since no one travels through there much just like half of drone space so less threat  more desire in using bots
ooh i got another idea against supercap proliferation without hurting peoples ability for small scale pvp since that is the main effect of the anomaly nerf how about we make supercaps very expensive then there will never be more than a few in eve at a time am i doing this rightserious it is not freaking rocket science supercaps are solo pwnmobiles especially on a strategic level but pretty much on every level they are just the best ships in every possible situation they dont have a counter and can single handedly whipe out much larger fleets if they dont have similar number of supercaps now what should be clear for those with some common sense or who read the topic making supercaps more expensive either by making them more expensive or by nerfing income will do nothing against the need to have tons of them while malcanis is right never thought i would say that it is a chicken egg problem that doesnt matter you need more supercaps than your opponents to beat themkeep your space the more unrealistic you make it obtaining them by legit game mechanisms the more you are promoting the less legit game mechanisms botting everything that makes it harder to get supercaps is a direct boost to cheaters botters two solutions against it either make it easier to get supercaps while it is more fair everyone in a supercap doesnt sound like the ideal situation although eve is heading in that direction anyway or stop supercaps from being solo pwnmobiles now i know there is always someone who complains about that since solo supercaps are no problem to counter with 20 correct ships on your side but that is pretty much the definition of a solo pwnmobile needing to outnumber them 201 to kill them
you guys are debating about your personal hart behaviours instead of focus the main post that i do agree the title is mehthe fact that rating income changes touches more players than boters is not fair and i cant see how you guys can think for a second that asmall group raters will pay himself caps just by killing some ratsdont misunderstand me i read your post and saw that you are not happy that now you need more caps to kill commander stuff so what im pretty sure there are some specialised in commander stuff but those cant be assimilated to boters so where is the trouble guys your trouble is that they can pay themselves ultra gimped supercap tbh why the end game stuff should only be available to some guys when those same some guys are the ones who mostly pay their sub with plex buyedoffered by corps making gazillions per month i cant agree with this and tbh that makes more cap stuff to kill and lootnow to get back to your threads title i dont think this will change something for botters why should itevery one know the most efficient bots are the ones who do simple tasks and the botter type is the same no matter the game resources like minerals plants or whateverin this game this means iceore mining clouds harvesting now maybe there are a few ones doing more complex tasks but start by doing something randomly changing in mining sessions or every 30min at the server level so they cant adapt but the player even if afk 85 canby the way if ccp really wants to get rid of them all they have to do is to download them and see how they work to counter them and nobody will make me believe they dontedit dont touch that stuff they already screwed dreads and bss are just good to bubble by big numbers kill pve stuff or bump other ships trying to dock
your clumsy attempt to switch the focus of discussion from ratting to buy a fleet battleship to ratting to buy a supercarrier is noted nice try though
i agree with topic starter it seems pretty dumb to try and get more people into the end game content having the it be marginally better then level 4s in empire nerfing so it is worseconquerable space is the selling point of the game ever see a eve video championing living in empire and running level 4s in npc corpsnull sec should be able to sustain more having more resources instead of a finite amount compared to the infinite that can come from empire the player base of the game keeps rising how can null sec sustain more when belt ratting in systems is the only income one can find assuming one isnt already doing it with the respawn rate i would guess most whole systems at most can sustain one individual doing it at the same time so their you have it the vaunted thing people championing what others can go back to can at most sustain in a region alliance of a paltry hundreds in a game with hundreds of thousands of accountsputting aside any debates on what people should use for fleets or what they do with the isk players should be commonly be able to get in basic 00 ratting double that they get in empire missions the odd rarity of exploration sites that are not gavemetric even more on top of that null sec should be better to start with not just having a heads up with stuff elsewhere after being upgradedhaving null sec be valued differently isnt itself a bad idea but all of it should have value more so then any level 4 huball in all the basis behind the nerf are about as poorly thought out as the new forums serious rear admirals seem to be in charge i would hate to say it but with some of the stuff being pushed out and the results the game might be better without expansions
currently when you decide to export a fit to xml the export box automatically has every one of your saved fits checked by default for export can this be switched to the opposite when trying to play eft warrior god youre forced to uncheck all of the other fits you have saved in order to export a single one it would be so much easier if by default there were no fits preselected rather than all of themi understand the idea was to backup all of your fits offline in case you had to reinstall but with all fittings saved server side i think the check boxes should be alteredthanks
supporting my op
alternatively simply export all your fits and only import one of them this be whats i does
aaa defending their bots
i love that imagine how angry the botters would be lolif they had to reposition or reprogram every patchoh oh oh make it so every account has to be set individuallyactually  make the windows open in different positoins every timeor randomly move slightly from time to time that would bugger a bot easyi could live with the slight inconvieiance
i really wonder what would happen to the market resources and economy if all the bots got banned it would become like waterworld youd be recycling your own 
like bootini id rather not trust ccp to shepherd my files these guys cant even port open source forums without falling on their face
ea bought westwood then they took earth and beyond and rammed it down the ter just because blizzard has wow doesnt mean they can do any good it would shortly become a game of merchandise where you can pay lots of cash to make your ships look pretty and then you wont lose ships theyll go to a magical ship yard to respawn then theyll have annoying really small scaled pvp that involves at most 25 people sov claiming will change to sitting with your thumb up yer ass for 5mins in a system do i need to go on itll be hell and wouldnt work at all please never make anymore suggestions without at least thinking about it for a minute
i concurbad idea
to the op gtfo
gaaaaaaaaaaaaaabe
give it to ensemble studios  oh  wait 
regardless of this if there was a way to view ban history all characters on an account get a strike in the window it might make finding botters easier for ganking which would be beneficial have the ban linked to the character as wellfor viewing not the actual ban and people might be less inclined to purchase the character which would be increasing a botters incomeso mine isnt for transfering bans into characters but to show a character was on an account that was banned ganking botters is a pretty fun past time and if i can check local for targets in this manner would make this job pretty fun
i am glad a fellow fw member came in here to shoot down an idea that would help fw instead of keep it in the state it is in now1 to the op
supported im not sure if your ideas on how to solve the fw situation would be the most optimal as im not really a fw player but i think fixning fw needs to get the csm and ccps attention as it is a well advertised future off eve and is or could be one of the best forums to get new pilots into pvp
supported this might be or might not be the solution for fw the most important thing is that something gets changed now
noit is a hodgepodge of random code from all over the place and is unimaginative in its implementationthere is no fix for fw beyond a complete revamp of pretty much all mechanics involvedwe need fw mkii not fw ver 11
because his suggestions wrt plexing and mission running wouldnt help fw imo the other suggestions would
i dont think fw missions should be nerfed however i think there are many mechanics in fw that can be changed to promote more of the pvp that fw was supposed to havei agree there should be lp rewards for all involved in a kill whether its like kbs point system or whatever only problem i see if people making a fw trial alt and putting him in a t1 frigate and and continually insuring the ship and having said players main blow it up over and over again for the lp and all the isk to replace the ship maybe a way to combat this is only one kill on a character per 24 hour period would give lp  because its much more arduous to make 100 trial accounts a day and thus far in my fw experience i dont kill the same people multiple times a day oftenalso would a bounty reward system on wts be capable no million isk bounties but at least something of course there would have to be some method like the one above to circumvent exploitationalso invading and taking over a system should be more exciting how i dont know so i am not much help on that front  however there should be more of a reward for owning systems such as agents in the stations flipping and becoming available to the sov owners of the system a fed agent would now become a state agent  but i dont know how well that would do in terms of rp componentheres my most controversial point it involved a two step process1 demote everyone ouch  make ranks only available through killing wts and make them much more difficult to obtain possibly make a monthly quota of wts needed to kill to retain certain ranks such as the top 32 give a daily pay to militia men who were actively involved in pvp as in killed or lost a ship based on rank this payment should be either isk or lp but probably not both id rather see isk to replace ships and ammo but i could see ccp wanting lp instead as they want to produce more sinks rather then faucets3 pay would be based off a multiplier for owned systems and rank mildly this would make other militias to want to attack and take over systems resulting in higher daily pay for them also doing these attacks would result in pvp which would help to bring them up the rankshairbrained possibly  but  it would result in more militia pvp

recently there have been a lot of patches sometimes 2 extended downtimes per weekthis is a problem if you are in the asiaaustralasia time zones as these occur during our prime timethe current situation is resulting in several daysmonth without the opportunity to play eveand ccp arent providing notice of the extended downtimes like they used to so we cant plan for it and are wasting time  moneytherefore ccp should either revert to doing a single large quality patch and update taking the game offline for a day every few months if necessary or move the extended downtimes around a little so they arent always occuring at the same time of the day
this is urgently needed anything to lessen the clickfest
1being able to monitor planets through the api would be very helpful
agreed what they said there are at least three separate threads going about issues with the new fitting system and how it went straight to release with precisely zero opportunities for player testing and feedback on sisi beforehand
actually no i dont hate csm 6 at all i rather like the mittani for some strange reason despite not knowing how to spell his name properly i also voted for him seleene is also a good choice as a former dev and wormwood isnt bad either sorry i mean trebor jk im having a bit of fun with that anyway trebor is not my ideal choice him having served in the last csm with not really impressive to me results yes the character creator could use some work but i dont consider it a top priority less something to get obsessive about he had me very suspicious with the way he persued that whole thing ill admit perhaps even a little paranoid at his overindulgent seeming obsession with the whole thing then when just days after parts of his ideas got implemented in a patch the annoying isk mongers started to proliferate local and rookie chat again i began to see directions for my paranoia to take he was helping the other side deliberately infiltrating the csm to get his filthy paws on nda material and code and using it to generate spambot programs that used the new character generation interface and reinstated the annoying old standard of filthy debris in rookie chat and other channels rmts everywhere crooned with joy at the new pets trebor had made themokay maybe not but it was a thought then i found out he was an anime fiend and everything was explainedyou see i used to know a few anime fiends they were horribly obsessed with the whole anime gendre and couldnt keep away from mind altering chemicals at work or at play they were generally mimicking anime characters while under the influence of various chemicals i was fortunate enough to often be there immediate supervisor and have the pleasure of attempting to get them to do work not to say trebor is one of these sorts of individuals or even uses mind altering chemicals but memory of such things has traumatized me greatly i will never look at anime the same again actually i never really liked anime since the first toaster was invented and children everywhere drooled over colorful cartoons and brney singalongs have i been this way i mean nevermindtruth video games on consoles when i was a kid about 1213 before i played my first one werre very cool and a completely new experience for me having had nothing but a handful of hours to play montezumas revenge and car wars on an old apple ii e beforehand that was brief as my brother hogged the thing and newver really let me use it car wars was great though colecovision and pong there was that toothen after a few years of shinobi and various other games on friends consoles i got my own nes and began to play rpgs which i really liked at the time one day when i was about 16 they introduced a new game for consoles i had a sony playstation at the time and it contained anime it was perversely lacking in any real content puzzles or involvement aside from clicking buttons repeatedly the world of strategy rpgs was gone and replaced with shinobilike clickies i might as well have been playing street fighter for all the good it did me no longer did games contain the investigative storyline which drew me in it had been replaced by flash pizazz and anime action adventures i was boredthat pretty much ended console games for me aside from mech warriorlike games such as armored core semirealistic racing car games with some semblance of physics like gt3 and jet fighter piloting games like ace combat 4 good games in their own right anime had killed the majhority of my interest in sitdown video games however and as a result silly looking oversized swordguns included ive never really liked itthen theres samurai movies i knew this guy once
some people seem to just call him mittensill admit that by this point i was thinking this sounds like a glenn beck conspiracy theory but then i readand i was all what were we talking about again
we took our own initiatives and maintain constant communication in order so that were all informed about what were doing and how we address things
big coalitions will practice small gang warfare only for fun but when  hits the fan the batphone will ring and blobs will form only small independent entities will fight in small engagements for their life but small independent entities cant survive in nullsecthe problem is that living in conquerable space requires a pos or an outpost and you need a blob to defend these structures against another blobtherefore we need small objectives for small gangs but we even need small cheap and hard to spot structures as a logistical backbone for small independent entities in 00 possibly a new kind of safety in space should be designed not based on effective hit points and reinforced states but on invisibility and cheapness
why not smallish player owned stationsmodsthings to destroy that can be hidden behind invulnerable playerplaced warp gates as in mission style that limit the size of the ship that can move through or even the number of ships that can move through per hour
if you cant find small scale fights to satisfy your ehounoure bs then youre not trying very hard
the csm personally destroyed the new forums you heard it here first folks
1i already allowed 3 of my accounts to run out last month the only thing that has been keeping a lot of accounts active including mine is the training skills this game keeps subscribers for one reason over all others skill advancement and hopebelief

guys i feel your pain i truly truly do eve has been ruined for you you see no value in this game and therefore you want to leave but why leave without sending a message seeing as you see no value in this game you must also so no value in your assets however in that you are mistaken i am here to provide your assets with value the final message of disdain for eve that you can send to ccp is through publicly abandoning your assets and isk to me send them to me and i will start a thread with your player name and details of the abandoned assets which will surely create a strong message for ccp show them you mean business send me your isk your ships your stockpiles i will bear the burden of all of them and make sure that your clear dislike of the game is heard throughout new eden these pixels mean nothing to you let me give show you one last moment of value for themedit if you are willing to hold your ground with me then bully to you but for all those that have made their public proclamations of abandonment i submit to you the following service which is outlined above

i can only agree to akita while i still think incarna at least is a good thing it shouldnt come at the cost of the rest of the game being neglected take people from wod to work on incarna dont take them from eve  were paying for this game not the other twoand the most important thing when the marketing department starts to have a say in game design fire them too many developers have been ruined by people pretending to know about games by quoting market data i really dont want ccp to be one of them
common sense proposal is common sense
the argument here isnt that suicide ganks arent fun or that they shouldnt be allowed the issue is that if you rob a bank and get caught you dont get to keep the money suicide ganking which breaks the law in high sec should come with a price and that price is not being reimbursed for an illegal activityyou want to break the law and lose your ship fine if its worth it for the vendetta kill or loot drop then by all means but no reimbursement through insurance if concord has to destroy your vessel it should also void your insurance contractthink of it as another much needed isk sink added to eve
he isnt trying to express a position elfa hes trying to elicit emotional response hes a griefer thats what they do some might think that allegation is an insult but it isnt and it isnt intended to be mits enjoys causing grief brags about causing grief and claims to be a sadist hes actually very honest in this regardwindjammer
1 u just filled in your own blanks so theres your answer and u can add sec status penalty and kill rights to that as well 2 news flashcriminals regularly break the law in low sec and can use fake ids high sec alts and operate under the front of a legal business high sec mining to fund their illegal activities on one identity they stay relatively safe under concord and at the same time theyre deemed criminals on the other so for even better isk sinks whats better than restricting all 10s alts only to where theyre allowed to be or better yet void insurance completely for everyone
and for the nth time its fine to make the laws in hisec more realistic but the net effect would be and youre well aware of this also be to make it safer as long as this is balanced by making the law enforcement more realistic as well then no problemo
that doesnt make any sense at all i didnt vote for him but i still agree with his position on this furthermore ccp arent going to make a change even one as sensible as this just because the csm chair tells them to do you think you might be taking things a bit to personally i think i have a spare level 80 tinfoil hat if you think its some kind of conspiracy suicide gankers should get zero insurance payout
thats further down on the agenda lets not get ahead of ourselves
ok folks you want more realistic law enforcement how about this instead of concord destroying your ship they arrest you and confiscate your ship basically after your arrest you would find yourself in your pod docked at the concord outpost station for whatever system you were arrested in there would be one per system you would be free to go right away but to get your ship back you would have to pay a fine equal to whatever the average regional price is for the ship that was confiscated equipped modules would stay equipped and not be counted in the cost of the fine if you dont have the money to get your ship out of impound 5 of the fine will be added to the fine every day until you do you would receive the same concord standings penalty as beforethis idea solves several issues makes things more realistic  negates the insurance mess costs more to the ganker to retrieve his ship but allows him to keep the modules he paid for this allows for gankers to equip more expensive modules to their ships allowing for greater alpha without having to worry about losing them as long as they can afford to get their ship out of impoundcreates a larger isk sink by forcing players to pay large amounts to concord instead of just putting insurance payouts back into the economythoughts

l2closequotes bro your ocd coping problems arent the games problems suggesting pointless features whose only purpose is to satisfy your ocd cravings is pathetic and in no way helpful to anything admittedly my suggestions have been more then a little absurd and ridiculous theyre on the same level of pointless fringepandering stupidity as your original proposal if youd managed to fail to grasp the entirety of the sarcasmare you still here haha noone cares what you have to say
you are quite right there are several more important issues that need to be addressed however since those have been covered by other threads i chose to address this one thank you for your comment
of course im still here i assume youre old enough to have a firm grasp of object permanence but i may be wrong if youd failed to notice the excessively lackluster support for your idea apparently scarcely anyone cares what youve got to say either yet at least it lends me some mild entertainment
but well uh okactually best idea thus far supported

pointless interference my character is born an adult every time it dies an adultgo break your own immersion some place that might matter

then i suppose you would agree to having your date of birth changed each time you are vat born you werent vat born with the knowledge of being a pod pilot nor with any of the other skills your character started out actually being born and having a normal life until you decided to go for the capsuleer training which is when in your characters life history you started the game thus this proposal makes absolute sense since we arent being born into the game we are being certified as a pod pilotshould be an easy fix too just a matter of changing some text1 supported
nice
i like the born on date more we are not still human they toil they get old and sick they diewe dont get sick we dont get old we dont get hurt we have wealth beyond what they can ever dream of we can store massive volumes of information in our headswe simply arewhen we became capsuleers we become something new and whatever you want to call it we are no longer human our born on date is simply when we became what we are now
i think the date of birth is the date we became a pod pilot ie immortal it was our date of birth at which point we ceased to have the ability to perminantly die barring a bad accident with the cloning

make them bigger supercarrier though is a fine name assault carrier just reminds me of this 
ill support this because realism is affected by this classs model size
im sensing a lot of peepee size insecurity in this thread say it aint so guysa man shall not be judged by the size of his ship but by the content of his carrier
i bolded your points in particular that i agree with  the ones in italics made me go wtf initially but i think that it could make for an interesting subdivision of skill training however i believe that this latter point is probably beyond the purview of my thread thanks for your comment
ccp  flawedcsm serves one function to act as a buffer to the general discussion forumthis keeps bad publicity from the eyes of potential new customersdont believe mewatch the 50 page threads go for months without responsethen watch the same thread get a quick patch within 2 days on general discussionnothing but a way of hiding bad publicity and very very occasionally a source of free labour
much like your postingthe csm is a good thingtm getout
yeah
the mittani is on what appears to be good terms with ccp and seleene is fairly in there i dont see how it matters though csm will do csm things ccp will do ccp things why should it matter if they are friends that should only help things really ccp is quite competent when they put their collective minds to it and had brought us this much of eve with or without csms involvement how much effect csm has had to date is debateable which is why i say thatdont worry about itedit ccp devs seem to be a bit bloodthirsty and trollish so youre actually kinda right about the pvp thing still they realize that the game isnt just pvp and they have more than one crowd to please just look at incarna for completely nonpvp oriented expansion content in a lot of cases it seems pvp griefers gankers and trolls would be perfectly happy with mud if it afforded them the same carebear tears overall a lot of them were furious over incarna and the work on the character creatorccp will do what they want with a minimum of encouragement from the community and some mind to the response to brainpooling with csm end result is eve is ccps brainchild not ours and theyll do what they want with it in a way thats how it should be and i support them in that decision for the most part they havent truly disappointed me thus far so why shouldnt i sure i got my things modular pos structures with a much simpler interface 3d interaction with the pos in overlay mode allowing greater control over many features in building operating and maintaining a pos  a minimalized hud which allows for better functionality in combat situations or even other areas even the possibility of optional hud environments would be cool better research and manufacturing with the ability to modify bpos or make your own a bit involved in the number process but perhaps an approval system could be worked out where completion is partially a petition process that ccp has to approve grant success beyond simple ratios and random numbers importantly this one would allow for modifications within set parameters reduced times on research and better invention methods more control over reverse engineering more t3 ships and updates on a lot of the older ship models like we saw with the caldari scorpion some level of ship customization ship rebalances and additional classifications more effective industrials an in game voting system with the release of incarna or shortly after we could use this to vote for not only yes or no questions from ccp to the playerbase but csm candidates for future csm elections greater exposure through these and billboard advertising additional levels to player communication and organizations secret organizations and the means of layering them over and through corps and alliances a member is a member wherever they are api enhancements that make the former possible even with the release of a full api etc
wouldn that be a good thing having csm and ccp as friends rather than enemiesbeing friends  makes for a better working relation between ccp and csm which is passed down to player being enemies  makes for a bad relationship between ccp and csm thus ideas that csm have will get ignoredsome people really need to grow a brain cell and grow some balls and post with their main
this thread is nothing more than a personal attack on nc and goon perpetrated by someone who has undoubtedly been anal probed or butt secksed by them before and is now angry that they hold a majority on csm6if not then why hasnt the ops valiant opinion popped up in previous csmsyou have something against the nc ad goon op get in a ship ingame and handle your business like man instead of cluttering up the forum with tear threads disguised as ingenious ideas

ccp doesnt listen to csm and will only listen somewhat if they are supporting an idea they are considering to doin other words the csm is just for show to make us think we have a say in how the game workseditthough the idea is nicemaby give low sec some super valuable gas clouds
having read the article i would love to see something like this happeningi have dabled a bit in drugs and plan to do more with it when i get back to eve in fuller swing than the activity level i have nowim mainly an industrialist and a blockade runner i generally dont go out of my way to hunt people as pirates do but when action comes my way i wont back down from it my first exploits in low sec and drug manufacture were interesting and quite profitable id love to be able to crank that up and get it into full swingthe biggest issue i had with it was getting the gas in the first place while its about 50 of the income generated from the whole manufacturing process harvesting gas was always a pain the good gas is out in sovspace not in low sec ive even considered setting up a 1 man corp and go out to sov space to see if i can set up a drug lab over there renting from the local overlords  this idea is still very bright in my mind low sec really needs a boost and having something like it being the place to make drugs as well as a semisov system with the corruptionvigilanty thingy in place would be totally awesome
after skimming the first 23s of name dropping i finally got to the actual mechanics they are pretty bad both sides are trying to swing the corruption level here is what he writesbut pve impacts corruption level at a much slower rate than pvp as the corruption level of a system changes corrupter or vigilantethemed abilities are unlocked for example corrupters are able to bribe station managers into secretly increasing the docking timer on another player adding an abrupt and panicked end to anyone trying to play the undockredock game bombings and sabotage are also an option vigilantes unlock concord payouts from destroying corruptor ships allowing them to truly be bounty hunters since podkilling someone in lowsec without a dictor bubble is nearly impossible either side can pervert a systems sentry guns to shoot the opposing group assuming a system has swung to themgiving one side pvp advantages will simply mean more people will pile on the winning team consider faction war lets say you fight for gallente what if when caldari were winning the war they started getting these sorts of advantages you cant dock as fast as they can they get sentry gun help say goodbye to any frigate combat would that make the game more enjoyable for you i have to say this sounds horrible for either side moreover basing large advantages on pvp kills is just easily exploited how many times do i need to kill my throw away alts insured t1 ship before we win the war this is the main reason we know they cant do allot of awards for kills in fw yet the article doesnt even address this issue have npcs join in on pvp by bribing them well again we can see how well this works with faction war plexes at best the npcs do nothing significant at worst they prevent the pvp from happening really why cant people just accept that no one really wants npcs either applying unknowable amounts of dps to them or whoring their killmails keep the npcs out of pvp give use mechanics were we can find real quality pvpi mean i dont care if they want to start a new sort of fw under a different name where you call one side good guys and another bad guys that seems pretty simplistic to me but the actual mechanics are what is ultimately going to make it good or bad those mechanics sound horrible
more perks to people living outside of high sec would be good
rereading my post to find where i said this is the one and only solution to fix low sec nope still havent found it
if you cant be bothered to be factually accurate andor relevant in your posts why should i be when replying to youmore on topici dont often agree with caerin but he and frank wordfilterlitz have illustrated the major flaws  mechanics are  mechanics and that doesnt depend on if you believe the fairy tale that lowsec is a ghost town
perhaps it would hep if they moved officer mod spawns from the safety of null to low sec it would definitely cause pain to bot farmers and give more targets to low sec pilots
the subject of neutral logistics and agrodockingjumping mechanics has been brought up many times in the past many people would agree that it is an issue and many would also say that its something thats getting noticeably worse its quite common in the main market hubs to see gangs getting into fights with more neutral logistics ships than combat ships whats more its very common place to see people using very expensive ships and setups in what is not too far from risk free pvp  which to many including myself seems unbalanced and far from what eve aspires to beim not going to throw any extra ideas into the mix with regards to game mechanics as it seems like many good ideas have already been presented from simple solutions such as remote assistance modules resulting in a dockingjumping timer to sharing whatever timers the receiving party has to some more complicated but interesting solutions that revolve around new timers when ships providing support are aggressedinstead of all of this i just wanted to know  does ccp and or the cms consider the current mechanics of logistics in particular neutral logistics docking and jumping mechanics to be an issue in turn is it something that ccp or the cms plan to look at some point in the foreseeable futurethanks in advance for taking the time to read my post and for any comments or feedback you might have on it
neutral logistics is and will be an issue until the current mechanics are addressed remote repping and other logistical support should 100 cause a timer no reasonable argument against it
it certainly is an issue and dealing with players that like to make use of these sort of mechanics is dreadfully annoying you can even look as far as neutral bumpers when it comes to mechanics exploits  but i am sure there is no way ccp would even think about trying to do something with thati believe it was mentioned at one point that they were going to implement some kind of changes to the undock mechanics that would stop people from deaggressing and docking up combined with the ability to see outside of the station while docked but it has probably not been mentioned again by them in over a year not promising
yes the changes proposed would be amazing  and increase the amount of ships pwnt which is something ccp wants i hope that the csm can step up and follow the lead of their predecessors to advocate for this change
i totally agree that there should be a station aggression timer for aiding someone with aggressionhow ever gate timers would make it extremely hard to roam with logis in low sec as they have to keep repairing each other against gate guns they get shot by by having gccso in order to move one gate they would have to wait out their gcc just to have to rep someone else in the next system and have to wait it out again to be able to move on
neutral assistance represents the same problem that a hotdrop does an unscoutable additional force that can not be countered except by one of your own  naturally it is being abused to no endi no longer engage known alt users at all be it logis boosters or cynos kind of running low on pew because of that though  so many damn alts around
so ccp showed a video for the new nebulas at fanfest the video is here
this would be pretty cool the position of the nebula should relate to your location  if youre in branch the nebula should appear when you spin your camera to face towards galactic south with relative blackness in all other directionswhat would be really awesome would be if the visible stars related to the actual positions of other systems in the cluster
i agree this would give it a nice feel when flying
i do believe the idea is that the orientation of spatial anomalies will change based on your physical location in a region
thats certainly cool but since theres no way to judge south in the game will anybody really be able to tell
the eve and all the systems that we currently know are only a fraction in size compared to what would be a full galaxy in fact i believe it was stated that what we currently know of eve is only part of the galaxy it is in so who is to say that we are not in fact towards the center of the eve galaxy and we just havent seen the rest of the galaxy yet
i cannot agree with you more the vast majority of my pve experience in this game comes from fighting serpentis so im only going to comment on them there are tons of missing ships where are the elite tier 1 and tier 2 bcs where are the elite non faction bs let alone the tier 3sid like to see all of the races hulls represented in the local npcs ships
it only seems logical doesnt it mission runners rarely get any additions to their gameplay and this would certainly be a welcome one

i am a gallente pilot myself so i know what youre going through getting something done about it is a part of my mandate as csm and csm6 is concerned about balancing as a whole
do want dhowever i do agree that it should use ammo that should be rather expensive i could even imagine different types that only work for certain distances like a basic cheap one goes 5aulike 2k isk up to 50au and then 1 system 3 systems 5 systemsthis one should however cost like 10mil or morehowever i think that every ship should have a special bay for them maybe even different sized bays for different ship sizes also performance should be the most important part about all this if its gonna cause lagg its bad but i think it wont be a problem if there is an option to turn it off so in big fleets you would just have it turned off
this idea is awful

congratulations on completely missing the point what business of yours is it if anyone got drunk at fanfest are you suggesting that internet spaceship players should be statesmanlike in all areas of their life both before and after their election to the csm what about if a csm member cheats on their wife should they be impeached

1030 supercarriers can accomplish some sov war objectives does it count as small scale warfare
this is a really great idea unfortunately according to the last dev blog it seems csm only cares about fixing lag for their blob fleets not really a surprise after all
what would you consider a real goal there are plenty of things you can do with a 1030 man fleet why are none of them real goals
a group i spoke too want to be able to do real significant damage to 00 infrastructure with small gangs and disrupt the operations of 00 alliances in a meaningful way take from that what you will
will highlight again for ya
i think youll find there are plenty of small independant entities surviving in npc 00 as for conquerable space goonswarm has 6000 member and 60 sovereign systems for about 100 members per system test has about 70 members per system even pl has about 65 members per system although i doubt they rat much in them explain how your 1030 man organisation is 310 times more deserving of space than those peopleive seen this small gangs should be able to take space argument before and what it usually boils down to is people are unaware of how much effort actually goes into taking and holding space or they know full well how much and dont want to have to do the work themselvesreally what it comes down to is not the lack of goals available but the fact people want disproportionate rewards for their inputand for the record i dont think ive flown in a large fleet since goonfleets first invasion of cloud ring most of my pvp is gangs of 1030 but i dont get worked up because im not causing lasting harm to anyone because my goals are proportionate to my the effort im putting in
i am of the opinion that windjammer is a bad poster and am not lying about this in the leastwindjammer
good for you honest opinion incorrect but im almost sure its honestin that you believe in sharing your honest opinion surely you support the idea of others doing the same say by writing to supporttentonhammercom to give their honest opinion of what they think about the article in questionwindjammer
i really cant help but be tickled by windys campaign of libel and admitted attempt to draw negative attention to a business at the point where hes libeling someone for lying by omission it gets even funnier im sure that tth has no real interest in suing children on the internet but its some good ol fashioned basic irony
im not sure what you mean by this at all i am sorry that we werent prepared for this venture to fall flat on its face if you absolutely must have a statement right this minute i think were going with n1 m8s ccp thats literally all we can do obviously were as interested in qa as anyone else and we dont want our game and the systems that are attached to it to be broken given that with the security leaks our security was also at risk were not exactly dismissive about it
yo well discuss it at the qa theres not much to say besides looks like a structural failure at the corporate level and i guess they hired some incompetent dudes on the forums team welp good luck fixing the security breach what would you like to see mr sees no necessity
exactly this were gathering information and will address this at the qalooks like ccps old patternwe are already working on it but there is nothing to tell now so what do you expect us to sayuhm maybe that you actually are working on it because you didnt even say thatwell you do know it now happyseems like this csm already adopted that very quicklygrats
the csm now responsible for ccp qa processeven for stuff created and tested before they were elected
look at how much suppressed manlove he has for mittanis babyface look
the csm is not responsible for any at allmaybe i can find my goon  english dictionary and find out you actually meant something elsebut you are right they shouldnt say anything about it at alli wonder why they want to discuss it at the qa then
i fail to see what you expect them to do or what you think they can do obviously wow this is a pretty bad failure on the coding team maybe we need better qa is a statement that ccp themselves have already said the csm cant exactly add to that besides expressing their own disappointment at ccps failurei mean qa has been a sore spot for ccp for years this shouldnt surprise anyone i have a feeling itll be slipped into the csm summit though under the topic heading of why  hasnt gotten implemented yetexpecting the csm to excoriate ccp for a security failure that ccp has already rolled back a new feature overwhich is friggen unprecedented for them honestlyis overreacting and akin to throwing a tantrum over a trivial issue righteous indignation and outrage can be had elsewhere for beter reasons
i have a question about the qa session i was wondering if befause it is being hosted by my alliance and we are the ones putting forth all the effort in the form of sorting the question deciding who is allowed to talk and all will us loyal goons be given priority over the fail empire pubbies
i assume you mean the qa session with the csm and i dont believe any one group will be given priority over another questions will be selected based on them actually making sense and not being absurd most likely this means that both test and goonswarm members will be given the lowest priority given that both alliances are composed entirely of unironically terrible human beings
youre not a goon youre just a sock puppet of some angry pubbie trying to make the csm look bad vov fly away
i watched the vids from fanfest recently and particularly the csm one during it it was mentioned that new members to the csm often have a ton of catching up to do on issues especially those covered by the nda which they have no access to prior to starting their term in office i think the quote was 1 or 2 months before they get up to speed and fully productiveit seems to me that being the case that a change to the election process is in order then id shift the election a month or two earlier when the winners are announced they sign the nda soon after that and essentially take on the powers of the alternates in the current csm with the exception of active participation in the current csm meetings essentially that would give them csm forum access to catch up on things and the right to sit in on any csmccp online meetings silently it would also give them a chance to talk to discuss issues with the current csm even the ones covered by nda which would make such talks impossible currentlyat the very least that should give the new upcoming council time to settle in and get prepared for the start of their term the first meeting in iceland follows so soon after the term starts that it only makes sense to me that the more prepared and up to date the new council is ahead of time the more productive the meeting will be for everyone involved
while this is a valid concern i think it is becoming less of one as the csm evolves in the case of the csm56 handover we not only had two csm5 members reelected myself and meissa but mynxee prepared a detailed transition document and the outgoing csm5 members kept their access to the internal forums during the transition i think they finally are losing it this weekwhat i would recommend is revisiting this issue in 6 months and if the current csm thinks a bit more transition time is needed then we will make a recommendation to ccp in that regard

but the person that was ganked loses all their modules as well as their shippimped ganker ship a suicides pimped target ship b a pays for a new hull keeps his entire fit and doesnt even have to lose time running around shopping for ship and fittings b loses everything and gets an insurance payout for the hull only and if it isnt a t1 hull loses big time on even thatjust off the top of my head no thank youwindjammer
not realy high sec related butwhat about death penalty pirates reaching 5 sec stat would loose all their clones in concord space  and wouldnt be allowed to respawn there eighter so they can only respawn in 00 or in criminal station if they dont have a contract there thn char is considered dead  you are a criminal after all  with conseqvencesalso concord should actively hunt these pirates  their pods with low sec raids or similarfor high sec  blown up player ship loot should belongs to that player not to whom blow it up
but then how would you do your hulkageddon the participants would lose isk on every ganksupported
why would you gank a hulk in a battleship you should use ganker thrashers your arguement is invalid by bad exampleganking a badger laden with datacores and t2 stuff thats when the ganking gets profitable how many bp and datacores can a single badger carry 100k that much stuff would pay for your next twenty gankpests
my main flys a hulk with t2 crystals a mackinaw with t2 harvesters and a skiff with the t2 crystal yet he cannot fly a cruiser if i had killrights on you what would i do kill you in a t1 rifter the killrights system is useless to my main because he cant fight if i could transfer killrights to my combat alt then youd have reason to be afraid
not entirely true ganking involves a lot of target research thats why you see so many interceptor craft around jita you can safely bet that 120 of them is some guy going about his business who happens to be in an intercpetor and the other 19 are using passive targeting to scan ship cargo and fittings these guys have to appraise cargo and fittings in less than five seconds and either greenlight or say pass on the shipas for the ganker its about as hard as shooting the primary
some ppl do use battleships because not everyone ganks for profit u just assume its a bad example because u assume no one does it when in actuality u know almost nothing about suicide gankingand that falls completely on whether or not the target chooses to do something that stupid whats your next complaint easy ganks in low sec00those r the consequences of hiding behind a weak char for easy isk to escape any fight thats not an easy gank so stop being so lazy and careless and train for one or better yet stop hiding behind that weak miner when u cant handle risk on your alt and whos your combat alt and what exactly do u do with that char that has u so scared that u have to hide behind another identity just to feel safe
receiving insurance after being destroyed by concord is silly and should be removed
this
sure if they turn up realistic chance remember when they turn up could be anywhere between 20 minutes to 3 days again with the realism if they get the right guy theyll probably just arrest the nearest minmatar and go and eat donuts if they even arrest anyone at all go check out crime clear up rates  theyre usually singledigit percentagesoh and as long as were being realistic they want paying for their work too
the point is that he doesnt get paid for his action by the insurance company and the action taken by concord is far more realistic and by realism malcanus i mean arrest of the criminal rather than blowing him up as far as i know we dont just gun down murder suspects when we find them police arent executioners theyre job is to apprehendhe not only doesnt get the pay out he has to pay out of pocket to get his ship back the benefit of keeping his modules is an offset to getting no insurance payouts plus most suicide gankers get their ships cheap and in bulk many times which saves them money per hull but allowing them to keep their modules presents them with the alternative of having to decide to pay average market price in the region to get their ship back in order to keep the modules rather than just going to get the next hull in his inventorythe fact is windjammer you have to make a damn compromise in what you want if you ever hope to get anything out of this argument my proposal takes away the insurance payout from the ganker while allowing him to keep his fittings if hes willing to pay far more his old ship than he probably did the first timethe benefits for the ganked no insurance payout for gankersthe benefits for the gankers the ability to use more powerful modules in their attacks without fear of lossyou have to give in order to get windjammer as for the the ganked losing all their stuff well thats a hazard of flying anywhere in eve be smart and youll never be a gank targeteither way my idea may be the only way the gankers may peacefully accept losing insurance payouts give to get man give to get
elfaif police see someone with a gun shoot another person they usually shoot the shooter right besides eve isnt really as civilized as real life and is that way by designin your scenario the ganker wins hugely there isnt a suicide ganker in the game that wouldnt gladly forego the insurance payout in return for being able to keep ship and modules at the paltry price of a hull this is even without the differential between what insuranceconcord accesses a ships hull at and what the ship actually costs on open market wed suddenly have suicide gankers cruising around in t2 t3 and faction ships pimped out with dead space modules and t2 rigsat least as much as they thought they could get away with and not draw the attention of other gankersalso in eve you can get something for nothing and suicide gankers are not by nature inclined to peaceful settlements i mean unless you offer them a boost of a deal such as youre suggestingyour heart might be in the right place but i still dont like your idea its a ganker big win ganked utterly screwed sort of thingregardswindjammerps i have never seen a place in eve where it is possible to be smart enough to completely avoid suicide gankers unless its inside an npc station
and ure missing his point which is u bring up realism and at the same time u only nitpick parts of it u like and dismiss parts u dont like and keep in mind this is a science fiction gameonly your compromise screws over a third party the manufacturers who will lose sales over this when ppl dont have to replace their ships or mods furthermore it can be exploited by anyone to get out of a regular fight whether its a gate camp target or a stupid factionfit missioner who shot his way into a trapjust shoot a neutral or even the stationgate if here losing and then hell just avoid a lossmailhell he might even get a killmail on whoever he suicided as well
its funny i can change my name in other mmos and even in real life but eves too cool and hardcore even moreso than the ing real world to be able to not change something that doesnt even matter that much in a gamewhatever id change my name if i could and i dont even hate my name that bad i guess this game is just the most sacred thing on earth and shouldnt be tampered with if i had known the game were even more strict than the actual life i live about names i might have thought about it a little harder but for a moment there i thought i was just playing a game

with the recently added three names thing id absolutely like to change my name id love to give arklan1 here his proper full name of arklan uth oslin
i agree with the above and a bit more tooim not strongly against it but i am against it i would welcome the extra money it would bring into the game but even with an audit trail on the name change in the biography or wherever it makes it easier for people to escape their naughty tut tut deeds i mean who the feck reads the bio anywaynot supported
the fact is that this should be allowed as long as a history is kept public to be seen which would void all the negatives addressed by this proposalmany players start this game like any mmo and pick some random name or one they brought from another game and once theyve been in eve awhile and get into the spirit of it they wish they had picked a name that better suited the eve universe or the ones that picked something silly and then ended up taking the game seriously but are stuck being named like a clowni think its something that should be allowed at least once after your first year in the game you can change your name in real life and you should be able to do it here for the sake of ingame realism at leastcharge a plex for it and make it a one time only event after 1 year of active account holding and let it be kept public what name you had before problem addressed and solved
i support this fully however i think name change should be a 1 time deal per account also when the name is changed a eve mail should go out to ever person that has you on their contact list so they know
there are entirely too many whiners that do not support a name change for the stupidest of reasonsi support the option of a name change especially for those who purchase a character from someone else this would have no effect on the history of the character only what name is displayed purchasing a character imo should give the character a new start the person who purchased the character is highly unlikely to follow in the same path as the seller and even if they did  so whatthe argument that a name change could some how fool you into getting you ganked that is such a noob statement if you trust every neutral that enters your system you deserve to be ganked

i wholeheartedly support this
yes please
sounds good
its been ages that this has been talked about and kicked around that ccp does not wish to fix the problem due to that many of them play caldari or minmitar pilots damn few play gallente gallente hybrid guns need to be fixed there are several possible solutions for this 1 give all gallente a 10 boost on damage and blasters a 10 on tracking2 nerf everyones weapons except the gallente3 all gallente pilots camp jita and kill anything coming in or out of the gates till ccp fixes this problem the gallente are second in technology to the other factions why does this not showbetter yet would it be horrible to send in a trouble ticket on our weapon damage not working properlythe only thing i see is that if its not fixed the gallente players will start training up other faction ships and guns but this should not be the solution we started with gallente and we should be able to enjoy playing them like any other faction pilot out there

white three for presidentconvince the other csm they dont need to serve a full and ready made solution to ccp its also ok to just say here is a complicated problem that is hard for the community to agree on partly because of protecting special interests and partly because its  complicated none the less hybrids are critical for those it affect even more so because both rain and blaster are flawed it thus deserves ccp attention and solution generation
being said by a guy flying in fleets of 2030 men your coment means absolutely nothing and most important add nothing interesting to the discussion but since you want it let me give it to youfor you the real player having the enourmous advantage of the true knowlege how blasterthron works has this in specificflyes with 20 or 30 buddiesnever fits an armor repairer what a shame fit is thatdoesnt cares about is cap stability who cares logis are ther to do it arent theydoesnt fit something like scramdisruptor or web its not the purpose of megaseverything else is fail and used by noobs or players lacking of knowlege how blasters and megas work
i hope they bring back a lot of stuff that wasnt in the initial release

several posts removed which are just a case of you are lying no u posts
here is a simple idea to decrease the botters and other pilots that exploit the universe of eve remove the static asteroid belts and ice fields and replace them with a more dynamic system use the ship scanner to locate the asteroid belts and ice fields updated daily with random locations in a solar system list the scanner results of the asteroid belts and ice fields in a random order mix this list with one or more dangerous combat sites faction pirates etcthis way pilots have to look at the list similar to captcha mechanic to warp towards the belts they want it would be a minor inconvenience for real miners instead of right click warp to belt they need to open the scanner scan and right click their belt to warp to
right because bookmarking all belts once a day will stop macrominersor maybe because there are no bot programs able to scan with direct scanner and run chosen siteshint there are
it will not stop them the scanner which produces a random captcha result list will only make it more difficult instead of bookmarking once for the rest of their botting life they need to do it daily the more hassle for them the better imagine if they have 20 bots running in different systems
i generally support making asteroid mining less staticthere are a few improvements to you idea i would like to seerather than daily random location for belts constellations should have a constant number of scanable sites for asteroid grav sites this means there should always be a good number of grav sites within one or two jumps when a site despawns after all the roid have been mined a new grav site will spawn somewhere in the constellationgrav sites should have varying degrees of difficulty to find from onboard scanner to elite probe skills this should appeal to players with varying levels of skill pointsthe quality of the grav site contents should depend on the degree of difficulty to find it and the security of the system other factors like the amount of ore mined in a system may also have impact on the quality of the grav site spawnedstatic asteroid belts should remain for new players and ratting but in hisec they should only contain low grade ores which cannot be mined by strip miners
well theirs really not to much for us to say since ccp showed us were mining falls on their list it was second from bottom that was on the screen most always think that all miners of high sec only use one toon well very wrong many have 23 miners and their orca i find that the current system makes this difficult as i tryed it with 5miners the belt just vanished and the laser work was a pain i find the concept of huge rings around planets to be interesting i wouldnt be to annoyed if high sec was left with the low concentration version i get the high suk concept but micro scopic roids super annoying and laser that dont stop when the target is done also annoyingif i were to ask for any thing it would be decent size roids im fine with the low to no concentration kinds would like bigger areas harder to find is fine as a large field of so veld would be ok as itll take a bit to work outfor the fun part i dont find all the laser work to be much fun after a few hour as its a none stop action chasing them in pve i dont have this problem as they take ea little longer to kill a ship i have drones and it only takes one to actually kill a belt rat i find this to be a 2 second moment of joy and then its done  i believe if ccp gave us enough cpupower grid that i can actually use my 4midslots while mineing would help and increase the belt rats considerably and maybe throw in some thin bigger then a frig in null i personal love the mineing version guys and the attackers to protect them was great fun killing them with the orca and finding a cargo hold full of great lootnow i do find it annoying that every one has this dream that a miner always have huge amounts of money so not true it takes many hours of moving low value items to make a decent sum of money as i can take one or 2 t2t3 ships and do combat and make more faster but since i like building stuff i have done mine threw my eve carrer throwing in the cobat and bounties would be great only concern is if i kill to many of them will it murder and rep with other faction like gallente as they seem to drop stupid fast already
sounds good to me
1 log in one character2 scan for belts3 make bookmarks4 share bookmarks to all of your alts5 6 profityour proposal doesnt solve anything
any bot not coded by a mentally stunted chimp eating crayons and sniffing glue would have no difficulties handling the ship scanner just fine so only mostly effective unfortunately it wouldnt take them rolling their faces on their keyboards very long to overcome this obstacle
dear lord no
i beleave that the reason is why they are waiting is becouse the ships already need to be redesigned for the visble missle launchers thats why they havend done more ships after the scorpion the new designs will come out together with the visible launchers
basically one major issue with the drone regions is the lack of npc space anywhere near itcurrently most other major regions have npc stationsspace nearby heres what i know of so far mordus legionsisters of eve in pure blind society of conscious thought in geminatethukker tribe in great wildlandsserpentis in fountainore in outer ringintaki syndicate in syndicateguristas in venalsanshas in stainblood raiders in delveangels in curseas can be seen by the following list there is no npc space anywhere near the drone regions the nearest being lowsec followed by great wildlands geminate and then venal what does this mean a whole section of space is essentially an invulnerable fortress as people can not live there unless they are allied with whoever happens to own the drone regions its one massive blocby establishing a region owned by an npc rogue drone faction players would be given the option to live in and experience this space instead of the current regime where youre forced to rent from one of the drf alliances this would also reduce the fortress like nature of this group of regions as it would give small gangs a place to base out of and give people an area in which to stage capitalsthe other aspect of this would be to completely redo the rogue drones as an npc factiontype of rat currently the drone regions suffer from the fact that these rogue drones lack the good loot table of other npc factions this should be fixed a new set of implants that would give 1525 drone bonus damage not applied to fightersfighter bombers and 1525 drone hitpoints again not applied to fightersfighter bombers would make drones a much more viable weapon system new armor tanking modules could be introduced similar to the bloodsanshaserpentis loot table this would give a much needed boost to drone plexing and ratting i could envision that all of the base faction not deadspace as per usual loot would be purchaseable in the npc lp store which would be in the stations owned by this new npc faction ship bpcs could also dropbe purchaseable this is discussed in the next paragraphthe last thing that would be cool to add would be ships that utilize the infested models seen ingame already the most obvious racial combination for these ships would be using gallenteamarr this is one of the few combos not present in the game the other being caldariminmatar this would leave the obvious choice of these ships to give drone damagehp bonuses for levels of gallente ship and then armor resist for levels of amarr ship to balance out this obviously powerful combination there would have to be a severe lack of midslots 2 at frigcruiser max 3 for the bs max by adding these new ships it would make the drone regions much more valuable and interest people in the rogue drone factions a lot more
i believe the lack of amarrgallente and caldariminmatar ships is possibly intentional as they havent really interacted with each other much from the whole roleplaystory prospective that assumes ccp really plans effectively which im moderately sure they dont thus the drone regions lowsec sov fw rr tyrannis market exploits supercaps being deadlocked into singlecore nodes and a great many other thingsgiant blue blobs are either sad or epic nes miniboss fights so
i normally take most things on the chin and find a work around and get on with it but i am seriously considering whether eve is worth playing anymore eve is a game after all its supposed to fun where is the fun in grinding for 5 hours for every battleship i want to flythe latest patch anoms nerf supposedly meant to increase pvp has done the exact opposite how do i pvp more with less isk simple answer is i canti know people will say move away from rattinganoms and into miningmoonspos but those areas are either very time consuming or run like a cartel that i have no way of forcing my way intothe fighting for better space arguement is laughable too fight against people who run bots 237 what exactly are we supposed to fight them with when it takes 5 hours to fund even a battleshipbtw like the majority of my alliance i dont own a supercap i dont even own a carrier i spend all my isk on subcap pvp
another one sighhow ever did you get along prior to dominion when ccp stupidly handed out the isk plates to the general populationthe easy isk is bad for the game as a whole and has been replaced with the much more involved exploration plexes more isk but more workif you want to improve circumstances then why not run the new content give feedback and maybe spawn rates and quality of the plexes can be improved
sanctums are only marginally better isk than lvl4s in a marauder and not everybody was doing them with bots 237 so calling it easy isk is far from the truth your way out of touch with the average 00 player sanctums worked for us because we could spend more time in combat the majority didnt use them for botting towards a supercaphave you tried finding this new content all i can find is gravmag and whs 610  1010s seem to have vanished then there is the small matter of getting to the plex first which isnt easy when your competing with people using multiple probing alts
well its trueisk making is key to learning pvp for inexperienced players cuz they loose ships like a motherfker but at the same time everything is being done to lure or drag or force players into 400 where they can get shot for some reason the hardcore part of eve is totally dominating now and while that can be fun its also very time consuming and thus detrimental for the casual player it is from the large base of casual players that hardcore pvpers grow so lets try not to ignore their pleas completely ok
the 04 and less systems arent anymore dangerous than before because when you live in 00 you always have your eye on local have safepos bookmarks they are just permantently busy so you have little chance of running a sanctumpvp costs isk so the rewards should be far greater in 00 space otherwise whats the point of 00dont think this wont effect players that stay in empire we all have alts that can turn their attention to piracysuicide ganking and griefing wardecs as an alternate source of income to fund our thirst for pvp
have you tried flying ships that you can afford that way youll waste even less time pveing
good advice and yes i always doim talking more sov related pvp though cant see how this is going to lead to more 00 conflicti suspect its more to do with cheap plex
obviously its not possible that the increased resources in 00 caused more people to move there or that the general increase in game population means more resources are needed to support people at the same levels of income that would be stupid why would anyone possibly think that
since the problem the anom nerf was supposed to fix was isk inflation why not just change the way anoms work from giving bounties to giving modules that must be sold to gain said isk or lps that way the anoms and probably incurisons as well soon wont be contributing to the isk inflation
or ccp can get a ing clue and fix the real isk inflation issue which is tech moons make them dynamic so they deplete and respawn at different moons throughout the regiona little common sense goes a long way ccp
never forget to add to coments like this one that the easy isk is not for the comun player but to mega corpsalliances whats next ive buyed a pirate ship that is reerved to the elite professional playersif too much isk is not good for the game they should start by nerfing those wallets making billions per day and not the ratersmission runnersexplorers i get it for you whoever doesnt play in a big alliancecorp shuldnt even play eveor do you think those corpsalliances flying all those nyxs and titans full dead spaceofficer fit did them with buyed iskplex 
you dont understand currency inflation as an example lets take iron in the real world as demand for iron increases the price for iron goes up however unless more currency is released into the market this just increases the cost of living meaning everyones income did not increase but the cost of products increasedthe issue with moon goo is that there is a fixed max amount produced a production level that has already been reached and an increasing demand ccp has been doing some pretty terrible economic policy to deal with this namely allowing for currency inflation to offset lack of supply a real world example would be roughly the last decade of us monetary policywhy is that bad policy simply put the product driver maintains value while ever other product decreases in value relative to the currency this is generally seen as bad monetary policy if ccp wanted to fix moon goo they would need to make it more dynamic basically there should be a way to pay more to extract more
patience my dear the blog specifically stated that the anomaly change was done first as it was the easiest to do  meaning all income is likely being revisedmoons are probably going to be hit hard as hell so the fatcats will get theirs dont worry inflation is as bad in a game such as eve as it is in the real world plex prices have almost doubled since their introduction for goddess sake  talk about hitting the little guy  that is a direct result of too much isk in circulationthanks to the greedy idiots in null i now have to put in twice the hours to pay for my free ride  kill all the easy isk
an own alliance guy that doesnt know how economics works how absolutely shocking
if you are poor you cant live in nullsecif you live in nullsec you arent poorif you are poor and in nullsec id suggest pulling down the towers and moving to hisec before your neighbor finds out youre poor
your logic is undeniable
agreeseems that eve games about consequences of the choices you make so this one is completely broken and decisionconsequences image gets a good slapthe actual mechaninc is totaly screwed you can rep has neutral without being bodered but you cant rep your own corpalli guys without seeing the pos shoot your ship after engagements something already repported isnt that awesome
be careful here rr is an important part of small gangs big fleets and possov operations the proposed changes will have a significant rippling affect should remote repping someone cause aggression i can see a legit argument for chaining down aggression but i dont think this is easy to implement especially with the current mechanics if you notice current gcc mechanics repping a ship with a gcc resets your gcc in essence two logies that previously ascertained a gcc can not get rid of the gcc as long as they are repping each other now if repping a ship with aggression resets your aggro timers too the ones that prevent you from dockingjumping then 2 logistics that previously incurred an aggression timer could never deaggress while repping each other this would be terrible for fleet fights essentially any fleet that tries to deaggress because the battlefield changed against them would either leave behind all of their logistics to die or give up logistics for the time it takes to deaggress if the mechanics can be altered so rring doesnt reset the timers but just transfers the current timer reliably then you can transfer dockingjumping aggro timers too but not until then note while this change makes some sense your essentially giving logistics pilots hell in doing so gatedocking mechanics are one of the few saving graces a logi pilot has to mitigate the risk to their fairly expensive ship risking 150m isk ships to save the typical bc hull is often just not worth it especially since they are typically primaried
this it would also stop the gang jumps into another gang all ships reapproach gate logistics ships rep until they get to low health then jump out and return a minute later phenomenon if youre contributing to a fight you should be aggressed simple as that what do you mean i might have to risk my ship expensive ship when fighting in it ridiculousby your logic maybe wed see fewer drake  scimitar gangs definitely a plus in my book
cta 2000 evei would like to have people who post proposals as well as anyone who reads forums as well as your corp mates alliance mates your cats your dogs your family your cousins to show up and help ccp do their tests to put it simply its in your best interestsincerely yourskrutoj the destroyercsm 2011 alt
ill come if they are testing a way to stop macros you up for that
zzzzzzing nice one
i will help ccp make bigger blobs if they give me 500k skill points on tranquility and not 2 million worthless skill points on singularity to me thats a fair deal i would be there for every test if they did that
if you take a look at the galaxy on the ingame map you can see the spiral arms and all it looks to have to right proportions for a normal spiral galaxy so id say weve covered most of it
new eden is most likely a tightly clustered dwarf galaxy that orbits a larger galaxy
if thats the case wow we should see it then from every system though looming in the distance it would be amazing looking as for the op i fully agree furthermore i would add that some of the nebulae shouldnt be sprawling accross the entire system but should have a small angular size only revealing thier full detail when zoomed in
the impression i got from the fanfest video was that this is exactly what they are going to dofrom a lore point of view i imagine that new eden is a cluster of stars formed around some vast emission nebula like the eagle nebula for new eden to be a galaxy it would need billions of starsi do hope they address some of the inconsistencies on the suns on new eden many of the suns show a red lens flare which give the impression of a red run but they produce a white light also when some lens flare fade out the sun also disappears
the eve cluster is most certainly not a galaxy or even a small dwarf galaxy its only about 150200 light years across according the jump range of capital shipsa normal spiral galaxy is at least 100000 light years across a dwarf galaxy is still 10000 light years across example the sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy in our own milky way neighborhoodbasically anything like a stellar nebula that is many light years across should be visible over multiple constellations and as you get further out it should get smaller that would be an ideal addition to these new nebulas but nebulas that exist in the core systems of eve would still probably be visible from the furthest systems of null they would just be much smallerexample the tarantula nebula is 35 light years across meaning if a similar sized nebula was located near the catch region it would span all the way from querious to insmother and be visible easily from anywhere in eve
this the playable area of eve is far too small to be a galaxy in its own right a globular cluster maybe though the amount of heavy metals would be inconsistent with being in such a clusteras far as nebulae go when traveling around the playable space of eve we really shouldnt be seeing completely different nebula formations in fact we really shouldnt be able to visibly see nebulae that close to the playable part of eve as that would put us on the leading edge of an arm where old massive stars have been dying and new stars are being born there would be a lot of background radiation between novas and shell flashesscifi video games dont need to be perfectly realistic though id rather the pretty scenery of nebulae over the star belt look like what we see in our solar systema side note im still curious whether or not ccp is ever going to iterate on that bright star event they had a while back they made it out to be something important at the time
personally id preferr a basic black starfield with the extremely occassionalsubtle nebulas and the removal of the giant roadflaresinspace serving as system primaries to be replaced with actual starseye strain online
theres a butteload of stuff id like to see them do to improve the realism of this game w regard to the game world id actually prefer to see these changes take priority over the majority of gameplay issues and definitely over other forms of new content once ccp finish incarnasome things that would be nice replacement of skyboxes with proper view of the rest of space ie stars actually represent and are in the correct positions to represent other solar systems rather than being part of an arbitrary wallpaper replacement of asteroid belts with actual continuous asteroid belts rather than a grid in space with a few rocks realistic planets and planet locations make planets statistcs match the planets appearances make sure planets of various types occur in plausible positions in a solar systembasically a gameworld more like the one being developed for infinity would be a lot more fun to play in than the current one for reference heres a video of what im talking about
i think the calendar is a great tool but unfortunately is limited to personalcorpalliancecalender events should have a viewable by standings option much like the fleet advert in fleet finder
being able to add color for instance blues will be blue greens will be green people shooting you  red people jamming you maybe purple people repping you green etc etc drones on you from a person  goldmore options for brackets also different bracket sizes very hard to tell sometimes based upon the bracket for ship typesfrig  circle  cruiser  square  bc  triangle  bs  oval  capital  diamond  sc  hectadectagon  titan  star
i did not know that were you able to learn anything there
congratulations upon entirely missing the point the question under consideration was whether people act the same way in real life as they do in the game i submit that at least some of them do and used examples to illustrateif a csm member wants to drink themselves silly and act like a clown every day of their life i could care less therell be at least one person in the room that thinks theyre funny if they want to as you suggest cheat on their wife let them maybe the wife will catch them and get a nice settlement out of it as well as get rid of the loserhow did you work any of that into the possibility of an impeachment i know you were trying to be absurd but you could have put more effort into it come onwindjammer
good duck you never disappoint and you never understandwindjammer
babelfish not working for you again eh too bad gotten a response from tentonhammer yetedit not that your sperging over the fact that someone was gasp drinking while on vacation isnt amusing in and of itself im just trying to predict what your next angry letter campaign will be about
let me quote this again as you seem to forget what you said the moment youre done spraying the contents of your digestive tract over these forums ignoring the fact that none of the current csm were elected until the end of fanfest and the fact that you probably didnt vote for him so hes not your representative and the fact that ccp advertises drinking with devs as one of the draws of fanfestdo you honestly believe that internet spaceship politicians should lead puritanical personal lives because thats a laughable stance to take for real life politicians who have real life consequences for their actions perhaps we should mandate that the next csm may only consume tea and biscuits when they socialise with developers
its nice to see that windys obsession with the nc and goons has finally driven him to complete insanity
let me post this again as youve neglected to read and comprehend youre attributing a position to me that i do not advocate ill underline the pertinent part for your ease in reading enjoylet me know if you require further clarification or simpler words heres a little hint it doesnt really matter if the person is a member of the csm running for the csm or just someone having nothing to do with the csmwindjammer
does it bother youwindjammer
so why are you posting about it in a csm thread in the csm forum of the popular internet spaceship game eve online
because someone alleged that people act one way in the game and another way in real life this allegation was made to support the idea that people who act like griefers scumwhatever inside eve are in fact really nice upstanding people outside of eve i responded to the allegation with the post youve been determined to see as an attack when in fact i was merely pointing out that sometimes what you see in game is what you see in real life as far as behaviourbelieve me when i attack if i attack youll know it and no that isnt a threatwindjammer
so what part of consenting adults taking part in leisure activities enjoyed by millions of other consenting adults across the world makes these people scum
the amount of members per systems is not exactly the matter here if a 70 members corp where able to defend and hold just one system against a bigger alliance then things would be cool i guess but the fact is absolute numbers will pretty much wins over anythingthe problem is no matter how much effort people would want to put into it maintaining anything in 00 requires large alliances and blobs its simple as thatwe are not saying rewards should be as plentiful as big alliances have camius idea is really good maybe that king of covert and cheap structure he is sugesting to suport a small corp  alliance could have a lot of limitations on its own like only be able to be anchored on 00 to 02 crap null sec as they say limited or not possible to moon mine etci think that giving smaller alliances a way to have some tiny influence in sov space would be good for everyone more conflict more guerrilha style wars and more pew pew and fun for everyone
so as i see it there are really 3 seperate issues herefirstly the perception that small fleets never happen which im not convinced is truesecondly the idea that small entities should be able to hold space which im completely in favour of however what i dont agree with is that a small entity should be able to hold said space against a far larger one that wants to take it from them you can either find space that nobody else wants or gasp use diplomacy this is why i support the spirit of the anomaly changes if not the execution there needs to be less desirable space that is still worth more than empire so that the first of those options actually becomes a practicalitythirdly theres this notion that a small entity should be able to affect sov of a larger one with small roaming gangs this is often presented in the same context as the second idea but theyre mutually incompatible i often hear people say that timers arent fair because they allow a large defense fleet to form well duh if you could do significant damage to a large alliances sov with a 30 man fleet that same large alliance could do the same to 30 small alliances this is why timers exist to give people a chance to defend things having permenant damage which can be done by small groups in less time than it takes a defensive fleet to form just s small alliances you cant have both 2 and 3
not really what youre asking is to be able to have your cake and eat it too you dont want to put in the effort of cutting a deal or making an alliance with entities that areable to hold sov and would prefer to fly around in small groups to harass those people fair enough but the tradeoff is that you dont get to do any real damage to their infrastructure the influence you have is related directly to the time you actually spend in their systems hunting their pilots
they do happen as they are fun but there is little reason for them and they often surve no great purpose towards larger wars they are also not very common and are at risk of being blobed by a large more mobile force small fleets should be common and able to work towards sov objective or achieve some effect vs another alliance not saying they shoudl take space because that would be dumbno issue here bigger group gets more and better space it would be nice if it was easier to hold and defend a small amount of sov from the larger sov holding forces the current structure of 00 rewards mega alliances rather than smaller entities with smaller pacts of non agression the result is super blobs and mega alliances as they can not be defended against a small alliance wanting only 23 systems with 100 or so pilots can not defend them selves from the larger alliances the larger alliance does not need the system but blobing them is easy as a result the little alliance join big alliances and you get the current static 00 with large alliance not really doing much of anything waiting for the next huge fighttimers are great and well thought out for a number of reasons that said taking a lfeet and mauaraunding through another alliances space on the warpath should have some effect especially if uncontested something to encouragean ad hoc fleet right then to defend from 30 battle cruisers
i dont think there was any plan to nerf the nc the stated goal from ccp in the blog was to add disparities in the sovereignty value of different systems i think theyve done a fine job with it too the problems the nc will face with this change are a function of their size it will simply be harder for the nc to harmoniously support the same number of highend pilotsgoonswarm and test are doing fine but test isnt really living in the north any more fountain is suddenly a nice place to live eh the rest of the nc is undoubtedly feeling the change here howeverwi holds sov in 38 systems most of which are in cloud ring along with fa and stlr 93 of the systems in cloud ring will no longer spawn any highend site no matter how much you upgrade them in fact 22 of the 38 systems 57 of the systems wi holds across all regions wont spawn a single sanctum or haven ever again for the end game wi ratter who earns his isk primarily by ratting sanctums or havens in a carrier the only sensible option is to move to branch 2800 pilots 2 highend systems do the mathif wi really is sitting pretty happy then they are all pantsonhead reed
it isnt libel if its true and it isnt a campaign against tentonhammer unless mits is tentonhammer such a good quack whos a good duck good duck heres a little snack for youwrite to supporttentonhammercom and give them your honest opinion regarding mits articlewindjammer
same old trolling as always heres a hint youd be less glaringly awful if you werent simply reduced to lying with every post and could actually do something like say finn is wrong because of x y and z instead of lol finn doesnt understand congratulations now that you understand what libel is you should realize that libeling tth and claiming that theyre published lies which you redefine as lies of omission is somewhat less than honest here lets conduct another quick experiment in whether you are lying and trolling or being honest point out all the lies that tth printed quote these lies verbatim or naturally prove that you are the one who is lying and trolling horribly youre not particularly good at lyingstick to trying to organize angry letter campaigns youre a bit less horrible at that
omitting even the most trivial mention of what ccp did instead of making the csm an investigative watchdog and thereby giving the impression ccp abandoned the watchdog project entirely leaving the future open to further corrupt behavior on the part of ccp staff thats not what ccp did ccp replaced the idea of a csm watchdog group with a much more powerful internal investigation section of their organization thus the lie of omissionwrite to supporttentonhammercom let them hear your voice give them nothing more or less than your honest opinion regarding mits articlewindjammer
did you just give an example of what the csm could do with the situation while wondering what i could expect them to doso is that really clever on your part for thinking the csm might ask ccp facetoface why this happened given the fact they are the only group that gets to talk to ccp facetoface on a regular basis or not for not realizing people might expect them to ask ccp facetoface why this happened given the fact they are the only group that gets to talk to ccp facetoface on a regular basis
not to get too far off the point but your initial complaint was that there wasnt some useless post impotently raging about the issue
what do you mean the number of people from these alliances that will be requested to answer your qado you csm intend to post the qa in this forum

as some one with the majority of the last decade spent in qa at several games companies vivendi activision 3do gearbox etc id bet my eve account that its managment related more then tester relatedalso id happily volunteer to move to either atlanta or iceland for a job dsupported
this i think ccp forgets that thier market is niche makes more sense to focus on subscriber retention than addition moreso the simple fact is that the concepts behind eve are so unique so spectacular so immersive that if ccp only focused on making each element of the game as good as it could be the new subs will pile on and stay playing great game is great if you build it they will come
suicide ganking is nicely balanced most part time s have been driven out of business and ganking is no longer nearly as profitable as it once was prices are high now for the boat itself 55 m isk when it is all said and done for 1 suicide bs although you guys are going to absolutely scream when the new methods available for gankers become more common incursion brought a windfall opportunity for gankers and no sorry i wont discuss what it is it will be common knowledge in a matter of weeks
first that is a really strange word for the filter to blocksecond youre 55 mil in the hole after insurance payout because im seeing a lot of ganking going on and they dont seem to be going broke fifty five mil isnt really that much anyway unless youre just ganking everything in sight whether youve scanned it for valuables or notthird i thought those methods were already common knowledge are they the same ones that were being discussed even before the first incursions patch was released i think ccp even blocked one before it could be used muchwindjammer
realism doesnt have to be taken to an extreme only given a basic representationmanufacturers wouldnt lose that many sales at least not enough to cause major upheaval in the economy since most gankers only get about one or 2 shots off on a gank target chances are the target wouldnt have time to target another ship before his ship was destroyed or concord arrived to arrest the ganker ganks either work or they dont usually scoring a kill with the alphapolice normally try to arrest at all costs and only shoot the shooter if its required to save a life as pods survive the ship kill lethal force isnt required however lets just change things then and say that if a capsuleer gets podded in a gank the gankers get destroyed instead of arrested and then they have nothingwell a way to balance out the rig issue then would be to also add a fine equal to 50 of the total cost of the modules on board therefore the more expensive the modules the greater the finesee since theyre only brainstorming ideas you can also brainstorm more to fix the problems
1 what u consider extreme is actually reality for some ppl thats why some minorities dont like the police because of malcaniss example so fyi reality isnt perfect and its certainly not all sunshine and rainbows thats what wow is for its just like how u consider that manufacturers wouldnt lose enough sales to make a difference yet if so few of those buyers r into suicide ganking then why would suicide ganking be such a huge problem in the first place its not ure taking reality to an extreme here as well only ure exaggerating the prevalence of suicide ganking and at the same time ure contradicting it with your own figures2 cause the exploiter would never target another ship in advance before the fight starts either way he gets out of a lossmail bonus killmail or not im surprised u didnt even consider something that simple cause neglecting simple counters like this one isnt gonna make it a better proposal u know 1 never heard any stories about anyone getting suicide podded but if that were the case then they wouldnt be losing much since theyll be using a smaller ship to do so2 which defeats the purpose of your incentive to use expensive mods which no longer makes it a compromise but a pure nerfexploit3 this isnt a brainstorming sessionthis is the assembly hall if u cant form up a decent proposal from the start then brainstorm it away in features  ideas
what crawled up your ass and died anna youre paranoid and obnoxious you know that at least im trying to come up with something what are you doing other than just being a negative ass and a rude negative ass at thatinstead of just shooting down other peoples ideas why dont you try and come up with one that will work for everyone instead of just one that will make high sec even more safe for cbsand btw you take away insurance only and youll do more damage to the economy than my idea since no insurance means no ship replacement and thats only if they keep doing it if it drives sg down even by half the ramifications to ship builders would be far greater since there wont be ships lost to gankers or gank victims to say nothing of the down slide in new module purchases caused by ganks ccp aint gonna go for thatmy ideas may be flawed but at least im trying to think and not just being obstinateoh and i can roll my eyes too
elfathere is really no call for you to be abusive anna is giving good reasons your idea will not workanother reason your ideas have little probability of acceptance by ccp is that they would have to be tied to the active market to be effective if this could be easily done ccp would have the current insurance tied to the market to see that this isnt happening you need only compare the insurance return for a t1 ship and its t2 variant to see that the insurance evaluation is not reflecting the price the ships are selling for on market or if you want to go a little deeper you could compare the prices on various t1 ships with the insurance payout for their lossits much more effective and within the confines of eves world realistic to simply eliminate insurance payout to those whom concord destroys due to their criminal acts its also much simpler for ccp to implement this and therefore more likely to be something that is implemented it has a greater return on the time invested in making the change than your ideawindjammer
my 02 and im sure youll all flame me to no endim all for suicide ganking for both fun and profit there will always be tards who carry lots of isk value in undertanked indies they do indeed deserve to die at the same time there should be more calculation work and risk for gankers who do it for incomeinsurance should only be given to pve losses and only in lv 1 missions for total noobs everyone else should have the sense to guage the risks they take and react accordingly in order to balance this you should be able to evade and tank concorde at least temporarily as in real life you can kill police and you can try to run it is usually futile in the end i would say if you can tank and evade them long enough to get to lowsec then you can effectively pull it off
removing insurance for t1 ships for pvp heavily disadvantages new players learning the trade its hard enough already for new guys to break into pvp without massively increasing their costs

it really is time to get angry csm just ignored hybrids in their first meeting how many times do they have to ignore it before we see a angry response want to just hope it all happens to change by some magic wave of the wand the time to get angry is now its time to make some noise we have 2 members in csm who can see the issue here the rest never played gallente becuse they are too busy in their tengu how often do you see anything but the tengu proteus cant even do as a drone boat and hybrids need a workoutmaybe we should set a date some time in the future and do a happening like a mass petition to ccp i doubt they actually read the forums
its exactly my problem i never had a warning window when ive made my gall char that if i wanted to have fun i have to crosstraingreat can i haz my sp back and put it in to another toonrace ill pay im ok take 100 on my credit card ccp no problem for that but at least ill start having some fun and will always cross train of course but wait kanid ships are awesome and angel ones are omgftompwnmobiles pliz ccp you can do it its just some clicks nothing like if you should make your brains work
yes
a megathron works fine in a fleet with 20 guys specially in empire  low secnow who the freaking hell fits an armor repairer on a passive tanked mega with neutron blasters in a rr bs gangas far as i know i have a capacitor booster fitted on my megathron so the logistics isnt needed to let me have capmy mega have both a warp disruptor ii and a webber fitted toso what are you talking about
yes thats the problem i have with your comments you dont seem to understand that nothing ever says blaster ships must play in 20 men fleetshas its never said that blaster bss must be the ones you will want to replace by canes if you want to solo small gang pvp oc if your definition of small gang pvp considers that more than 1 is some and gang is more than 1 or 2maybe instead of insulting other players at each of your posts because they obviously dont play the same game than you you can enlighten them with your enormous fitting knowledge and solofleet combat tacticsexplain them why and the good reasons to never use blaster bss in 2 or 3 men gang why they are dumb enough to use local rep etc etc
did i say that the blaster mega only works in a 20 man gangi said its working fine in a 20 man gang because i know it since im usually in a 20 man gang my self where others are using a blaster mega to and its no insults by saying where the megathron really works goodwhen it comes to 00 space warfare then i to some point agree that the mega doesnt work very well but like i said its working very well in gangs from 5 players and up to around 50 players in empire  low secand im using the mega because its working very well for what kind of pvp i do but i also have an abaddon im gonna start using soon so you will most likely hear from me after i have used it for a while on how it is
merci beaucoupvielen dankarigato gozaimasu
right stupid me rockets are much more in need of an overhaul since missiles also suckwaitwhat
get out 
blue eyed optimistdidnt see them vote no to hybrids and yes to rockets
oh i dont what they hell they were thinking with this 50 limit thats just dumbsupported
hint if you support the idea of this thread then please tick the support this topic check boxalso i have the exact same problem
if the text is in any format readable by a person ie normal text a bot decently made will also be able to read itso all this does is makes the process take slightly longer
currently1 log in character2 start bot program3 profitnow1 log in character2 scan for belts3 wait for scan results in captcha4 pick the right belt from the list otherwise your mining ship will die5 make bookmarks share bookmarks dont see the point of that for it creates even more work6 continue with 2remember this has to be done every time after a belt has been fully mined the more hassle for them the betterif you make the belts a bit smaller they even need to do this more often a dayusing the scanner is no problem i agree reading the captcha results from the scanner is
most captchas have been proveably broken and the ones that havent are usually so obnoxious that even a human needs to cycle through a bunch of them before finding one that they can decipher they work for blog comments because for every website with one there are hundreds without so the time required to break the captcha is outweighed by the time it would take to just find another site to fill with adverts for free shoes and viagra in the internet spaceship game eve online there is no other website so solving the captcha becomes worthwhile againon top of that website captchas can choose random letters or words to obfuscate im assuming your list of belts would have to provide some meaningful information about the belt limiting the combinations to a smaller subset matching a captcha image against a small subset of words is a much simpler problemreally all a captcha system would do is infuriate human players
in this proposal i am refering to an image captcha not a text based one in which players have to type looking at pictures to determine if its a belt or not should be doable also 100 examples can be made by taking in game pictures this is of course by no means a final solution to botting but it makes it more difficult not as much for real miners
youre still only inconveniencing the people who make bots not the people who use them image captchas like kittenauth only work because each website can provide their own images making each one different and removing them from the pool of low hanging fruit with eve there is only one system to crack so once one person has figured it out every bot can use it 100 asteroid images just means the bot has to ship with knowledge of all 100 which wont take long even if theyre generated on the fly for each belt the chances of them being completely indestinguishable from the other entries on the list is pretty slim
its a real simple idea and longterm it would  off the real human miners and the bot miners would simply implement it into their base code and never worry about it again
one of the annoying things i dont get with missions is that the main market based missions are material for war storyline missionsyet there are plenty of items in the game that seem to collect in my container named useless items for instance elite drone ai why not introduce missions that require such items in order to accept the mission then players will have a reason to salvage the items to save and use or to put them up for sale on the market so other players can accept those missions an example would be a mission that required ten elite drone ais in order to accept it the mission itself would have isklp reward after the player goes out and kills whatever it is that they need to kill if the player doesnt have the ais they can buy them on the market from another player or reject the mission since you can only reject a mission once every four hours it would increase the value of the ais thus creating another revenue stream in the game thoughts
the drone ais are used for scamming and nothing else  learn2play not supported 
i agree bumblefck however they dont have to be
i like it they can even be written in as having to flatter the agent with some roses and wine to get a better mission 
actually the elite drone ai chips where required for the cx2 offer pre lp store days80100k lp as far as my memory goes and where 23m per piecethey are still required to build integratedargumentet drones however the bpcs of them are far to rare so they and other materials required for this are basically worthless
i take it youve never done the lowend cosmos missionstheyre exactly like that fun fact the drops for the missions are so utterly horrible some folks just buy the items off the contracts market despite the fact that you could easily justa circle a container in a deadspace pocket full of respawning pirate rats collecting two tags every 20 minutes you only need 6 tags to complete the mission for quarter of a million isk rewardb kill random frigate rats at the belts collecting a dozen rat tags to turn in for another mission with another quarter of a million isk rewardelite drone ais afaik only drop off certain rogue drone bss in certain missions i only know of 2 missions that have em and as was stated above theyre a material of a bpc thats so rare its more of a joke item i personally have like 130 of the damn things and probably collect 5 a week but could you imagine getting back to back hey capsuleer go collect 10 of these items and turn it for for a 250k isk rewardive seen the drone ais currently on contracts for roughly a mil eachbesides it sounds awfully wow like go collect ten torn wolf pelts at least the materials for war prep missions can be mined by anyone in the game from standard roidsalthough to be fair it could work as an interesting alternative to the data center tag collection typedeal bring me 50 stranded pilots and ill give you a onetime bpc
i like how you are thinking eladaris i had forgotten about the cosmos missionswhat i am proposing is like the cosmos but in normal game play mission mechanics these would be new missions that perhaps are a little more on the rare side it doesnt have to be elite drone ais it can be the freedom fighters freed slaves wine ect if you want the mission and you dont have the item then you have the opportunity to purchase the item on the market or decline the mission and move on to the next one
i also have an issue with the distance between cobalt edge and tenal that jump is absurd if gates can cover that distance what dont they just build gates between the far reaches of every system in 00i have a feeling the original intention might have been to open jove space in that middle area making it npc 00 but plans probably changed looking at the location of jove and drone regions and that huge jump between ce and tenal seems easy to assume but who knows what will come of it all now
thats actually a very good idea
missions are to feed invention with minerals and acquire salvage for rigs  hoarding isk holds no meaning to me i have what i need and liquidity to acquire what i want any more is superfluouslet me guess your primitive brain recognized the surname as japanese and suddenly it is an anime namedid you even bother to look it up before giving your mouth permission to openlook up the first name while you are at it  at least my names dont sound like something out of wowlotro dust bin
the issue is obviously much more complicated than this but by reducing the income of individual players while keeping alliance income static you effectively force more people into large alliances who can provide reimbursement programs as they become less able to replace their ships independantly
which is why it is generally recommended that what little data ccp shares be examined in detailto me that reads like everything is going to be tweakedupdated to accommodate the increased populationthey could have left it alone and done one staggeringly massive null update but those tend to go down even worse with the null crowd and besides they are now working with the paradigm many smaller updates rather than a few whoppers which in my opinion is much better
theres nothing in the blog about isk inflationand the blog does list the reasons for the change and the expected outcomes
this is my main point and must be addressed before giving neutral reppers an aggression timer
i think it would be great out in low sec neutral logi isnt an issue its openly hostile logi jumping in and out every 30s and there isnt a damn thing you can do about it unless you split your fleet in half to camp both sides of a gate and that just encourages even more blobbing any remote effect positive or negative should result in a 1 minute aggro timer preventing docking and jumping by stargate the current mechanics on whs and jump drives are fine i thinka related issue is people docking ships inside orcas and carriers while engaged it goes back to that risk free pvp thing since the orcacarrier never shoots anything it can just hump the station and instantly dock a 1 minute aggro timer should be applied to it in addition to any timers the docking ship has

ok i am a noob when it comes to this how do i join the test server
yeah cast me as a teetotaling prude thatll playwhat makes you think i think theyre scum if a guy plays scum in the game theres a chance hes scum in real life if he likes to grief in the game theres a fair chance he likes to grief in real life if a guy comes off as a drunken clown in the game theres better than a fair chance hes a drunken clown in real life situations if hes a whiner in the game theres a real good chance hes a whiner in real lifethis sequence can be extended ad finem but im pretty sure you can see the trendwindjammer
no no this is not how the internet and videogames work at all do not do this
so people who were playing dungeons and dragons really were potential murderous satanists learn something new every day
do not do what
i believe this is a sighting of the all too common reductio ad ridiculum
erasure of a double post
actually its proof of the fact that you have no idea what a logical fallacy is dont worry as im not a troll i can actually point out your errors also as im not a troll i can actually point out your own words and why theyre wrong food for thought anyways the appeal to ridicule attempts to substitute mockery for an actual argument this however is not what actually happened what i did was used an argument of analogy to point out that the same hysteria youre trying to use in your personal grudge against certain csm members is based on the the same logical fallacies that the loons who demonized dungeons and dragons used namely that if a guy plays scum in the game theres a chance hes scum in real life or as the anti dungeons and dragons cruasaders put it people who were playing dungeons and dragons really were potential murderous satanistsyour argument about how we have to mistrust people who play as badguys in an internet spaceship game because they might just be a badguy in real life well that uses the same logical fallacy as the assumption that someone who plays an evil mage in dd might just be a satanist it is essentially a variation on the quoting out of context fallacy where you attempt to strip away the fact that someone is playing a character in an mmo and using that character to form conclusions about the person much like someone accusing the actor who plays macbeth of murder it is also an actual example of circular reasoning whereby your conclusion that peoples actions in game may tell us something about who they are out of game is used as your premise which is that peoples actions in game can predict how they may act out of game it is also an example of hoc ergo proper hoc where youve attempted to create a fallacious causal or predictive relationship between behavior ingame and behavior out of game simply because they both occur in the same personits also an example of the fallacy of bifurcationwhereby someone who is a badguy in game may just be a badguy in real life rather than there being an entire continum of behaviors and views about those behaviors both ingame and out and even if they were all agreed upon someone being scum in game would not mean that they had to either be scum or virtuous out of game but that the whole range of human behavior could be possible until we knew something about them as a person and not just as a gamerit is also an example of confirmation bias whereby those who are badguys in eve and also are badguys out of eve go to prove your claims but all those who who merrily grief in game and are good people in real life are conveniently ignored and thats just a few there is literally nothing any more cogent or coherent about claiming that peoples actions in an mmo game like eve are predictive of their personal lives than about claiming that someone who plays a doctor on television can really perform surgery none of that of course gets at the utter hilarity of your rage over the fact that an adult on vacation while his vacation was taking place prior to his even officially being placed on the importantinternetspaceshipfocusgroup drank
by using a weak analogy aka faulty analogy aka questionable analogy zero introduces mockery into his statement and that is reductio ad ridiculum reduction to the absurd an appeal to mockerythe attempt on zeros part to discredit my analogies hinges upon him following the sequence i laid out to his absurd conclusion additionally he characterizes my statements of probability as statements of certainty i say if he likes to grief in the game theres a fair chance he likes to grief in real life zero rewrites this to if he likes to grief in game he must grief in real life then zero argues against his rewrite this is the essence of the logical fallacy known as the straw man argument its a shabby way to lie but zero has convinced himself that it deceives readers in itself a measure of his intellect as well as a measure of his inability to see just how many are his intellectual superiors weve all run into the guys who love to grief in game and weve seen how a fair number of them love to grief in real life zero would extend this simple observation to the absurdity of believing those who play d and d must therefore be satanists since this is obviously untrue zero then circles back around to say that if the one is untrue the other is untrue in other words zero would have you believe that for instance a guy who loves griefing in eve is not someone who loves griefing in real life everthis is why it is unwise to argue philosophy with someone like zero their argument is obviously absurd they stubbornly refuse to admit it argue for the sheer sake of arguing attempt to use terms they do not understand and then argue about the interpretation of those terms when challenged by people who do understand themzero depends upon bulk without quality both in his writing and in his game play its blob writing and while the blob tactic works in eve combat it utterly fails in writingor in logicwindjammer
lying and trolling again windy why what are the odds its almost like youre physically incapable of actually responding to facts and have to lie and troll about them again you demonstrate that you have absolutely no idea what logical fallacies are you obviously have no clue at all what the fallacy of false analogy is heres a hint troll there are two situations where people who play a role in a game specifically designed for that purpose are having their ingame character used to cast aspersions about their outofgame behaviorno false analogy youre just lying as usual as you are a liar and a troll that never actually happened youve invented that quote because you are a liar and are trolling if you contend otherwise cite the post and quote where i said that but we all know youre lying anyways which is why you wont provide any such quote contrary to your pathological lying what i actually said was we have to mistrust people who play as badguys in an internet spaceship game because they might just be a badguy in real lifepeople who arent lying trolls will note the might be in what i said ah so you have no idea what a strawman fallacy is or you do and youre lying again your argument really was that people who are scum in game might just be scum in real life because of how they play the game lying and trolling again windywhat did i actually say liarthe same logical fallacy as the assumption that someone who plays an evil mage in dd might just be a satanist people who were playing dungeons and dragons really were potential murderous satanistspeople who are not liars will note the use of potential and might in my quotes and must therefore in your lying bit of trolling no id point out that you are a pathological liar and a troll and you lie about things that are right above your post when anybody can see youre lying what i actuallys aid wassomeone being scum in game would not mean that they had to either be scum or virtuous out of game but that the whole range of human behavior could be possible until we knew something about them as a person and not just as a gamerfolks who are not liars will notice that the not ever is a lie youre using not what i actually said so aside from being unable to offer a single logical rebuttal to the facts that show your arugment is awful all you can do is lie with pretty much every single statement you make
hypocrisy thy name is zero as well as the sum total of his successwindjammer
this is windys standard lie when proven wrong on the facts he has to troll about how i dont understand something rather than proving that im wrong meanwhile how many separate lies and errors did i just prove he was engaged in hell something like two or three faked quotes alone plus a lie about his own claims coupled with a faked quote in order to allege that his own words are a strawman of his own words as always since windy only trolls and only lies in his responses to me he cant show how i was wrong about anything he cant point out any errors in my actual logic he cant provide quotes for the things he said i did but which contradict what my actual words were he can only lie unsurprising
my line of thought is about considering the small independent entities the most important source of small fleet warfare in my opinion from a save the small independent entities standpoint npc 00 is very good because a small group of motivated people can actually survive there against a much larger opponent survive i said not win while keeping the endeavour convenient by an economical or fun factor standpoint and thats pretty much the point in npc 00 there are different layers of effective sovereignty big entities will get the best systems even some good moons small entities will farm and trade you can move in when you want and leave without lose anything npc nullsec is far more dynamical than the average conquerable space because there are many small facilitations and warranties that are crucial for small independent entitieswhy crucial because everyone can refit their ship produce things set clones repair and tradewouldnt it be good to have a similar but more restrictive and effort requiring mechanism in conquerable spaceto get basic facilities you can set up a pos in hostile conquerable space but you cant actually defend it with a small fleet thats the point again there are no mechanics that make it possible to a small independent entity to keep their logistics going on let them replace their ships refit refine produce in a situation of strategical disadvantage the problem for small independent entities is not that they cant harm anyone its just that they lack the tools to survivein other words you should not need poses and outposts to survive in nullsec they should be a plus something that the big boys will want but small independent entities conducting a guerrilla style gameplay should be able to run their logisticsstorageproduction anywaythe key thing we need to allow this gameplay in conquerable space are facilities that have the following characteristicshard to find easy to destroy cheap to replaceno rf timers or at least not known by the powerful attacker
fun is a pretty good reason in of itself and i would suggest that when you take a small force to attack a large organised entity on their home turf that a larger more mobile force is a reasonable thing to expectwhy should this smaller entity have a magical ability to defend itself against a larger one where do you draw the line between small entity who gets game mechanics to defend their space and large one who doesnt there are reasons to remove an alliance from its space that have nothing to do with needing the resources some of these come down to limitations in the region system itself markets etc some of them are because its less secure when you have neutrals basing out of space right next door to you if a small alliance sets up shop next to a large one and starts attacking it why should the large one not wipe it out if it sets up and starts diplomatic relations then it might do a lot betteragain its impossible to design objectives for small groups that cant be done much faster or many times in parallel by larger groups if you can knock out system upgrades in a system in 10 minutes with a 30 man bc gang a large alliance can knock out all the system upgrades of your 2system alliance every hour of every day until you leave and do it all in their spare timethere are two types of gang that go roaming through alliance space those who are looking for a fight and those who want cheap ganks and in my experience most people who claim to want the former are lying if you desperately wanted a fight you could start attacking the infrastructure as it is today but its a fight youd probably lose and therein lies the hidden subtext of this 30 man bc fleets should be able to damage sov stance people want to be able to do significant damage and get out before they provoke a response they cant beat 100 of the time
there are some points here that i would like to contest first you assume that a big force should always be able to eradicate a much smaller force this is an assumption that cannot be motivated and is generally falsein rl you can fight a strategically superior enemy through guerrilla warfare you can even have rest training camps and logistical bases deeply into hostile territory you can smuggle if a gameplay like this were possible eve would become richer to be more clear i dont think that small alliances should be able to hold sov against bigger forces sovereignty and poses are for the big entities with a lot of blues etc we need some other things for the small entitiessecond about this just a consideration this does not mean that a large group should be able to eradicate all the structures of a smaller entity at once in my opinion a small force should be able to keep its logistics going on without even possibly fighting but at a cost in terms of effort and money that is replace what has been destroyedsecond a big group splitting and killing many things in parallel is good third bigger groups need a lot of work to be put together if you can attack a target only in a 10 minutes time window without notice you wont be able to build a large group example if a reinforcement timer werent visible to others than the structure owners the attackers would not be able to organise unless they have spies and the probability of having at least a spy gets higher the bigger is your side so relatively small groups would be advanaged by this more than bigger ones in short there are tasks that are accomplished faster and better with a small number of people these usually require either bluff or a good reaction time of course im not talking about possov bashing

having just started to use mining crystals ive discovered a small annoyance as a result of the way that stuff in the hold gets displayedif ccp are looking at small works to do what about altering the hold characteristics of the hulk so that it has a dedicated crystal hold like orcas have a dedicated ore hold and the pi ship thats name escapes me has a dedicated hold for command centressay take 500m3 out of the standard hold and add a 500m3 crystal hold after all the hulk is a dedicated mining shipthoughts
just as i said there are absolutely no lies and you cannot point out any lies because as usual you are engaging in metalying and youre trollingyou are lying and trolling mittani specifically mentions that ccp created the internal affairs department you know this and are deliberately trying to lie to people and we know that youre lying and attempting to troll because literally the sentence right before the one you cherrypicked says that the original watchdog concept of the csm was mooted by the ia department that exists today ill still quote the last bit of your trolling just for laughsone might even say that the original csm watchdog concept was mooted by the development of the ia department go figure
i dont think anyone has ever done more  kissing than you on these forums yet you still cant call him mittensdoes that make you feel unappreciated
we really do need a better class of troll you folks arent even amusing
apparently i was mistaken or the article was edited when i reread the article yesterday i could swear the part zero pointed out was not there in any case the article currently contains no outright lies or lies of omission that i can find today and i hereby retract my allegation that it does contain such thingsdo not write to supporttentonhammercom to express your honest opinion of what you think of mits lies mits is a veritable paragon of honesty he even admits to being biased in the things hes writing about talk about your full disclosure you may however wish to write tentonhammer to express your opinion regarding his bias after all mits gave his opinion shouldnt youwindjammer
i thought youd like that take what you can get little duck and focus on my retraction
yes i caught you lying and trolling good save and check your babelfish settings duck is not an insult in englishpredictably though youre still strangely obsessed with mittens now you want tth to fire him because he publishes opinions in an opinion column
well then you shouldnt be insulted should youhave i advocated mits be firedi notice youre calling him mittens now guess that other guys comments got to youwindjammer
yes troll thats what youve been advocating all along now i believe your next move is to lie and claim that youre only suggesting that people write angry letters to tth telling them to do something about mittens i notice that you are a liar and a troll and ive been calling him mittens for quite some time i also notice that youre a troll and you think that calling a person by their ingame name means something at all
would you refer me to the post or posts i made advocating mits be fired i seem to have misplaced it or themdont you think you should capitalize the first letter of mittens show a little respectwindjammer
already pointed out thats what youre advocating this is similar to your earlier lie that you werent really advocating that people make this about tth itself now of course your lie is that you werent saying that people should make it about the mittani you cant keep keep your lies straight by this point actually as you are a liar and a troll you are not only obsessed with someone outofgame because of who they are in a video game and the video games focus group you were trying to rally people based on a lie that youve now admitted was a lie and claimed that you were mad as hell predictably youre now lying and trolling and pretending that others are angry while you were the one engaged in a campaign of libel and who wants to have someone fired for publishing opinions in an opinion column but as usual ill provide you enough rope to hang yourself assuming youre not lying and trolling show us what specific action youd demand tth to take in order to prohibit a writer include opinions in their opinion column other than not letting them publish an opinion column dont worry as with the rest of your lies we all know what your refusal to answer will mean
hmmmyou claim ive advocated mits be fired from tentonhammer yet you ask what specific action i would demand of tentonhammer additionally you still havent referred myself or anyone else to a post where i advocate mits be firedwhats wrong with this picture anyonewrite to supporttentonhammer and give them your honest opinion of the bias in mits article its customer feedback and something theyll appreciate resistance is not futilewindjammer
thank you for again proving you are lying and trolling have fun with your deranged obsession with someone over a video game
ok heres a csm comment too bad ccp screwed the pooch on the forumsand nothing of value was lost on a more serious note i think that csm making a comment on a security issue while it is in progress of being resolved over reaches the purpose and scope of what the csm is i dont personally think the forum issue is anything more than a minor blip on the radar in the path of progress and will eventually be resolved or maybe not i am a fan of the old forums anyway d3
actually the only way i can see of doing it in an election where people choose to vote or not and have it distributed like it is in major countries world wide where you set it up with a number of seats based on the actual populations of areas in the last economic snap shot they did it gave fairly sound numbers for areas so for instance set up the seats as two for each empire space so 8 then one for the country ie 00 as high and losec make up 86 of the total population and 00 makes up only 1126typepopulation q3 2010 pop q4 2010 pop q3  of total q4  of total high sec 553502 611732 7956 7961 low sec 48346 51342 695 668 null sec 76999 86487 1107 1126wormhole 16846 18812 242 245 with the latest csm actually mobilizing the 00 population we now have the minority speaking for the majority or for them selves alone this is yet to be seen but the time dilation lag fix being the major point of their first release the outlook is not good it could be worse it could have been a lot of pure traders who never fly running the csm my only real evidence i have seen so far of how ineffective this csm might be is every one who has said some thing against the new csm is attacked in the forums by members of goonswarm so all i can say on that is please work hard for all of the eve community and dont turn the csm from something mildly useful into the pr exercise csm 1 was so my proposal is to merely have seats where the seat represents the population numbers and allow people running for the elections to attempt election only in one seat thus allowing for a more representative approch for the csm to cover all areas of play
the only conflict i have seen started by this is the player base towards ccp i have yet to see any blue standings fall apart over this i have yet to see any conflict started going for a 10 system that wasnt previously in conflicti get what the few douche bags are saying rawr rawr rawr less carebearing moar pew pew yes but where does that money come from ding ding ding havens and sanctums now typically you see most of the times battle crusiers on roams bcs are cheap so this pretty much indicates typical casual null players dont have all that much isk to play with anyways as you typically see the hardcore people in faction bss thats fine and all but wheres the economic drive all that isk isnt being farmed in the billions per day by people people are not sitting in null all day just to have a really big wallet they want money for more pvp ships and plexs not to sit around all day with their thumbs up their asses no one does that they stay in high if they dont want any conflict at all now take american history for example land of the free and opportunity and all that no one came to america to make less money or to have less freedom then they had before they went to america to have more its no different with eve if people cant make loads of isk to buy ships theyll stay in high sec and just make a few occasional roams to low or null sec or even war dec someone or gank there is only 11 of the population in null there is nothing to entice them to the 6070 of systems in null that will not make them any profit over l4s in high it will not fund their ships to pvp there will be no reason for people to want to come to null sec and no people  no pvp if null sec had easy money in short times you would have more people more shipsbigger ships at that too think about l4s people use faction ships and deadspace mods to get more isk same applies ratting too which just all means more people to shoot at and higher chance of conflict since there will be a higher demand for certain areas there is absolutely no logic in this because people fight over resources not money belts and moon goo all stayed the same now just have less people to afford the products does this anom change reduce the growth of supercarriers nope cause people will still continue to make moon goo which we all know makes t2 and the t2 market is still rather popular with the majority of eve players based in high sec so those alliances get money which pays the miners who mined the ores the alliances buys the oresminerals then build the supercarriers without ever having anything to do with ratting
the ship is purely to fill a logistical niche that very few people have that being getting a bunch of warships into a cyno jammed system in order to cause chaos it is already a very powerful tool capable of putting extremly dangerous ships deep into hostile secured spacebut it sucks at face to face engagements the thing loses to its t1 counterpart that said why are you using a black ops as a direct fire weaponthe black ops is not supposed to be seen it is supposed to move around ships that make people pee their pants when they see them does ccp have to remove all combat bonuses to get you to see that given my understanding of the ships role it is working as intended
um there are more black ops battleships sold every month in jita than there are titans in eve the qen quote is the number of active hulls being used at the time the snapshot was taken therefore it doesnt account for ships sitting in hangars while the owner is flying something else or in smas etcbecause you cant dock a titan more or less every character who owns one will have been sat in it at the time of the snapshot whereas many of the blackops owners will have been flying around in other hullsnow i dont disagree that the blackops bss are pretty underpowered and could do with some attention but i thought id correct this misinterpretation of the data
yes its a dead horse but ill bump it anyway yes i am actually a bo pilot bo v and all thata lot of people want bos to be combat ships but i simply want bos to fulfill their role under a realistic set of ingame circumstances sure they can fulfill their role in a limited fashion now but only under ideal circumstance which almost never present themselves i wont get into individual race tweaks though they could be a phase 2 of bo luv in any case the class needs the following to become usefulnonnegotiable to fulfill bo role covert cloako i suppose the expectation now is the bo pilot is supposed to portal people in then sit there cloaked and wait to portal them out wow thats fun ccp remember this is a game and us foolish players actually want to enjoy it about double the jump rangeo the current range is not tactically significant either a larger fuel bay or less fuel consumption to portal shipso bringing along a blockade runner should not be mandatory for a highly specialized convert strike force as it stand now all this means is someone has to drag an alt along which is just plain tediouswould be nice hps equal to t1 and force recon resistance bonuses t3 able to fit covert cyno tangentially relatedi dont think these changes will take a lot of recourses from a dev perspective and i cant see there being much argument to these changes
ill followup this last post just with the one suggestionlet black ops use covert cloak or some new battleship version of itto be frank it seems a bit silly that a bo has all the electronics and capability to create a covert portal but cant even form a covert cloak around itself surely that would require less powerenergy than creating a covert jump portal we are after all talking about not only creating the portal but cloaking the portal i cant see how a portal would be easier to cloak than a battleship sized object seen as the object is just a solid shape whereas a portal is a flux of energy the cloak has to adapt to or fight with to maintain the cloak
i actually quite like my sin as it is and wouldnt propose any major changes there when the idea for t2 bs was first floated aeons ago however i did hope sexy looking for a jumpdrive capable blasterthron though on second thoughts with blasters as they are these days  lolpersonally i see two possible routes either make them worth the cost of acquiring in the first place ie beef up combat abilities etc etc or accept them for what they are but knock the build costs down signficantly 250m ish and id use it more ofteneither way more jump range is also needed
i think everyone pretty broadly agrees with this its not a really controversial topic however like commit to excellence its basically just an empty slogan theres nothing to pass or upvote here dont rush stuff be excellent blah blahthats not a proposal devote more resources and staff to team gridlock and team bff or make bff a permanent part of every major patch release forever those are specific proposals that arent empty we all agree that there needs to be a massive resource push to iteration teams like bff and will be focusing on what i call the ccp abandons features narrative in the upcoming summit
so dont relese feature untill its working is not a proposal oh well
i can sadly agree with that completely indeed it is not a specific gameplay or resource allocation proposal however it is a proposal for a company policy shiftjust like the tenure of doc eg at the helm of the ingame economy division has resulted in changes that might have made the games economy more of a free market the lack of accompanying game balancedesign changes to compensate for that increased freedom with some form of negative feedback regulating mechanism ended up throwing a lot of things that made gameplay sense into disarraythe ccp leadership seems to have forgotten that eve is by initial design a niche game so its appeal and resulting subscriber growth linelike graph other than the uniqueness of it for a long time has mostly been quality over quantity or if they havent forgotten that they let themselves be swayed by external factors which have nothing to do with the game of eve ie pressure from some of the people who financed their expansion and now want to see fast results in terms of returned revenueeither way the notion that the conventional marketing wisdom that applies to wow clones  that any new features sell better than most older polished content  does not apply to eve or better said that if you try to apply it to eve you wont get the results you see for the runofthemill wow clonesso yes it is a proposal that maybe we dont really have a right to make afterall were just customers not company managers but there is merit in trying to explain to ccp management that their current policy focus will not work the way they expect it to workor alternatively that listening to people with no gameplay background ie marketing accounting investors when it comes to the general direction they take eve into will not end all that well for themhowever one of the claimed rights of the csm is that of a stakeholder csm might or might have not been intended as a mostly cosmetic andor pr thing at first and it might have initially applied only to the prioritization process to a small degree but its certainly grown a lot since then starting with csm3 or so and thereafternowadays in a twisted sort of way the mass of eve customers is indeed somewhat similar to an actual stakeholderinvestor in the company that is ccp we have a vested interest in keeping the game running and therefore the company afloat and the csm is for better or worse our best chance to reach slightly more receptive ears at ccp rather than just screaming and shouting in the forums for no visible effecteven if normally we shouldnt really have the right to push our opinion regarding what would normally be internal ccp matters in this particular case i believe that the argument is worrying enough to deserve to be at least heardunlike almost any of the other proposals the csm has brought forth so far this one if it makes it through the csm process which i kind of doubt but still hold the tiniest shred of hope when presented is not for the game dev team but for marketingaccountingi dont know but i personally think that csm6 just might have a shot of expanding the scope of the indirect dialogue of the customer us with the company that ccp is and this could be one of those aspects that would be ahem challenging but interesting
fair enough give em pvp insurance against other players not concord as well for 6 months after the characters creation
1 dont know where the paranoid part came from but obnoxious considering that now ure turning your compromise into a straightup nerf and still keeping it as an exploit im probably being too lenient2 ure coming up with something so is everyone elsedoes simply coming up with something automatically make it good no it doesnt not for them not for u especially when u ignore the issues to your own proposal and just whine about how everyones not liking it3 i dont need to really come up with anything because suicide ganking is fine asis rookie ships arent being suicide ganked so its still not low sec and at the same time ppl cant always hide their high sec alts in 100 safety the only ppl who still cry for nerfs r said high sec alts funding their low sec00 main because theyre too scared to use their space andor evading the 10 penalty which most likely includes u but if thats okay with ccp then this is okay with ccp as well and it is4 actually u r being obstinate because once again u completely miss my point by ignoring the fact that its a lossmailaversion exploit waiting to happen and u also changed it to a pure nerf so now u just simply think of of anything other than this factthats what the is forits a poorlythought out idea to begin with that u just made worse with what u call thinking and u ignore the most obvious glaring issue with it and just degrade to whining about ppl not agreeing with u like u think they somehow should not only does it belong in the features  ideas board instead of the assembly hall but im gonna add another just for u because even after repeating this u still dont get it and most likely u still wont
so then you would also say that new guys learning a trade or industrial career get invulnerability from suicide ganks its difficult to generate a cash flow when your first mining barge or your first industrial filled with your first trade item get blown up by somebody who wants to see the pretty lights and isnt very worried about the cost to themselfwhen a trader makes a bad trade he suffers financially when a miner gets ganked during something like hulkageddon he suffers financially when you do anything badly or with bad judgement in eve you suffer financially why then should it be different for a ganker who makes a bad decision in what to gank a good decision yields riches from the gank at any levelthere is a great deal of bragging amongst pvpers regarding how well they do at pvp and how rewarding it is financially and was so even when they first started there are also corporations oriented to pvp that give replacement ships to their members both these things are at odds with what youre sayingwindjammer
am i a bad person for thinking they should remove insurance in general
its good for noobs and noob subscription fee money is as good as anyone elses money
it will also cause a massive drop in mineral prices as well so the miners will take another kick in the facehow many professions have to get wrecked so people can endlessly grind missions in tengus in safety
this is why new players leave the game cos high sec is not safepeople need a real safe area or as stated remove insuranceits a joke
no but as malconis has aptly pointed out it would be a hard row for new players unless theyre supported by more experienced and richer playersthis proposal only touches suicide ganking and if i understand it correctly only suicide ganking occurring in high sec since concord is not present anywhere else it does not touch other forms of pvp such as war fighting in 00 or wormholes lawless space and presumably would not affect activities in low secthe proposal would have minimal impact even on new players but would introduce an element of cost analysis for those that wish to suicide gank in high sec would it eliminate suicide ganking of course not would it make a suicide ganker pick and choose hisher targets more carefully instead of wailing away on whatever thats the hopewindjammer
yes please
dude ur awesome thanks for the support
waste of coding resources game has too many obvious problems abandoned features to worry about pvp skill purity make a respec proposal instead or something that probably wont attract much support either but itd get more than this
there are several more issues that need to be addressed first i agree but this issue will be addressed as well even if it is at a later date i will not back down on what i believe to be an improvement however thank you for your response
ps  i would also like to see what is the general concensus among all the csms on this topic thanks
both the name supercarrier is stupid as balls and theyre too small i agreehowever this is pretty hilariously low priority i can throw it in our ship models and paint summit topic though and hope for the best it might be an easy fix i have no idea how model scaling works cross your fingersassault carriers aint bad mothership would have been fine supercarrier is terrible
yes
its great that 3 of the huge threads in this section arefix gallente shipsfix blastersfix railguns
i am supporting this hybrid weapons in general require a look at having too little advantages and suffering from too many penaltiessince the issue is on the table for 2 years and nothing happened i do not have much hope
advantages whereo i see none
bump for the new csm
ed idea that means if you wanna learn pvp you have to do wardecs or blob in 00
interesting there are both tears and fun to be had
i think we should enforce a new rule now we have new forumspost with your main onlythe amount of trolls false references false supports and people hinding behind alts to basically act like idiots is a bit silly nowthe forums over the past few years especially from nullsec alliances have turned to shtccp please enforce a post with your main only rule in the forums to stop all thispeople will think twice before postingbtw posted with my mainpeople will think twice
and who of my 9 chars on my 3 accounts should i consider my mainalso poasting with an alt just to annoy op
ah i had a feeling that would be asked i was going to put it in the main postwell there is an option is settings called default character however at the moment it can be changed so 2 options1 once default has been selected it cannot be unselected2 the character with the most skillpoints on an account is classed as the main account now yes there could be issues with this because another alt on the account could surpass your main account im not sure how many times this would occur to be significant because usually people who want a high sp alt usually have a second account rather than an alt on the same accountyou cant stop people have 3 accounts with 3 mains and you couldnt really enforce a linked multiple accounts system people just wouldnt do it so yes if you have 3 accounts then youll have 3 mainsbut it would still significantly make a difference to my initial points instead of allowing you to post with 9 characters which to me is just silly
supportedalt posting  more riskaversion under anonymity
better  1 person 1 account  remove multi acc nowalso 1 acc  1 char  this should work p
then ccp wouldnt have all the russian botters paying subscription fees
should i have to care 
ccp does 
no subversion and countering it is too great a part of this game
how insulting and pathetic that an alt of an npcd corp would propose a post with your main only forum rulecan you say hypocriteyou people really need to get out morenot supportingps and the ironic thing is i do post with my main
are you an idiot just because my main is in a npc corp means its an alt seriously you are an idiotwant my api so you can look like a bigger dumbass
i see no reason for this it wont change the trollingalt posting allows for a person who may have unfavorable opinions to post without risk to their alliancealt posting allows you to post without people knowing your main and thus knowing which pilot to hunt down and pod over and over
the biggest problem that plagues new eden is the use of alts which are bankrolled by their primary characters which are then used to gank or do other nonsavory things the flipside is also true funds that are acquired doing illegal activity according to concord laws can be washed clean and passed to other characters or alts why not make a penalty for transferring funds to characters of opposite security status positivenegative by penalizing the status of the transferring character characters of the same security status can move money between themselves of course unless ccp wants to make a new isk item that is a physical cash representation that can be movedpassedmaybe even ban the interstellar transfer of credits to those with extreme sec status altogether 5 from opposite ends they are outlaws after all why make it easy for them to move money around to throw away alts to continue their operationsthey are laws against this in real life and shady ways and black markets to get around them ask your local mafia there should be laws in new eden especially since isk transfer is so simple to regulate and the mechanics are already there to do the sec status penaltiessay no to good citizens funding piracy or legitimate businesses using dirty moneyadding the below which is from later on in this thread to summarize the high level reasons behind this proposed solution it may not be the best solution to the problem but i believe the problem exists and is worth discussion
yeah no
would you have an explanation for your summary judgement
i went to my local mafia to ask them about money laundering and they were extremely unhelpfulthanks a lot for this great ideae below the check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on checkbox there should be a check here to vote for this person to be set readonly box
i knew that you would appreciate the humour 
allow me to further explain the proposalgood standing character transfers isk to negative sec status character works but the good sec standing character takes a penalty to his sec statusneg standing char to another neg standing character works no penalties neg standing char sending isk to high standing char must be manually accepted  acknowledged  by the good standing char if accepted positive sec standing takes a penalty add new skills like money laundering that will reduce or eliminate the penalty this should prevent rich players from funding new skilless alts for the sake of ganking for fun
could you first explain why the problem is actually a problem
good question im glad you asked as opposed to summarily dismissing the notionso the reasoning i believe this is because it is consistent with having security ratings and penalties for shooting somebody in the first place why do you get a penalty to attacking somebody in empire space to protect the innocent to keep the peace etc etc to make it clear that if you choose the dark side then there are consequences namely people know you are an outlaw and your standing reflects that behavior good or bad im not advocating one side is better just that the sec rating system should reflect this behavioral choicenow there are different professions in eve and all are legitimate pirates are just as necessary to the world of eve as are miners we all should be able to agree that what makes eve a great free market meritocracy is that you are responsible for your actions you are accountable for them insofar as your characters reputation manifested in standings goes if you choose to live a life of a crime boss then that is great if you want to work the mines great too what keeps everyone honest and coming back to eve is the sense of reputation accountabilitywhat is broken in the reputation accounting system is that money transfers are allowed free without audit why is this a problem well say you have a reputable ceo of a trustworthy corporation his reputation means more to him than isk as he has plenty of cash and material things if somebody es him off he could just make a new alt send him 500mil isk and have that alt suicide gank his enemies now this by itself is hard to stop as nothing should really prevent anyone from just doing this but what most people do is create a ganking alt with trained skills to be good at one thing killing people and doing the dirty work which is fine many people make a living in this profession but now the same ceo can just have his personal assassin kill and gank to his hearts content this assassin alt is different from other players who happen to be pirates or pvpers for a livinghedoesnt care about moneydoesnt care about standings reputationhas no personal capital invested into his character doesnt care whether he lives or dieswhy should we allow this behavior without penalty should concord be turning a blind eye to sanctioned terrorism how is it different from allowing the said good ceo to start ganking and killing at leisure without any sec status penaltyps you should still be able to hire bounties on people without sec penalty that is fine i dont see that as the same because their is a 3rd party involved the bounty hunter so this is a positive thing for the economy it gives bounty hunters jobs plus it is not the same because somebody who is making it their primary profession is now given a job to gank somebody and he will take a sec standing hit for it part of the service you are paying for not a temp alt created just for the purpose of delivering a plasma bomb to jita44 with free access to your corp ceos walleti hope that makes sense its just an idea at this point but one i though would be worth discussion
i support this message
 thisif you train to use a sc then get there and find out how hard it is to keep it safe you obviously are too ignorant to play this game i am training to be a sc pilot but not to use it for logistics or even to keep it safe i just want to fly it around and show it off until i get all blown to smitherines but if you spend the 109 days to train to use a titan and actually raise the 70 billion isk to afford it spend the month to build it and end up getting blown up thats your own fault not ccps an investment of this size should be researched and decided upon many months before you actually finish training for it not the week you finish and the day you want to go out and get onewhat i mean to say is if there were documentation on this subject it would say this you my friend are a ing retard for not knowing what it means to be a sc pilot loser
i would love to be able to do that actually i dont care if the bomb launcher was built using station eggs used plex as ammo could only be fired once per social security number and required flying to iceland to verify my identity while using it
a lot of days i dont even trust myself it makes folks feel better
congrats  no one else outside of the goons trusts you either yes you have every right to suggest your alliance vote en mass to get you in but you knew what conflict that would cause in the community after the childish sarcastic campaign you ran you made the csm into a joke am sure that makes you proud though sad
i find it truly amusing how many people simply cant distinguish between the mittani internet spaceships douchebag and alex rl member of the csmthe former wants to cause you pain the latter wants to improve the game so as to provide the mittani with more opportunities to cause you painif you really want to stick it to the mittani just ignore the trolling and reply to any substantial comments he makes with calm sober wellconsidered replies it will drive him nucking futs
the edit to this post was because i have realized that i chose a poor title for this thread the new title i believe better reflects the intended message and hope of this thread ive kept the old title beyond artificial warmongering in the title so as not to cause any butt pain to those who would feel hurt by its removal also i kind of like the sound of a day of peace to send a message beyond artificial warmongering i feel its more clearfrom a speech by jfk during his presidency as the spacerace was just gearing up i like to think that we can all take a little bit from thisfor the eyes of the world now look into space to the moons and to the planets beyond and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest but by a banner of freedom and peace we have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction but with instruments of knowledge and understandingsometimes i wonder how amazing and progressive eve would be if everyone was blue to everyone else if not just for a day to prove a point just so we could all o at each other and fly by without worrying whats on the other side of gate or cynobeacon damning language barriers and past discretions to simply exist in the same world together without conflict malice or aggression toward each otheri would be all for staging a day of peace in eve if only to show the world that if this many thousands of people from so many different countries and walks of life can take their fingers off the triggers for a day there is indeed hope for humanity in the years to come
a shoot blues day awesome
the thing is that if we maybe dont send weapons to space is not because we are good people its just because we need them to shoot ourselves on earthso many millions years of evolution to be that stupid we are not ready to make friends any where in that huge unquantifiable space
quoted for great truth
last time i checked goons already shoot bluesits really sad this is all a community of thousands can muster 3 comments none of which will even consider peace as an option for humanityin a world constantly in conflict with itself where people are dying daily for no good reason its sad that this is the response to a call for peaceall i see here is fear and bigotry and it makes me sick
someone needs to to reestablish the boundaries between real life and the game world but ill humor you by posing a questionhow many times in our history as a species has a lasting peace been made when limited resources andor religionideology has been at stake
if you feel this action is uncalled for please reply and sayunerf it see if we can get most of the eve population on this thanksccp shouid know that this nerf will severely decrease their stock and salesthanks for any support
they should never have gone with the anomaly nerf and im not too sure what drove that decision other than either jealousy or shortsightedness
unerf it
ccp has successfully created another waasteland like the drone regions unnerf this bad call ccp bad call
the change was way to drastic ccp made basicly all the 00 systems about more or less worthless and this will only make the rest of 00 like the drone regions a load of botters running killing everything in sight becauseit will be the only way to make even remotly the same amount of isk as you used to or turn to empire mission running
unerf it

risk vs reward is not balanced now unerf it
dislike how you spam this message around to get people to post and disagree to the threadthis has been one of the best changes to 00 for ages if anything more should be changed its a moongoomechanic fix or a dedominionation
put it back put it back put it back errr unferf it those of us that live in 00 space should have the same opportunity to make isk as those people up in high sec when it comes to anoms and ratting this makes the game unbalanced when it comes to wealth
the idea seems to have been that the large coalitions will self implode because others would want thier space this idea was just ignorant of ccp it will not make it easier for little alliances to gain sov now with this nerf system ihub modules are worthless to put in because there is no hope to upgrade crappy systems i was in an npc system that has better ratting and mining than a fully upgraded system with sov tell me how this helped ccp your totally out of touch with your null sec residentswhy does this matter to you you fly with the milita

unnerf this  man
keep the nerf

either unnerf it or rethink your nerf and try a more fair method to improve game play nul sec should allways pay better than empire spaceallways
unnerf this bs i used to be a highsec missioner before i moved to null and for awhile i was pulling about even on net profit now with anoms nerfed if i lose a ship its a solid week of trying to find enough active sanctums in a fully upgraded system to get the isk to replace it
it sucksun nerf it
signed
while i rarely ran anoms in null sec and those that i did were ports unnerf it it drives up the competition for exploration which is my main source of income in null sec
null got what in the real world would be similar to a taxcredit it did not have the desired effect and has thus been revoked  there has been no nerf but rather a removal of a buff
id like to see the change undone it has resulted in a way too heavy impact on nullsec players ways of acquiring an income
unneft it  ty
un nerf itthis makes upgrades useless and it even more impossible for new alliances to get into 00
unnerf please it took me long enough to make money before now it takes me twice as long ratting sucks i dont want to have to do it for days just to fund a few simple pvp ships
unnerf it think of the carebears
why did you do thisunerf it please

fix what you broke and please stop being stupid unnerf our space please  ty 
unnerf it and or nerf things in empirebad move on ccps part to suddenly bring in a stupid idea no one asked for people who probably never entered 00 or play the game period think up the stupidest ideas

unerf ifthey should have kept the old system as the crappiest one then make lower sec better than that maybe some upgrades for larger groups or capsgive us back isk to afford more pvp shipsbesides other than the conflict between the russians and nc has there really been more fighting over areas with good anoms
unerf pls
as before pls thank you making more iskies in high sec than nullsec kinda missed the point of nullsec home bases

i believe dreadnaughts should be buffed to become carriersuper carrier killersfirst there siege mode should be changed to only give increase damage bonus to structures so they are still great for pos bashinghowever there base damage should be increased dramatically dreads should be able to effectively fight and kill carriers and super carriers without having to go into siege mode make dreads mini titans without the ddthis would give a huge counter to the current super carrier blobs that dominate 00 warfare these sc blobs need a counter and that would be dreadsso in short1 change siege mode to only increase damage against structures2 increase dread damage so there able to fight and kill carrierssuper carriers
amensigned
this is an innovative idea thats never been posted beforegreat scott
dreads suck we all know it were bringing this not your specific idea but dreads needing love up at the summit during our ship balancecapship balance thingie
the major problem with dreads is not their capabilities directly but that theyve been superseded in most roles by supercarriers  if every supercarrier was deleted from the server tomorrow most of the balance issues with dreads would go away toothey could use some tweaks the 5minute siege cycle is a nobrainer but the focus of any capital hull rebalance should be on limiting the omnipotence of supercarriers so that they dont outperform all other options in nearly all circumstances
problem with making them into minititans is that of subcapitals dread tracking may not be stellar but with full damage out of siege you merely swap the sc blob for a dreadcarrier blob remove ability of bombers to target structures cut siege in half  did wonders for triage is a no brainerthat is provided ccp and null insists on blobbage should be the one and only option as far as sov warfare is concernedthe fabric of spacetime is already becoming moist from the mere uttering of those words  best not
yes definately dreads had a role when pos warfare ruled now it doesnt and now they gather dust cos noone wants to buy themdefinately give them a newadded roleyes
thatas a class dreads are balanced excellently they have a specific role theyre horribly vulnerable to subcapitals and require a support fleet they have to commit to a fight because of siege mode and cant just teleport out on a whim this is a powerful argument for not cutting siege to five minutessupercarriers break all three of these points hence the answer lies not in changes to dreads but in changing supercarriers so that they follow these three rules
 dread siege reduced to 5 min cycle time make supers vulnerable to support ships by not allowing them to lock anything smaller than a capital remove the ability to fit anything other than fighters and fighter bombers on super carriers and remove titan
i like as the only buying force to buy one is to bash an online tower thats it 12bil doesnt seem to justify that cost imo take a few scs to knock out gunsew than get a lot of people with stealth bombers and glass cannon bss to take out the tower since its so easy and cheap to use either there wouldnt be much point in having a dread though i must admit i also found a fun use of dreads to use during mass testing events on sisi and take a moros with ions and siege for the pvp part and destroy all ships that dont moveand you would be surprised how many people dont lolbut yeah other than that theres really not much role for a dread for the price of it so i defiantly agree they need to do something done and without the stupid snotty response from ccp theyre not called super dreadnaughts for a reason hurf derf that was one of the dumbest responses from ccp during fanfast
this i would say dreads are the most balanced ships in eve themselves the issue is supercaps not dreads
im so sick of these multispec eccms being fit on ships how am i suppose to jam anything if every ship if every ship out there has a get out of jail free card im constantly losing my blackbirds when im in low sec pvping because people decide this is the cool thing to do at least make the playing field evenccp stop this travestynow
firstbut seriously yeop
fully agree there is nothing worse when when my falcon alt uncloaks and misses a jam cycle because someone is running the most annoying inspace graphic even seen
the playing field is even if you put eccm in your mids instead of tank or tackle you are nerfing your ship vs any nonewar opponent which most of them areyour problem is you dont want to learn how to play your toon and properly fly a jam ship you want an instantwin button your request makes about as much sense as asking ccp to remove all tanking cloaking warp stab and mobility modules from the game so that everything gets tackled and instapopped if you want ecm that works 100 of the time fly gallante w sensor dampers and load up 23 scripted damp modules how about you go to ewar school using the link below then at least you will have the information to competently fit your ship and pick your opponents maybe you will even figure out why soloing most pvp ships larger than frigate with your blackbird is a bad idea a rook is a much better ship for that but in either case being a good ewar pilot is 90 pilotingship fittingpicking your opponent and only about 10 dependent on how much sp you put into ewar skills definitive guide to ewarewar is a fleetgang support strategy with the insane range you have with jammers my ewar pilot has 110km optimal jam range on his bb you shouldnt lose bbs in lowsec maybe if you run into an arty battleship gang and heres a hint for that scenariowarp off instead of dying and crying
theres a counter to falcons you whine about it
lol i thought i would never see the day that ecm pilots would be complaining
i support this proposition even more
dont spam localand i need eccm to be unprobeableskill an other shipcaldari is ugly d
fix eve sounds
in other news ccps response to this thread seems to confirm the fact that they do not have any plan in place which is really really a disappointmentfix eve sounds
as stated in another threadi wonder if ccp can detect the  of people with sound on vs offthe only reason i play without sound is that i often play with multiple accounts the sound from the account out of focus usually annoys me so i turn it off by switching through multiple accounts they end up all with sound offwould be nice to have the option to have sound off for windows out of focus or a shortcut key to turn sound on and off havent checked if there is one honestly either that andor have an advanced selection of sounds we want to hear
i play eve from two clients at times ive disabled sounds because multiclient wsound can result in ctds and bsod having done some research on this very annoying problem i eventually discovered that the problem is not with ccp or eve it is with the fact that i prefer and use creative labs sound cards one file in the driver set has a fundamental flaw in it then when combined with certain applications can result in sudden instability it is from my research something that is known reported complained about and nothing being done about this was from reading creatives forums  guess what whining ensues there as welli would suspect that the true problem is simply one of legacy control of irqs at some point both eve clients will try to make a specific sound that triggers on the same interrupti would like ccp to eventually make it so that multiclient players can have true multiclients as we once did in the past this would allow individual settings of which client has sound and which one does not however that being said the truth is that the fundamental flaw i encounter is not one of ccps making
i know a good deal of people who would stake their pvp reputations on the fact playing eve with sound off lags less
tldraccess to plexes restricted by rank agents respond to rank not standing and give keys to access plexeshigher rank plexes are more profitable encouraging pvp between all levels of skill to try and gain rankranks are based on kill count per weekmonth and quality of the kills the rank of the victimfw pilots have access to unique equipment that can only be used by fw pilots rendering it a career worth pursuingfarming can only occur if you maintain your rankmass killing lower ranks in starter plexes wont cut it for the big ranks hence the quality part of determining rank higher ranks will have earned it through pvp and likely need the extra income as a result of the pvp costs they incurso the rough idea is this fw ought to be a form of income for pvp players inherently pvp can cost a lot of isk what i propose is that fw plexes and therefore the bulk of what fw is made of can only be accessed by players of a certain ranki actually know very little on fw but ive tried it a few times trying to get into it it sounds good on paper and well you all know its anything buthave fw broken down based on the pvp ranks within fw make the plexes require keys to enter and thus agents to access an agent much like standard agents will only speak to you if you hold the necessary rank thus larger more profitable and dangerous plexes are accessible only to players of a higher caliberranks need to then be based off of something other than standings or farmers could just grind the rank the solution much like ranks in other games base them on kills per week or month i know this will sound very wowlike but you may want to consider higher ranks requiring a minimal rank kill to count in other words a high rank shouldnt be there because he mass ganked a bunch of bottom ranks in a lowend plex this has several effectsencourages fw by making pvp have tangible gains and benefits higher level plexesmaybe even make parts of the lp stores accessible only to certain ranks a private shouldnt be able to buy the topoftheline ammunitionranks are based on kill count as well as the quality of the kill the rank of the victim this keeps higher rank pilots seeking other high rank pilots to keep their status will they still go and waste lowend pilots of course but to keep that rank youll need to engage in real fights a win win if youre a true pvp fanatic anywayscertain faction items will be available only to fw pilots making that aspect of eve a defined role fw pilots will experience benefits for putting themselves at risk and have a way to gain isk to sustain themselves through pvp no more regular missions yaymechanics wise on plexes thats a whole different story and one i really cant begin to tackle i made this proposal to try and make fw more appealing and more defined as a career in eve the fw zones need to be expanded in my opinion and im sure the plexes need work thoughts
why do people post in colors why
i dont know but i wish they would stop
this will never happen i could go on and on with a million reasons but ill stick with just this how will limiting income increase pvp
as a nonbotter it was hard enough to keep up with replacing pvp ships anywayimo i think ccp are attempting to reduce blobs and or bottersdrfs slow but steady progress in to germinate and vale  the north will soon be full of raven belt ratters that log moments after a neut enters systemits amazing how many bot are over in the drone regions i was gob smacked
hello everyone ive recently moved out to nullsec for the first time and while the probing mechanic is a lot of fun and as any vet knows drastically improved over the old system i would like to see this pos module reintroduced to the game with a couple of changessystem scanning array when used detects all signatures in the system only displays a list of the sites but you cant warp to them columns of information displayed id scan group group remaining life of signature if applicablereimplimenting this with the proposed changes would do two things that i think are needed first it will allow easier sharing of site information with the corp so anyone who wants to do a site can quickly and easily see what is available through a scan additionally it will cut out a lot of filler game time as i like to call it this being the entire hour you can sometimes spend scanning down every signature in the system in order to find the type you want to do more time if you have less than l4 scanning skillsso basically with this you have the ability to make the process easier for system inhabitants leave it unchanged for people new to a system who havent moved in and still require actual probing to be done by system inhabitants after they see whether or not the site they want exists but as someone who lives there and has invested in the scanning array they instantly know which signatures that they should look at to find what they want
hi csmas a relative new player slowly coming up on 2 years i have a proposal that i hope could spark more new players to try pvp more than once at least during the early stages of the game let me explain what i meanas it is now the cost of loosing a ship during a war dec is only a small part of the total cost due to the fact that more than likely youll end up losing you pod as well  along with all those expensive learning implantsmy proposal is to simply make the learning implants either cheaper or make them insurable eg just as the shipsnow some would say hey if you cant afford to loose your implants then dont go to war with them and this is precisely my point too in fact let me explain my point of view all new players are as i see it more or less bound to their learning implants because1 new players have so many essential skills yet to learn so learning implants is a must2 new players most often do not have access yet to jump clones to safeguard their existing implants and even if they have they would pay a relatively heavy toll by missing out on those esssential sps in the early stages of eve every sp is worth goldthe result of this is that new players often pay up or stay docked up for a loong time as a result of a wardec rather than fighting back due to the overproportional risk they are in fact facing ie they have both less experience and are most often pitted against more advanced fitted ships you only need to try it once or maybe twice to realize it is simply prohibitivly expensive to even try to fight back unless you know exactly what youre doing which new players of course dont yet and when you realise what you need to do to overcome an enemy tactic you often find you needyou guessed it more skill points  and then we are back to the waiting game againthis is a less than desirable state of affairs given this is after all just a game i believe both the mercs and the newbees would have a better gaming experience in my opinion by just having a go at it  it would lead to a less idle station  gate camping time and b more action  mistakes for the newbees to learn from rather than passing the time managing skill queues and twirling your inactive ships around in an npc hangar or even more boring  playing other games then eve
eidti hate the ingame browser sjust  i agree
why do you think we have the material for war preparation missionswhen i started playing that missions was something new and the price of a standard 4 implant was well above 150 millions now it is 20 millions a basic 3 implant was around 80 millions now it is 10 millions or less a full head of 4 has moved from above 800 millions to 100 make it lower and you can totally remove the 1 and 2 implants from the game
i dont like either of your proposals the cost of implants is relatively low anyhow and reducing their cost to levels where everyone can afford to lose them removes the costbenefit choice that is integral to everything you do in eve if you want the benefits implants give you have to accept the risk of losing themyour complaint about training speeds was somewhat relevant before the removal of learning skills but the few point difference expensive implants make isnt significant anymore many vets dont bother with them and a newbie can certainly progress with good speed without them only reason to care about that anymore is if you are only playing the sp progression gamethe only point worth considering is the lack of jump clones and the assosiated jump clone mechanic there are easy to use jump clone services but such services should be made more easily available or maybe more precisely information about such player provided services should be easily available in the game an alternative would be to allow people to gain access to jump clones in alternative ways that doesnt require increasing your standings by mission grinding the jump clone mechanic can also be tweaked to allow clone switching more often than once in 24 h to facilitate more spontanious pvp combatso while there is lot ccp can do to improve the situation i dont think implant insurance or reducing the value of implants is the proper or desireable solutionnot supported
you say you want this for new players then call yourself nearly 2 years old a new player for the sake of clarity define new player in your mind 3 months 6 2 years at what age would your proposal cut off

thanks alot guys really enjoyed the chat
i havent forgotten this i doubt were in a position to push an alreadyfully fledged expansion but well see how much political capital we gobble up as time passes i also dont think im a real expert on lowsec ill probably defer to meissa on lowsec issues but lowsec is one of the major ccp abandons features areas we have to contend with along with wormholes t3 ships faction warfare and the 70 of domininon that got cut
i like most of the ideas especially the methnaught that said the vigilantecorrupter mechanic sounds exactly like what fw should have been from the start there is a problem with any module that can only be used in low sec though and thats there is no demand for export thus it would never be that valuable instead such things should be only produced and traded in low sec but available for use everywhere
im sure you missed something there
botters will always exploit the weakest link  so pushing them out of mining mostly moves them into mission macros you need something to address bothalso the fancy bots use memory reading and python injection so this would have to avoid that as well
as a response to all the naysayerswith most of the races which have been updated ccp took care to ensure the appearance of the new characters were similar to the old onesfor example caldari civire minmatar brutor gallente jin meieven the caldari achura kept their japaneseesque appearance although much improvedmy girlfriend created a beautiful vherokior avatar one which she loved and she even wrote a little back story to her for those interested she was a babyfaced riddick style killervherokior looked sort of white with a slight oriental hint however when she reactivated her account and found her character transformed into what she described as a vietnamese rice farmer she was so upset that she deleted the character and started againthis is not racist at least not intended as offensivebut with the graphical improvement vherokior characters did not expect a complete race changenow as asian people go not every one has tiny slits for eyes we all know this anyway why can we not change the eyes are all vherokior females sisters give us at least some bounds for change ive spent hours trying to make a face which fits the back story but the best i can get is a butch lesbian michelle rodriguez lookalikea little breathing room is better than none and personally i see no reason to oppose this call aside from the racist trolls this is a very valid point which should be addressed  vherokior are the only race which has completely changed its ethnicity overnight with the new character creator
oh and supported x
what a load of bullst find one post just one where you or someone else in the nc posted prior to the anomaly change about the technetium monopoly in the north being bad for the game find and point me to that post do that and ill believe that you care about the game and not just about continuing your own coalitions financial dominance
yeh i dont like the current ship designs at alledit possibly add a legacy models visual option
not supported ive become way too attatched to the old models we all know and lovethe only ship i would want changed is the griffin and i like the model itself it just doesnt make sense that when it is moving forward it has engines pointed left right and forward all turned on edited for grammar
im all for new skins but the same shapes as already said i want the classic look still there scorpion was changed a good amount but not so much its unrecognizable from its original form the scorp tail is still there1 for new skinsbut keep the classic shapespace potato could be coolerbut the new dominix still needs to be a bulbous hulk it is afterall a massive dronebattleship
youre way too conservative keep the old shapes  come on the only ships worthy of a 2011 spaceship game are the amarr for the most part also every ship in the game has been copied and pasted 23 times for t2 models or navy models or pirate models with different skins it took me over 2 months to pilot a command ship that looks just like its t1 counter part thats lame considering the game has been supported for 8 years
working on poking at the art department about models and skins it might even be an entire summit topic in may aesthetics are very important for player retention imo on a number of levels
i think i got it all but you correct me if im wrong will you to anyone whos seen other posts from zero regarding people who disagree with him that should look very familiar particularly the part about lying and trolling hes very fond of that whether he has a leg to stand on or notdoes anyone else think this is a ridiculous assertion in a world where anything might be possible it remains very improbable to the point of absurdity satanists do exist yes but is it reasonable to think the guy playing one in a game is potentially a satanist in real life would it be something youd be concerned aboutby comparison i suggest that a griefer for example in the game of eve has a fair chance of being a griefer in real life much less of a stretch lets take a case in point zeros focus of hero worship is the mittani aka mittens aka mits or mitts as in get your mitts off my stuff mitts plays a griefer in the game of eve hes very good at it and seems to enjoy it a great deal on the forums he describes himself as a sadist his exact term and sees nothing wrong with this griefer in game griefer in real life point proven i should point out that i do not personally see this as necessarily being a character defect if the rumor of him being a lawyer is true it may even be an occupational assetit was in response to this statement by lordelfa that i gave several examples of how its possible for someone to be in real life what they are in the game with regard to certain behaviors i did this because elfa seemed to be suggesting that people who act in a certain way in the game arent going to act that way out of the gamewindjammer

naturally windy is lying and trolling again the clue is that hes posting about me naturally i point out when people are lying and trolling when ya know they actually are those people who disagree with me without lying and trolling dont get called on it but of course windy knows that and is trolling about it thats why when ive proven over and over that windy is a liar and a troll just check the number of faked quoted he provided to troll so his pattern is to either a ignore the actual factual logical refutations of his pathological lying and handwave about how theyre wrong never actually being able to show how theyre wrong of b use the kind of an hominem fallacy hes using here windjammer not the sharpest knife in the drawer recognizes that its ridiculous to claim that someone playing an evil mage in dd might be a satanist but thinks its perfectly reasonable to think that someone who plays a griefer in eve might be scum in real life earlier he lied and claimed that this was a false analogy and a strawman again the test is windy making a claim about me yes is it on the forums yes is he lying and trolling do i even need to askof course as windy doesnt post at me without lying and trolling ive engaged in no hero worship windy however is obsessed with the mittani to the point of conducting a libelous internet campaign against an internet cite that publishes his stuff and him personally in order to get him fired windy is is obsessed with mittens personally and with people being masters and superiors in an internetspaceship game there are several leather clubs that can cater to windys odd obsession but trying to shoehorn it into eve is more than a little bit creepy of course windy is almost definitely lying and trolling as is standard only an idiot would believe that offering factual refutations to accusations made against someone means that the person is hero worshiping or wants to be the slave to the master or wants to be the inferior to the superior person most likely windy is just enraged by being proven wrong and is desperately casting about for personal insults he can possibly use as windy doesnt know anything about even basic logic this is just one of his series of already debunked fallacies itd be like finding one dd player who was also a satanist and declaring point proven
i really hope the new and improved new forums have an ignore feature
id be willing to sacrifice an ignore feature if we got an intelligence test that was required before people could post
as do i its much needed alternately id be just as pleased with a properly administered intelligence test or even a standard of judgment to determine worth of content which could be used to eliminate a ton of postsof course in the later theyd have to hire on another moderator or more just to keep upwindjammer
1 wrong forum2 youve been trolledhard
how about the ability to create tabsfolders in your ships cargo hold instead all ships
ammunition storage slots would be better so you could put 23 crystals on one laser and switch between them using a small crystal iconthis would work for laser turrets as wellfor railcannon you would be able to store extra rounds of a bullet type on a weapon like this 2002000 or 1201200 or 20200 or 40400 etc so each weapon recieves an amount of reloads before it must be fully reloaded assuming computerized machines or crews handle the reloading of your space vesselalthough there should also be personal slots to store important things that are not sellabledisposable loottabbable cargohangars is probably the best idea of course so i agree with the above posteralso while im thinking of it maybe mining barges can access industrial cargo holds without using a can like with an orca which would cut down on pirate harassment for newbie miners
and yet you still havent found the post in which i advocated mitts be fired you who are so fond of quotes can find nothing can you find anything in this thread showing i advocated tentonhammer take a specific action of any kind against mitts no interesting what exactly did i advocate little duck and now youre saying that unless i supply you with a demand i might make of tentonhammer im a liar and a troll what an interesting train ofwould you call it logicwheres your rope zero i dont seem to be able to see it or is that what youre walking on looks very frayedwindjammer
i know youre horrible at logic but ive already pointed out what your demand is and pointed out that if you cant supply what you claim is your real demand that the logical necessity stands you are demanding the only possible change that someone can make to stop an opinion column from printing opinions that is to remove it from publication its okay ive given you enough rope to hang yourself you will either point out what actual action youre demanding tth take to stop opinions in an opinion column or prove yet again that you are a liar and a troll its very simple let me guess more personal attacks more logical fallacies more alleging that showing how you lie and troll constantly makes someone a forum troll at large but absolutely no answer as to what youre demanding tth do to stop opinions in an opinion column
im still waiting for you to show where i advocated mitts be fired let me give you a little bit of information it doesnt exist no matter how hard you try to pretend that it does i see you manufacture a demand but claim i made it and you cant show where i made such a demand thats because the demand doesnt existthen you say that unless i provide an alternate demand your created one must be true because you zero cannot imagine anything else calling it the only possibility and you call thislogic hmmm perhaps it is zero logic has a ring to ithave i made a demand of mitts of tentonhammer of anyone have i done anything other than urge people to write to supporttentonhammercom to express themselvesthat rope around your neck is catching the light in a most fetching manner zerowindjammer

char limit reachednot so much just abandoning features although that is a huge part of it too but also to a smaller degree the tendency to release barebones features in an environment we know is conducive to not revisiting old features too oftenthe approach needs to be twopronged  older features do need to be revisited even if they were quite ok once upon a time but also new features should not be released at all in such a skeletal state so oftenbut yeah on the other hand this csm might as well ignore this particular company policy  marketing aspect of this way too widereaching issue because realistically speaking its something unlikely to have much of an effect if any at all on ccps attitude much less actions so it will practically be a waste of timejust like you cant convince the staff economist that the eve economy is fundamentally unlike the real world economy so his measures at best only do more bad than good when the other important secret ingredient gameplay alterations is missing i suppose it will be almost impossible to sway any of the guys over at marketing that simply pushing out more and more new stuff will not do any goodthen again a more restricted approach ie just the feature abandonment part might have more chances of success so good luck with thathopefully youll get through to some degree
i disagree quality as in software quality and feature polishedness was never a selling point for eve depth endless possibilities pvp and uniqueness were and still are serving a niche market with essentially no competition and having a playerbase that is frustration tolerant minimized the impact of lack of quality for ccp this has led to a management and dev mentality where quality is regarded as of secondary importance however the bigger the game the playerbase and the company grows the meaner the problems arising from that mentality become thus underlining the importance of the call made by you in the opening post
well quality in the broader sense not strictly lacking bugs or similarone could argue that say the game design choices that lead to the depth and width we experience in eve would constitute in itself quality and that the more both of those dimensions is expanded by any additional feature the higher the quality of that particular feature is so in that sense for example pi would be a rather shallow but wide feature quite simplistic if you look beyond the sheer number of buildingschematicmaterial combinations but with a largescale impact on a lot of people so not exactly quite of high quality yet but if its depth could be improved meaningful territorial conflict populationzone management a more involved prospecting process a more involved competition for resources etc it would qualify as being of high quality afterwardsbut yeah you have a point good thing that the conclusion is nevertheless the same
yeah i thought of dwelling on the definition of quality but i was lazyat least we can say that the quality of the game experience is still good enough for us to care to discuss here

i couldnt afford more my the yang anymore so im stuck with the ying i would like to be able to change my name only once in a lifetime would be great imo
yep as long as the char can be found by any past names and that the char info lists all past names im okay with the proposal consequence is a key principle of eve and with this condition it is retained its then just an inconvenience for people doing background checks as the amount of work scales with the amount of names the char under scrutiny hadwhile at it id definitely like to see transfers being listed in the char info just dates really as account name or any other such thing is private
i would like this feature i thought several times i should support my corp and buy a mining alt but then i never found one with a name i relly liked
youre a goddamned hero hired goonshine on

gallente would need some seriously good fixes to become wanted in fleets again virtually all gallente players with any sense cross train early in their careerthe only advantage rolling a gallente character gives you is your in a good spot to cross train minmatar for better ships and some of the best pirate faction boats in the game the only reason a minmatar char would cross train gallente would be to fly the dram cyna machi dont mind the gallente having the same added complexity and more skill intensive nature that the minmtar have given that makes it easy to cross train just wished that training could be applied to some decent gallente ships rather than just preparing you for a nearly inevitable crosstrain into minmatar ships if you want a point of comparison to fly the decent caldari ships you need to mainly just concentrate on shield tanking and missiles amarr mainly just needs to focus gunnery lazors and armor tanking for comparison gallente requires gunnery hybrids tons of drone skills armor tanking shield tanking and comparatively better fitting skills because gallente ships are soo bad on pgcpu minmatar ships require essentially the same skillset as gallente exchanging projectiles for hybrids but have much more effective ships and weapon systems in comparison they are also much easier to fit compared to gallente ships
everyone and their dog knows the draek is op and thats why the drake needs a buff to be competative with it so not everyone is flying the op draek in fact the draek is were all of eves ballancing issues come fromalso on a side note a geddon can do everything a mega can for less isk at 300 the range with 10 less paper dps and geddon doesnt use ammo the geddon can both shoot the guy getting caught in the drag bubble and the guy undocking from the station without having to move

remove or lessen the sec gain from null rats whyif you are bad you can just go back to the safe alliance space and fix your ss without any risk now if null didnt fix ss youd have toa rat in the highsec belts very inefficientlyb go to lowsec belts and be in a danger of being ganked yourselfc grind missions and risk losing your mission ship when someone decides to use their killrights id say people would be more willing to get revenge if it felt like a revenge and not just a nuisance thats got over in 15 minutes at most when you lose a gankship
thread needs some attention from csm members imhomy suspicion is that this would lead to lots of people running missions in lowsec in unprobeable tengus of course some of them would make mistakes from time to timeedit if people would like to give some indication of where they usually go to regain sec status ive started a poll on fhc
this could actually work cautious support
this is strong plan
added to the op cheers
sec status is a fail penalty in my opinion i think it should be removed or revamped and i have an idea that i will get to in a sec we all know people who do crimes could care less about sec so if your thinking this will stop griefers or make pirates stop to think think againif i was going to invent a real penalty i rather see a more real life practice put into the game fine the people who commit crimes now you would not have to pay the fine the fine buys back your sec status kinda like a bounty on your sec status so if you want to go pirate you dont have to worry about paying anything but if your not and want to keep your sec up you will have to pay large sums of isk im thinking like 25 million for every 01 sec status that will make you think twice about committing a crime
lets see 2 man corp recently you left never been in any major corporations hardly any historypost with your main  o pthats all i can say to that
you realise that you posted the op with a character that is in ministry of war rightpost with your main
completely unenforceable
lol i think this what the op meant by trolls and idiotshere is one right herein defence of the op you tried to state that he was alt purely cos he was in a npc corppeople leave corps then join npc he may not want to be in a player corpto be honest its ppl like you who we need to get off the forums angry teenagers with attitudebut personally signed will it happen tbh ccp dont seemto care about the trash posting thats why ppl use alternatives and why ppl troll because ccp allows it shame really as a company ccp lacks any morality but that comes fromthe top mr ccp ceops the only people who wouldnt support this are the trolls and douches and aint that the truth
caod is the perfect example that prohibiting neutral alt posting does not magically make the forums any less horrible
no heres why

dont even joke about thatop the amount of  poasting wont be affected by your proposal and there are legitimate reasons for alt posting mainly that people want to discuss issues instead of having to suffer trolling and flaming because of their mains affiliations and they dont want to suffer inout of game consequenses for just posting on the forum
post with your main at cncoh and u madits funny supporters are actually alt posters hilarityit might help your cases better if you post with your mainsfunny enough id support it too but this whole proposal is nothing more than one big fat troll
you still looking like a 13 yr old teenagerkeep saying the post with your mainseven tho this is you still look stupidand the more you keep trolling the same old bs the more stupid and desperate to be listened to your lookingoh and your boringreally you arezzzzz now run along this is adult talki think you need to ask mummy for a bed time story before you go to sleep seeing you crave so much attention
yepsilly proposal over a minor issue
i dont feel its a minor issue at all its not just about the crap poasting at all its about false supports taking example about someone with 9 alts can make 9 supports is that rightsome with 9 alts can make 9 false references on a service thread oh i forgot scamming is allowed i guess by some of the posts and mittens quote pretty much shows the state of these forums and the dont give a  attitudeand the absolute idiots that play this game thats why it will stay the same old crap with the same old players who would want to come into a community with 999 douches whats new eh
you should listen to the csm fireside chat where mittani pretty much says they current csm arent going to bother with the ah anymore in favor of issuesfeaturesetc that they actually feel ccp will do to showillustrate csm gets things done im fairly sure if something important enough or interesting to their view is put up in ah theyd still look at maybe finding out ccps stance on it but in essence the votes wont matter and really they never did csm took up issues they believed in regardless of the votes and in doing that all it meant was that all the csm would weigh in on the issue and only if they reached a majority vote would bother bringing up the issue with ccp who then still have the option of not doing it saying it is too hard etc and so ontldr the number of upvotes means nothing as no number of upvotes means stuff happens look at the excellence thread
duuuuuuuuuuuudenobody is saying that it isnt a problem just that your proposed solution would do no big deal to alleviate the problemother than the jokingly proposed realid there would be no realistic way of enforcing it and even realid would not be a completely foolproof solutionyou have the problem of first selecting which character out of 3 on the account is the main you say that just pick the one with most sp well what about people where they do have more than one big sp character on an account and the main is actually the second highest sp count one  besides even if you would pick the right character most of the time it would still do nothing about alt accountsso how exactly do you propose to tackle the issue of multiple accounts  its not like ip identification would do much good with a large portion of the playerbase playing from dynamic ips or from behind a natfirewall youd have to get extremely intrusive to even begin to detect which account belongs to which real person and then you have the issue of people that come over their friends house and log into eve because hey they both play eve will you now flag one persons main as the others alt also remember just how upset you were when somebody hinted that you might be an alt just because youre in a npc corporation how do you think people would react all of a sudden when the character they feel is their main is caught by your system and branded an alt like i said your proposed solution is bunkthe fact that the problem might be real is completely irrelevantas long as you propose an inherently unenforceable measure theres no point in discussing it much further
i cant support thisnot that i wouldnt love to have alts stop posting but it just wouldnt work if i wanted i could just post from a character on my second accountor thirdor in some peoples cases the fourth fifth sixth and so onbesides thatwho cares
who cares welcome to the internet you sound like you belong in the idiots that play this game group
i support this topic
i think something like a capital docking port would be cool that could only be place in systems of sov holding alliances would be much like the player owned stations out in null they should not be invulnerable though and should take some sort of upkeep that would not be cheap only other option is maybe have a capital docking array for posses and a way to have an individual hangar for each person so no one steals i dunno im just throwing ideas out there
i agree that super caps shouldnt be able to dock because theyre meant for large allianceson the other hand we now have access to planets maybe in the future well be able to land on them  giving us a realistically large enough place to land and store a super capital sized ship of course something like this should only be viable in systems which your alliance held sovereignty and payed a butt load of isk to build a super cap landing padalso lol
bumpingrailguns have terrible damage tracking and fitting reqs
your suffering amuses meedit also trebors basically right
how did i miss this threadmittens quick tell me what to post
post something about how your ideas are entirely your own and youre not being coerced by me in any way shape or form  you just happen to agree with mepeople love that 
blank stare i am my own person i am in no way under the mind control of the mittenssrsly guys troll more this is true entertainment
my eleged ceomy eleged csm333
i think hes just sore because hes in the wrong alliance
i for one am quite happy with the current lineup and especially the chairman of the csmthe player base got what it deserved for not taking more of an interest but it also got what it needed because lets face it this particular csm will probably be the one most likely to actually push some of the better stuff since it presents a mostly united frontso sorry op totally and completely not supported
perhaps it didnt occur to you but there are people outside of alliance blocks that support the candidates they put forward the first 5 csms had their chance now its time for a real csm to represent the real eve players
lmaochairman lmao actually
the idea of a democracy is lost on some people
lets have a vote to abolish democracy 
stupid colour didnt read
first of all this is a troll second thats the way democracy works deal with it kid
i disagree this isnt voting for a president where its just a popularity contest race for 1 leader csm is more like voting for congressmen a proxy who is supposed to be representing hisher people in these cases each state has a certain number of seats that they can fill depending on their population so what csm is missing is some sort of tie to the constituents that the representatives are supposed to be representing for example if say 70 of the population in eve live in empire space then 70 of csm seats should be from there and so forththe problem is how you can register people to a constituency im not sure how this can be done but one way may be to instead divide up new eden into corporationalliance constituents at a given census time all corp membership is recorded and the populations of each alliancecorp tallied sort them first by alliance then sort them by empirepirate faction using perhaps the top standing faction they are friendly with evenly subdivide the total population of new eden by the number of seats on the csm and every multiple of the number each group of constituents has earns them 1 seat for that groupwhat we want to achieve here is proper representation of the population and not the upholding of the elite establishment by large alliancesfounding fathers once had the same problem and we all know where that ended up
populism  democracyit was an issue that i brought up when the final draft of the proposal paper the one that went to the nytimes was shown to me at fanfest and i am quite suprised that it took 6 cycles to reach this stage the point is a streight up numbers voting system like this does not reprisent minorities like fw that will never reach the organizational and numerical advantage that voting blocks such as 00 which completely dominate this year and will dominate from this year onwards until they lose interest  ie it becomes useless i suppose its not a problem for societies that dont have or do not recognizecare about minorities such as iceland and switzerland
youre assuming two things first every member of 00 votes for a 00 candidate and two 00 candidates dont add aspects of fwhighseclowsec changes to their platforms to get votes outside their normal powerblocs lol politicsunless you can prove otherwise mittens and other members of the csm werent elected just due to their good looks and charm they were elected based on platforms and their ability to get their message out to the voters people that did well in this election cycle actually took the time and effort to get their constituents out to vote for them or candidates with likeminded interests minority candidates have the same opportunities as major candidates and simply squandered it for the most part for example i didnt hear about any pie candidates in the current election cycle did they have a decent platformyoure also assuming the ageold fallacy that all goons in eve are in goonswarm and that all goons run around like mindless childrenbesides my ranting come onwho could distrust mittens just look at his adorable little smile his sweet flowing hair his soothing voice swoon
how many times in our history as a species has a lasting peace been made when limited resources andor religionideology has been at stakei see where youre coming from pretty much never but i also like to think that were capable of progressing beyond thatnow i have some questions for youwhen was the last time in history that we had the ability to communicate almost instantly with any other person in the world when was the last time in history that we as a species could look at someone a little different from us but know that they are not so different from us that they feel the same things desire the same securities and tolerance fear the same injusticeswhen was the last time we had the ability to move massive amounts of resources from one corner of the globe to anotherwhen was the last time language barriers were as simple to breakdown as copypasting a line of text into a box and hitting translatehow many times in our history have we tried war only to realize that what we gain often comes at a much greater costand how many times have we actually truly tried to maintain a lasting peaceeinstein insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results we keep making war thinking it will lead to peace and i know that aristotle said we make war so that we may live in peace and there are a number of others i could quote who insist that peace may only come from conflict but all of those who i would quote come from a time when the concept of an eye for an eye was revolutionary and progressivei realize that this is a game but im wondering why we cant show the world that we know that and try to make a difference despite it to pull our heads out of the game for a day to make a statement to the world that despite all our different walks of life we can band together no matter our country of origin or birth language or faithif 1 woman screaming  in libya can be the final push to incite an entire nation into rebellion think what tens of thousands of people across the world can do by making a show of peace
or maybe more people who play this game need to realize what world they actually live in  and do whatever they can to make it a place where future generations can coexist
its a possibility ill give you that however its also equally possibile that well wipe ourselves outirrelevant none of this has to do with human nature which no matter how hard we try to suppress or get around is still there  right now we have the ability to communicate with almost every person around the world hell weve had this ability for almost a century ex mail telegraph direct phone lines etc all this technology has allowed nations and groups to form up logistical efforts faster and more effectively though no group has made more use of this than the military never racism bigotry slaveryhuman trafficking religious fearmongeringsuperiority are all facts of life today as they have been for centuries and i dont see any of them going away so long as there is profit and weakminded zealots to fuel them since the late 1800s weve been able to move large amounts of resources both for need and want today in the early 21st century weve merely perfected this practice and yet we still have global famines poverty and starvation until recently last 10 years or so few of the common man could translate and readhear what the common man of another language were saying yes with the advent of translation technology we can now understand each other better than ever however the results which can be quite clearly seen on the eve boards here between us the chinese and russians can best be described as a flame war with very little civility on who is dumbermore brainwashedsmarter because a peaceful game is a static game and thus not real interesting in the long run not the mention that peace would almost certainly crash the eve economy which depends on ships and mods getting blown uphow does libya have anything to do with eve anyways my points are thiseve is a game based upon the darker elements of humankind elements that we are all quite familiar with ex greed nationalism oligarchies despots piracy etc the game takes these dark elements and creates its own reality by saying what ifmore than that we are immortal we cannot die and without that final of final restraints there is no reason to hold ourselves back from conflict
well im immortaland peace is bad for businessthat is one more reason than i needthere is also fact that blowing other ships is quite a show and the crew well human life is so cheap that one has to wonder if it is even worth remembering
i think that the start date of your toon should be removed because its better if its all a mystery it should only show the current corp your in at the moment with dates and so on but if u go to another corp then that one will show up within all players viewi mean what do i knowits just an idea i just like the mystery as to how old are you really also you dont have to se the texts of people always calling you a noob all the timeserves them rightlol
be quiet noobeditfirstprobably last 
why age really has nothing to do with anything
so you want to remove employment history not supported
10
nerf itand nerf jumpbridges too
unerf it  how are some of us to make isk when you nerfed it i think what you  ccp  did sucks 
drakes too p
unnerf it
unnerf itreluctant cuz i like the idea behind it but ruins any chance for smaller alliances to build themselves up in null sec and make renting system more ccpized which was the whole reason behind dominion
exellent change keep it
keep the changes people have become too used to being spoon fed
after seeing already a major shrink in nc fleet sizes i say to you dear ccpawsum patch keep up the good work o
to everyone who agrees with the nerf go make your own thread  this thread is for people who disagree with the nerfunnerf it was a poor decision made for even worse reasons
good change if the space you have blows now move somewhere better
unerf it all null sec is dangerous and should be equally profitable
make outpost stations destructable so the carebears have to fight for their stuffs
agreed this is the worst change that has happened all year the point of eve is to have billions of isk and be successful but thats impossible with the sanctum nerf 00 was fine as it was the sanctums need to return so that people can continue to make lots of isk to fill the huge fleet amount demandsunnerf it
think i need a bigger bucket to collect the nullbear tears
people who say keep the nerf make your own forumn this is a precise forumnbtw if we stop making money in null sec industry will go down which will mean more high sec prices for you hulks wont be 200 mil anymore theyll be 500 again just expect a rise in prices
unnerf it the change was incredibly shortsighted ed and just horribly bad
nerf it moarrly these ppl cant even check to support their topic they are clearly unable to decide what is good for them or not nerf it more pls
unerf it
the nerf was a good start while you are at it remove level 4 missions from empire nobody should be able to farm that kind of isk hiding under concords skirt
unerf it
unnerf it
unerf it please
unerf it if an alliance can raise the isk involved and logistically manage to get ihubs and upgrades out here then they damn well deserve a decent reward from doing so it still doesnt make your space safe at the end of the day usually more attractive to the enemy in most cases
you people disagreeing with this are stupid its like if ccp decided your mission tengus were way to good at lvl 4s and just removed them from the game without compensation people are ed that their upgrades are worthless now having to haul them in a freighter is a major pita and all that work is lost with this nerf also without being able to farm sanctums the potential iskhr for 00 drops significantly sure theres still exploration pi mining belt ratting all that crap but none of it compares to having unlimited personal missions in the complete safety of highsec suicide gankers blablabla fly a cheaper ship it shouldnt be mandatory for everyone in 00 to either jump clone to highsec or have an alt that can run lvl 4s in highsec either a move lvl 4s to null and low quality lvl 4s to lowsec highsec gets 1s and 2s lowsec gets 3s and low quality 4s 00 gets 4s and 5s this isnt forcing anyone to nullsec you simply just have to run crappier missions or move to lower security space following the riskreward balance eve is based on also nerf unprobeable tengus buy raising the probing strength not nerfing sensor strength b keep all the carebears happy and undo the changes sure its just as stupid as it was before but whatevs it kinda worked now ccp if you want to break up coalitions then get rid of jump bridges and presto no more 1500 man fleet fights more of a trickle of ships comming in to defend an area it forces allainces to focus forces and allows a lot of crappy space to be open and free for potential small allainces to take to and grow in boom you guys should hire me and all your problems would be gone with this game lets let the carebear whining commence about how unfair this is and threats about how many people will leave eve if you nerf highsec how about you try out 00 before knocking it pvp isnt much different than pve you just click on red squares not that many people will quite eve and the people that will quite were not going to stick with the game anyway
ccp did this with my whole caldari race  poor caldari only left is the noobish drake and falcon now everybody fliest op matar
tengu falcon drake raven gila crow hawk caracal sometimes kitsune ok maybe you got a point but gallente ishtar dominix taranis myrmmaybe proteus caldari is pretty sweet in that they are rather versitle most of their ships can both active and passive tank can be nanoed and missiles always hit not to mention the ungodly range of ecm and heavy missiles
rly crow rly caracal omg  gila o  hawk no no more jokes pls  kitsune yeah eas are craptengu cool another pve ship  oh and the raven is there anybody still using that o
hello i have one suggestion which in my game will improve at least for some people by purchase of the lp store you can give the opportunity to buy larger quantities at once for example i have 180 000 lp and lp of turning the sisters combat probe 1800lp and it is up to a hundred you click accept this would give you the option to buy the thing at the same time hundreds of times and it would save time and problems with the lags during the buyingps sorry for my english a low
yes this has been requested many times and still hasnt been addressed so still supported
someone should slip this one on a note to team bff
old idea and still universally supported i think it reduces server load makes it more user friendly and wouldnt take but 2 minutes to program
yup
yes1signeddu et ccp
hey everyonei would like to ask if the csm could put in a word to ccp about drone navigation i love using drones and right now there is one small thing that bugs me a lot and that is that i can not launch my drones with a shortcut i can basically do everything needed once they are launched attack pull back orbit and return to dronebay this can all be done with shortcuts however launching drones still needs to be done manuallyi would like to ask if the csm could put this feature on their list its a really minor change and it would add so much more to the playability for me atleastgreetzjoyana
while id like this as well theres some aspects to be discussed the shortcuts would probably work on a perdronegroup basis but those groups are tied to a ship so shortcuts would end up being shipspecific not a problem but something to be aware ofso id suggest reworking the drone grouping to allow for two new thingsa allow managing drone groups while dockedb allow adding shortcuts to drone groups and store the setting on the server or client
supportedif i were to select all my drones in the bay right now and launch all of them i would either get the 5 or if there r more a random 5 at the very least this should be a shortcut as a quick and temporary bandaid
interacting with drones needs to be streamlined across the board both for the host and the target
i proposes better linux support this would entail having one dev tweaking the client to run better under wine im not asking for a full port just some attention to a player base that is at least as big as the os x player base assuming a player distribution similar to cross platform games
of course i support my proposal
mac client has a much larger user base and hasnt been fixed since like apocrypha dominion really ed us mac users over
how about better cross platform support then
before you used to be able to interact with your agent in more ways than accept and decline take a scenario for examplehey joe i need you to go run 5 copies of this manuscript for meacceptthanks and yes id love some coffee tooversushey joe i need you to go run 5 copies of this manuscript for meyeah sure want me to get some coffeethanks and yes id love some coffee tooin the real world you dont literally say accept or decline like a robot to your betters when they assign you a task this is immersion breaking and even makes some of the mission text not make sense consider incarna too when it is implemented soon the acceptdecline method will really need to be worked on so that your character does not seem like a robot in interactionsin the end youre still clicking somewhere to initiate a mission bringing back the quirky responses would just make sense
ships that are not in combate can freely self destruct would be happy with a 10 second count downships with any form of pvp agression cannot perform the self destruct action while in space
translation when a pirate holds a target hostage if the target doesnt eject or pay the 100 mil ransom that he doesnt have to honor he can be held indefinitely until he finally gives in out of boredom andor frustration of waiting long enough and having better things to do than stay glued to a screen the whole day
denial of fitting intel and loot is a valid tactic so no the selfdestructed ship is still just as dead as it would be if you blew it up you realise
hello togetheri would like to discuess an idea so heres an exampleyou want to buy a ship from the contracts fitted with multiples modules rigs and dronesif you now check the prerequisites of the assembled ship then youll only see the skills you need to fly that specific ship no word about the modules rigs and drones this works perfect if you are buying a naked ship fresh from the market and assemble itheres an example about a retriever
this feature already exists but only for savedlinked fittings would make perfect sense to have that for contracted ships as well
discussion of moderation removed as per the forums rules
supported
maybe just require standings with the local factions for reps ie the caldari like me so they try and keep my ships alive when someone else aggresses me maybe they will stay out of the fight if the attacker also has high standingsit doesnt negate suicide ganking but it certainly doesnt make it easier
i have a counter proposal just make the system scanning array a usable pos mod like a gun make it sit outside of the pos shields just like a gun so it can launch probes make it require the same skills and possibly high scanning skills as well then boost the arrays probe strength by a large amountthis way pilots still have to work for their intel and scanning gets faster for people who invest in a systemthis in my opinion would be a win win for everyone but seriously this mechanic is working as it was intended you get a much higher income rate from exploration sites and therefore an hour of work really do you constantly have 50 sigs in your system should give you more reward than usualps this is not wow and ccp is not required to give you a map to your cookie i know that you dont want warp ins but then again a normal map doesnt walk for you either
not supportedand im really curious how you can consider yourself a relatively new player at nearly the two year markthe learning implants cost what they cost because its an open market their cost is dirt cheap because the market is flooded with the damn things from all the missioners doing materials for war prep having ccp make changes to make the implants even cheaper would be just a nerf to highsec storyline mission rewards which can be pretty horrible alreadyas for jump clones a one day old player could join one of the jump clone corporations and install a jump clone l1 of the skill takes a brand new player 8 minutes without implants and a million isk which could be a heavy toll but thats neither here nor there or they could simply join a corporation full of missioners that offer jump clone services once youve got a jc installed somewhere you have a perfectly safe spot to hide your implants during war decs or pvp operationsand i doubt either of these changes would convince the afk warbears to undock and try having a go at itedit inb4 someone supports the idea so they could create new characters to get a leg up on cheap learning implants to make some easy isk
on april 16th at 2000 csm 6 held its first of many fireside chats as outlined in our recent devblog
how do you feel about incursions
why do you list the anomaly change as a scandal
because hilmar said there would be more communication about how things were going to change and that anom nerf was deployed without communicating to any of the csmsor wasnt that tinfoilhatty enough for you
because they need something to rage about
while it would be nice if the csm could make a differenceeveryone knows ccp disregards the csm as and when it feels like paying it only lip service in there plansthe anom changes are a very good example of this disregard
temporarily moved to general discussion for more discussionthanks to the council of stellar management members for this unique and important initiative heres hoping that everyone who spends time in new eden finds some time to listen to this recording even if just while mining or en route somewhere or waiting around for your fleet to assemblein order to foster wider discussion wed love to see this link shared and issues talked about in a wider arena on your corp message boards the tweetfleet and csm6 twitter hashtags and here in this thread the feedback loops are important for the csm itself to better represent you and the more data obviously the better
yes we can give feed back on this threadi listened to it live and liked the info it contained hope everyone gives it a listen as well
yes this is why it was labeled as a scandal i believe it was covered in detail during the mitannis talk
i love the idea and am thankful that theres a recording it will give me something to do on my nearly threehour drive to work tomorrow morning thanks guys looking forward to it

herp derp industry expanshun u haz awesum orca so shut up11
please give a nsfw warning when linking to audio file of mittani performing autofellatio
this is one of the main reasons you can never find csm info cuz its in the wrong place a noob who has just figured out that the csm section on the eve main page is utter crap and that he needs to visit the forums where there is a specific csm section will now not find this thread there being completely oblivious of its existance he will prolly never see it
it was covered in detail during the mittanis talk multiple times in fact i believe marconus orion is just one of those guys
i didfile size is approx 50 mblength is about 2 hoursexplicit language
maybe try checking firstwhen ccp manifest moved the thread he left a reference to it so it actually is posted in the right place and its posted here too for a few weeks
nah you misread the trolling draco its not hey theres nsfw language here mark it appropriately its lowell mittens is blowing himself hey everybody im clever im saying mittens is blowing himself
oh lol yea i failed i was internet reading read the first few words and moved on oh well
interesting stuff thanks for posting the audioon the industrial expansion at least some recognition was given that the original plans were shelved in favour of stackless io and that the whole idea hasnt been totally forgotten aboutthere were so many ideas floating around at the time largely rumours and false hopes that some digging around on what the expansion would really have been and what may be expected in the hope not too distant future could be a useful thing for the csm to ask ccp about if only to manage expectations out here and get you guys clued up on what was shoved under the carpet back then
well this hardly encourages people to post to the csm or instills confidence that they will be listened to
yes please give the leaders of certain alliances a heads up on all game changes so they can use them to their advantage in game if ccp did have to run all game changes by the csm first i think it should only be fair that the rest of the eve player base have an opportunity to see the proposed changes at the same time
excellent topic im downloading the mp3 right now could we hope a total debriefing for those who like me arent amazing englishspoken people  edit wow  man youve convince me  csm6 rocks 
what the hell was that no one apart from mittani was allowed to speak
i threatened to strangle anyone who spoke out against me  through the internet
pretty sure therell be a grace period between when the changes are published till they go livei strongly doubt youre going to get much more transparency than that certainly not so far as to seeing each and every draft of every proposal that ccp employees think upthis was covered in the session at least once
no wonder ccp doesnt take the csm seriously when the chairman starts insulting the intelligence of anyone who doesnt ask a patsy question
so any plans to make this more accessible to those of us that have hearing problems and any idea roughly how long some time may be
after im done with some more certification exams that end on wednesday i will happily transcribe the audio for five billion isk
um no a paper thin reason was given but the fact that even when mittens was asked questions about things he admitted to knowing nothing about he didnt even think to hand it over to one of the otherswhy doesnt he trust the other candidates to speak sensibly he is only one voice on the csm after all
i like the csms focus on improving the way ccp maintains the larger game vs focusing on specific hot button issues diemost dreads hybrids ewar supercarriers fw mining and any other ship module or feature complaint are symptoms of the bigger problem that is the lack of ongoing itteration by ccp as the mittani said this game is full of sucking wounds focusing on any one of those wounds isnt focusing on the bigger problem team bff has shown some real results from the thousand papercuts perspective and has actually improved gameplay the only thing players actually see i can only hope that ccps management is open to taking that process to the next levelas a benifit by directly focusing on improving ccps process and improving eve indirectly the csm can avoid the appearance of bias on specific issues anything that improves the csms legitimacy to the players is imo a good thing
but they did speak and they also said that they would have no hesitation speaking up if something was said they disagreed with or was not covered so whats the problem again
a combination of the dunningkruger effect and the prevalence of lead based paint
nvm im an idiot
interesting talk made me reevaluate my preconceptions of goonsnc mittens has all the braincellsreally like the focus and the direction you showed an understanding that this is a business you are dealing with and retaining that concept is key to successful negotiations i hope that you will not get sidetrackedwell done
dang now i have to start thinking mittani is secretly evil instead of openly evil one of the things talked about was documentation i just wanted to point out that eve is quite well documented even officially through the star team the fact that the star teams on going official documentation seems to receive less official support than some 3rd party one concerns me why does the ingame help screen send you to the knowledge base that ccp claimed was going to be retired when the evelopedia came out why does that search not send new players to the much more useful evelopedia in what other ways are the isd teams which have been in place a lot longer than the csm not being supported by ccp
im taking a wait and see posture right now because i joined before the election i couldnt vote and rightly sono complaints there i think that if the goons and their allies in the csm understand that they now represent all of the eve playerbasebig nullsec alliances small nullseccers wildcatters lowsec pirates pvpers and dwellers and yes hisec carebears as well then theyll do ok if not and this is nothing more than an elaborate goon prank then from what i understand about the csm theres very little real damage they can do the csm has no actually authority as far as setting game policies is concernedit merely acts as an intermediary and advisory body between the players and ccp with both groups being able to ignore csm if they feel the need to do so ccp doesnt have to follow the csms recommendations and we players do not have to go through the csm to express our ideas recommendations or concerns to ccpbasically its up to the mittani and the other goons as to how they want to shape the csm if theyre truly interested in representing the interests of the entire eve community then thats great if not dont worry no real damage will be done as this csm will be nothing more than a series of high level meetings with low level thinking
if eve was a real place the one ship which each faction would have developed is an anti capital ship and weapon this class of ship perhaps a second black ops ship for each race would be able to sneak up to a capital ship and blow it up so i imagine it should be skill intensive to fly and use maybe skills like cloaking 5 black ops 5 ect i would also make the ship extra vunerable to all none capital ships its only defence would be the ability to fly cloaked it would work by flying cloaked to 0 or 500m of its target decloaking and activating its weapon destroying itself and the target ship the time delay between decloaking and weapon activation being reduced by a skill this is to give a defensive ship a little time to defend the target ship though i would also make it almost impossible for capital ships to target or defend against it without support this ship would obviously have a large impact on gameplay a single titan or mothership being vunerable to a single pilot capital blobs needing frigs and cruises for defence against the ship might make 00 far more accessable for smaller groups 
wrong forum should post in the assembly hall
they have two practically 3 the titan the dread and whats ususally used is the super carrier
1 you cant read2 you still cant read clearly says i put it in the wrong forum and i found it funny enough to post
purpose specific bays are an integral part of the ship constructs since at least 2008  the code is all there to use them plans to move ammo into such bays for balance and gameplay have been  abandoned this one could easily be added to the list for ccps future balance doodadding multiple crystals to each laser sounds more like something that would require coding to support and is a real change ask for stuff thats easy for them to do and you are more likely to get a result ie no art no design no coding  just tweaking numbers is easy and takes longer to talk about and document than to do and qaunfortunately ccp have no business process dedicated to iterative balancing like we all expect from other games companies  yet
this topic should be moved to the assembly hall
its very simplelet me guess more personal attacks more logical fallacies more alleging that showing how you lie and troll constantly makes someone a forum troll at large but absolutely no answer as to what youre demanding tth do to stop opinions in an opinion columnas i said providing you with enough rope to hang yourself youve complied easily you still cant point out what your actual demand is that would have tth stopping mittani from publishing opinions in an opinion column other than stopping his column thats because youre a liar and a troll and of course thats your demand if you werent a liar and a troll you could state why thats incorrect finn my actual demand is thatinstead you just lie and troll some more and hang yourself with the rope i provided even allowing you the chance to explain what you claim you really meant just leaves you proving that youre lying and trolling again it would be so simple to prove me wrong no youre wrong finn the steps i would expect tth to take in order to stop publishing opinions i dont like in opinions columns are x y and z except there are no such demands im correct and logical necessity demands that the only way to stop opinions in an opinion column is to remove it and you can only troll about it which is why no my actual demands are but thats because you simply do not post at me without lying and trolling like your lie that you werent making this about a tth followed by ten quotes of your own words where you made it about tth and after being caught yet again lying in order to support your trolling your quickly changed to subject with another lie that you were trolling with and when it was proven that you deliberately took the second of two lines and lied that the first didnt exist in order to troll then you claimed that maybe the article had been edited figured out yet what your real demand is of tth so that they stop publishing opinions in an opinion column no just going to troll some moreprove me wrong we all know why you cant
a ccp person for csm vice secretary what is the reasoning behind that decision did none of the other delegates step up for the positionif it had to be a ccp person i would have thought it should be one of the advocates or a game designer of course this position doesnt ever get called upon to ever do much anyway but i assume it means that sreegs will be attending all csm working meetings and ready to fulfill secretarial roles in case treb cant glad to see treb as secretary btwon a related note what have you decided to do about working meetings and documenting them to the public youve said youre not going to be dealing with assembly hall proposals in the same way that previous csms did but wont you still be having regular meetings from which players will be provided minuteslogs of some kind or is it all going to be audio meetings only
we will wait and see
with darius johnson exceo of goonswarm as vice secretary this allows better control of the csmtinfoil
i didnt mean to imply that but i did wonder whether it was a troll or not in case not i asked the questions i did out of actual curiosity
cripes
the vicesecretary position has been left unfilled at this time apparently nobody wanted to be in my shadow  which as anyone who has seen my ass can testify is a large one indeed
you are truly the alex jones of eveo
i had a funny feeling people were going to take this literally
when were the officers chosen and on what format was the discussion i dont recall seeing anything in the official channels regarding this
yeah strange how we expect our elected representatives not to troll us in official communications i doubt im the only one who prefers to just get straightforward information and not be left guessing about the facts also my other questions still want an answer if the answer exists somewhere on eve o kindly point me to it thanks
id also like to know where i can find the minutes for the meeting where these officers were appointed im also disappointed that nobody on csm6 is willing to step up and be vice secretary  who will take minutes in case trebor is unable to
why does it matterwhether you are informed or ignorant you cant actually do anything with the information you do or do not haveunless you count making bad posts on the internet
try to be less goon and get out of your dipersthe question is valid if a voter asks someone who is supposed to represent him or her about certain information which isnt closed under the ndaand making bad posts on the internet we gladly leave to goons as they prove over and over
speaking of bad posts it matters greatly because we can only assess the quality and performance of the csm members if we can see how they act and come to their decisions so you can in fact do something with this information
so far the csm election was more a popularity contest than it was an electionalso the qa looked to me more like an ego boost event where mittani speaks like he has been interested in csm ever before csm6 notid say mynxee and dierdra made valid pointsplease dont turn the csm where others before you worked hard for into a muppetshowshow some respect to the communityalso this new nonopen communication through skype is something i have to put questionmarks with concerning transparancyfinal wordsits an emberassment to see that the winners of the popularity contest csm 6 that theres no one else willing to be vice secretarygonna be a long year
csm6 did not feel that it was necessary to elect a vice secretary and so as an act of humor we decided to appoint ccp sreegs it was pure humor nothing else i also find it amusing how with one hand you can complain that csm6 is constantly connected yet simultaneously you attack our legitimacy and or seriousness about it we have composed our objectives and are solidified on a level that no previous csm in history ever has beenthe csm is also entitled to a degree of privacy when it comes to internal deliberation it is literally no different than the use of the internal csm forums we routinely discuss topics which are generally not ready for public presentation
we decided on the officers over a period of days and well rubberstamp them when we have a formal meeting but wanted to get the news outcsm6 will probably have fewer formal meetings that csm5 but communicate more tightly on a daytoday basis and do more direct communications it remains to be seen if this is a better idea or not but the noobs on csm6 deserve the chance to try new approaches just like the noobs on csm5 did
the least we can do is to connect the current csm with all former csm at our csm continuation channel if csm6 is interestedmynxee still has the operator status of that channel
to be honest i dont know if ccp sreegs can hold down such a critical post effectively were going to have to evaluate his employment on an ongoing basis to ensure that the crucial position of vice secretary is given the respect and consideration that the position deserves
we were relatively well connected with the former csm and trebor has been extremely helpful in guiding us through the process hes an agile and talented individual whos offered sage advice on the process we go through
then ill happily await the minutes and the official appointment of these positions and i hope that in the mean time someone will step up to be vicesec i fully agree that the csm needs a place to discuss things in private whether that is ingame or on the forums or on skype but ultimately decisions and the motivation for those decisions need to be made in public formal meetings for the sake of transparency and trust in the csm
i know trebor met him at csm summit in december and personally i was in csm2what you are probably not aware of is that we do have a csm continuity channel the csm noobs using trebors words are probably not aware we have such a channel pedit the evecsm channel has been officially approved by the almighty lord xhagen
there was no formal meeting after a week within the term beginning the chair can simply appoint titles at his discretion or hold a vote via the csm mailing list we got together briefly in skype after the qa and handed them out by consensus csm6 isnt particularly interested in titles beyond the ones with teeth were more concerned with getting things done
i totally gave up the vice chair position because meissa is a big cry baby true story
sad to see mittani and co already making this whole thing into a big in joke listened to the whole of the qa and was struck by the fact that it was depressing to see it all being so one sided and now even the announcement of officers is done purely to amuse mittanis corpmates
more details please
i promise you i am alone in the csm in not kissing the nether regions of mittani they are lined up like followers adoring the budda makes me sick i am definitely outsider on the csm this year which is good as i wont catch space herpes from them bunch of hypocrite windbags if you ask me remember all the candidates promises kiss them goodbye bottersmacros get stopped all credit to ccp in the extremely unlikely event it happens most of csm mostly so far looking to get in bed with ccp and the ever widening circlejerk continues uaxdeath and kruton are seemingly immune to the ph balanced perfume of mittens though maybe next year as full members we will form dissent coalition within csm sorry carebearsyour concerns are going unnoticed
wow bunch of try hard trolls in csm this year
told you id resign if i didnt get it i got it its all that matters i deserve some epeen
one of the amusing bigass holes in the csm white paper is that the csm is not required to have any meetings at allif there are meetings the secretary is required to document them and publish minutes to the players but meetings themselves nope nothing in the white paper saying they have to happen it just lays out a recommended guideline for meeting frequency it also says the chair and vice chair may summon the other representatives to these meetings and of course theres notes about the sorts of things that should happen at these meetings if they happeninterestingly it also specifies that a meeting is only valid if there are seven representatives present so mittens can pull together five other reps on skype they can chat about something of note and then break up a without it being considered a meeting and b without the secretary having to document itso what csm6 is doing is all perfectly legal
dude you should have paid a little more attention agreeing on a position after days of continuous discussion does not make us pushovers in addition to which we already were mostly in agreement with what needs fixing anyway not necessarily how but thats where the discussion came in progress was made and compromises were reachedmittani has absolutely no hold on me what does he have that i want what could he threaten me with im already shooting goons ingameill be very happy to listen to any and all the socalled carebear issues and if you had paid attention darius youd know that theres actually no opposition from the 00 delegates to the highseclowsec proposals because those are not their primary concern doesnt mean they are incapable of holding constructive conversations about them agreeing with the topics raised and supporting them if theyre reasonablebut if anyone thinks the 00 delegates are going to block non00 proposals that have merit youll just have to wait and seeand either way my evemail is open and i accept all convos if anyone has an ah proposal they want to bring the attention of the csm to
no my initial complaint was that communication on demand is not something the csm should doi have no idea what made you think someone asked for impotent raging or useless posting
for those looking for the discussion thread about the csm 6 fireside chat it is here temporarily been moved to general discussion for more  discussionyou should had done it differently1 keep the original thread where it is supposed to be jita park2 copy the qa session into general discussion being locked and notify people that they can respond in jita park make a link to jita parkwhat you did now is the world upside downyou brought the mountain to mohammed and not mohammed to the mountainplease fix this
interesting idea certainlywhat about people people are elected not the character with characters in null and empire do they have to pick one seat or contest for two different seatswhat about the population difference between eg caldari and amarr regions could a caldari pilot vote for an amarrian seat candidate if they so chosealthough its a great idea eve is a bit too fluid to trust youll be in the same area for the next 12 months
the first meeting confirmed they have absolutely no interest in the overall health of eve
in your opinion in my opinion after attending the meeting and talking to some of them on their public channel after it they have no other interest than the health of evein my opinion one of us is a sad bitter and cowardly trollfeel free to join members of the community on text on voice on out of game forums and even on comms channels where our real life identities are revealed for constructive discussions on the future of this game a game many of us have been playing for five or more years and want to enjoy for years to come or keep on trolling anonymously  whatever

im sure none of you have any opinions on this and i personally think everything is fine just as it is so this is probably going to be this post and nothing else sorry to waste your timeok now that the laughter has died down we all have some strong opinions on this subject and id like this thread to encompass everything from individual ships to how they interact in fleets the sky is the limit i want your ideas on what is messed up and why you think it is messed up but also id like to hear from you what you think works particularly well and why we need every bit of information you can throw our way because while i think the the ferox is an industrious ship that is capable of taking on all comers i fear some of you feel this might not be the case arm us with your best rants and most thoughtful ideas so we can spend hours slamming our shoes on the table reciting our best poetry on why assault frigs truly are worthless and how they can be improved to be better utilized in small and big fleet engagements maybe you thought up a new way that fleet mechanics can be designed so your special snowflake electronic attack frig can be integrated into large fleet combat if only x was changed dont let me down friends we got a lot of work ahead of us on this one and i want your input so we can attack this properly

in may well be discussing methods of improving nullsec industrialization with ccp at the ccpcsm summit in this thread we welcome the community to offer advice and counselthis is something which we discussed at the fanfest roundtables at length right now nullsec is entirely dependent on importing virtually everything from jita and exports only moon goo meanwhile nonsov smallgang entities can only contest the empires through the sov system which does not interest them industrialization would provide both crops to grow in nullsec and provide targets for smaller entities to set on fire to make life miserable for empires beyond tcus
the things that keepb ppl from bulding stuffin 00 arefirst and most important it much too easy to haul stuff from empire jump bridges and jump freighters make it very easy to haul thingssite note super capital esp super carrier building is often done via reprocessing carriers which speed up the process as one carrier can give the parts you would need 3 runs with a jump freightersecond its harder to get production slots etc in null sec also refining ore is harder you need to run poses for all that which is a lot of work so the solution would be something like removing jump bridges spread the null sec systems apart light year wiseso it rakes more jumps to get through to your destination also maybe make it easier to catch ships jumping all just some vague stuff pointing in the direction i think the problem lies
current issues mining sucks and is boring and not that profitable in nullsec so its easier for me to buy stuff in jita compress it into gunsammo and then jf it out i can fit a supercap into 2 jfs if there was a better way of getting minerals in nullsec maybe nullsec mining should have a better mineral breakdown and be like 10x as profitable as it is now or something i might not have to do thisalso a major issue is the availability of factory slots empire is so chock full of factory slots its ed and since you can only have 1 outpoststation per system it really sucks alliances should be able to have multiple outposts per system and amarr stations should possibly get an extra 10 base slots with minmatar gallente and caldar gaining another few slots per

pis interface while improved still has major annoyances such as a very clunky workflow for importexporting in particular the act of figuring out what resources goes where theres no ability to give storage areas names and switching between importexport mode could be cleaner the delay between actions is also hideously annoyingthe pos processes interface couldve been massively improved by the simple act of being able to reorganize the different reactors and silos so it makes sense to me instead of the random order it appears in now
i personally would like to see a general ui feature where we could adjust text size in all windows such as the overview wallet market stuff like that reason for this suggestion is that i have astigmatism

spades while those look like launchers in your photo if you watch the video itself they labeled them as ion blaster iis also that would mean ccp is pursuing hardpoint launchers as op says many missileoriented ships dont actually have the harpoints in their skins for launchers the caracal and drake being excellent examplesim all for a new missile graphic but i think many would agree that hardpoint launchers wont work unlessa the fb fix is used so that lag isnt increased by missiles launching from multiple points andb the skins are updated for ships that have no hardpoints or not enough hardpoints drake caracal tempest typhoonetc
def supported missiles havent changed graphically since post beta i think correct me if wrong in a stupidly long time while gunsi love acs btw have gotten effect changes and now epic turrets at the very least change the spawn points to surfaces on the ships
this is a must  missiles are left behing even in graphic about defender ms just remove them from the game same for fighterbomber remove them with the supercaps toooh and dont forget the trails those should be awesome like realy awesome then the explosions too 
makes sense
such a trivial and inconsequential thing to worry aboutbut it seems like a quick and easy 1 minute fix for a dev so i support

if youre going to do this get rid of the ed sec status penalty for repping flashies my sec status has dropped more in the last month from that than any other sourceactually logistics and sec status interaction is crap overall fix logistics aggression
this simply makes sense you cant lose se in 00 so theres no reason to gain it there either it will create much more gameplay than the silly fines idea above plus well actually see people ratting in losec again this proposal is a win for everyone
petition it and ccp will give it back being in the militia this comes up a lot and we found that if you petition they recognize its broken and will give you your sec status back ive gotten mine back every timealso i dont think my fines idea is that bad it actually makes you pay for your crime rather than be like oh i lost sec pffff ill fix it in a day or two ratting is also the worst way to gain it back try running an incursion or run level 4 missions or go do exploration and kill overseers and faction guys centum 610 has 4 overseers each give nice big chunks of sec status i know why you want more people ratting in belts is cuz you want easy ganks if you want more targets in your low sec yell at ccp to increase rewards in low but then you run into the problem of null sec alliances showing more interest in low for isk potential and so the endless debate goes on you want pew pew in low just move over to amamake you wont even have to worry about sec status there
problem is that isk is cheap literally whereas time is not were people allowed to just buy security you will be in worse shape than the current rat in safety in napland  besides wouldnt really make sense rp wise unless you consider the empires and concord 3rd world banana republics where money talksidea is for people who break the law and get negative security to be forced into doing community service lowsec ratting and not just their dayjob null ratting which they are going to do anyway to fatten their walletsps it will make a lot more sense in conjunction with a lowsec revamp to truly make it the area of space the gentile fear and 10s fight perpetually over access to stuffz
good idea this it always makes me laugh when i see a 00 dweller with a 50 sec status i know what youve been doing i wonder about the sec gain in highsec alternative though many not all but many missions give sec status gains ive used them to fix sec status in complete safety once ive grinded up to 40 or whatever i needed to not have the faction police get angry at me in that system and it would quite easy for a suicideganker to manage sec in this fashion without having to go to lowsec if nullsec doesnt give sec gain neither should highsec missions or missions at all just lowsec anomalies and belts
that is correct as per the proposal only lowsec belts should give sec status gain
an excellent idea and since this is in the assembly hall ccp can falsely give the credit it for it to the csm as welleverybody wins
interesting conceptand how would this address alt usage to completely circumvent having to grind sec status back up in low sec aka do the crime on one alt grind easy isk outside of low sec on the other because ive never had anyone answer this even once
you will eventually run out of alt slots if you start recycling the alts you will get banned as per current rules
the poll currently indicates that out of those people who repair their sec status a large majority do so in 00 space so that gives some weight to this proposal
if i had it my way i would say that a piracy killing in empire even just once results in an instant 5 sec status for all of empire this negative sec status remains unchanged no matter what you do for at least 3 months after which you may slowly begin to increase your sec status you wanna be a pirate then be a pirate stay in lowsec or be concorded every time you enter highsec live on the fringes and pay more for your ships and modules because you want to be a piratepiracy as it stands is too cozy of a profession

sooolittle bit of drama here what do you think the chances are that the op is yanking your chains
im posting but not with my main
lol everyone post with your altsit makes this thread that much more of a joke
not really effects but visualsnow i wont explain but heres a video which show you minmater ships flying in and out of the station and also other ships flying out or in a station
realistically the size factor is true that it doesnt make sense another thing ccp decided and thats how it rolls so i dont honestly care ether way when i had a rorqual i never really wanted out of it so im not sure why you would ever want to let go of the tity when it so big and awsomeso for the toon crap id stick with a alt for the light pvp stuff a good dramiel should be exciting enoughnow from personal experience the alt for the cyno i hated that crap
the only way this would be in any way acceptable in my eyes would be that if the station upgrade for allowing supercaps to dock only allowed them to simply latch onto the station itself the act of latching on would not in any way shape or form make the ship immune to damage it would simply just increase its ehp to that of say the toughest station service thus making the ship destructible
omg this is bull i bought a ferrari and now theyre telling me i cant keep it on my council estate and should have a mansionalso theres no room for my speedboat in the back yard and my prizewinning racehorse looks so miserable tethered to that lamp post so ing       rant over
ooc reference to an ic thing here so apologies in advance for the rp angle to this discussionone of the set scenes in the empyrean age p268 was when admiral alexander noir was approaching the lifts in the station that would take him up to the capital pod gantries dozens of levels overhead this in order to board the wandering saint a nyx supercarrieri see no reason why docking should not be allowed something as simple as a lengthier docking timer would avoid docking games as someone suggested earlier
put the titan in a capital ship maintenance array at a pos there docked
this not going to support any mechanism that makes supercaps easier to play or encourages proliferation i want you to hate your life every second you sit in one of them and i want you to moan and gripe to your corpmates so they also fear the day they decide to make the decision to jump in one because they feel that its important to be in one as end game contentso yeah uh not supported
perhaps you guys missed the part where this is a multiplayer game if you want to play a game where you can do everything solo you might consider a console fps or something a cap ship was never intended to be a single player resource if you are too stupid to look into the requirements and restrictions of a super before you train for it whos really to blame
supercaps were originally intended to be alliancecorp assets there is a flaw in there deployment as corps cant control a supercap essentially they do all the management to build them but the mechanics to maintain ownership of a ship just dont exist account sharing is illegal and they cant dock to be controlled during downtimes when a pilot enters the ship it permanently leaves alliance control and the alliance essentially loses all the resources used to create it to recuperate this loss the supercap pilot is typically expected to pay for the supercap this typically limits supercaps to wealthy individuals that can afford a character stuck in the ship this is where multiple characters become necessary a supercap pilot has a very limited amount of activity they can perform in this game so to enjoy the many other aspects of eve you need a second character given peoples interest in various aspects of the game change with time and the constant need for more sps this typically translates into additional accounts if you are playing eve in a super and you dont have multiple veteran characters your doing it wrong predominion the second account requirement was a reasonable trade off for generating hundreds of kms in one dd moms were viewed as near worthless and the sov system required massive amounts of pos bashing which pretty much requires the use of dreads as such dreads were the workhorse of sov warfare unfortunately the posspamming sov mechanics were tedious and titan proliferation was nearing the point to mandate removal of the aoe dd hence dominion postdom sov upgrades made nullsec an isk monsoon threatening to drown the economy in a biblical noahstyle iskflood sov warfare moved from shooting poss which fighters couldnt hit to shooting structures that fighters and fighterbombers can shred and moms were buffed into untackleable seigeless monstrosities that consumes dreads like a fatman consumes pizza this changed the landscape from seiged dreads into supercarrier fleets as supercarriers do almost everything a dread does but better and with much less battlefield risk with the influx of isk and the ease of training into scs the workhorse ships of sov warfare became the supercarrier this brings us back to the original post when dreads dominated sov warfare most people played the game as they desired and then shipped into dreads for sov activities this worked fairly well even if the sov mechanics sucked as after sov is claimed you can go about your daily eve activities exploring many of the other aspects of game play the dreads position as the sov workhorse was near perfect unfortunately the sc changes have ruined the dread supercarriers are superior to the dread in almost every way and hence sov warfare has spent the massive influx of dominions isk to create supercarrier workhorse fleets the averagejo player in these fleets has two or three quality characters to fly the sc they typically have to devote one of them to a ship essentially removing that character from use in any other aspect of the game is it fair to impose this cost for a supership to fix this game we need to return the sov workhorse to a dockable ship one option allow scs to dock this will result in the continued proliferation of scs for the love of lowsec limit their docking to a sov based structure note until there is a counter to supercaps beyond more supercaps sc proliferation is a terrible thing alternate option nerf supercarriers so they cant be used effectively against sov structures unfortunately since scs are so effective against dreads dreads will still be rare and bssc the normin either case supercarriers need a vulnerability whoever introduced a super tanky super dpsy ewar immune logistics ship that lacks siege vulnerability tracking difficulties or an effective counter aught to be 
why dont you just buy another char to hold it
is it just me or do people forget two important facts1 there is one vote per account therefore it is much more likely that far more experienced players mostly found in nullsec i hope will inherently have more weight in an election than newer hisec players that have only one account my three votes are more than your one even though there is only one player new players wont invest in multiple accounts unless they have lots of money or realize quickly the benefitsin general they wont because they arent ready to commit to eve as their game that early2 newer players often dont know to vote they see the ad on the client login maybe on the website if they visit it often enough but likely wont vote because they dont know any of the players they often realize they lack the knowledge to make such a decision since most candidates portray themselves towards either a grandiose and complex vision of eve or nullsec fixes neither of which new players understandall csms are inherently going to be weighted a certain way because like eve is a niche game in the market those who vote are a niche market in eve if you want to prove the elections are flawed have a player actively campaign new players such as earning eunis total support and gain a ton of votes with new players only to lose anyways elections will forever be lopsided unless candidates make it a point to work together to involve more players in the voting processwhy should ccp changed the csm when the players that take the time to vote got what they wanted you and your few friends would have voted someone that benefits you too thats why you vote if you want that person to win you should have made it a point to find them more votes votes should continue to be on a single account basis those who are willing to dedicate the funds to ccp deserve a vote for each account they want to see the game continue and they obviously have a vested interest in the games success because of that
maybe they didnt bother because they knew that for example given that only 2 of accounts are active in fw then what is the point on campaigning on a fw platform even if they did get all players in fw to vote for them they wont dent the 00 votesnow if ccp dictates groups of constituents based on a census or a survey of all players and how each player choose to identify themselves as then that would incentivize more minority players to run for csm because frankly who wants to bother if they have no statistical chance of winningfor example before the next csm have a survey that all players are encouraged to fill out which asks each player 1 per accountwhich best classifies what you spend most time doing in eve in the past year1 pvp 2 pve3 mining4 industry5 exploration6 trading7 corporate managementpie8 faction wars9 piratingwhere do you spend most of your time1empire2lowsec3null4empire null5whthat should bucket the population into groups which can then be assign a number of seats depending on proportion each player can then vote for a candidate for that seats ie players who are identified as null sec pvp can only cast a vote for the candidates running for the null sec pvp seatsas an aside i believe that any argument that a goon or better 1 goons on the csm sorry i dont mean to pick on goons just a handy example is not biased is going to be flawed even if they had the best intentions in mind i doubt that a player that spends 100 of his time and experience playing in null sec is going to give the same mindshare to a suggestion that affects empire space or fw than one that is more familiar to them on a daily basis they just may not have the experience in the other aspects of the game to be able to contribute as well as somebody who do spend all of their time therethis system is not without its flaws but i think it would at least give a chance at letting the lesser in terms of population aspects of the game get some coverage and spotlight and chance at improvement its arguable that those sometimes forgotten aspects are the ones that should get some more attention after all
on the first point  it makes perfect sense to vote for someone who will reprisent your interests at csm  so a 00 player not voting for a rep from 00 would be odd on the second point however  you do realize that fw has had no changes since launch is basically broken and ccp did not even show up this fanfest to th roundtable for it yah no csm has reprisented fw just to focus on that and looking at the voting numbers  no csm can be voted in on a fw ticket the numbers just dont add upi dont care if its the alliance leader of gsf or whatever  thats the ops concern my concern is that minorities like fware not being reprisneted and while it may sem only fair that the better organized 00 alliances should vote their own membes into csm  it undermines the idea that csm reprisnts the community if there is any change to anything that is not related to 00 moon goo 00 sov mechanics some pvp tweaking logistics i will be suprised i think this is a problem in terms of what csm was designed to do  but  i am also glad that at least someone is getting their voice heard so more power to them
looki would love to be the first person to say anything negative about mittani and goonswarm but there are too many people ahead of me in the line for that one i will say i am however the last person to ever support goonswarmin gamethat saidwhile it is true that mittani is a distrustful ass of a gnome in game i dont believe that he as a csm are the same listen to the fireside chat that was posted today he in no way shows any interest in ing over the game to benifit goonswarm even if he did he is not the entire csm there are others there to keep him in line he is working with the rest of the csm and taking input from the players through the assembly hall to get done what needs to be donedo i fully support him no but i am not in direct opposition of him either despite his ingame jackassery he does have some good ideas and he does have the real life experience to get the job donethreads like this do nothing but build mistrust and hinder the process does he deserve that mistrust yeahbut at this point nothing we say or do will change the fact that he is the csm chairman nothing ccp is not going to kick him out he was voted into his position and no amount of whining is going to change that let him do what he needs to do give him constructive criticism and ideas to help better the game
i propose a new item that is basically a low yield nuke you keep in your cargo hold so it can be scanned and seen by the gankers that detonates upon an unexpected venting of the cargo hold ie it is rent asunder as the ship is destroyed the up shot would be that it progressively via skill levels reduces the  chance of your goods dropping for suicide gankers to harvest from the 50 chance of any one module or stack dropping on ship destruction it drops by 5 per primary skill level add on a couple more skills heavily prerec and possibly reduce the chance of a drop down to under 5basically what you are trying to do is make sure if you are ganked then you assure that your precious cargo is rendered useless if you drastically reduce the chances of a profitable drop then the desire for profit motivated ganking also dropsfor the ganker its not all bad news as not every one will do the research or even know of this item so there still will be viable targets also even at the highest skill levels there should be a good 5 chance of a good dropthis idea would not stop ganking but add another deterrentanyway just a thoughtedit fixed an autocorrect snafu
no i think what a lot of people fail to realize is that suicide ganking is part of the game just like scamming and thievery you wanna be a well be a  you wanna steal and pillagesteal and pillage you wanna become the leader of the biggest alliance of jackasss in the game and then become chairman of the csm and have a bigger impact on the game then do it thats what is great about eve you can be and do what you want when you want if you want to stop people from suicide ganking youthen do your business somewhere other than jita or stop making yourself the obvious target
why should suicide ganking be deterredif you really want to deter suicide ganking i suggest using a super special ultrasecret h4xxsploit known as tanking your ship properly and not autopiloting when you have valuable cargo or modulesi hope you see this post before it gets deleted and i get banned for revealing this exploit
ive heard scouts help or flying as a group you know in a massive multiplayer
not supportedsuicide ganking is working as intended
your solution is a module that when in your cargo reduces the chance for cargo to drop i actually like this idea but need some extra thought put into it what uses does this cargomod truly have it means when your ship dies so does more of your cargo can this be used in all ships does it affect fitted mods could this have any potential for abuse what is a fair reduction in likelyhood i would suggest a reduction of chance to drop to a minimum 1020 why do you want a mod to do this would a skill be better if its a skill that you cant turn offon then it has a nice double edged sword feel to it
i would like to see a vision of highsec that revolved around reducing conflict between empires rather than amplifying it
its people like you who give peace a bad name
its a possibility ill give you that however its also equally possibile that well wipe ourselves out yea its equally possible so why bank on the outcome where everyone dies if there is no hope then why bother kill them before they kill me even if thats not their intension this is the kind of thought process that gets us into conflicts in the first place why change anything when were so efficient at war were better at fighting than we are at peace so why not keep killing each other until nothing is left but the roaches then theyll be no question peace will be the only choice because there will be no one left to make warirrelevant none of this has to do with human nature which no matter how hard we try to suppress or get around is still there hmm human nature this is a funny little joke which people like to fall back on to make excuses im sorry to have to shatter your glass house but humans arent natural yes we do a lot of the things which other animals do but we also have reason awareness beyond the self a concept of time and long term effects as well as the ability to feel empathy beyond our own species let alone our own families or tribes or communities we are freaks of nature we are not natural were something more it just requires us to realize that so that we can move beyond making excuses and start making a difference and if you dont believe that then you should just dig a hole and crawl into itright now we have the ability to communicate with almost every person around the world hell weve had this ability for almost a century ex mail telegraph direct phone lines etc all this technology has allowed nations and groups to form up logistical efforts faster and more effectively though no group has made more use of this than the military because the military is the only group which receives adequate funding to execute these maneuvers on a regular basis imagine if disaster relief groups had billions of dollars and thousands of fully trained operatives at their expensenever racism bigotry slaveryhuman trafficking religious fearmongeringsuperiority are all facts of life today as they have been for centuries and i dont see any of them going away so long as there is profit and weakminded zealots to fuel them but theyre less acceptable than they were and thats the point people dont do these things in the open anymore more and more theyre being pushed to the shadows because thats the only place that they can exist will they ever fully disappear from human society probably not but would you rather be born or have your child be born into a world where slaveryfear mongeringexploiting others is a rule or rather an exception which is hunted down and abolished weakminded zealots include people who cannot see beyond the shortcomings of the world and accept them rather than fight against themsince the late 1800s weve been able to move large amounts of resources both for need and want today in the early 21st century weve merely perfected this practice and yet we still have global famines poverty and starvation global famines poverty and starvation are the result of those in power including nations with technological solutions choosing not to act or worse not acting to maintain their superiority over those who are not able to realistically do anything about it it wasnt until the 1920s that cargo planes outside the realm of posted mail were developed and commisioned by shipping standards the largest oceanic cargo ships can carry approximately 14000 teu which at the maximum weight per teu would translate to 500 million pounds or 250000 tons of cargo these are very conservative numbers modern cargo planes have a capacity of over 100 tons and a range of over 6400 kilometers imagine if it was all food and supplies rather than weapons and pessimism
 until recently last 10 years or so few of the common man could translate and readhear what the common man of another language were saying yes with the advent of translation technology we can now understand each other better than ever however
more than that we are immortal we cannot die and without that final of final restraints there is no reason to hold ourselves back from conflict yes thats quite true of the video game but i was hoping to make a point beyond the video game realm have you ever had an ingame friend die in real life last time i check and im quoting fps dave on this one there is no respawn in rlhow does libya have anything to do with eve excessive question marks aside libya has nothing to do with eve as much as i hate repeating myself i was trying to make a point that if one woman can be the final straw which moves an entire nation into revolt imagine the message that tens of thousands of people across the globe would send to the rest of the world especially coming from the videogame playing community which is at times blamed for desensitizing and promoting violence because players cannot separate the real world from the fantasy that is a video gameits people like you who give peace a bad name and what have you done if youre so enlightened maybe you can offer more than an offhand remark that holds no weight and last time i checked the idea of peace was never a bad thing only a fantasy which is what we all immerse ourselves in every time we log into a video game
your just a joke who thinks he knows what peace isill tell you what peace is peace is mutually assured destructionpeace is a lie a total fabrication of your mindyour definition of peace is where you dont get shot at and make all the isk you wantmy definition of peace is literally ending your career ingame so i dont have to hear you whine when someone suicide ganks youpeace is a subjective stuffed toy it gets tossed ran over changed stitched and torn up again not to mention set on firethe goal in my book is cooperation i cooperate with you to take down my foesi cooperate with my foe to take down a common foeand along the way we get some laughs have some fun because this is just a gameso please take your carebear peacemaking excuse of a pipe and shove it where the sun dont shinebecause this is eve online and we all aim to misbehave you can thank capn reynolds from firefly for that onecan i get an amen folks
1go back to high sec plz
your history is your history if you dont like your history you should have lived a better lifefrankly i want to know the history of people i play this game with because in a lot of ways that gives a good clue as to how badly that player is ready to  you sorry i cant support this
this sounds to me like someone is trying to add in a stealth buff for corphopping thieves
unerf it 
unnerf it
you mean the ihub that must be destroyed along with any upgrades in it before they can take the system yeah sure attractiveone question for posterity is there any physical pain involved in being as wrong as you are in the statement i quoted above
i will have to concur with the others i also request to unnerf the current system in place
for the love of null and hate of missioning  unerf it
bad change instead of bringing more people to nulsec this is driving many of them back to empirei dont know that a complete reversal is needed i like the basic premise that some space is better than others but theyve taken way too much out of the lower end it really is a paycut to move from solo mission running to move out to nulsec and join in an alliance as has been mentioned before this change doesnt really have much effect on the power bloc alliances and completely screws the little guyunnerf and try again
i was ambviolent towards the change but seeing the results its obvious this was a up solar systems are being abandoned and ive watched the military indexes on adjoining systems go from 5 to 1 or 0 its a ghost town out there now and the thrill of being in nullsec is wearing off rare pvp and then nerfed isks when you do something else out of boredom for pepople who invested in carriers losing the sanctums is a huge hit in their iskhour
it needs to be unnerfed
unerf poor ideas executed even more poorly 1 ccp
what he said big mistake ccpbuti think thats already been said about a million times before you went ahead and did it anyway question ishave you learned your lesson yet
all the risk and no more rewardnul sec is void unnerf
unerf it
keep it
give the changes time
ccp took a stick shoved it up where the sun doesnt shine and broke it off then twisted iti thought ccp wanted more fighting but with these changes it takes 2 to 3 times the time to make the isk for the loss of a shipin all it wasnt a bad idea to give systems with lower true sec more anoms but the execution of of the plan completely failed unnerf 00 please
during the may summit the csm will be discussing improvements to eve customer support that impact our everyday game play this thread is not to discuss individual petition details and responses from game masters but more of a way for you to provide some input as to how customer support can be improvedthis should focus around improvements to existing policies and procedures eg the recently announced reimbursement policy or the implementation of new policies and the expectations you have as players when you file a support petition
i am just wrapping up listening to the recent fireside that was posted about 2 hours long but a lot of good information came out of it it was nice to hear the ideas coming from the csm and the interaction with ccp the clarifications made in the fireside not only on what the csm is able and not able to do but also what is intended is great i was also glad to see that a couple of the ccp devs made the effort to attend and also put in their input listening to all of this was not only enjoyable and informative for me but it reminded me of the fanfest and the kind of information gained from watching the fanfestthat saidi would like to see more of this i know it was stated that the goal is to do this once every month or two or as needed but would it be possible to make it more like twice a month where updates can be givenmore ideas discussed and so on i wouldnt ask that they be two hours longhalf an houran hourwhatever we see in the assembly hall ideas come up all the time maybe address the bigger ideas each week in a vocal setting like this and discuss said ideas on a broader scope get input from ccp devs at the same time and let the players as a whole hear a devs input as to why an idea would or would not worki know the forums are exactly what this is for but rarely do we see a dev actually give real solid input or opinions on an idea the interaction from the regular players asking questions to the csm answering them and even ccp jumping in was fantastic againshorter versions of this more often with dev interaction would be awesomei just now heard you guys say it would be a regular thing at the very end of the csm and the request of devs to tag along i am going to post this anyway since i have already typed it all up and here is your threadloli do apologizei was at about 145 when i started typing this at the end you guys started saying you were going to hold this regularly as needed and even said make a post about it in the assembly hall right at the end there
supported i loved this chat and hope to see more though more concise and dense would be my preference over a 2 hour rambler but thats expected for a first go
moar
agreed they dont need to be as long maybe a half hour that touches on the key issues with the community  where those issues are updates that sort of thingdefinitely supported
but but theyre harvesting your ips111111
i cannot support until i can get access to a version i can readi cant hear edit incidentally shorter ones would make it easier to put into text
i guess what most morons out there dont realize is that their ip changes on a frequent basis mine changes every day that is unless you pay to have a static ipwhich most people are not going to fork over the cash to do and noyour ip is not 19216811as for the hearing impairedyes you have a point personally i dont have the time to be typing out two hours worth of chat but maybe there is someone out there that is willing to put in the time and legwork
just so im not lumped into the category of mouthbreathers ive had to read the past few days there are actually people who unironically think that because the first talk was hosted on a goonhosted mumble wed easily be able to harvest everyones ips and thus easily weed out all the spies that connected to that server im not even joking or being sarcasticyes the goons are so crafty theyll figure out that the guy connecting as sir dongalong is actually spychar1ingsf even though his name is completely differenti cant facepalm hard enough every time someone get this paranoid
yesyou are right butyou are a goon i still hate you
dont make me call durrhurrdurr
this thread has been derailed enough without that
a dread does less dps than a well fit cruiser unless it goes into siege mode thereby becoming immobile and unable to hit anything smaller than a pos
dreads are not the problem supers are
this is largely my perspective on this
thank god dreads are about as useful as a screen door on a submarine at the moment
my understanding of dreads was that before supercarriers got buffed dreads were in fact on the field to be carrier killers i could be wrong on this because this was before i got into capitals but it makes senseeither way i support this idea to make dreads more useful
honestly i think making dreads more useful involves less changes to the dreads themselves and more changes to making supercarriers less of the solo pwn mobiles they are now
buff dreads with a 5 min seige cycle drop invulnerability of supercarriers
qft
server load for lp store is irrelevantand its more than 2 minutes of code or id have bartered beers for it with a dev long ago
uhh this seems like a no brainer provided its not a huge monster code rewrite hell id support this even if it was
indeed
i dont even use the lp storesupported anyway
little things like this make sense
so the second design a starship competition has been and gone and yet we still have not seen hide nor hair of patterns tornado the winner of the original design a starship competition for thsoe of you who forgot or dont know what this is see herei would like to ask csm 6 if they cant do something about getting ccps proverbial backside into gear and give us a date preferably before 2013 when we can expect to be able to actually fly these ships as promised
what is this i dont even
i would like to point out that the tornado a battleship if i am not mistaken being put into the game also means that each other race will need a ship to match not to have a ship for each race would cause an imbalance in pvpone thing we can all agree we dont want i personally believe that ccp went into the design a starship competition without any idea of what kind of ship would win that saidwhen the ship was chosen they then would have to create not only that starshipbut the ships for each other race as well i wasnt expecting to see the ship entered into eve with the very next expansioni do however hope to see it within the next or the one afterit was unclear if you are expecting to see the winner of the second competition in the game if you aredont it was already stated that the winner was not going to be put in the game howeveri would hope that ccp would see the contest as a way to get the players to create and vote on what they want to see in the game for future ships instead of the crap created by the past devs no offence ccp but most of the ships you made for eve are crap and look like crapcoughrevanantcoughi agree that having a date of the release would be nice howeversetting a date and then missing the date is worse than not setting a date and releasing it when it is ready
i couldnt agree more 
hi everybody
add a dmg attrib to ecms so a jammer ship can defend itself
so first people scream ecms are overpoweredpeople argue that fitting eccms are the solution aside from the stfu remarksand now your saying eccms are overpoweredis this supposed to be funnysomehow i missed the punchline in this pathetic joke
1 damn those multispecstry again
a good idea when dust 514 comes out could also be a good thing to add for dust players to take out while fightinga new upgrade for pis would be space defenses which you can use when battles are happening in space right next to a planet which you have colonies onwhat you do is make defenses which send rockets bombs lasers up to space and hit a target you painted the damage is really powerful but it depends on the ship shields or armoranother thing would be airfields which launch fightersbomberscombats drones as wellinto space to fight for your corpallianceso just another thing for guys to considerleave comment or likestay
if not what would the dusties be good for unless their targets have military significance beyond the military value of pi goods dust is going to be a huge flop
are you densethey fixed eve sound nearly a year ago its been working perfectly since then
last stat we received is that 72 of players play with sound onsound works much better than it used to and i havent heard of any serious issues on that front other than granularity of control but thats differentif there is any prevalent bugissue with sound at the moment id be happy to hear about it and the bug reports associated you did submit bug reports right
i used to play with sound on until my computer discovered this one explosion sound that would cause the whole client to lock up i havent played with sound on since that moment but with a new computer and updated sounds im sure its fine now gonna need specifics on this one
what was said about drone groups and the ship is very trueid say the fix to this is having keyboard commands for drone groups 120 i cant even see that many groups for carriers but just to be safe you then assign your shortcuts to each group you intend to usefor the ships drones are assigned to a group number which can also be renamed per ship or the account itself to make it easier to useexmy myrmidon has four drone groups 1 2 3 41  5 hobgoblins2  5 warriors3  5 hammerheads4  5 valkyriesthe shortcuts programmed to those groups launch those drones i actually name those groups what they hold less memory on my part needed id say the groups ought to be named across the account not the ships probably easier to program but i wouldnt know then whatever ship you are using you place drones in groups just like now but in addition to groups you manually create as you do now there would be an option for preset groups that then allows you to assign the drones to one of the twenty available groups on that shipskipping my speelyeah a launch command would be great but it needs to be able to control which group launches
already requested in csm 3 check the minutes for ccps answerbasically theres a technical issue there however a general revamp of the drone launchingmonitoring and general interaction could be interesting in its own right
no comments at all does this need to be moved to fi
leaving aside purchased accounts storage issues and the fact that an old 00 player now without alliance may decide to have fun in fw for who knows roleplaying reasons would be left out of it the basic flaw of this proposal is that the most fun people have in fw the sooner theyll get locked out of it and this runs contrary to the objective of the proposalso no not supported
this came up during the csm qa session but i didnt find any threads to itanyways the idea is to be able to selectively turn on or turn off certain visuals or sounds and having more options to control thesesmall examplesleaving effects on but turning off just sensor booster effectsturning sound on but leaving lowshieldarmor warnings onshortcuts to turn sound on and offsoundvisual profiles eg having one for general pvp and another for fleetswhile im on it overview folders
ctrlaltshiftf12 turns off sound and back onweve requested more granularity for selectively turning sound onoff in csm 3 so its somewhere in the backlog will see if any progress has been made on that front
something to think about
hello guys ill try to be short as possiblei got a idea about hit effects and shock waves that make you ship move or stir off course for a second or two ill try to make as short as possibleokay so when you ship takes a hit from a enemy ship your ship rocks a little bit from the blast or rocket hit you take say your orbiting and they score your ship rocks a little but it regains control gives the feeling that your character is flying it so thats one downsecond is shock wave effect now this can range from your buddys frigate exploding next you to a titian blowing up also poss going upthe effect rocks your shipdepending on the size and explosion a little but does no damage what so ever its basically the same thing as i said above so thats thats thought i get the ball rolling on thatso leave a comment like or whatever and hope you guys decided to throw it the game one daystay
2my boyfriend plays eve on linux
the buttons are symbolic specifying exactly what your own character says is trespassing on a more important aspect of immersion
i like mittens mittens are cool in both the clothing form and the csm form he spoke warmly and fuzzily ok in all seriousness i look forward to more of these qas because i gained alot of insight and was happy with the issues that were brought up im satisfied with the csm as a whole and even though mittani was the only one to really speak for most of it with the others chiming in i can see that he has forged this csm into a very effective and unified front and that is something i am glad to see
thanks for the link to download the fireside chat audio can the csm request ccp to include the fireside chats in the eve gate calendar the facebook notification was posted at least an hour after the fireside chat began
im pretty impressed that they seem to have developed cohesion and solid positions on so many issues so quickly i also like the way theyre approaching the game balance issue theyre very much right that eve just doesnt get the constant fine tuning that happens in most highcaliber multiplayer games improving this in the way the csm is suggesting seems very much within reach and i really hope ccp takes action on this input
i have not been a supporter of this csm in fact ive posted some negative projections of what i thought might happen cant tell about the future but the macro over micro approach almost seems obvious as the right way to present issues to ccp i must admit my opinion has changed in my humble opinion a most impressive intro of the csm6 to the eve community
forgive me for asking a simple question while at work instead of dropping everything i was doing to run off and connect to mumble hosted by goonswarm for a totally unbiased slant on the csm where i get to hear all of the members and not just two hours of mittani stroking himselfrunon sentence is a go
it was exactly what i thought it would be mittens talking about mostly null sec issues wonder why glossing over anything difficult or contrary to his place in the eve world with i dont know anything about that insulting past csms but mainly masturbating in front of a mirror as he listened to his own voice droning on and on and on and on and on protip  when so many against you its pretty stupid to hog the conversation 99 of the time yeah that showed real cohesion in the csm the only time anyone else got to speak was if mittens was clueless or on such important matters as what sandwich they enjoyed in iceland wow  thats sure important but it was an excuse to insult someone respectable who doesnt go to iceland just to drink yah how wittywrong way to go about it dude chairman has certain responsibilities yes but twisting that into making the csm broadcast into the mittens show was pretty damn dumb  and selfish if anyone is interested in how long mittens can dominate a broadcast  current record is 2 hours minus 1 am sure that record will be beaten in the next or he will learn from this mistake hope so my guess is he will learn but not enough next go around they might get 2
they might get 2 but the broadcast will run extra time to make sure mittens still gets his fill
ccp doesnt need to tell the csm everything and never should alsomore communication doesnt mean everythingtrying to classify this as a scandal is rather petty and belittles the true scandals that have happened which have been rather few in numberthis is just players trying to fan the flames to try and get what they want normally happens with unpopular changessuch drama from the csm will only marginalize it
lol at mittens expounding on his speculations as to what flavor the eve economist is is he old school homo economocist or more modern behavioral cognitive blah blah blahnext oh wait no someone else wanted to talkjust joshin ya it was a good talk and you guys cleared up some misconceptions i had
the scandal about it is that ccp put the news up about it while people were on the airplanes to fanfest refused to talk about it at fanfest refuse to have any dialog about it after fanfest and are ignoring even the legitimate questions and feedback its not really that ccp is making an unpopular decision so much as they trying to hide from that decision and it possibly lying about the decision depending on your favorite conspiracy theory in fact the devs in general appear to be laying low and on the defensive on the forums these past few weeks i think most of the devs know that it was an absolutely stupid idea but some scrub made the change already and there arent processes in place in the growing company for everybody to tell him how stupid he isscandal may be a little bit strong of a word for the nerf itself embarrassment sounds more appropriate for the nerf itself and scandal the way it was implemented
just to be clear homo economicus is not a gay joke as much as it sounds like it
as for that file system it does not work on my computer make it easy okay
the download button is for torrent users if your old school like me use the smaller direct download just below it thatll give you an mp3
remember guys the csm are people who either failed at life because they didnt realise that swearing is very unprofessional or that making childish jokes is also rather unprofessional oh well another failed csm the chairman takes command of the meeting but does not give anyone any room to speak either they dont have any education or they didnt pay any attention during their lectures
lol okbut the ones they have are impressiveim guessing you ignore most of the things that go on in this game then
i like the idea of time dilation but the lag i experienced in the only fleet fight i ever participated in has kept me away from them for years nowi like the idea of a couple devs devoted to constant balance iteration of shipsi agree feature abandonment is one of the biggest problems with eve devs seem to treat features as the theme parks that other games use build and forget but we dont have theme parks in eve we have tools to play in the sandbox with some of which are defectivedocumentation does need to be better but i badly disagree with the idea of the isk book getting the attention it is that stuff needs to be in game or at least easily found on the evelopedia license buy or steal the thing and give it its own button on the neocom i dont want to tell new players to go out and buy a book or to download such and such pdf i want to tell them click on that button then go to this section until documentation is easily found without having to fire up google its a faili disagree greatly with the slant of all these issues by the csm though the number one problem with eve is pve im going to go out on a limb and say the vast majority of eve players are going to do some sort of pve on a daily basis shoot a belt rat do a mission mine some ore run a complex something its almost inescapable to not do some form of pve its the foundation for which all other things you do in eve are built in that it supplies you the isk to do themive quit eve came back quit eve came back and ill probably quit again and its always for the exact same reasons that i quit i do not want to slog through hours of unfun things to do a single hour of something funthe way it was glossed over in 45 minutes of thats something far outside of anything which could be accomplished during our tenure just aggravated me greatly
this is great very informative and funny listening to u guysthis record should be properly promoted explains very well what csm is about and what u are trying to achieve because from the perspective of the casual player csm looks like a bunch of mega corpalliance leaders or representatives pushing their own agendas and they are probably asking themselves why should i care what those guys have to sayso rly i heard good things keep the good workpsthey are professional enough considering this is a computer game
ive always seen it like thisthey bring out a feature see if ppl use it and decide if its worth putting time into the feature and ironing out the bugs cause if most ppl dont use the feature they dont see any reason to devote development cycles to it as noone uses itnot saying thats a good thing mind you just the way they seem to handle such things
im really happy to see the direction the csm6 is headed in so far more communication more open channels more of a sense of direction and seriousness about the job thanks for holding the fireside and posting it upbut i do have to say that a whole lot more professionalism needs to be put in place i dont mind the fbombs and whatnot but using the word retarded 100 times schlong jokes stupid comments about jewish last names offensive and totally unnecessary this isnt your alliance teamspeak the csm is a very public representation of the player base please treat all public communications with a lot more professionalism
imo csm work is voluntary they do not get paid so they should act as they like with some borders can they have at least that as i said above this is only a game we have enough of the long speech boring kind of guys in the real world they are probably much more formal and considerate when communicating with ccp staff to represent us or am i wrong
im not sure why the lack of pay is relevant they took on a job that makes them representatives of 350k players in a very public way and they should treat that position with respect and a level of professionalism that was lacking in many ways on this call
on another note one thing i heard brought up over and over on the call is that ccp will not listen to micro detail change suggestions can i ask why not is it an ego thing amongst the game designers i would think theyd be open to taking ideas and suggestions no matter how micro they are i understand that the big picture suggestions are easier for them to digest and respond to but ignoring all micro suggestions is justlame
unlike the misc rap songs ccp have made the past few years with a peachy white and fat technoviking or the beer ship
yeah you have a point there but this was a thread about the csms fireside chat not ccp im not saying it needs to be pg13 or anything im just fine with adult chat and humor i just think that some of the discussion was more akin to listening to an alliance team speak and not really professional for a representative body
so the csm should be held to a higher standard than the playerbase not particularly hard when 90 of local chat is in smsese or trolling and the company which makes and maintains the game and actually gets paid for itid have expected more professionalism from the company that makes the game but i give no s if they prefer to be a bit more chill about it and not take themselves as seriously as an old lady with a whole broom up her backside
i thought this one was pretty clear its not that ccp wont listen to these ideas its that these ideas just get added in to the black hole of a backlog which means maybe someday if someone is bored enough and there isnt something else theyd rather do ccp has bazillions of ideas on record for how to make things better but they have nobody in place to work on them the csm has decided that its a waste of time to just dump more ideas on the pile at this time at least until ccp starts catching up with thingsi kinda had mixed feelings about the lack of professionalism on the one hand it was a never ending  joke about how everybody in csm ccp and goon are gay for eachother and sucking eachother off im not paraphrasing here on the other hand the impression that they all seem to get along at least from the 30 seconds of people other than mittens talking is a positive thing although i betcha there are at least a couple guys on the csm who sit there and quietly loathe mittens and the joke hes making of the csm
and i understand that i just feel that first should come the broad strokes kind of suggestions but once ccp accepts one of those and decides to iterate on it why wouldnt they want the micro ideas related to the broader subject

gotta say i really like the idea of getting ship iteration and how about featureexpansion iteration too fw anyone into ccps process as a regular thing with dedicated devs to support it consistently this is one of the most important things csm6 has in their plans me thinks
from my perspective the problem is that this has been attempted and it hasnt really gotten us anywhere its not like the backlog or the ideas are going to disappear just because theyre pushing for there to be someone anyone to actually look at the way the game is to play today and do regular tweaks instead of using a bigassed 5t hammer to bludgeon a change inonce that is in place then the focus can shift back to ideas but i wouldnt be surprised if that would be something for csm7
ccp has way more broad strokes plus micro ideas that they will ever be able to implement especially since many of them are probably contradictory if they find they are short of micro ideas theyve got eyes and access to these forums just like anybody else its a waste of time for the csm to work on the little things especially since ccp has a team thats already doing them even if csm were to focus on them the works already been done and doing more work on it will not get it done sooner i agree its better for them to focus on getting processes into place that will get ideas implemented rather than championing specific ideas that will never get implemented
there is a direct download link on that very same page finding it takes less time than it did for you to login and post your message how ed are you
one youre asking for professionalism from a goon one that most people seem to have voted in because either hell fix the game or burn it downin before its internet spaceships
sir you are a very stupid eve character please visit your user settings to reenable images
i really like that idea for having more scrum teams for broad topics that continually need improvement stuff like feature advancement not abandonment game balancing hybrids dreads moon goo etc and the npe new player experience i also love the idea for a redesigned noob ship team gridlock and team bff if your reading this good work guys i personally know many players appreciate your hard work
it was a nice session to listen to i liked it
change in game to make null sec entry for small alliances easierhope the following is written in a proactive manner contains limited tinfoil hat attitudeexecutive summarycore problemthe resources to have major battles over are in place ie tech moons stations and larger alliances gobble them up and use them heavily to help fund their pvp players these promote beautiful large battles the problem the smaller newb just starting out alliance have to support their pvp the hard way spend countless hours to mine and pve for it these incomes are easier to attain thanks to ability to resource building though dominion but didnt this didnt protect these small alliances from larger alliances easy to used tactics like though afk cloakers and hot drop titian fleets solution theme requestput features in the game that givebonus to an alliance core systems 15 solar systems so as an alliance grows beyond its initial growth stage the benefits become less important the bigger they becomeprovide ships and equipment that are more fragile inferior ones controlled by larger power blocks titian bridges minus the titian pos based clone bays provide toolssystem upgrades that can be easily damaged and repaired by some blue collar work give the inferstructure partial weakness options not just  there or not there auto resource collection damping units able to shoot structures pos infrastructures components that allowed produce lessen effects or cost more to maintain if damaged the great wall of text  the sob back storylife as a member of a small alliance it is toughwe are so small that we can be suppressed easily and we dont have the resources to make it out on our own compared to the big blocksto survive we need to join a pact with a larger alliance as a pet and just hope the we get treated well and the enemy block does not lock its eyes on uscurrently there is no diminishing returns on the growing you alliance larger resulting in large alliances being formed to to be able to share resources and create land buffer zones to either force the enemy to jump a few to systems of lightly populated carebearing content so the intel channels can report them or have enough space so that if an opponent tries to suppress them ie afk cloakers the alliance can simply shift its care bears members from one system to the other face it in a harsh world there is safety in numbers in nullsec bigger is better there are very few things that become less effective as an organization growspredominion large alliance could hold vasts volumes of space reasonably cheaply and crap space was just plugged up just so there would be a land base barrier to protect vs roams if there was trouble you could simple blob it out at your conveniencepost dominion  it removed the ease to just grab space the cost was much higher and the sov system allowed for upgrading a system that allowed alliances to take up less space the ones able to leverage this advantage though was the larger alliances as they had resources to upgrade the systems simplyfor the few organized smaller alliance also took advantage of this allowing them to build up a system of their own crap system to be able to function in a section of space though they had to bargain with the local power block to allow them to be there as the assetsadly this only worked well in isolated regions of space which the larger power block too the opportunity and organized renter power blocks that allowed them dedicate some tools like jumpbridges to assist there renter alliance to turn isk and were in return able to charge an arm and a leg in rent as a strong side benefit it made blue lists a lot simplerto be continued
sadly the game play issues that would be used commonly to shut down small alliances were never addressed there are limited mobility options that dont required large alliance ships and assetsthere is no option for a smallstarter alliance to fortify its self in its starting locationthere are limited options for small roam objectives that can have an effect on a larger alliance with out being curb stompted while in the the process the following are issues that if address can assist smaller alliances while not taking away from the large alliances but only giving them marginal benefitsi will list the general issue and then follow up with possible micro issues to fixmobility as it isonly large alliances can set up supply routes though jump bridges smaller alliances have to rely on these larger alliances to get out into their territories the jump network set up by larger alliances has been a big help in this area but has crushed any idea of small alliance independence it they wish to stand on their own if we the small alliance wants to do close to home pvp and turn on our larger alliance allys we will be cut off from the nipple of empire for sustaining ourselves only the large alliances have the power to force project them selves into distance fights with titian jump bridges so it is either travel for ages or blob with the big boys we need to make travel in eve more fluid put more options in the hands for small roams to go enjoying in the harassment in some locations away from the well travelled path grass cant grow on a well travelled trail and opening up access to others need to put force projection capabilities in the hands of the poorer manthe problema small alliance is crippled if it wants to be compete or stand on its own from the major power blocksthe proposed solutiongive cheaper tools to help smaller alliances become more mobile iegive jump clone vats like the rorquals to carriers so that small alliances can load a bunch of ships and pilots and force project near the battle location to rally their troops then attack larger alliances currently use jump bridges and titian bridges to accomplish jumping right into combat this will allow help in getting alliances set up to move outdefenceless jump bridge shipproduce a fragile jump bridge ship which is based on a weakened jump freighter chassy that needs escort of fueling ships has short a spool up timer making it less efficient time wise than a titan making more of a target roamsjump bridge ship cant to stay behind and can only project none capital size ships that is what jump freighters are forthis would allow a smaller alliance independence from the larger block to move material past standard bottle necks and remove the need to rely on the infrastructure of a larger power block this ships would be super juicy target it would required an escort and would reward those smaller roams with a target that would be worth while to suicide kill clone bays for poss required null sec status to installas a small alliance you will not have the resource to build a station and a have to rely on larger block alliances for an office or a station to jump clone to if a limited pos clone bay like the rorqual clone bay holds max 510 bodies would be fantastic small alliance member get popped and then podded he may end up in his death clone in empire but can clone jump wo implants into his pos where he must install another back up jump clone this would be less effective than a station clone but would allow a small alliance to take more risks and pvp in null sec with out the worry of loosing everthing because of 1 podding
 alliance hanger for poss allow a single container like a no tabs corporate hanger array that the alliance can place in and take out items personally i am a alliance mining cocoordinator conduct a local or a remote mining op often becomes c
dominion suggestion treaties not sure how beneficial this will be for the work involved though as the out of game politics and diplomacy in use currently may be adequate i did a little diplomacy work and didnt like it and i am worried that
doh  i think i may have have just posted in the wrong section sorry
capitals are already mostly useless in 00 due to supers id like to see more balance so supers dont make capitals completely obsolete its very lame that a 100 man capital fleet cant go out because theres 20 supers around that will  the fleetnerf fighterbombers instead supers already have crapton of ehp to account for their cost or buff capitals 5x ehp would do p
i like how they dont know how to spell plagiarism
as mentioned wrong forum still funny as hellthis mail was pure unadulterated lol i bet that the people who came up with this wrote it this way because its funnier than hell
forgive me for not having the time to troll the forums for the answer to my question but i would like to know if the csm are going to try and get pos settings looked atmy issues with the current system can be found here
we the csm all agree that poses suck we are planning on discussing them with ccp during the upcoming summit as someone who lives out of a pos in wormhole space i absolutely understand the pain of pos management
yeah i love the idea of being able to set up a base of operations with my corp but i have trust issues so if ccp could fix this flawed system that would be great thank for the reply csm
god almighty both of you just shut upseriously take a step back look at yourselves and shut up
i think they are soul mates
thus far ive not seen mittens trying to sneak anything past the rest of us hell the guy posts and talks constantly he asks a ridiculous amount of questions of the other delegates opinions and about past csm processes and weve all started to work on ways that we think things might work better  differentlyi guess what people fail to realize is that im in a meeting right now with 6 other csm members on skype were actually discussing topics for the may csm summit and the current discussion is heavily focused on improving the game for newbies ten minutes from now it might be about world of tanks so yeah its all about titans and jump bridges this has been happening almost every day for three weeks now i just leave skype on and when i get up in the morning i read all of the words that i missed and if i see something fascist or crazy i bring it up and say guys wtf is this  lets talk some more about it because were all complete wall of text s everyone is happy to reengage until a consensus is reachedseriously seven of the nine of us are noobs at this council thing so were going to put our own spin on it i honestly have no idea how many formal meetings that csm6 is going to have obviously we are going to want to get some specific stuff on the record and were going to have to adjust our processes for that at the moment however were going 300 kph and are constantly trying to think of new ways that we can take the csm to the next level in terms of effectiveness and community interaction i think that part of the problem is that the community is used to seeing the csm act or conduct itself in a certain way were trying a few new things and because mittens is involved some folks are all zomg they are all goon puppets at this point i am content to just let speculation run rampant while i continue to work with the other csm members as we keep pulling mittens back from insert bad activity here like eating babies in the end well be judged by our record in office so far i am optimisticas for the content of this thread the vice chair position was mine if i wanted it but killer 2 suggested that we might want to make it clear that we are not solely 00 focused by putting someone else in the slot i didnt really care because the position itself doesnt really matter unless mittens gets hit by a bus and i like being a team player so  it why notin all seriousness though we did consider naming the ferox battlecruiser as the vice secretary i have chat logs to prove it
vice secretary candidates put forward thus far the feroxmy puppythe 152mm derp gun on the kv2a roomba
oh i didnt mean to imply anything of the kind exactly the opposite in factyes by a strict interpretation of the white paper since youre making everelated decisions and there are seven of you present what youre in right now is a csm6 meetingthe interesting part if it is a meeting then the secretary should be documenting it and recording who was there
ooh i vote for roomba its excellent at keeping track of the dirt we spew i wait i mean you spew we are all mindless bumbling idiots that blindly follow you and have no opinions of our own i guess you can keep it busy 
in all honesty i think you guys have an image problem that you need to work onthat doesnt say you guys are doing a bad job or anything its just  that you guys have an image problemmaybe a bit less arrogance from mittani too at least he has that image of being arrogantim sorry but im just pointing the finger on the sore spots
you ran a hysterical ignorant and barely literate campaign as ms pacman i think ill ignore any advice from you about image problems
this is hilarious serious internet spaceship politics is very serious err a gameps the puppy is the obvious choice as it will actually do something with the minutes
from past experience there will be a long line of people waiting for their turn to do the same thing
ccp sreegs is responsible for this pr disaster
long awaited ferox buff spotted
and then they wonder why the csm has a certain image
bread and circuses csm6 doesnt fail to disappoint btw i heard that ankh is back in eve and she would make a really good secretary of vice
i would like to propose the 3ed spotlight is something with universal appeal and will improve the game in many waysupdating the look of eve will help improve new player retention and bitter vets we all like cool space ships flying through space and it undoubtedly plays a role in why the majority of subscribers play eveengine trails and updated warp effects are common posts in the suggestion pagesit is also well within the realm of possibility for ccp to achieve this if it rises in priorityby having the csm spotlight the lack of these once great effects and request that more development time be put into them we may actually see some results
most of our other spotlights will focus on things that will effect almost everybody not just bitter vets as you call them
im keeping this bumped yeah i know lack of updates but there hasnt been any issues that really stand out though yeah i will add them as the come alongeditadded hot topics by akita t 1000 paper cuts and stop rushing things damnit
for great justice
supported and i dont even own a pos
incarna will not stop me from canceling 3 accounts if eves old broken features arent fixedpos towerssovbetter gms who actually read your petition instead of apologizing for taking to long to get to your petition
yeah there will be a lot of thati would suggest looking at faction frigates and balancing them out a bit
increase the jumpportal range on the black opsget rid of the tier system for t1 frigs it would be nice to have some options besides rifters to fly in pvpfix the inconsistencies between meta 4 and t2 modules
see my sigcapital ships of all flavors except perhaps the titans need to be reviewed and possibly even revamped entirely with special emphasis on dreadsdumping the tier system would pretty much balance the rest of the t1 shipsthe t2 lineups need review as well too many ships out there that nobody uses for anything at all special emphasis on bo cs and the non ecm ew ships
nobody is gonna be looking at your sig just post your ideas here
for me the first thing i can think of as far as ships is the dreads i remember when i joined eve and was like whoa dreads are fawesome then i found out that they are basically big fat battleships that move 3x slower have horrible damage against other capitals can pretty much only shot stationary structures rly only have 3 xl turrets and not to mention the 10 minutes it takes to make your guns look all fancy they need some serious buffing my personal uneducated and ignorant idea that will no doubt get trolold is to simply give the dreads more turrets when i say this i am thinking of the star wars star destroyers like 30 large 20 medium and 10 small and proper missile upgrades to the caldari all active at oncejust my opinion or whatever
i didnt vote for you but ill humor you anywaymandate tiericidedont you have a secretary
quick thoughts 1 eaf are too weak in the current pvp environment why does the griffin have 50 farther targeting range than the kistune all the eafs have a reduced targeting range and most have reduced cpu isnt this a little assbackwards2 the fourth bonus on afs would be nice but not required most afs are fairly quality as is as long as they have midslots the ab bonus that was tested a while back sounded pretty nice i wonder why it was discarded 3 the dramiel is a little tooooooooooooo fast for its tank and dps its ok for it to be the fastest dualprop frig with a mse but not if it outputs 200 dps too the best compromise ive heard is to reduce its dps by 1020 keep it at the top but engageable 4 scs 5 hybrids realistically they probably should have switched the minnie  gallente weapons platforms but tis too late for that hybrid platforms need more pg and blaster platforms need a way to get in range i would reduce autocannon tracking to less than their blaster counterpart and boost blaster optimal by 25 6 i think destroyer bonuss are all mixed up for their corresponding races 7 ships with only 1 midslot are broken for pewpew if its a combat ship it aught to have 2 midmidslots8 give bos some luvin either make the ships cough sin cough more combat capable or allow them a longer jump range and the like
id like to reference something that eve facebook page brought me to in terms of ship balancing and that is thisthrowing the math part of the link away for a moment if you look at the distribution graphs 14 of the way down and the near the end of the document youll see graphic representations of why certain ships are favored amongst others when it comes to a ships navigational performancethere needs to be a better spread although i agree in part with a bit of ship type grouping and racial grouping in this area i dont believe certain ships should have such an unquestionable dominance over anotherit makes little real world sense either in terms of industry just because intel used to make the 500mhz mmx processor doesnt mean its viable for the current era similarly id rather see ships more closely balanced and then shifted around constantly in the form of updates improvements and upgrades to simulate shipyard industry rivalry and competitivenessthis does not mean a constant chain of buffing what might buff one aspect of a ship could nerf another aspect which may be buffed in another update providing a detrimental double nerf to another aspect keeping the level of buffs and nerfs equal and constantly shifting will create dynamicism and a constantly changing combat situation i would also add with the now 64 bit database it could be made possible to opt a ship out of the update chain preserving a particularly successful update thus making them extremely valuable commodities
from hot topics of the assembly hallblack opstldr  black ops are too weak their jump range and resists should be boosted and add covert ops cloak or a variation there of for black ops shiporiginal concept  many of you dont remember but when black ops were being tested they were going to mount a module that basically pinged cloakers that were on grid that were cloaked this ping would allow black ops to temp see cloakers and fly to them to uncloak themgallente  drone boats  they are fine dont fix what aint broke anyone who thinks the ishtar or dominix suck dont know how to fly gallenteblaster boats hyperion deimos astarte megathron if you are daring simply put there are two problems they are too massive weight and there is not enough capacitor due to hybrids requiring cap this puts gallente ships below par of something like the vaga or zealotfix  there are a few things i can think of1 increase capacitor2 ship bonus that reduces the max capacitor penalty of mwd3 lower the ships mass to allow faster acceleration4 increase base speed of gallente shipsminmatartempest needs some freaking love as it stands right now people would rather get a phoon or a maelstrom over a tempestproposed fix  tempest  tempest fleet issue  raise the power grid by 1000 mw possibility 2  adjust the rof  damage mod to 75 per leveltempest fleet issue only  add back the 7th turret slottech 3 shipsthese also need some major love especially the legion one general thing  all defensive subsystems should have a drone bay of sorts ranging from 1025 mUFFFD based on the type of subsystempossible fix 2 why is there a reason to train strategic cruiser past level 1 other than for overhead have the base hulls give a racial bonus of some sort examplecaldari  5 flight time per levelgallente  5 falloff per levelamarr  5 bonus to energy turret use  5 rof to missilesminmatar  5 to cool looking wingy bits per level or 5 to shield  armor boost per level shrugs these are just ideaselectronic attack shipswhat to do about these ummm best guess is reduce sid radius and boost resists to shields and armor to be in line with af make them hard to kill like interceptors or give them durability like afanyway those are just ideas
improve the maller and prophecy so that they are something other than bait or an occasional comedy fleet optionthe base change should be either to abaddonize or khanidize each ship abaddonize meaning to have laser damage and resist bonuses and khanidize meaning to have ham damage and resist bonuses my preference would be to make the prophecy a ham ship the maller could go either wayadditionally the maller will need more cpugrid it does not have nearly enough of a cpugrid advantage over the totally superior rupture to compensate for the higher fitting requirements of lasers especially considering the rupture gets dronesand nerf angel ships into the ground
my 2 isk for blacksops changeschange the cloaked velocity bonus to a 20 per level reduction of scan resolution and speed penalty of fitting cloaking devicesincrease jump and bridge range by 50 should be enough to get some of those regional jumps that are just out of reach currently change the sins agility bonus to a 75 tracking bonus per levelchange the panthers speed bonus to 10 falloff per level bonus add t2 resists
damn beat me to it nerf minmatar rage
the drake really needs some tweaking it can simply accomplish too much at the same time in gangs of almost every size except for megablobs massive buffer regen the huge range of heavy missiles low reliance on cap and shield tanking allows it to stay faster than the other bcs with the exception of the hurricane assuming its shield tanked all this in one cheap easy to train package that is especially hard to counter in small gangsyes yes bring on the endless flames but it is the 1 most used combat ship for a reason
i should probably point out that the csm have already said theres little point posting ideas for specific balance tweaks as ccp is more interested in hearing what the problem is than what you think the solutions areedit by which i mean big picture ideas buff tier 1 battlecruisers are probably fine microlevel tweaks give the ferox another turret slot5 more grid500 more shield hpwhatever will probably be ignored by ccpill walloftext a list of problems a little later
replace tempest with freeborn model ccp starship contest finalist  freeborn  tempestreplace ferox with vidar model  vidar  feroxreplace rupture with thor model  thor  rupture
i detest that the following statement is true in this gamewhy fly abc when xyz existsthat applies to so many ships right now so many that are simply inferior to other ships so they see no use at all granted you could name any ship and there will be some die hard out there who had some mild success with it once out of a hundred times and swears by it but lets be realistic here
1 oneiros and scimitarboth need a remote energy transfer bonus just like the basilisk and guardian2 black opsjumpbridge range increase because sometimes its quicker to go through a stargate than jump i wanted to do single jump to a system that was 2 stargates away but instead i had to travel 10 stargates to get to a mid jump system then 10 stargates back3 damps and ew as a wholewith the damp reduction a few years ago the arazu and lachesis were rendered fairly meaningless where as you could damp a single target down to less than 5k these days your lucky to get the target below max scramble rangeill use the base raven for referenceraven  93km rangedamp lvl5arazurigs  60 per damp0x  93km1x  55km2x  33km3x  20kmmy scramble range with a t2 scrambler is 162km 18km with lvl5 skillswhat i would like is more modules that works similar to the ecm signal distortion amps which gives 10 bonus to use of ew modules damps ecm tracking disruptors even perhaps webs and scrams this would enable better use of damps and tracking disrupters but also will make you decide whether to compromise the low slots of ships for tank or ew ampsanother side effect of increased ew efficiency would be for electronic attack frigates4 electronic attack ships a increase tank whether thats by resists or hp b increase lock range c using 3 would increase the usefulness of eafs
my ship balance problem with the game from a macro instead of a micro world view logistics once a certain level of dps is on the field you have to rr to keep ships up and since there are two types of rr everyone standardizes to the type that the greatest number of ships in the game use making life easier on everyonefix thisand no this isnt a zomg fix my caldari shield rant i want there to be strategic or tactical reasons to standardize a fleet to one or the other beyond the number of ship types you broughtits a bit beyond the boundary of simple ship balance but if one type of fitting or tactic becomes the norm because its so overwhelmingly better than all others its probably a good idea to introduce a balancing factor against it or to introduce a new mechanic which gives reasons for or against implementing it
disclaimer the following is written from a small scale pvpers perspective only i will begin with what i think is good about the current system the rockpaperscissors model basically works it ensures that theoretically no ship class is useless and even for a veteran with 50 million sp there can still be a reason to fly a rifter over a battleship in a given situation this is a point where eve differs from other rpgs and i like it there is an everchanging world out there and you have to use your brains adapt to it theorycraft new setups test them iterate them and so on this is what pvp in eve is all about in my opinion so in your attempts to balance ships do not overact until all ships are the same the diversity must be mantained and even emphasizedthat said there are issues with ship balancing a lot of them actually but we have a good foundation upon which we can build i will adress several things in order of importance1 the mediumsized ship class as a whole eg all cruiser and battlecruisersized ships the addition of strategic cruisers has even more added to the problems here i will give some examples instead of explaining the theory for three pages command ships are almost completely useless at the moment field command ships are not worth their price and training time when you look at the strong tier2battlecruisers there is just no reason to justify flying a command ship instead when it only performs a slight bit better just look at the harbinger which does more dps than the absolution or the myrmidon which has better tank and versatility than the astarte fleet command ships used to be powerful but nowdays unprobable t3 cruisers offer even better gang bonuses while being almost completely invulnerabletier 1 battlecruisers are vastly inferior to their tier 2 brothers and are used very seldomlybalance between races is bad in tech 1 cruisers the rupture is the best of them with no other being able to compete with the possible exception of the blackbird all races need good tech 1 cruisers when have you last seen a moa omen or thorax used in pvp the whole ship class needs some worka role must be found for some hacs that currently dont see much use hacs as a whole must be more focused on speed and maneuverability so there is a reason to use one over a bc at the moment a nano hurricane is about as fast as a sacrilege or a deimos while also having superior damage output and versatility that does not sound right to mesome of the empire faction cruisers especially fleet scythe navy exequror and navy osprey are way to weaki consider the tier 2 battlecruisers too strong in total they can be used with success in almost any situation and offer such a good compromise in speed tank damage and price that they often replace hacs command ships or t3s altogether2 hybrid weapons especially medium sized hybrid weapons are very weak and need some kind of buff i will not elaborate on this any further it has been discussed for years3 active tanking it is more skill intensive than buffer tanking usually requires more slots and is more difficult to do cap management and all it makes total sense that active tanked ships are not supposed to be viable in large engagements but it should be possible to win a 1on1 in an active tanked ship without using stuff like drugs implant sets and faction fittings this matter must be adressed carefully so as to not make fully pimped maelstroms the ultimate solopwnmobiles continued in next post
continued from above post4 angel cartel ships while expensive and difficult to fly are a bit too strong when you fight one you either die or the enemy can run away unless he makes a crucial mistake5 destroyers and intedictors generally the minmatar ships are the only good ones in this class the others need to be put in line6 the arazu and lachesis need some kind of improvement to their ew bonuses so as to make sensor dampeners viable to use edit forgot about the keres maulus and celestis same applies for thoseso basically just what marconus orion said every ship should be resonable to use in some situation there sould be no such thing as a useless shipkyang
ship what o never heard that word related eve sorry
vile ratthank you for setting up a topic for this much needed area of adjustment being a bitter vet that is truely getting burnt out of changing ships i can say gallent cald hybrid systems are totally broken i am an avid gallente pilot they would really be good if hybids were not so totally broken with rngdps ratios it makes no sence that i can fly a mega and do piddle for dps against anyone regardless of setup then add in they are the slowest bricks you can throw into a pool and you get broken blasters on a ship that can never get into range what is the point of staying race specifici have now taken up the common practice of fitting lazors and autos to all my ships even losing the bonus i am better off my ferox is full of 220s autos and can take darn near anyone my mega is pulse lasor fit and get a large factor i hate this bring back a reason for me to fit hybrids papa boats
the omen needs more powergrid and base speed it should be quicker than a rupture but slower than a stabber it should be capable of fitting hpls without tank or grid mods it should be capable of fitting fmpls with serious tank and hbls with grid modsthe only t1 cruiser worthy of flying is atm the rupture please change that
you know i love this post i agree i hate that whole classes of ships end up obsoleted because some other class does it better dreadnoughts im looking at youkeep the ideas coming guys dont worry about interpreting the thread too much just post all your hair brained ideas on how to fix things and things you got a gripe with
it would be nice if the specific ship bonuses were reviewed in general in there effects both pve and pvp a few are favored over all others max velocity and resist specifically also some of the slot layouts are quite unpopular retribution deimos and otherslarger drone baysand lastly look at a lot of the minmatarangel lineup and their effect on solosmall gang pvp based on player preference i think you greatly underbudgeted speed and agility when deciding ship characteristics the ability to dictate an engagement is a very potent ability especially when they also deal comparable dps to their competitorsps change something about hybrids do anything you think will make them better
this wont be popular because im calling for mostly nerfs and the myopic always like the incessant turning of the powercreeping boostwheel oh well1 battlecruisers tier 2 battlecruisers are too popular because theyre too good at too many things their abundant slots and fittings give them mobility competitive with t1 cruisers while their abundant medium weapons give them vastly superior but still relativelyeasytoapply firepower they step on the toes of both battleships and cruisers too much while obsoleting tier 1 bcs solution nerf tier 2 bcs to tier 1 levels by cutting their ehp slot counts and turretlauncher layouts people will switch from tier 2 bcs to cruisers tier 1 bcs and bs the diversity of ships seen in space will increase2 supercarriers theyve obsoleted dreadnoughts by being better at being dreadnoughts than dreadnoughts dreads are well balanced because they have a defined role they have to commit to a fight and theyre very vulnerable to subcapitals supercarriers have none of these weaknesses and no defined role supercarriers need to be much less mobile much more vulnerable to subcapitals and need to have a specific role this will maybe require changes to cyno mechanics removal of their ability to deploy fighters and their immunity to normal tackle3 increase the 150 km minimum warp distance to 250 km a wreck or probe result 150 km away can be warped to in seconds this degree of mobility reduces the value and meaning of range rendering longrange combat unfairly difficult it reduces the value of ships designed to engage in longrange combat and the value of fast ships as restrictions on both range and speed can be bypassed in seconds by an appropriate warp change the minimum warp distance to 250 km the lock range 4 rails the defining feature of rails is range it is therefore absurd that the ship with the most gun dps around 240 km is not a railboat while okay on the frigate level theyre flat bad at the cruiser level and rendered obsolete at the bs level by the existence of the apocalypse boost cruiser rails nerf the apocs range bonus to 5level or remove it entirely then see how bs rails look in conjunction with the change to the minimum warp distance5 blasters the defining feature of blasters is closerange dps but acs and can also apply dps effectively at close range to the extent that theyre almost as good at blasters at being blasters but have vastly superior range to boot given their greater range acs and pulse have unnecessarily good tracking allowing them to hit small stuff by manipulation of range while blasters always fall foul of range or tracking reduce the tracking of pulse and acs increase the tracking of blasters and maybe their raw dps a tad
capitals  carriers nerf archoncapitals need a full review including carriersas is the archon is simply the best by a wide margin it has the strongest local tank by far even compared to the chimera the chimera loses out because it needs cpr iis to be cap stable which gimp the local tank it has the best cap stability  and for carriers cap is life  and as it can fit 3 rr and run that from its cap partially it even outrrs 50 a nidhoggur which supposedly gets a bonus 2025 to that there is no reason ever to fly anything but an archon in an armorbased fleet and with three carriers designed for armor tanks thats kind of sillythis goes as far as to making people prefer armor tanks over shield tanks in fleets because the archon is simply so much betterlogistics boost oneirosthere is no redeeming quality for an oneiros in a fleet the guardian has a better tank better rr ability has better fitting is faster has a lower signature etc etc etc the oneiros needs a rolepossibility make the guardian slower with a higher signature so the guardian is the cap chain based ship but the oneiros being able to sig tank much better and give them roughly equal fittingtanking abilitycommand ships boost eosthere is currently no reason to fly an eos it needs a much better tank to be useful for armor fleets it currently tanks worse than a bs information warfare links should do with a revamp too theyre nice but not nearly as useful as the three othersabaddon nerfright now there is almost no reason to ever fly any other battleship than the abaddon except a machariel for fast fleets the abaddon has a much bigger buffer than any other bs much better resists ie logistics tank absolutely fantastic range 80km with pulses and 2x tc which also completely mitigates the minimal tracking problems of lasers can fit artillery for alpha fleets and is in that role superior to the maelstrom same alpha same range much better tank lower rof is easily mitigated by the better buffer and has in essence no real drawback this is compounded by the archon being such an awesome carrier compared to the rest see abovepicking abaddons as fleet ships should have some kind of actual drawback in proportion to their advantages if they have 50 more ehp and tank than anything else they need say seriously reduced damage output and not just 10 less dps than the other options there never should be one ship for a role thats simply better in every respect than the others its fine if there is a ship that is best in some qualities but not in allfaction ships nerf dramielthe navy faction ships are nice they are close to the t2 versions and have different roles the hookbill needs a check because its a tiny bit too strong compared to say the slicer or especially the firetail but theyre all quite okpirate faction frigates are so far out of scale its not funny anymore the dramiel is the favorite example but the daredevil isnt much behind either its boring if a single ship is simple the best in every way make the dramiel have some kind of drawback compared to at least some other frigates doesnt need to big much but as it is the frigate class is dominated by 15 frigatesthe angel lineup is also too strong all in all but im not sure if that is because the other pirate faction ships are so weak in comparison or because the angels are so goodps fix fw plexes so they treat faction ships as t2 the new player minor plexes being dominated by dramiels is unfun
echo what arkady says above carrier balance is out of whack and i say this as an archon pilot and the eos is just sad the astarte is also but thats very much tied to the sad state of hybrid guns at the moment so could be fixed via that  on the other hand its a command ship without a utility slot for the gang link compare to absolution so there is that to fix in any caseand yes the angel ships are op i think pretty much everyone is aware of this some rebalancing needed therethough its a minor issue id also point out the active tank bonuses on blockade runners as something that could use a rethink even on prowler fitting a buffer tank makes more sense if you do the math and on viator and whatevertheamarroneis who uses a lowslot on a hauler for an active repper ffsadded eafs fix them please i dont remember seeing anyone fly them ever outside the alliance tournaments 
i think that alot of the bos problems are because there are few situations where it is actually usefulthe farms and fields topic may provide more practical situations where the bo actually has a purposethat being said i would change two things about the ships themselves1 longer range on covert jump bridge2 allow use of t2 covert ops cloak not being able to warp while cloaked really nerfs the ships utility
some general things that are linked to ship bonuses and therefore to effective balancehybrid weapons need help rails are too weak especially compared to fitting reqs and cap use and blasters do not work well enough dps and tracking in their ultracloserange envelope to be worth it usuallysensor damps are close to useless currently even on ships with bonuses for them lachesis arazu its very rare to find a use case for damps nowadays especially since you need a lot of them  one does nothing compare to ecm effectsubcapital active tanking is inferior to buffer tanking in all except very tiny engagements ie vs at most a few enemies since most fights are against larger numbers active tanks and therefore ships with active tank bonuses become bad this is especially galling since active reppers are also harder to fit and use lots of cap either active tanks need a buff passive tanks a nerf or the active tank ship bonuses need a hefty boost or a combo of thosethese are all pretty wellknown issues but just thought id list them here
warning to forum mods vile rat may cry if you edit his postson topici would really like to see the removal of t1 tiers of frigate cruiser bc bs etc  they add almost nothing to the game the escalation through them is almost nonexistant as they are so role focused this would mean substantial buffs to many t1 hulls and might i suppose also require some nerfs to bring them all in lineif a compromise is needed for noobs i would propose a single hull be deemed a stepping stone hull worth about 50 of the rest of the class for noobs to start in but im really not sure this is needed

in my very limited experience i feel gallente and caldari ships need to be looked athybrids are in definite trouble compared to every other weapon system in the game anyone who says different either a doesnt fly these ships andor b is delusional ive seen someone post a short video of doing tripledigit damage per volley on a megathron and claiming it was working just finedrones need to be looked at as well especially for drone ships good example of this is the myrmidon battlecruiser it has 75 bandwidth exactly the same as a vexor cruiser far too low needs to be upgraded to 100 at least capacity might have to be increased too and of course drone modules could use t2 variants etc etc you know the drill as a racial weapon system which the tutorial claims is drones for gallente drones are badly neglectedfurther limiting the number of drones under control to 5 for everyone is rather unfair to gallente for example a rupture can use ewar drones while still doing a lot of damage with turrets and launchers while a vexor has to use damage drones or lose a very large portion of its damage imho some system needs to be worked out to keep damage drones and specialutility drones separate or give drone boats the option to fly 1 specialutility drone per skill level and tweak their effectivenesscaldari ships by relation second race to use hybrids along with gallente need to be looked at as well but i believe fixing hybrids will go a very long way towards making caldari ships function betterewar could use a review as well gallente dampening is rather weak when compared to amarr tracking disruption which is weaker compared to caldari jamming it has its place i wont deny that but it is highly situational just ask people doing fw missions people hate running missions vs caldari because they get jammed and missile spammed but they love going against gallente because hybrids hit like wet noodles and dampening is highly ineffective almost negligible really

dreadnaughts currently have no role except bait right now scs perform any role a dread can do better and have increased mobility to boot they also are favorite targets for titans to dd due to the fact that they just dont have the ability to realistically tank a dd suggestions  make dreads more resiliant to doomsdaysbombers while in siege 50 reduction to doomsdaybomber damage recieved while in siege increase dread jump range to match carriers also give dreads a slight damage or range bonus while in siege its just too easy to set up carrierscs outside of dread range and kill every last one from the other side of a pos bubble i think for the most part vs subcaps dreads are very well balanced against scs and titans they fall far short and just arent used much anymore tier 1 battlecruisers are rarely used compared to tier 2 normalize ehp values between the two and adjust fitting and bonuses to promote versatility within the class as a whole hybrids  small blasters are fine for the most part however medium and large blasters are terrible there really isnt any reason to fit anything other than autocannonslazersheavy missiles on cruiserbc sized hulls projectiles and lazers are quite good on bs hulls as evidenced by the prominance on 1400 mael and baddon fleets optimal  falloff on 1400s vs megapulse iis seems to be pretty fairly balanced unfortunately ther just isnt any place for 425 rails 350 rails and blasters within the arena boost falloff for mediumlarge hybrids to add more practical application of damage
the problem with armor tanked blaster boats is they are as agile and fast as a twolegged pregnant cow and have the attack range of trexs armsthe problem with rails is they have no useful niche in the game right nowthe problem with caldari hybrid ships is they are slow and do very little damagethe problem with snipers in general is how hard it is to keep range whether it be the silly speed a dram can fly the 100km range max warpin range the hypefast probe scan times or the alpha weapons the natural sniping type of weapon favoring medium rangefrigates are unbalanced because the current trade off is a little extra tank for a lot of speed and speed wins every single time so any frigate sized ship that cannot dictate range is worthless in most situations and the slow faction ships are worth little more than as hangar trophiesdreads are sitting ducks that are easy to ninja gank with high alpha ships like the scarriers and titans making them useful as bait or only in situations when enemy fleets are known to be no where near and are instantly safed up if so much as a single enemy ship shows up within 10 jumps they are currently very dreadful but not the definition that was intendedmoon goo is unbalanced it means from an alliancelevel you are either in control of systemsconstellations in the north or you have a harder time investing in alliancelevel projectstitans need to be reworked to fit their current mechanic it is hard to have a game rule prohibiting account sharing while at the same time creating alliancelevel ships that by default require the access of multiple people in most casesscarriers are evil creatures that keep captive a character with at least a year of training while usurping the game niche of dreadnoughts at the same time they are i win buttons for smalltomedium sized fleets ten scarriers shouldnt be able to keep hundreds of battleships cowering in fearthe self destruct command is broken in combat situations it is used for any number of different things that do not benefit the gamelocal makes botting easybelt ratting makes botting easyhauler missions make botting easynull sec completely lacks any incentive to obtain low end minerals locally shipping them in is far far more cost and energy effectiveincursions provide far too much income having become the new anom for null sec players fly in to low sec join incursion fleet  profitblops lack range and fuel storage space to be reasonable ships they also have no use other than as a transport meaning few people are willing to use one as it is generally no fun to click a button then listen to the rest of the fleet enjoy the rewardsships with active rep bonuses waste a bonus for most pvp situations making them generally less useful ships especially the ones that are bad for pvepulse and ac have insane tracking impressive dps and reasonable range making the use of anything else for crtomr fights uselessarmor is heavily favored by mechanics from implants base resists and buffer for anything bs sized and up in pvp with the exception of a few bs that need the speedmake super carriers bigger we should be able to pick them out on a battlefield to identify and kill far easier than we currently canscrap the moa hull its shear ugliness keeps people away even if hybrids were useful
i think the biggest change to ship balance needs to be in how ccp approaches it not in terms of a particular change to a particular class of ships right now ccp does a balance change about every 3 years to a given shipgun thats about 10x too long a cycle if a class is fine leave it alone by all means but if a class is deeply problematic then change it in steps and regularly reevaluate how your past changes are doing the poster child for this is black ops  introduced three and a half years ago with one nicebutminor tweak in that timeability to ignore cynojams theyre still the least commonly flown ship class in eve by far despite being one of the most inherently cool ccp should have a policy of looking at ships that are that hilariously underused every few months and tweaking them upwards until balance is reached no massive buffs that will leave them op like they did with motherships but calm tweaks every few months and watch the results lack ops say you give them a covops cloak see if theyre better three months later if not up their ehp by a quarter and wait another few months it wont get them to the right level instantly but if they were to do things this way then we sure as hell wouldnt be here three plus years later with them still being junk this strongly implies that ccp should have a permanent balance team or at least a balance dude to look at this stuff regularly and in depth and not adhoc it like they have in past of note the above policy applies much more to buffs than nerfs nerfs annoy players more so they should be less common and thus more impactful the way that nanos and the falcon were nerfed were both good at least procedurally but for the usual suspects that people whine about needing a buff small and regular tweaks should be the name of the game
wall of text as promised ill start at the lowest point and work down class by classt1 frigates have three major issues  the tier system horribly cripples the lower tier frigates several ship hulls are designed for roles that nobody wants mining frigates are a case in point as ineffective ship that newbies fly for a week until they can affordoperate a mining cruiser then never undock in again isnt a valid role by anyones standards and other hulls have inappropriate bonuses for the ships designated role  nobody flies a probing or ewar frigate for their damage output so why do they even have weapon bonusesi want variety in the t1 frigate range i want to be able to tell goonwaffe newbies something other than crosstrain to minmatar frigate and autocannons because everything except rifters are crap i want gallente pilots to be thinking hmm should i fly an atron or incursus for this gang and there be definite pros and cons to each i want to actually see a caldari frigate once in a whilet2 frigates  the existing interceptors monopolize most of the roles youd want from a combat ship  speed and tackling aside we have interceptors with damage bonuses double damage bonuses optimal bonuses ehp bonuses lots of guns the purpose of the interceptor is poorly defined and because of this it keeps treading on the toes of its cousins in the assault frigate and eaf classes leaving them with few viable roles to move into that arent already covered by a faster harder to hit interceptor also inevitable 4th af bonus comment goes herethe only real roles that the interceptor cant overlap on are those of the covert ops and stealth bomber which apart from the pointless weapon bonuses on the covert ops hulls see above are arguably the best balanced t2 frigs available  jokes about the helios and its dronebay and lack of 3rd highslot aside its an excellent reconnaissance shipfaction frigates the dramiel is absurdly broken the navy faction ships feel slightly underpoweredt1 destroyers fulfill a role nobody wants or needs  pitiful damage from a long way away is not a useful contribution and with the exception of easy mode level 1 missioning and suicide ganking shuttles and rookie ships in an artillery thrasher theyre pointless maybe they were useful before the hp buff in revelations but that was what 5 years ago theyre too slow too easy to hit with not enough hitpoints not enough damage output and not enough utility slots the catalyst in particular is a mess  combined falloff and optimal bonuses ugh make it a blaster and drone gankwagon alreadyt2 destroyers are better balanced than their t1 equivalent  the sabre is arguably slightly overpowered but thats mainly a function of autocannons having such low grid and cpu requirements the heretic and flycatcher are both usable their main problem being fitting issues if you try to actually squeeze missilerocket launchers onto them the eris is a horrible abomination however  split weapon systems including a pointless drone and a lack of valuable midslotst1 cruisers mostly balance out reasonably and most of their disparities are actually with the modules they fit  the rupture dominated the fanfest pvp tournament but that was as much as anything to do with autocannon supremacy as the actual hulls hybrid turret cruisers are bad because hybrid turrets are bad nonecm ewar cruisers are bad because nonecm ewar is bad the hulls themselves are reasonably usable
faction cruisers have some real dogs amongst their ranks  how many of us have forgotten that the navy osprey or scythe fleet issue even existed until we saw them on the ship browser window of eft our failed theorycrafting attempts at there must be some way to make this thing viable mocking us silently the cynabal is perhaps slightly over the top but certainly not a priority issue nowhere near as overpowered as the dramiel is t3 cruisers arent something im too familiar with but the legion is by all accounts vastly inferior to the other three and theres a bunch of nobrainer subsystem configurations with their corresponding hahaha why would you ever fit this mirrors also 5th subsystem alreadyt1 battlecruisers are where we see the worst offences of the tiering system with the possible exception of the brutix the tier 1s are all dreadful piles of garbage that nobody in their right mind would undock except for comedy lossmail purposes they badly need a viable niche that isnt expendable bait conversely the tier 2s themselves are actually fairly well matched to each other all having viable combat rolest2 battlecruisers are again not a class i have too much experience with except to say that as mentioned earlier itt they have suffered in the command ship role by the appearance of t3 command cruisers outperforming their bonusing role whilst sitting in a safespot impossible to probet1 battleships like t1 cruisers are mostly good or bad depending on whether their primary weapon system is good or bad the fotm metagame currently leans towards laser platforms and projectile platforms and sometimes projectile turrets fitted on supposedly laser platforms so reviving the rokh megathron and hyperion would largely depend on what happens to hybrids there is an issue with the hyperion and maelstrom receiving active tanking bonuses in an environment where remote repping reigns supreme over local repping but this is relatively minort2 battleships see their worst offences amongst the blackops class which is supposedly a combat ship with a portal ability but in practise came so badly prenerfed that they can barely fight a combat and barely portal the widow is usable in a support role mostly due to its jamming capabilities but the rest need help increase their combat capabilities good t2 resists as mentioned earlier in this thread would be a good start and increase their portaljump range marauders seem to mostly work as intended with the same issue around weapon systems as t1 cruisers and battleships
capitals as i said in the other thread are currently thrown way out of line by the absurd overpowering of supercarriers 00 has become a 1 dimensional arms race of who can field the most nyxes dreadnoughts and carriers can now only operate after you have counted your opponents supercaps and confirmed that you have more than they do supercarriers are dying at an unprecedented rate yes but when they do its almost always to larger packs of other supercarrierssupercarriers the nyx and aeon especially have 3 main advantages over other shiptypes  the massive ehp buffer massive variation in their primary weapon type and the large number of utility slots these things combine to produce a ship which can omnifit against any circumstance with little in the way of drawbacks that isnt balanced nor is it particularly fun and it has come to dominate the capital warfare scene some relatively modest nerfs to the three advantages i mentioned above would go a long way to bring them back under controloddly enough even titans arent particularly overpowered by themselves  the removal of the aoe doomsday increased their vulnerability to dictors and subcaps as did the capital gun buff in dominion because they now are encouraged to fit xl turrets or launchers in the highs rather than smartbombs and neuts and damage mods in the lows which compromise their tank andor capacitor if every supercarrier was deleted from the server database tomorrow dreadnoughts and carriers would be mostly balanced as they would no longer be rendered obsolete as sovgrinding tools and anticapital vessels whilst retaining some vulnerability to subcapital fleets some minor tweaks to them the 5 minute siege cycle for example would be welcome but the main issue of imbalance amongst capitals right now is the omnipotance of supercarriers
the information warfare link modules currently suffer from a stacking penalty the gang bonuses implants and skills that go into them become worthless for anyone already fitting any modules to boost the same stats
1 while i acknowledge that some ship classes have basically been obsoleted or were never truly viable i would contend that the primary culprit is the ship tier system in that spirit i think the most egregious flaws in high level ship balance are 
this sums it up very wellcurrently there is no reason for anyone to fly lower tier frigates lower tier cruisers or lower tier bcs in general this includes amongst others things like the slasher atron executioner condor breacher bellicose omen maller celestis moa ferox prophecy brutix for various reasonsadditionally the whole class of hybrid ships gallente blaster boats and caldari railgun boats are almost never used they all have serious fitting problems and their weapons are mostly outclassed by all the othersas mentioned elsewhere the lower navy ships scythe osprey exequror are all outclassed by higher tier t1 shipsthe question of op ships is one that should be very carefully considered as for example nerfing the dramiel the cynabel or the machariel might make them next to useless a small nerf perhaps but not much likewise although the drake is considered op due to its high resists big tank independence of cap and the huge range of heavy missiles a nerf might make it substandardtldr the most obvious imbalances like the lower tier ships and hybrids should be looked at first as these are the most pressing and rebalances should be done on a ship by ship basis not whole classesps although i dont fly them obligatory nerf supercaps and buff minnie and caldari caps
which is why putting a covert ops cloaking device on a battleship would be insanely over powered there is too much cloaking going on in this game anyways a covert ops cloak should not be the answer to fixing ships
unless the ship in question is designed to be used in cloaky gangs where every other ship has a covops cloak then it seems like a pretty sensible answer vile if you would fly a covops cloaked panther all the time you have vastly more money than sense
in ccp speak this means disable reprocessing of meta 0 items but yes if the low end minerals could be levelled up in unitsm3 to compete with abc for profit it would hopefully get mined locally
kill the static jump networks and make outposts upgradeable to station standards
how about this for burning crops and fieldsallow small gangs the ability to incapacitate ihub upgrades make the upgrades targetable like station services with way less hp of course so small groups can have large effects on the residents of that system by doing so they could for example stymie anomaly income or interrupt super cap construction or break key legs in a jump bride networkif the hp was low enough for small groups to incapacitate it would also be easy for the residents rep as well which will allow more opportunities for pvpin my mind more goals for small groups means more conflict and for the residents it means more conflict or headaches depending on your perspective and more conflict is good for everybody in eve
what i would hate to see is things that are basically something with x amount of hit points so blobbing it is the most effective way of doing the burning of the crops and fields i also would like it where the industrialist could somehow grow these things in a way to maybe cater a bit towards a home field advantage maybe like a script or something that changes the aspects of the grid it is onexample not to be taken super serious on specifics but hopefully you get the ideayou got some guys who want to minefarmwhatever bears do with industrial  and when they go to plant it they put in a script that nerfs remote repair  and boosts local reps or increases speed but reduces lock range or something make it dynamic also if they ignore the raiders and the raiders are able to burn the field which can grow back or whatever just dont want to see something being permanently destroyed then maybe the associated resource or category it is related to is not as profitableanyone get the vibe of that
first  dont let this be hijacked into another jb  distance thread stick that where the sun doesnt shine you got the true sec 00 nerf you freakin carebear so stfu go inhabit some abandoned renter systemmoving on to the optwo sepearate questions where one solution is not necessarily going to get you there if you want a response on the first half in my opinion your problems come down to refining in null sec and availability of empire minerals the former might be addressed by a more competitive  functional refining array for pos refining at a pos is lol the folks that have refining stations in system will continue to use them youre alliance hc all alliance hcs for that matter will probably steer you away from this because they will fear that youll get less income from the refining taxes so we can just pretend i never brought this up but if they have half a brain theyre probably realizing the true null sec nerf is going to cost them a good chunk of renter business and they might be able to get more mining folks to take up some spacethe latter could be addressed by increasing the volume of empire minerals available in null sec honestly you just dont have enough low end rocks to be free null sec players from the empire markets even if you have a solid industry division theres no possible way youre going to be able to pull up enough trit  mex  pye  iso to sustain a corp or alliance we sell our high ends in empire and get our low ends via compression mind you i dont necessarily think you will ever be able to do it and i dont think youre trying to get to total disconnect but more self sufficiency that being said stations arent broken pos for construction are working as intended ccp could implement a pretty descent fix  and in their eyes descent usually means cheap by jacking up the size of the empire rocks null sec dont jack em up in grav sites make the pvp folks happy jack em up in belts instead the other alternative is dramatically increase the hauler spawn rates another cheap fix for ccp something quick and easy so they can go back to doing stuff like walking in stations the stuff most of us dont care aboutlast youre asking two very distinct questions which in reality only have a chance at creating a single solution if youre going to try to solve for x try creating two separate threads and evaluating responses to see if there is an overlap enjoy your giant threadnaught that will probably accomplish nothing
using hacking skill and maybe new skills you could make it so small gangsindividual saboteurs can cripple the crops and fields for a small amount of time or until someone with other science skills comes along to repair the damage
i havent been much to nullsec but still some ideas might be useful1 get those ore faction tower or better get ore faction versions of refining arrays those arrays shall be fueled like the tower and are self dependent on cpu and power production arrays working the same way could help getting more production slots2 provide a passkey for a free passage trading run ie you ask an alliance whether you enter once to fly to an npc station and back to high sec youll be set for 24 hrs to blue the pass key cost you a small fee measured on a collateral the alliance pays the collateral will be a protection that no one who is blue to you can shoot you without the consequences as you pay for a free passage those pass keys should be predefineable and transferable so a courier contract in jita could provide a free passage as well the pass key could either work for the blue territory or for blue members my favorite is the territory as the alliance would then be responsible for your safety3 next to moon mining it should be possible to use a moon to provide ores as well a skill similar like pi could be interesting you scan a moon for places of certain ore concentrations the better the skill the better you can scan for ore i think to use the pi skill for that is not such a bad idea next skill would be new one you plant explosives on the moon area that explosives could release a small belt in to the space the higher the skill for the explosions the cleaner the belt and the bigger it gets skill at 1 is much more trit skill at 5 and more high mins could get extracted4 from what ive heard the structures to find mining belts are much harder to maintain as for getting rats equal those with the ratting structures getting more and better fields ie you dont have to mine as much for getting them to lvl 5
change gravimetric sites to where players can build structures inside them take a page from pi but allow us to blow it up instead of fps players scan down a grav site and setup a mobile command center inside it at that point it becomes a static entity which stays put until the command center is destroyeda mobile command center allows you to build extractor units for the large asteroids inside the site it also allows you to setup a basic production chain and finally setup a basic defensive grid thatll make solo players dead if they try to take it head on but a small gang of players should be able to clear out with no major problemsadd in a few sizes of mobile command centers for larger production chains and greater defensive arrays for larger gangs of players to kill for scalable difficulty  rewardsafter that give the attackers a few different choices of what they wanna do they could bring in haulers and a hacking module then try to steal everything in the hopper they could destroy it all they could do a bit of bothtie keeping the mobile command centers up and running with fuel back into pidust making the fpsers even more important to the gamekeep in mind i dont know if this should be done at all anything like this putting more and more of the onus of production on nullsec so people arent dependent on highsec will be the single largest sweeping change to eve ever made yes it could make 00 better but it could also break empire spacewhatever system or choice you decide on make it clear to ccp that this should not be an expansion in its own right it should be a very very careful iteration of allowing some things to be built in nullsec easily let a few months pass so everyone can get used to new market balance and add a few more repeat
scorched earthlets see what 00 resources are moons asteroids npcs plexesanomolies piall these factors should be able to be affected currently the only way to deny the enemy these resources is to take over the system ie sov warfare or lolafkcloaker in some cases there are no mechanics for smaller properly organised groups to disrupt these or if strong enough to apply any burning of the fields tacticsthere should be ways to use existing skillsshipsmodules to disrupt these or with the use of a new ship it should be balanced enough to give defenders a chance to protect their assets but not require a huge fleet to attack the scorched earth policy should also be available to defenders if they wish to deny attackers any resourcesunrefined examples  irradiating moons so they cannot be mined for xdaysweeksmonths  destroying asteroid belts lowering military index bombarding planets or using dust players to destroy pi facilitiesindependence from jitai think this is a deeper problem more related to economical sense than wanting to be independent to be able to be truly independent from jita you need a ton of organising to be able to have the market diversity that jita offers at the prices jita offers this could only exist in 00 if there was incentive to actually produce items there instead of reselling from jita only a highly organised alliance in which some players have all the bpos and access to all the required resources could really rival jita and then again they have to be able to make a profit the only way i can see this happening is by streamlining the access to resources t2 is the defacto tech level to have in 00 and while minerals are easy to get to build the t1 items getting moon materials is another story alliancescorporations tend to find it easier to sell their resources directly to jita as it is much simplerwhen it comes to making a profit the massmajority of players will always tend to go for the simpler ways to do things will expand on things later
once we can tag an item with who build it add depth simplicity to the 00 areas by making ships made in 00 have to stay in 00 if they go into hisec they get a criminal tag unless you pay concord to register the ship if this is done you can tweak the blueprints for 00 made items to use less ore or purchase whole books of lower level bpc that cannot be used to manufature in hs
scorched earthits easy to make a list of stuff that needs to be breakable to hurt someone one thing i think has been done wrong so far is how this is done structure grind the game mechanical background you have is that you want a balance between making it possible for an attacker to do some bad stuff within a reasonable timeframe but also for the defender to have a chance to set up a defense fleet structure grind tries to establish this reasonable timeframe with a hp count but that does not work as moar dps will just totally wipe it out to make it impossible to just run through with 50 bs and kill everything in 5 minutes the hp count is big enough to tank that but that makes it impossible to do anything bad with 20 hacsdrop hp grind replace it with timers yes im serious you park your fleet next to a target maybe activate a module on it and then you wait 10 20 30 60 minutes whatever is deemed a reasonable timeframe after that time the thing is broken and defenders have to do a similar doohicky to fix it again factional warfare uses this and when you manage to get past all the bugs problems and misfeatures like one frigging tells you when an attack is starting so you cant actually defend the mechanic works really wellso you can move in with a 5ship fleet and disable the pirate magnet at the ihub by sitting next to it for 15 minutes if you get attacked in that time the disruption stops etc if you dont the defenders have to put in some major work to repair it say sit next to it for 30 minutes or somethingmoon miners and other resourcecreating things customs offices could even drop some of their yield to you sit next to moon miner with the moon mining hacking tool and you get some of the moon yield from the silo every 5 minutes until someone stops you for example you get the yield of 1h every 5 minutes so if you can stay for 2h every day you steal their whole moon goo income no need to repair anything even exact numbers need some major thinking through obviouslyindependence from jitathis is difficult because you will have to compete with a much larger market ill say something about this below but as it will include make logistics more difficult ill mention the other stuff first so people who rage at me for that will read the other stuff give the expensive ore in 00 sufficient quantities of lowend minerals so its not sensible to just mine highends and import lowends from jita but to have all the minerals in 00 already when youre done miningthen remove the whole regionspecific stuff if you want stuff to happen in 00 then it must be possible for an alliance to produce most if not all things themselves based on the resources of a region all moon minerals all sorts of ice etc etc need to be available for your alliance in sufficient quantities in the one region you call home while trade is good the second you add trade you make it easier for an alliance to run to jita than to do anything else trade should be an option to avoid local work not a necessitybut in the end im afraid that effort of logistics seems to be the only real factor i can see to balance this out  regardless what else you do you end up with a much smaller group of people competing with a much bigger one which just wont work out even the whole nc is 40k accounts total jita has 140th of that logged into the system at any pointthe problem here is ease of logistics on multiple levels not only the ease of logistics from jita to 00 but also the ease of logistics to jita autopiloting freighters bring goods to jita every day and thats trivial effort to get the results from jita make logistics to jita more difficult and you reduce the competition of any single market spotanything that makes it desirable for players to spread out and not stick in any one system will reduce the competition that 00 has to fight against usagedependent dynamic agent quality dynamic factoryresearch cost and dynamic sales taxes in empire space would all work towards making it easier to compete with jita
now that is an interesting idea to kill jitabalance trade hubs
reduce material reqs of outpost factory upgrades to a more attractive level increase slots available possibly do the same with research slotsfor farms and fields add solar collector small gang targets sovdependent structures which will be the basis for your pos fuel discount also jb fuel use anchored near stars need to be probed down one or two per sov level need max  to reach same fuel discount as currently available have limited shield and armor ehp significant structure hp in a similar way to pos guns  so you can disable them with limited effort or destroy easily with large bs gangcapsmust be repped within 1 12  2 hours or are stuck offline for 20 hours after which they can be repaired at any time obviously while offlinereinforced you lose your discounteither omniresists or racial variations not visible on overview must be probed down cost twice more than a tcu but no bill associated with them
dynamic npc fees for the market and industrial slots would certainly make spreading out more appealing but depending on how strong that factor is it might prove really annoying in the long run not saying it would be bad to try but just reminding everyone the consequences of actively discouraging trade hubs are going to be far reaching and not nesc intended independence there are five problems i know of for 00 industry mineral balance t2 material shortage t3 material shortage industrial index and capacity issues in general there might be more but i am only going to offer comment on things ive dealt with directly and before zastrow freaks again yes ive run a small 00 alliance oversaw noir holding 4 outposts in provi for over 6 months and trying to rebuild the market there and more mineral balance as mentioned above over abundance of high ends and not enough low ends because of natural player tendencies to want to spend time mining the roids with the highest value increase the yield of low end minerals in arkbistetc would be the simplest solution some kind of process where you can turn high ends into low ends would be another the opposite of the alchemy system some nerf to compression will probably be needed to balance this out so the empire markets arnt crashedt2 material shortage regardless if you have enough mineral income to build tons of t1 ships seeding your 00 market with t2 itemsships without importing from empire is edly hard and given that t2 fits if not t2 ships are practically required for robust modern pvp thats a serious problem as a poster above mentioned this is because not only is the t2 production chain complicated but it cant be done from the resources of one region possibly even two regions and certainly not to any degree of scale a way to facilitate the exchange of or straight up acquisition of moon minerals and reactions between 00 regions would be needed a simplification of the production process at least a little would probably helpt3 material shortage wormholes are awesome and t3 are fun to fly unfortunately the wh ihub upgrade is woefully underpowered and even at level 5 the increase in wh frequency is marginal increase the effect of the wh upgrade increase the volume of material that can be acquired and then put to use by alliances which choose to put t3 in their crop rotationindy index its extremely hard to build up and maintain compared to the military one and the level 4 and 5 mining upgrades are not as iskhour good as the level 3 the difficulty level needs to be adjusted and the higher end indy sites could use a lookcapacity once the resource issue is solved 00 will need more slots and tools to handle the production side of this yes you can sorta do it with pos but they are annoying require permissions and are otherwise inefficient pos manufacturing capabilities being made streamlined and perhaps adding more efficient production modules that can only be anchored at a certain sov level similar to csaa would be ways to go another way would be push through the outpost upgrade cost reduction that was supposed to come with dominion and look at tweaking the upgrade trees to allow for more competitive services compared empire
burning all that  i just mentionedsystem scanner functionality not directly related to indy but related to ihub upgrades 30s and 4au range is a pretty swift kick in the pants to roamers and pretty much necessitates a t3 cov ops probes configuration to have a remotely competitive chance to land on someone before they dockpos requiring a 500mil isk ship just to level the playing field is a pretty high barrier of entry shortening the timer and possibly increasing the range would increase the chances for success while still affording more protection for the npcer than belt ratting and would be more convenient for carebears as well since they need to scan for anomalies tooincapacitate pos industry mods moving mods outside of the pos shield is an old idea but not a bad one ihubs i am actually against allowing roaming gangs to disable parts of the ihub ive gone back and forth on this but degrading the index i feel should be the way to reduce the advantages from the upgrades perhaps a look at the rate of degradation on the military index and a way to lower the strategic index instead timer mechanic would work here wormholes buffing the wh ihub upgrade will not only increase t3 material availability but for those alliances that choose to install it they will be opening up more ways for small groups of harassers to gain access to their space potentially with little to no warning riskreward at its finest outpost services till we get wreckable outposts please seleene were going to have to deal with the proliforation of things that allow you to be perfectly safe inside them and offer a wide range of convenient services which will hopefully be easily upgradable to well past empire utility people can attack them but would need a pos takedown fleet to do it in a reasonable amount of time pos takedown fleets dont really lend themselves to riding around the country side setting fire to crops what we have now is something that takes forever to incapacitate and forever to repair what we should have are services that are very low hp so they can be incapd and repaired in one playing session by a small group of players this will drive conflict since downed services are inconvenient but attacking them is not while not griefing defenders too badly since they can easily repair damaged services once attackers are driven awayleave

putting on my indy hat from 00 echoing the earlier comment there are simply not enough low end roids in 00 to make a dent into the amount of trit  pyer  mex necessary for production whoo 100k veldspar roids in the grav spawns yeah for instance change the supermassive spodumain spawn in level 1 grav sites over to massive veldspar scordite and pyrox spawns while it would be good to put those lowend roids in the normal belts it prevents the ability to respawn which could be problematic i would even go so far as to suggest making level 1 wholesale full of low ends the bummer is that players are largely protected in the grav sites but the respawn mechanic is probably necessary unless the fields spawn amazing wtf numbers on the roids each night  alternatively tweak the high end mineral chart you get a pittance of of low ends from the high end ore perhaps even add in new ore to further tweak the system take say the info from cerlestesarkonor yields 009 of trit versus veldspar which yields 30 tweak say your midhigh tier versions gneiss spod to yield on par with scord or veld in terms of trit pyer or mex per 1 m3 or upgrade ark bist and crok to anywhere from 14 trit pyer or mex per m3 rather than the puny amounts they yield now low trit  pyer  mex yields means import from jita plain and simple  way way way more manufacturing slots at stations stations slots are ideal in that they do not require working through the god awful pos role management pos role management is probably too much to ask for slots on the order of 30 50 or 100 would be a good start the station becomes the default access for low tier industrialists and the hard core can use the pos which has the benefit of a time bonus  big thumbs up to the notion of timebased disruptions rather than hp grinds the fellow from agony unleashed had a good concept with the notion of a playercreated incursion toss that in with a dose of being able to steal moon goo  pi loot from the system and that becomes full of awesome
i think there should be more hauler spawn income and less bounty income these anoms should include a few hauler spawn sites less isk sinks easier production in null sec
fwiw i am a smalltime small ship manufacturer located in 00 most of the minerals i get are imported from highsec as are much manufacturers simply because it is wiser for a miner to operate in highsec risk free than it is to gain very little more in null for a much higher risk players will follow the easiest money if it is more profitable to mine lowertier asteroids than highertier asteroids they will go for the lowertiermy simple suggestion would be to make roids have much more or less minerals in them based on sec status and to drastically increase the amount of minerals that can be mined every cycle the supply problem is a large issue because its expensive to import minerals and as said by a previous poster why bother importing minerals and creating things for a sliver of profit when you can just import the actual item miners will always provide a farms and field mechanic they are nice juicy targets for any roaming gang in lowsec or 00 if you wish for the manufacturing and mining community to be decentralized rather than highsec as it is currently the riskreward factor of nullseclowsec mining should be relooked  station slots should be increased caldari and unupgraded amarr outposts have a pitiful amount of researchbuild slots compared to what a medium to large sized alliance full of highskilled manufacturers can use to add an amount of risk to relatively secure stations station service hp can be reduced to a level where it may only take a medium to large sized gang only 510 minutes to put down pos researchbuilding is fine but some more incentives should be offered to augment the risk of losing everything increasing the amount of station slots also increases the amount of isk that can be trapped in stations taken by enemies in a war this can introduce a supply line mechanic as capturing an alliances production hub can cripple their ability to fight long bloody wars as well as remove a very important income source a way to destroy or disable ratting complex and mining upgrades on the ihub much like station services should be implemented if the farmers leave their fields undefended the raiders should be able to disable or destroy their income source rattersminers should be punished for posing up running away and providing no resistance whatsoever i dont have much experience with t2t3 stuff but the current pos mechanics for moon goo and supercap production seem to provide a lot of risk losing your entire haul if you dont time your pos correctlydont show up to defend it for a lot of reward billions upon billions of isk making them fair and balanced  the plain and simple reason why jitahighsec is the base for all industrialization activity is because it is more profitable to build in a centralized place in a safe area rather than in decentralized areas around the universe nerfing jump freighters and jump bridges is just attacking a symptom of the problem rather than attacking the actual problems
make ore in null sec yield double the minerals that of empire variations and low sec 50 more as it stands the bottle neck for production in null sec is often trit and pyrite miners have no reason to mine trit in lower sec if it is the same profit as empire where they can do afk much safer got to have some kind of worthwhile crop outside of death stat moon poss in order to worry about how to attack themideas for stations as well a basic station should have close to the same slots and abilitys as those of npcs a upgraded one should have increasing number of slots that and ability to set up more stations in a system
 change mineral volumes so that trit is 11000000 m3 or soand scale it up accordingly so that the highends are fairly bulky still this eliminates mineral compression and makes actual ingots of minerals the most efficient way to move minerals arou
the problem with commerce in nullsec is a matter of access you cant dock without standings and you cant travel through with the kinds of ships that make it worth the effort freighters without a massive fleet in support therefore alliances tend to focus on being selfsufficient and seeding their own markets prices for things are often way out of hand because of the highdemandlowsupply situation administratively most alliances manage this by adopting jitaprice standards and punishing members who gouge a possible solution add a few contiguous highsecurity systems into each of the regions that adjoin empire space go even further and establish npccontrolled cynogenerators in those hubs that only jump freighters can use commerce should be reasonably open to all
is the possibility of nerfing the  out of highsec industry at the same time as buffing nullsec industry likely to be on the table here
hmm is this one of those stupid assembly hall threads you were talking about
in my experience t1 production can be reasonably done in nullsec however outside of a select bcbs hulls and a very limited number of mods most t1 items just arent used additionally the limit of lowend minerals makes mining for bs manufacturing extremely hard t2 production in null sec just doesnt happen much bringing t2 bpos into nullsec is typically not worth the risk and invention requires a significant influx of other materials that you typically cant get locally decryptors  datacores when competing with hisec services nullsec is at a disadvantage this is reversed from what it aught to be if the resources for complete t2 production where available locally then maybe nullsec industry would have a better chance potential ideas for fixing this 1 make more low end minerals available locally 2 make more invention materials available locally 3 allow nullsec station services to be upgradeable to hisec quality or better 4 make hisecnullsec travel more risky ie move the jb system to the ihub ie at a planet away from pos protection 5 make industry upgrades more effectiveprofitable 6 this is way out there tariffs empire fee for moving modules between empire regions with a tariff free nullsec i doubt this can be simply implemented and is more trouble than its worth im sure there are much better ideas on how to improve nullsec industry
im not at all an industrialist so this may be a completely ed observation but i havent seen anyone else mention it from what i understand t2 production requires datacores these datacores are only available from research agents in empire is that not a fairly significant hurdle to establishing an industrially independent nullsec
i have a whole giant proposal on nullsec reform over at fi on this topic industrialization small gangs everything else wheres my xprize from ccp
i dont think these suggestions create the smallgang targets nullsec needs the truth is most pve stops the moment a gang enters system and rightfully so as most pve ships just arent capable of fighting a small pvp gang besides most gangs want fights not ganks so the real question is how do you motivate the pve members of nullsec to form up and fight the incoming gang atm there is little motivation for the pveers not to safe up and make some tea the dilemma of space farmsstructures small gangs dont like shooting structures what do they get for it if the structures are too destructible pveers wont use them if they have too many hitpoints or are too defended pvpers wont shoot them if they are too easily repaired pveers wont defend them this is where my corp mate suggested an interesting new idea that builds on incursion mechanics player created incursions  basic gist a deployable device that will create incursion effects in a system unless the defenders prevent it from onlining ratters either defend their space or deal with decreased bounties resists dps for the next day or so link on agony websitefeatures  ideas link
im not a resident of nullsec but heres my two cents i dont make raids into nullsec for the simple fact it isnt profitable unless you can catch a few loners off guard nullsec mechanics are such that it isnt worth the time or money usuallyfarms and fields are all good i could care less if nullsec is selfsufficient youd think it would be but nobody is going to bother attacking such resources except competing sov corps if you want outsiders to try and cause havoc small gang pvp pirates etc there needs to be some form of incomeinterruption of ihubsgood idea for strategy but again only sovs will engage in this i like it but why not make the upgrades targetable and destructible  which allows them to be looted or salvaged in some way scenario gang from lowsec or even highsec decides to make a raid into nullsec on an ihub they think is vulnerable for the purposes of some big money but with big risk the upgrades should only require a small gang 5 pilots about to destroy but should have a safety feature such as warning the owner corp or having a failsafe shield that gives defenders potentially enough time to drive them off lazy corps will lose modules on their toes corps will save themideas like this will encourage the use of cov ops ships oh no the black ops might have a use again if balanced and add an additional element of riskreward in nullsec that all players large corp or not can enjoy farms ought to be relatively easy to maintain provided they are protected this is the distant future but apply basic warfare ideology only critical structures were ever inside walls pos such as food storage armory and maybe a smithy to repair broken arms production itself was outside the walls usually as well as nonimportant storage they were vulnerable true but trying to build a wall large enough to encompass them was too expensive and left the wall underpowered use this ideology on pos and nullsec in general and youll see a lot more activity from nonnullsec residents
perhaps make deployable miners that players need to defend from other players and rats too i guessgives the defenders something to do gives the attackers something to shoot down and at the same time players to kill and also provides a localised source of minerals for manufacturers that doesnt require players to mindlessly mine  all daygive it a reasonable amount of hp so it cant be alphaed but not enough that the defenders dont need remote rep support to keep it alive for the duration of the engagement the rest can be worked out by game designers i guess
ccp zinfandel will be talking to the csm for an hour about ccps marketing efforts related to eve what advice would you want us to give him about seducing unsuspecting gamers into paying for the privilege of being podded and what honey could he set out to lure back the elusive bittervet
eve evolves other gameworlds are staticeve player base is 80 mature with majority of the player base possessing college education and above a lot of students play eve in their spare time a lot of adult males enjoy eve after work this means that mental capacities of the players are above average enemies are more intelligent and game is more challengingit means that eve community is unique intelligent friendly sarcastic vicious savage but not dull reserved grinding lonefinally there is no end game over 5 years time you become more valuable and not loose purpose over that time the challenge remains in the game since regardless of skill points and equipment the maximum multiplier is never above 400 and the most exquisite setups are easy to counter eve is a game of cooperation not skill and item grinding
if you are good enough you dont have to pay irl
edit multiple posting as it told me i was going too fast 
edit as above the proper post is below this one
thisextending galnet into the real world internet as was done with the now disappeared duvolle labs website getaclonecom would not only make the depth and flavour of eves lore more accessible to players it would also open the world to those who may not otherwise encounter it
hire a studio to do a serious of five minute episodes on cartoon network andor scifi channel like clone wars
made ingame
eve will market better if braonly can be reintroduced only in a limited fashiongo go bars will attract a lot of people in incarna naked bodies pay to see
i really dont want to sound bitter but a good start would be to have functioning content and proper dev cycles at older content this way you can get players commenting on the game in a positive manner rather then moaning cous half of the released content is broker or unfinishedfor me i feel ashamed to spend timemoney on this game in its current state thats hardly good advertising if someone asks me how eve is ill tell them the truth and 910 times they wont even want to try so yeah good marketing can only come when the management takes off in a good direction for a change suckering in people with empty promises and lying about working game content isnt the smartest thing to do
ccp needs to revise its seo and web marketing approach i get try eve ads on all sorts of web sites obviously picking me up as a visitor to this site etc preaching to the choir is less than ideal as a marketing strategy
full 20 minute eps using carbon based char rendering like we saw so much of at fan fest in game rendering of space battles but the key is this base the stories off eves history not the in game fluff i mean the main selling point of the game player generated drama in 00you have like 7 years worth of material to draw from animate the great northern war i keep hearing about that spawned bobthe nc bring to life the contrast of bob and ascn and the epic conflict that saw the first titans created and destroyed tell the world of how mercenary coalition brought the dagger right to the neck of the nc draw viewers in to the circumstances around the betrayal and disbanding of bob and the rise of goonswarm youd have to adapt some things to bring everything into the world of eve but the characters and the stories are right there and more material is being created every daymost of the players involved at the big scale are still around or at least alive i have no doubt theyd be willing to sit down to interviews or otherwise help fill in the gaps for the writers to help promote the game and their own legend you might get the occasional objection of people not liking how theyre portrayed but i suspect anything more serious than whining would be infrequent if not singular heros villains who cares were on tv plus eve lends itself to the kind of writing and character development where the distinction of good guys vs bad guys isnt always so cleardont even worry about putting it on actual tv yet distribute online via a site andor youtube the existing eve community will be all over each new episode like a fat girl on cake allowing you to show an existing audience which will help get the show on other platformsyou want to talk competitive advantage no other mmo is doing this no other mmo really could do this in a meaningful way because they dont have the single shard mature universe ccp has developed put the effort into making it look as good as clear skies if not better using the engine youre using for incarna and we will soon stop measuring your customer base in hundreds of thousands well start talking millions
when i suggest eve to friends i often get the ive heard insert threadnought topic about eve why would i pay for that it would be nice to say they fixed that more often when replying to the bad press eve has hadto be clear eve has some trouble with word of mouth other marketing is kinda silly until ccp does something to fix its image in the gaming communityways to do this1 ingame videos that include elements of the game that people have complained about and ccp has fixed2 ingame videos of fleet fights running without lag handling 800 combatants that visual with a in game footage should carry a lot of weight it was what drew me back to the game after its rocky startreally a lot of bitter old vets get focused on the but i want to be able to have 2000 involved in a fight and forget that new players will likely not be involved in this before they are hooked by the amazing stuff earlier on basically eve needs to showcase how well it does work and put that in front of people who were turned off from the game by something they heard years agofor all the bitter old vet talk they are hooked and obviously expect things to get better or they wouldnt still be playing the wonders that have all of us hooked need to be broadcast to potential new players to counter complaints about the extreme cases that are experienced later in the game
the best comment ive heard on eve lately is that its a bad game that the players make good nobody is going to write odes to the mission system and even the bots get bored mining but the rise and fall of empires is inherently compelling as is a great scam or a wellrun tourney play that up theres a reason why the butterfly effect video was one of our favourites stuff like that is just about the only sensible reason to actually play this game also eve is an eight year old game with the polish of a beta if you change that fact word of mouth will be your friend
tell him and ccp to read eve game mails
this i get paranoid when eve ads follow me across the internet its pretty damn ridiculous too since i already playbut most importantly ccps marketing needs to realise that game marketing is mostly done by word of mouth ccp being more attentive to details in releases ie less bugs iterating on old ignored features and engaging more with the player base here on eveo would be a great place to startfinally as someone above said small internet videos of ingame combat from players would be a greatway to attract players mining less so and never ever mention pi or else ccpll never get another customer
craptastic ui annoying anchoring timers more specific roles for security permit cans in the arrays and let us remotely check if ammo is loaded in the guns
ability to sort pos processes ability to queue anchoroffonline commands
flogging of the dead horse thread found here also a new pos gui alert management overall new features to the pos interface
poses need to be more like small modular stations and less like campsites that cost fuel
would be nice to be able to make a queue for anchoring and onlining structures same with offlining and unanchoring honestly having to spend hours checking every 15 minutes to start the next operation is just maddeningand along with fixing the pos ui can you please get them to fix the corp ui its so damn bad its just
is it just me that i find it ridiculous a small anchorable audit logged secure cargo container can have an access log of all the changes made to it in something weighing 10 tonnes yet a full large pos weighing in at 1000 tonnes cant even manage to log changes to important security aspects of a poss operation by who and wheni find that absolutely absurd and it needs to change
fix securityallow granular control over who can access what object and which tab in that objectintroduce the tab structure in ship maintenance arrays too people can jettisonsteal each others t3 ships that is just stupidauto hide everything tabs a pilot has no access tomore tabs per object 
drop anchoring time plsi would not mind the anchor time if it was actually doing something like some sort of transformers robot unfolding into awesomeness in front of my eyes but its does fa except show a ty timer for what so it can be destroyed before it gets anchored lame
it might be a much shorter list if we were to sound off on what we do like about poss dont you think lol
this ressurrect the dead horse
one thing i would love to see is bigger fuel bays not for stront ofc or a new module that connects to the pos fuel bay that has a bigger bay 20days worth of fuel in a large pos is very annoying and is just a weird artificial limitationthat said the reduction in anchoring timers would be nice not sure about online that would probably screw with active sieges if they can come online faster then you can kill them anchoring queue would be awesome toolets not talk about the ui the flogging the dead horse thread is pretty good
oh for the love of god please let us queue anchoringonlining of modules content taking care of poss shouldnt become a second job what i hate the most about pos is setting them up and taking them down pos artists have my utmost respect the security ui is lacking in intuitiveness esp for new pos owners clarity and granularity as you mentioned the green box of hate needs to be changed and fuel pellets would help immensely  weapon platforms should be balanced in their own racial regard
just for reference here is the crowdsourced possible practical pos performance proposal from csm5
i am glad i am a simple grunt and do not have to deal with pos again the problems i see with pos is the same things mentioned above the que idea to onlineofflineunanchor would make things much better as i could i dont know maybe play the game instead of being stuck in a stupid tower also is there anyway that the process of linking stuff could be made so much simpler the current way it is makes me want to get a root canal i have to have them all off line nothing onlining or offlineing then open drop menu 1 drag and drop then submit hope it takes it and start on the next step and so on and so on and so on depending on how complex an item i am making it really puts people off of staying in the pos game after they get out of the job for 5 minspb
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesnot looking like this is also a major issue
all of this all of it a thousand timesthe entire pos interface needs to be reworked and for the love of all thats holy give us the ability to name all the pos structures
i think the single worst thing about them is forcefield accessthe whole concept of typing in a pw to your ship is ed there should be granular standingsbased controlsi should also be able to allow roles by standings particularly gunner role ridiculous that gunners must be in corp and given specific role
make it alot easier to lock targets when manning the pos guns the current system sucks big time make it so when you reset password it does not bounce any friendlies out of the forcefield but kicking hostiles out
couple of things from both empire and nullsec experiences with pos setup  tear down role management for pos is terrible and offers far too coarse of roles jobs should be able to be queued by the individual not just by the corp  standingsbased pos access rather than passwordbased pos access password is really only good for supercap handovers public labs would be awesome  queues for pos modules queues for pos modules please please please  easier  more intuitive loading of weapons for pos weapons better explanation of what the pos settings aggression  etc mean in the game bigger bays for refining and  or better yields on pos refineries ability to process one item type at a time for nonore items or a new item reprocessing module email or other information mechanism for out of game comms pos under attack pos low on fuel etc rather than external tools
i likei also would like to be able for pos managers to assign specific tabs of a module to specific members such as having 2 corp hangar arrays you can assign a tabor even make up your own tab to a particular member without giving them rights to that tab at all poses
thisand thisalso i could understand the need for slowing down onlining a pos back when they were used to establish sov however they arent anymore so why do we still have all this lengthy timers
nerf teh jump bridge pos module imo
i want to preplan my pos layout from my corp office in a station and then manufacture an android that will construct my layoutdesign in space so i dont have to sit there and anchor junk deploy it in one package or maybe several that voltron into one pos
i want to be able to hack an offline pos to unanchor it if you cant be bothered to fuel it its mine now
1 also pos fuel pelletsliang
i personally would like to see standings based access to fitting services and arrays set it up something like fleet where its corpalliance only and then based on standingsmaybe also set up a reaction for pos fuel that allows pellets that are 2550 smaller for the same burn time but the reactions to make them from pi materials also requires moon minerals in the r816 range i dont know it the prices have adjusted yet but after pi was introduced some of the moons became immediately unprofitable on a small scale at least
my corporation should not automatically own any pos i purchase and bring online i should not have to have starbase config roles in order to online a pos in npccontrolled systems if i want to set up a research station for myself in highsec lowsec or npc nullsec i should be able to do so as an individual i understand the need for allowing a corporation or alliance control what is deployed in their sovreign space i dont want to change that
while this may sound dumb to some people but id like to see a larger variety of poses available rather than just large medium small but more specialized ones research moon mining asteroid belt support probably not hostile deployment allowing some to be anchored anywhere in system including safespots would be cool too it would be nice for the average player to be able to set up and manage a small pos for themselves say in a nonstation system without the need for too much logistical strainedit this could also add in to the farms and fields thingo having smaller poses that can be destroyed relatively easy but then theres the whole issue of not being able to defend them if you arent awake reinforcement blah blah blah could maybe work something out
new better looking noob ships please appearances are like 8639first
it would be nice if tools like evemon and eft was available within the game itself at the moment any skill planning longer than 24h has to be done out of game you cant fit up a ship and get a list of what skills you need to be able to undock itthe certificates is a step in the right direction but it would be even better if you could click on a certificate and have all the relevant skills added to the list just like evemonmake aura like the old holographic quafe girl maybe swap the shuttle and noobship models around imagine starting this game in a minmatar shuttle with turrets
no matter what the npe ends up being it must represent eves longterm playability which unfortunately also means any npe is going to suck and be rather disassociative to most playershowever a complete ui overhaul with an emphasis on dumping the current window based system would go a long way to helping new and old players keep logging in adjustable and customizable is great but the default ui could still suck a lot lessthe other thing is the newbie ships they dont need to be great ships related to the rest of eves ships but they dont have to be shuttles with guns either gives them more slots and a second bonus even if it isnt a combat bonusdefund obamacareer wrong forummake the tutorial less about reading or listening to a bored woman reading and more about actually doing stuff information is great but cramming it into a single tutorial will turn off most players let the students chose which courses they study at the time they want to do it
i really would not want simulators or anything but what about missions where they had a decent set of skills and the associated ship to do some missions with so they get an idea of things to come a few missions with a frigate then some with a cruiser then battle cruiser battleship and dare i say maybe a capital at the endget them excited about what else is in the game besides noob ship crap also dont forget about some missions that has the industrial stuff in it the missions should gear them to full fill the role the ship should play not some go here and blow these s out of the water all the time it should be more like go here with this arazu and tackle these guys why our megathrons get on them to destroy their face
yes this would be excellent these tools are indispensable and they should be emulated and put in the client itself
new players are treated in a bad way with uber noob term large corporations do not want to recruit noobs as they lack competence and these corps lack time to train them another stigma associated with new account is the spy suspicion new players have bad experience when they feel not wanted or not able to play with real guysin my opinion new players tutorial missions can be totally surpassed by recruit academy a player npc run organization a training centre and a task force with an aim to provide daily combat experience to the pilots in these corporation combat is a standard and courage is the real value npc give out real mission briefings while community fcs can lead up to 30 men groups through low sec wh reconnaissance 00 sec border attacksthe difference from faction warfare that recruit academy focuses on tactical training of direct beginners people who are in noob corp and have less than 3 month play time the corporation has ship fittings sets ship stocks that satisfy the recruit combat programme needs also recruits get their isk payout for accomplishments in their missions funded by megacorporations as anti sansha anti jove multi empire initiative academy training is focused around tech 1 frigate and cruiser combat wing coordination and facing opposing forcenpc ruleset missions training plans player cadets community volunteer fleet commanders and opposing force where opposing force may be seasoned players in larger ships engaging in staged environments and micro tournaments
new players in my experience leave the game largely due to wardecs new player hears about game from say ebaumsworld which is where autistics sharks is from they are out in 00 then new person joins the game and they are in say jita they then undock to go out to the closest highsec system they die and they quit happens over and over and overadd in the fact that the wardec system is awful
noob ships  theyre supposed to be rubbish but i think they coud get some tweaks1 the ibis is a caldari ship  give is a missile hardpoint or two it can still keep railgun bonuses as a caldari noob i started with guns and trained all the way into a rokh before i realliy realised that caldari missile boats were more appropriate2 the impairor cap bonus is completely useless since it doesnt have enough power grid to fit lasers that would make it cap unstable give it a laser damage bonusthe noob missions are great but there are rough edges that might confuse playersone mission has you salvaging a civilian datacore which ends up doing nothing there are a whole bunch of useless trinkets awarded through the noob mission systemin one of the minmatar training systems theres an anomaly that spawns a demonstration this is related to the minmatar level 4 epic arc any noob warping into this will probably die quickly perhaps the spawning of this anomaly could be fixed so that noobs arent going to accidently stumble into it when theyre running the exploration training missionsi think there needs to be a special mission in the combat training arc which covers the effects of different ammo  drone types show them how to switch ammo to get different ranges and damage types i understand this is a bit more complicated but youd be amazed how many pilots have no clue about the different ammo typesbookmarks should appear on the overview in particular mission bookmarks all that right clicking through multiple menus to get somewhere is very frustating for new pilots
one of the big problems with the npe is the vast gulf between new players and pvp vets with 50 million sp there is currently no way a new player can realistically either ship wise or financially engage in pvp i am busy planning a trial account tournament for sometime in june to provide a level playing field at least on the isk and sp levels eve needs something like arenas or battlegrounds that are limited to players in the trial account period where pvp can be carried out relatively risk free
agreed or perhaps an academy or even virtual reality simulator instantly fit instantly in action may place bets or watch fights in station
new players who wish to mission are not adequately guided to resources to enable them to find missions ccp should either buy or just ask chribba for permission to link eveagentscom ingame or something like italso the tutorial missions are boring as helledit to add reasons new players leaveits boringthey dont know what to do new tutorials address this a bit but only go halfway better documentation in game or links to out of game documentation such as evewiki eveagents and dotlan are neededmysterious and unexplained game mechanics leading to them being greifed or just not being able to figure out why their tutorial mission wont complete so on the one hand better documentation available to new players is needed they shouldnt have to find eveagents dotlan iskguide etc on their own either make the existing playercreated documentation available or put that documentation ingame and accessible on the other hand make being a new player less of a grind so much of a terrible grind and largely asocial too its just awful
ive thought about it 100 times but never said it thats probably why they implemented a ingame browser to access important information that you cant find or wont find easily inside the game with the captains quarter that would be the time to implement a eve dotlan or eveagents inside the game also once you do a mission you could unlock more info on the mission and that becomes a sort of evesurvivalorg
epic arcsnote pluralitymany new players need direction early on once they grasp the sandbox nature they are good to go i propose you create careerlike epic arcs while this sounds a bit silly particularly for something as simple as mining remember that mining is actually categorized in industryindustry mining production researchcombat pvepvp  fw specialty combattrade hauling and station tradeexploration sites whs salvaging archaeology codebreaking each of these should have a lvl 1 or 2 or maybe both epic arcs of a shorter scope than soe to guide new players along in their chosen career should they change their mind as we all know you can simply start training something else and leave it at that these arcs could provide skill books though i wouldnt recommend it but more than likely some better than meta1 equipment the arc missions would have a clear goal but not a clear way of accomplishing itex industry mission agent needs 20 of item b story for whyno blue print provided the agent would inform the player how to find bps on the market maybe even inform them the difference between originals and copies but it is up to the player to buy the needed materials or mine them and create the item while simple in structure the player gains valuable skills and understanding of the careera sixth jack of all trades career could be introduced in which a single arc has missions that cover the basics of all careers think of them as a final exam in which a player will complete missions mine in a basic mining frigate produce goods sell them for isk buy other goods and get a general understanding of all careers currently this already exists but as separated careers keeps those in place and have this sixth available since players no longer freak on what to use my bonus sp on the need to focus in one area a certain way is also gone win win for ccp  new players get to see more of the game and have a higher chance of getting hooked on a career they like ccp gets more player time when they spread their sp around on careers they wont be pursuing
ahhhh totally support this d
planetary ui in the new cq build need to not open a window eve has so many windows how awesome would it be if there was 0 immersion broken when you set up your planets from inside your cq you just get to see the pi ui right on the 3d ui screen and you can spin the planet and you can zoom in of course you would get a more detailed full screen view as an optionbut this would be the start of something really important to me real in game 3d ui for walking in stationsas far as in space ui i would like my targeting reticule to change color with transversal velocity compared to my ships highest tracking speedwhile i myself understand radianssec and how to read my guns and stuff there is a forgotten feature in eve the tactical overlay if a ship is moving too fast to hit it should be in a read targeting icon when the ship is within your tracking speed it should be green then on the tactical overlay you can see if the target is within your optimal rangethis would increase combat awareness for new players that might not really understand whats going on

neo neocomit got pulled with only a 3page thread with most people wanting it to go vertical i want to be able to remove things from my neo com i loved how they could make custom plug in to show skill training and dev hinted at drone combat app for the neo com also the tabs docked with the neo com it was kinda awesome it wasnt prefect but it was a huge step forward there has been no real clear answer but a 7 page thread is around now with the majority of post is support of what was pulled if thats not a sign of badly it was needed i dont know what is it feels like feature abandonment please get on them about it even just a clear answer would be nice and not just oh players didnt like it a 3 page thread is not the same as a 30 page thread like what happen with moon changes and they ignored those 30 pages so why did they pull something that at the very least they could of released as optional testing on tq where most players could try it out also in game polls maybe to get a better idea what the player base thinks that never visit the forums
semi ui relatedto mother ing hell with shooting a ship and not being able to decide where on the ship i want the pain to be delivered right now it is just shoot the ship specifically does not matter and watch the grey bars go red boringit should matter what on it im shooting excel is not immersive in a spaceship game interface should be organic and dynamic the ui should be customizable changing as i see fit to suit the situation at the moment i know we have are so rooted in the rightclickdropdown boxes but that has got to go big time
ill quote one of my old proposal but dont expect me to recreate it on photoshop  ill let the ccp people do the workbuying stuff in big quantities in the lp store is grueling you click accept the window refresh and you lose focus on the item you want to buy again with the filter they implemented you can manage to display only the item you want to buy so you dont have to scroll each time anymore thats the only thing that this overcomplicated filter achieves getting rid of the scrolling the dumb thing about it is that you still have to click 50 times on accept if you want 50 batch of ammo why the hell cant you make the lp store like a real store  you add a quantities column you add 2 more columns lp total and isk total for each row big total at the bottom and checkout button 1 simple click to buy everything you need  numbers display as red if you cant proceed displays as green if everything is fine you need only 2 simple filters affordable only and show all you dont need more filters because we will scroll down the list only 1 time to add quantitiesi want a lp store that works like a real simple ui store
the one and big issue i have with the ui is its windownyness for lack of a better madeup word there are just simply too many windows in fleet battles i zoom out all the way to improve performance orbit anchor and focus on the windows that cover 75 of my screen where are the glorious battles where is the majesty of space where is the epicness of ships firing lasers projectiles and missiles at each other i know where they are they are behind all these ing windowsin essence that is the major problem with the ui for me during pvp we need to have a lot of information to perform our best yet all that information is spread out in tons of different windows the overview for example takes up 25 of my 1900x1200 screen on the right just to see the information distance ship type ship speed pilot name pilot alliance tranversal etc if i reduce my resolution it takes 40 of screen space that is simply to get the information of whowhat is around me and what are they doingthe second type of window that takes up another 25 of my space are chat windows i want to know what is going on in local so local window is open i have to have fleet window visible to talk to the rest of the fleet in order to keep coms clear sometimes we also need to convey messages to alliance or corp chat or other chat window whether its for intell or general chatter it becomes a messi then have to keep the fleet window open to see broadcasts esp when playing as a logi because the overview lags too much to effectively update broadcasts this takes up another 5finally there is the ship hud target list and drone list those also take up quite some spacetldr there needs to be a way to be able to get all that information without cluttering the spaceship game that is behind these windows my honest opinion is that ccp work from scratch on a new ui using a different philosophy when creating the new one if they keep on working on the same flawed base itll just end up being the same thing looking differently it is impossible to shove rocks under a house build on sand i dont care if it takes a whole year or two for a team to do it sure people have gotten used to the current ui just like some get used to driving crappy rusted cars and living in dumps
if you compare internet explorer to mac safari browser you will see how similar things can be differentin ie a lot of space is wasted commands are hard to access window positioning and resizing becomes are real painin apple browser a lot less space is wasted giving clear view of the page the page can be scaled the command menu can be access much faster bookmarks history tabs and favorites are accessed much faster and easierin windows explorer a lot of space is eaten by thick borders headers status bar tool bar it can range from 15 to 70 of visible space depending on your screen sizeefficient interface results in more productive work and absence of stress cluttered windows are number one source of frustration and time wastenumber one boost of interface introduce scalable fonts menus context boxes market assets info boxes have far too small letters your eyes start hurting on 1900 and above resolution on hd resolutions and above they become unreadablethere should be 3 types of interfaces changeble on demand  combat interface  minimum data only combat feeds clear view and command and status updatesmanagement interface which is similar to what we have now should be more structured you manage trade windows fittings station commands with less back ground interference less bright stars nebulae dimmed etc which improve the visual perception of dataand minimal interface when you can just do repetitive activities like star traveling mining and simple object management example surveying and salvaging
less space excel more sf cartoonstyle tactical uihow simply adding a vector that depicts the speed of each ship on the tactical overview which would become a lot more tacticala more complete proposal that takes in account several things such as lag and overview clutter is here tactical overview option for solosmall gangs ship velocity vectors
one small annoyance the session change timer for those of us on large resolutions 2560x1600 is incredibly tiny it would be nice for a larger option available
a complete ui api to allow players to build their own with whatever modifications or plugins they see fit a major effort certainly but the potential benefit is limitlessalso selfupdating market orders nothing insanely fast  maybe just 1 tick every 510 minutes would be ok trading should revolve around attrition of wallets not playing time
less windows in space and more streamlining
or an actual timer as opposed to a little spinning circle would be nice also visible aggression timers would be cool as thats you know kind of important in some situations
this i love it though dont get me wrong i dont want to login to tron spaceships but i love the market i love the windows setup etc so something along that nature would be great i also think some of the ui stuff they had in recent eve trailers would be really nice looking as for specific uis i think it would be nice to better customize chat windows so you dont get them clumped up and not a spam of blocks i also think there should be different options to customize how your moduleshp and such look and positioned i also think stuff should have the option to have stuff appear at the target such as targets isnt in one static line spot such as have a little icon choose specific stuff like show transverse velocity ew being done etc being shown from the targeted shippretty sure they had something similar to this in an eve trailer that way we dont have to stare at the overview and actually look at the screen to play and get rid of the clutter on overview i think the overview config also needs to be redone and have grouped options like show allhide all ores or do not show friendliesthat way you dont have to spend hours configuring ui to still show low sec status players and filter out friendlies theres been times i seen local was all blue and had my mission overview tab though i could never figure out how to have low sec status players still appear blue if they are blue to me so when seeing a blue with low sec status i would typically be in a hauler and have a heart attack lol
ability to assign hotkeys to drone groups eg launch group 1 2 3 recover attack abandon drones too much clicking menus takes time away from piloting perhaps also the ability to select lock and broadcast a target just by looking atnear it and hitting a hotkeylock last broadcast key would be invaluable for fleet usage allow filters for targets vs assistance requests to avoid logistics locking enemies and friendlies locking friendlies
i am not a ui wizard nor an art guy so i cant really comment on what should be the new ui but i can tell you that ccps annoying habit of using a greenred interface for everything is really ing me offand yeah im colorblind and i miss wide screen mode even though it was terrible because it let me see heat on modulesi would ask that the csm read this article colorblind gamers common developer awareness minimal because it does a far more eloquent job of explaining how the world looks to those of us who are colorblind than i could ever hope to dothis is a huge concern for me as ccp continues to pay lip service to the wanting to improve things for those of us that are colorblind but they just released autopilot changes that add a bunch of boxes that are various shades of red which since i am colorblind does me  all goodim not threatening to quit eve or anything but i would strongly prefer it if ccp would stop color coding their user interfaces
this is my ideal but if we cant have that my primary concern with a ui upgrade is space efficiency eve is a game with a massive massive ui massive to the point where i barely care about actually seeing my ship because if i try to care i cant play the game i personally keep a minimum of 14 chat channels open at a time often as many as 17 or 18 i have four separate stacks of windows in order to make it all fit sensibly and it takes up over a third of my screen on top of that i need target locks the f1f8 buttons and caphp readout overview selected items window system info ap route and often watchlist its damned cluttered now its cluttered by choice and frankly no matter what you do itll probably stay cluttered i want as much information at my fingertips as i can get and im going to keep pushing it until i run out of screen space but while you cant make my screen less cluttered you can make it so that i can fit more onto that screen to pick an obvious example let me remove portraits from local so i can see 3x as many blue pluses and red minuses at a time i can keep it as is get more info or get more space according to my preferences and remember for a game with as many disparate play styles as eve choice is kingwhich is why a moddable api is so clearly the correct approach similarly give me more choices with things like chat windows  for example if i could make the tab bar at the top doublehigh and pin one window to the front as default instead of the ui having a mind of its own i could easily cut down on my chats ui footprint significantly also whatever changes you make make sure they work if my pinned windows move every time i log in youre doing it wrong
thanks for the topic mittens please kill the 100 km look at limit already the selected item menu needs to have a user configurable list of orbit keep at and warp to distances in dropdown menus the overview is an abomination it is complicated to set up and tends to break is buggy as hell simplify the overview setup box the spacing of items in the ui needs to be improved as well as it is currently extremely cluttered consider putting everything that goes in the right click menu in a popup menu which can be moved around the game window the amount of rightclicking is terrible where oh where is the new game font that ccp took 40 years to make with broken pencils and torn paper a spaceship vector arrow would be far more useful than the myriads of columns in the overview consider adding wasd or the arrow keys for ship navigation in spaceleft right up down spamming double click is fine but tedious
heres my ideas to change the corp management ui and make it user friendly and simple1 too much customization is bad you want a system that can be recognized by all not the big mess created by a luncatic ceo so limit the customization as much as possible to create a strong foundation you can add stuff to it later as long as you keep in mind to keep it simple and user friendly also the current system allows you to do too much and thats whats bad about it2 all roles would be made by ccp and each roles would have its own icons maybe 5 roles max by object and simple roles definitions  pos admin hq admin pos supplier pos user station admin a horizontal slider of the roles like the haireyesclothes slider found in the portrait customization could be used just make it bigger3 corp members would belong to categories defined by ccp only to access the right people faster on 4 and 6 admin user supplier director it would work just as 2  4 without 6 in a previous window4 youll get a list of the roles and list of the corp members this one with multiple rows and columns the members would have a medium sized portrait with their name underneaththe idea here is to drag  drop 1 or several roles on a portrait or drag multiple portraits on a role a quick search and filter by name or category of members see 3 would be available5 in the same window as 4 youll also have a list of the pos station hq you own or rent represented once again by an icon and the name or location underneath youll be able to drag  drop 1 or sevaral stations on a portrait or several portraits on the station icon to give only basic user rights6 each hq pos station would have its own info sheet in which youll see empty portraits this sheet will include a listing of your important people defined by certain categories combobox of categories act as a filter and youll choose them to fill the most important roles of the selected object also you wouldnt be able to select 10 administrator for 1 pos put limits for each roles to have a well organized structure7 each corp member would have a personnal sheet in which you can see his rights and icons on the stations hq pos and with links on the systemsas a programmer i have a clear idea in my head i just dont have the time to make a clear picture for you however im sure that with a little bit of imagination youll figure out the right direction to take
launch drones commands  based on groupsi think there is a post somewhere in ah on this already basically be able to assign drones to groups exists that can then be bound to command keys for launch does not existhow it would look in my perfect world that doesnt exist in a perfectly sad wayin space1 i highlight my five hobgoblins rightclick and move them into a new group which i name hobgoblins2 i rightclick on the group bar hobgoblins and the menu comes up with options like launch move etcthere is also an option assign3 hovering over assign i am allowed to select group 1 thru 20 keeping carriers in mind i assign hobgoblins to group 14 while fighting i use ctl1 to launch drone group 1 which is hobgoblins which is 5 hobgoblins that i put there if i wanted to launch group 20 it could be ctlalt0 the commands were assigned in the keyboard interface menu prior to combat much like many other ui featuresfor those who like different setups or commands since eve already allows personal mapping the keyboard options would simply have launch drone group 1 launch drone group 2 etc and you assign whatever combination of keys you like i dont know if eve already does this but deviate between right and left ctl alt and shift as well as number pad keys from topkeyboard numberals people could then use the number pad for various commands drones or otherwise again i dont know if eve already does this
yes please
i support drone implants i am primarily a drone boat and whish this would be addressed as well
yes we can   hit the 2 year of begging ccp to do something
for you children on your fifth birthday may your next five years be as full of promise and hope and may you one day walk with us as equals among the starsidmei sver society of conscious thought on the fifth anniversary of the capsuleer era apotheosis descriptionstop to thionk for a few seconds
i like the ferox but yeah it could definately use a bit of a stat boost to really shine next to other bcs
for the record i suspect that ccp is thinking about tiering issues as i made a general comment about imbalance within the frigate range in one of the round tables at fanfest and chronotis asked unprompted whether i was talking about tiersstill cant hurt to keep talking about it
indeed thanks for that tidbit
i totally agree ive been playing for about a year and have sunk a lot of effort in hybrids and gallente only to discover through pain and the usual vertical curve of eve that for some reason im always unable to compete with other races ships its very depressing i now have to start over and work on minnies to have any real chance
excellent idea 
thats not what i meant theres no recycling involved with one char staying at low sec status and doing the crimes while his carebear alt grinds all the needed isk in safer havens theres no recycling or sec status repair needed at all since one just stays at low sec status while the other is completely unaffected so hows this gonna get fixed
well that would is the way of the outlaws this change is more for the gankbears that want to randomly suicide haulersmission runners in highsec they will have their easy out of jail card slightly nerfed
fully support
translation suicide ganking nerf not criminal nerf from 10s with high sec alts who just want to nerf other pirates because the 10s have to feel 100 safe funny how u mentioned how easy it is for them yet your case is no different u just used different words so that carebears and riskaverse pirates alike can support it without looking like the real gankbears u talk so much about which leads tothat pretty much summed it up right therecombine that with your that is the way of the outlaws and its u and every supporter who r the gankbears especially when u want to keep your high sec alts safe just because ure too scared to be a target in the same space u use to farm easy killmails remember thisu chose your lifestyle now pay the consequences for it and if u still dont like it rat all the sec status back up preferably in that low sec u love so much since doing that is so easy to u
lol interesting that newer players usually go to 00 first when we raid nullsec with maybe 10 ships usually without logistics  i mean 2 logistics for 6 ships srsly you beg that hard for ecm they usually dont fight unless their size is 50i support the original idea because well in nullsec you dont lose sec so you shouldnt gain any either
fix the gcc flagging for repping innocent outlaws in lowsec
the first thing i can think of as far as things that annoy hybrid rebalance dread rebalance a pos gui similar to pi speaking of poss the flogging of a dead horse thread should be looked atgreat job with the fireside chat fellas insert brown nosing and  jokes here
tiericidelow sec disparity being so far off in risk vs reward compared to high sec null sec and wspace
more client to server and server to client request combing to remove unnecessary and redundant requests and to streamline the ones that are made im sure thats what veritas is doing atm and he should be allowed to keep at it
change date of birth to pilot certification and fix the sebiestor and intaki
please oh please fix the ghost ore issue
its good to see you all getting some perspective and focus for things to come csm appears to be maturingfixesglobular graphical glitches resulting from light refraction on pos structures and gates and ships coming apart at the seams like so many catalysts ive seen in the past year its very distracting and takes a great deal away from the game and enjoyment of ityes at some point id also like to see higher resolution textures on the models and it wouldnt hurt to scale them a little betterpos refresh this is an old topic much discussed pos drive me and just about anyone else with experience up the wall would be really nice if they saw some massive changes including 3d uis and modular construction as ive mentioned before in other incarnationsship redesign not just ships but guns fittings and generally anything to do with flying this needs time and consideration and generally a bit of attention in a good way ships and modules should not be designed for npcs to useaggression mechanics and war declaration makeover the whole aggression mechanics system needs to be at least briefly disassembled and looked at for flaws in the system that allow players to exploit the system to their advantage yes im talking about pirates everything can be exploited in some fashion of course however this one is weighed heavily in favor of the side its supposed to be protecting against kinda like the canadian legal system wardecs need to be looked at to and have some basic flaws addressedfaction warfare please make them stop cryingquirky little login issue heres how it works as im sure many already know login with account name and password basic gui and station view pop up you can see your ship and the stion interface your name etc the chat window pops up blankly you click on you character to open the character sheet or mail it appears blankly little spinning dial on whatever window is open poof youre on desktop eve is gone familiarwhat year is it 110 cy 111 no idea can we get this added to calenderheyyy i got an idea calculator  market why not have the ability to input prices on market directly to calc possibly even something more functional with taxfee calculation for amounts purchased if sold to buy order etc yes im a little lazy when it comes to that seperate from the normal calculator of course this one would have to be directly interfaced with the market window anyway idea work with itim grasping at straws here cant think of anything else its late im almost tired have to work tomorrow goodnight
in a new convo window all the font sizes and box at the bottom of the chat window has the hight all reset to default it should open with the exact same font and chat box as the last window i changed the setting to
ui fix the windows from changing focus when there is a session changeactually the ui windows should not be affected by session changes at all its a ui on your pc its not in space while undocking you should still be able to read and chat for example fricking separate the ui from the content already ui101 srsly
tldr switch the implant slot for implant series zms and zmareason zms slot 9 works both for light missiles and rockets zma slot 8 only works for guided missilesbut the damage implants for rockets and light missiles are in slot 9 so a light missile user can use both the damage implant and the zma while the rocket user can only use either the damage implant zms or the damage implant aloneswitching slots for zms and zma would let standard missile users have approximately the same benefit by switching implant in slot 8 and keeping the damage implant in slot 9 this would allow rocket users too enjoy both the damage implant and the explosion velocity implant at the moment rocket users dont have anything to put in slot 8 which seems an oversight
remove or decrease the 30 second timer for changing ships and docking and undocking
edit great wrong topic sorry
when there are a 1000 things to do often the fastest way to get them done is simply get them done one by one just let the devs pick one they want to fix and fix itif you have to prioritize then start by the smallestquickest fix and work your way upidentifying is easy get the 1000s of players to post like in akita ts thread sorting them out will take time though i suggest positing what is already on your list without dedicating yourself to them and then make a post in general ships  modules si and md channels for players to post what they find tldr help us help you find stuff
sticky the 1000 paper cuts thread and sticky all these summit threads so they do not get off the front page
old cyno effect you cant even tell when caps appear these daysso many things to click during invention  manufacturing cant you have a repeat last or somethingwhen you warp to something at 0 but cant jumpdock since you landed 2500people who get around the docking aggression timer by docking in carriers
undock  abort often requires two keypresses to actually abort as client gets confusedalso annoying station interior update after abort behaves as if entering station and reloads the whole thingadd scrambling frigs to all fw missions should help with the skittish lone bombers look at docking envelopes on stations some have 4050km range while others require you to scratch the paint off the superstructurebatch purchase from saved fittings oxymoron much but yeah there are a ton of standings based issues that couldshould be resolved in regards to assists
engine trails would be even happy with the old ones simply added back into the game againif ccp wants to go fancy something like this would look quite goodlinkage
i would really love to be able to see myself cynojump into a system instead of just out of itmy first time around with carrier  black ops i was excited when i popped out but immensely dismayed i never saw myself pop inif and when the new cyno effects come hopefully with an inout difference id love to see myself do both parts instead of only just the out itd make jumping a lot more seamless and entertaining i think
manufacture input required hoops should be reduced with bookmark style production options for things often done and for a specific nag allow ore compression directly from the ore bay in the rorqual instead of having to move it first to cargo
the ability to set defaults in the science and industry ui when say manufacturing a bpoc it automatically selects the first available assembly line at the location station or assembly array it is and automatically selects max runs same for the rest of the options you can do on a bpoc so the sequence is shortened if you have all the materials there you right click select the action you want to do hit done get the quote and hit build having this is in would remove a massive amount of tedium and rsi that large production lines have i think what would be useful to know once the issues have been identified collated and the final list decided and given to ccp to look at is why something isnt done so if an issue pops up time and time again then but ccp doesnt act on it it would be good to get feedback as to why they arent doing it whether its just that that particular thing would require a reworking of lots of code that isnt immediately clear to the average player its being looked at along with a bunch of other things and will be changedreworked when that project goes forward or quite simply ccp doesnt see it as an issue or its meant to be like that
i dont have any great ideas on how to do this betteraside from possibly doing a search on the noob help forums for the word ed but i will definitely lend my thumb to the project
team bff has probably been the single most significant factor in keeping me playing im reasonably content with the current process of identifying little things and im extremely happy with the things theyve fixed i cant believe that were anywhere near seeing the backlog of relatively minor fix requests cleared so the only real change i want to see is more of the same increase the resources available and therefore the rate of fixes and the issue of prioritisation becomes proportionately less pressingincrease the size of team bff and build on the success of one of the few unarguably successful projects team gridlock is the other that ccp have started since apocrypha launched 2 years ago the work done by bff benefits every single eve player from the day1 noob to the 7year veteran
drones apparently hate large collidable objects with the intensity of a thousand sunsafter 4 years of subscriptions id be pleased as punch if the next time i ran a station sanctum i wasnt forced into a clickfight with my drones in order to get them to attack my target honestly if this was someones idea of a minigamewhat id prefer is an only attack my target setting that works exactly the way it sounds if im not targeting anything they dont attack with this checked until i do if they are set to aggressive
nerf jumptitan bridges
if i read you right its called the passive setting
in faction war remote repairing someone of 5 security status or less results in loss of faction standing this mechanic serves no useful purpose and does have a large drawback in that sufficient loss of faction standing can result in a corp being automatically kicked from the militia previous communication by ccp has led to the perception that this is a bug however it like everything else in faction warfare has gone unfixed for yearsdecouple faction standing losses from remote repping criminals
thanks for the topic treb session timers possibly need a rethink with the coming incarna it is possibly going to take even longer to dock reship and undock than it already does also do session timers need to be long for fleet position changes or joining fleets why does one have to go back to the log in screen when changing characters why do all the races except amarr have the 10 second reload time 5 seconds or none please
im still clicking if i dont have aggro
were looking for feedback in relation to the recent changes to the anomaly system and how it relates to the spawning of profitable combat sites in sovereign nullsec space given that when this idea was initially proposed the feedback was considerably weighed in the negative i want to hear your personal experience with this system and if you feel it has impacted on your gameplay if the change to the nature of the way anomalies work in 00 has altered your income what steps have you taken to seek alternative cash flow and are you satisfied with it were generally interested in how this has changed the way you play eve if at allmaintaining serious discourse concerning this discussion ie not complaining about whether or not you think nullsec anom runners deserved a nerf or not etc is not what were looking for in the same regard were also not looking for an nonconstructive plethora of moaning about how generally bad this change is offering satisfactory counter suggestions for improvementsalterations to this system are encouraged
just to reiterate we know its a bad change and we have similar concerns we are really looking for constructive feedback please if you want to rant and rage use the other thread 
constructive feedback since the anom nerf i and four of my corpmates have moved our moneymaking alts to hisec where we run l4 missions theres no risk there and were making x iskhour provide figures while we remained in our space give territory and trusec in nullsec we could only make x iskhour postnerf where previously we made x iskhour thats good feedback it shows movement of behavior and is based on numbers bad feedback rarrr ccp rarrr i unsubbed rarrrrr you are awfulthis tells us nothing and is useless we already know from the 109 page thread that folks are furious we want postnerf anecdotes and data
i understand the need for it so i wont go into a whine fest about nerfed income what i would like to see is less frigates and cruisers in the higher sites hubs havens and sanctums were quite fine or perhaps some new sites with bs sized ships only the problem i have now is i used to rat in a carrier which was fun and exciting cous it has a massive risk but now with all these sub bs ships it feels pointless and lame to rati would really like to see some more equal sites i understand the anoms need some form of warp scram and webs so a few frigs or tackle cruiser npcs is fine but too much is just horrible to play against make them more exciting would at least help against the boredom of having to farm 50 more then we used to for the same reward hell its more effort now due to all the smaller ships to killjust my take on it as i doubt well see havens and sanctums back in most systems
for example i now mow through stargate havens in my tengu it goes through very quick and nets me a very respectable 22m isk after corp taxes for roughly 30ish minutes work and seeing as havens seem relatively abundant i have adapted to the situation if others can do the same more power to them if not then explain why
im at least 35 days away from a tengu cruiser v  we get one haven now in our space and thats always on cooldown so to speak
station sanctums were designed to be more profitable but ultimately more time consuming than ring sanctums which had less trashy spawns which were quicker to run but offered less profit the same can be said of chemical factory havens and stargate havens i assume the makeup ripples down to the lower echelons too but i could be wrongindeed unfortunately we cant all be flying tengus forever and depending on the sec status of your home region you may not even have havens which is unfortunate how do you feel you will adapt to this in the long run
i have the luxury of having a highsec alt and invention pos so my income is secure but i do feel for those who dont global prices will take ages to balance out towards the lowered income of the people that rat so for most people everything is just more expensive now to the point where losing ships and keeping accounts open is endangered the bridge between botting alliances yes i will put this like this and the ones that dont do it as much just got massively biggerif they had done this from the start there would be no issues but giving candy and then taking it away is bad game design it just made it feel worse for everyone i guess what im saying is it stopped being fun now that we have to spend 50 more time to gather isk to keep up with fights and i doubt anyone wants even less fights to begin with being forced to use cheaper ships now just means everything people skilled for is a waste why fly t2 ships now if you have a much harder time now to recuperating the cost of losing it
errrm so i guess any feedback will only be considered constructive if it reinforces your view as much i appreciate the initial post and what its trying to do i fear this will become another mudslinging thread
if you think the changes are great and are prepared to give numbers to those thoughts then your input is also welcome
read ccp screwed us out of a wad of rant cash and now we actually have to fight for our space
i told you not to do this if you cant keep this civil then you might want to take a short vacation from the forums or possibly take a mandatory vacation keep these sorts of posts to an absolute minimum this is not the place for it
left null behind ages ago when blobslag reached critical levels so only experience is based on visitsas i understand it the exploration content can more than cover any losses incurred from anomaly change albeit not as easy nor is it solo work for the most partonly problem i have heard and experienced is competition over the spawnsso double or triple spawn rate of all null explorationties nicely into the whole outbackgreat unknown that null is supposed to be and could even be used to provide materials that would otherwise have to bridged in from jita reg mitts industrialization thread
nc  friends now has to fight for their moons since drf got screwed and has a reason to finally kill them off
for some reason its taking sanctums forever to despawn scanned down 6 sanctums in 1 system and 5 had already been completed and some had been completed almost an hour ago really annoying
hello as a previous resident of fountain i would be more than happy to give feedback on these anom changes ccp has put forthnullsec to me had always been a playground for the big dogs and a place where newbies could go and learn to play with said big dogs the risk is great but the rewards also incrediblebefore the anomaly nerf an alliance such as test had plenty of places to run these anoms as long as we were willing to put forth the isk for the ihubspirate arrays and the time grinding systems to military index 5 now why i point out test in particular is no reason other than i know how many members they have and i know how many of them ran anoms pre patchwith the nerf to anoms our 4000 ratters generous figure has went from being able to run anywhere in fountain to being secluded to a significantly lesser number of systems this in turn has caused the anom systems to become overcrowded with lines of pilots waiting to run these anoms as per figures before the changes to anoms were put into play i was able to pull upwards of 80 million iskhr consistently post patch my income has sunk through the floor in comparison to a steady 100millhr with waiting times increased i personally had dropped to a subtle 20millhrnow even being at 100 mill an hour wasnt spectacular but with not having to wait x time to get into an anom it was reasonable without a doubtbut having put these changes into effect i personally see no reason why anyone would waste thier time running these when they can churn out level 4s indefinatly in empire print faction ammo with lp and make more isk hand over fist for little to no risk when comparing to running anoms in null im currently turning out 250millionhr doing level 4s in empirewhy for such a massive hit to the wallet would we endorse these changes at allliving in nullsec at a much greater risk than empire should yield higher rewards not lesser i should not have to pull my money maker out of my nullsec alliance so i can go make money in empire this anom change has promoted nothing but anger from all corners new eden
as a previous member of fatal ascension we were in a system that was just upgraded to combat 5 sites like 12 weeks before the announcement that is my first example of why it was a bad choice i forgot who exactly bought it but the thing costs 250mil and got very little in return during that time since it essentially said well you just spent the money on this upgrade and the time and effort getting a freighter in here to install it but it doesnt matter because no matter what you wont be getting sanctums or havens anymore then running the other mediocre sites wasnt even worth the risk vs isk i can mine while looking at my screen every 10mins or so in high sec or do l4s in high sec with very very risk and make the same amount of even more and being a college student i dont have 8hrs to make isk doing mediocre stuff just to buy a decent pvp ship that will be easily lost one might say dont lose the ship then well then dont pvp dont pvp then stay in high sec simple chain of process everyone loves money real or virtual people want to go where the money is thats why back when the usa was founded people moved to america thats why people go to college because they want more money than what a high school kid makes flipping burgers same concept applies to null sec if there is more money to be made out in null then people will take the risk and go for it then they can afford to buy a battleship or faction shipcause quite frankly im tired of seeing the spam of drakes and canes last i checked from reading the quaterly report only 11 of the eve population lives in null that isnt much at all instead of shrinking that existing size for people to fight over increase the overall worth of null sec and get more people out there imagine if the null population grew double the size to 22 that would be a lot of people and with more people comes more chances of conflicts and more people to shoot at if there are more people they are going to want to fight over the other valuable stuff like moons as for the misconception stuff like carebears and blue standings people are not going to go to null sec just to make lots of isk and never spend it they want to make some good isk in a relatively fair amount of time buy a nice ship and kill  if they dont want to kill  they become a good target for those that do so theres really shouldnt be anything bad about that for blue standings yes thats always going to be there and thats how its going to work regardless of what ccp wants lets pretend an alliance of 200 people no super caps wants to join null they dont wanna pay someone 1billion a month to rent when they dont get the protection that is promised they want to start and grow they cant just waltz into some place like cloud ring and take a system or two theyll get curbed stomped out the next dayor within a few hours being blue with people will always be there because thats the only way to survive out there does it decrease combat activity hell no last ive checked dotlan for the past month the nc has been busy with ev0ke ncdot drf and pl so yeah thats kinda the jist of my feedback hope it helps
to answer the question  yes its impacted my gameplay previously i was able to pull 60m  hour if i focused with a tengu and had the ability to chain sanctumshavens as rings would finish in  20 minutes not counting escalations given the decrease in available anoms the competition among blues has simply forced me to pull a ratter from null and run highsec missions still making respectable isk with far less risk if i want to make isk that way ive also diversified my revenue stream into tradingproducing which actually reduces my risk overall less vulnerable ships in space and isnt really tied to a particular location meaning i dont really care where home is too muchif anything the change has made me far less interested in the space we hold in terms of income and far less reliant on nullsec for income in general i spend far less time in anything other than a fleetsolo gank combat ship in space in null
prenerf living in deklein doing ring and station sanctums in my nidhoggur with 24mil bounty ticks  the chance of escalations everyone was happy with the way it waspostnerf living in fountain sold my carrier because all sanctums are either occupied or theres reds camping the system with probers and a nearby gang i switched to beltratting in my tengu and can live of it but only because fountains truesec regarding beltspawns is broken  caused by npc space withing the region the more players move into my ratting grounds the less profitable it gets averaging on 67mil isk per tick when i start out ending up with 16ish ticks once i chained spawns no chance of escalation to a plexall this definately breaks the riskreward ratio i know of a couple of guys who moved into alt corps so they can run level 4 missions in highsec with 0 risk and 250mil isk per hour source corpmates and this threadsolution bring back the old anom system and nerf the lp payout highsec level 4 missions provide
well to make up for this maybe chnage the industry upgrade so it will boost the moon minerals reach industry 5 and at least one moon in the system will become technetium
i undocked my ship from 00 took 3 days to get all the sand out of my engines the new desert you gave us is pushing people to where the food is empireour small alliance started to die when you posted the dev log 99 pages  of this is a bad idea and it didnt click then again were stupid and need to be lead around by the noise feels like wow now good job
as a director for a large nullsec corp this nerf saddens me deeplyprenerf we spent around 15 billion on upgrading one system which enabled our pilots a couple of weeks in which to make some decent money and not really worry about where the funds for there next fleet ship to come from we averaged around 250300 million a week in corp taxes through anomspost nerf we are now facing a crisis as all of our older players have moved out their ratting characters to npc corps to run level 4 missions in empire with little or no interruptions taxes have dwindled to 150 million isk a week the loss of our older players not being active in the area running home defence fleets or being around in corp to help with questionsnow comes the big problem with this nerf our corp recruits out of the eve online memberbase we source all of our pilots from somewhere else and we always have around 2030 new pilots join per week they are told to run tutorials and they recieve assistance from our corp in the form of skillpacks ships and advice from our older players with decreased tax revenue we are struggling to find these programs which will discourage people from entering the gamesitting in empire grinding missions and not being an active member of a community isnt what our corp thrives on and through those times where we are in empire everybody leaves we thrive on the big fleet fights we thrive on helping nurture our new pilots to become the blood thirsty menace and scourge of new eden which everybody either loves or hates this stifles not only our growth being in test alliance please ignore but others like us who embrace new players into our lawless space without this revenue it not only endangers our corp but also endangers the growth of eve itself as its hilight the lawless player run sandbox environment which is nullsec has no rewards for all the of risk time and effort now required to live out hereit doesnt break up large power blocks it doesnt dictate military staging systems as per ccp wolfjumper mcshortsightedson suggests but stagnates the game and discourages players from playing
that thread is not about high sec its also not widely accepted even by the more elite mission runners try reading it againlianged also the lp store is a isk sink you dont want to nerf those
personally i dont run anoms at allindustry ftw but a significant portion of my alliance does as their primary income source theyve been dropping from nullsec like flies  ive had entire corps pack in their towers and move back to empire for l4s were in about the worst position its possible to be with both our sov systems being 003 but this change has hit us incredibly hard we could handle a nerf but the complete elimination of good sites combined with the recent buff to gurista jamming has basically eliminated my alliances ability to make money from nullsec as things stand now
when the devblog came out about the anomaly changes i was certainly not running around screaming the world is ending in fact i thought the changes wouldnt change life at all for those of us in fountain seeing as we have many systems with decent truesec i also have to admit i was highly curious to see how this change would affect the placement of alliances and their associated power blocs and it really is quite fascinating to see the abandonment of certain regions of the game in favor of better space the drfs push into the eastern regions of nc territory that being geminate and vale is really good fun to watchwhen the reality of what wasnt explained in the devblog hit i was more than a bit disappointed the dev blog about the changes as i interpreted them basically said if you have 05 to 059 truesec youll have one sanctum if you have 06 to 069 you have two 07 to 079 three etc assuming you have pirate detection array 5 what the change appears to be is that in these systems below 05 with a pirate detection array 5 you get one constant sanctum in the system with a bunch of havens from what has been tossed around in order to get more sanctums to spawn past the constant one sanctum you have to finish the haven anomalies that are already there from my experiences in the past week running havens and lone sanctums in a 07 system i havent ever seen more than the one sanctum at the same timeas far as numbers go alternating between havens and sanctums i seem to get a consistent 37 million isk per hour in my blaster proteus and my fellow corpmate csm white tree is making almost the same on his tengu pilot my friend captain ichimaru who also posted in this thread is making nearly five to six times this amount over time running l4s in highsecas a result of this change i am currently training a mission running tengu pilot alt from scratch and will be actively using that character in 35 months time because it seems at least for the line members of a major alliance the best way to make isk at this point is to run l4 missions in the safety of highsec with little to no threatsas far as risk vs reward at least for line members there is very high risk in null with little reward and very low risk in highsec with great reward there is a problem with this as it has been stated by the developer that a part of the games design is that nullsec should be rewarding players for taking the greater risk of being in a nullsecurity environmentjust to tldr my problems are1 the dev blog that ccp greyscale published contained unrealistic expectations of changes that would occur in the game2 i can make far more money running l4s in highsec than i can running anomalies in null this mentality is not in conjunction with the intended riskvsreward model the game is supposed to have
prenerf anomolies were a ridiculous way of making huge quanties of isk anywhere in 00 with minimal risk that completely removed any point in doing anything other than sanctums for isk due to the vastly greater iskhr and low effort requiredthe nerf was a good idea just look at the economic data showing rampant inflation since they came inthey need to take it one step further and make truesec dynamic based on inverse player activityoh and nerf l4s urgentlyjust to make sure the csm understand this point its not a bad thing for there to be less people running anomolies post nerf nor is it bad if their income is lower both of these are good things because the situation before was absolutely ridiculous people talking about 200  300m an hour running l4s are lying simple as or they are using multiple accounts and comparing to the iskhr of a single account running annoms
im sorry i didnt notice anyone claiming to make 225m iskhr doing high sec l4s can you please direct me to proof of this because im very very keenly interested in his methodslianged i found it and hes doing it with faction ammo no less
three things that thread is about low sec missions that thread hasnt been particularly well received and theres much discussion over whether hes including all the time sinks you have to be making 120k lphr and selling 250k units of faction ammo per hour in order to pull off what was claimedlianged i dont really care if you guys are gonna  about the change or even claim that high sec makes more than  00 but lets do try to keep it within the realm of the reasonable 
three things   following that thread in empire i am pulling the same weight off of faction ammo the people receiving that thread poorly are people that a dont have the skills required to do this properly b people running missions for bounty ticks 120k lp an hour easily done 250k faction ammo in an hour my highest rate has been 350k inside of 45 minutesclaiming heresy is all good and everything but multiple people are actually seeing these numbers people bailing out of nullsec en mass is not coincidental its as simple as a ball was dropped and the issue needs to be addressed and resolved
i used to run anoms with my thanatosfighters 5 carrier 5 and i even had jdc5 finish recentlyused to do anomalies in
in all honesty i dont care in the slightest there are lots of other ways to make money in null blowing up rats and anoms are probably the least enjoyable one i can still find a sanctum when i need to and i can jew in other better and more entertaining waysso personally i give no s
let me be perfectly clear that i think anomalies are a godawful boring pve mechanic the greatest danger to me in an anomaly is that my intel channel is badbehind and in the 30 seconds it takes me to kill a random spawn of scramming frigates an entire gang of reds piles into the system finds me and kills me in other words not dangerous at all theyre also not interesting because the faction spawn and escalation mechanics are completely random and fairly rare they might not be rare when you can see the big picture for all i know its a 110 or 15 chance but as a pilot i have gotten 1 escalation ever from an anomaly and a negligible number of faction spawnsall anomalies are good for then are fueling the war machine pilots need isk to buy ships to get their ships blown up in fights theyre not serving in and of themselves a major source of entertainment people are upset because their means to an end have been removed which causes them to be less inclined to participate in the risk aspects of eve that might be too meta for this thread but whateverfor me personally once the change was announced i decided to train up my exploration and profession skills scanning hacking archaeology and salvage i now spend my nights flying around looking for random crap to run instead of pushing butan on my built in scanner and lazying through anomalies ill still run one occasionally but its no longer my primary source of incomeoverall i feel like exploration content has been a net gain for me its certainly much more random and dependent on what drops i get but when you find a nanite control skillbook or a nice faction mod or deadspace drop it makes up for a lot of bad siteswhich brings me to my suggestion i recognize that inflation is a major source of concern in the eve economy and the rampant isk faucets like anomalies are a major reason why it is a concern regardless of any of the reasons listed in greyscales devblog i would wager that the anomaly change was made almost exclusively because of inflation concerns and other justifications were created later because inflation is a really boring reason to make a change like this onealong those lines i think it would make sense to buff faction deadspace and officer spawns and drops by buff i mean their frequency not their power along with associated cosmic signatures in which to find these sorts of things players love finding mods because theyre shiny and exciting much more exciting for my purposes than a wallet tick and theyre better for the economy for two reasons first they have to be purchased with existing isk instead of magically created faucet isk like bounties second unlike isk they can be destroyed either in transit or in combat and destruction or conflict as were often told is what fuels this gameso long story short anomaly nerf changed my gameplay though arguably for the better but a good way to maintain the fight against inflation but keep players happy would be to make fewer bounties and more special mod drops this puts a damper on isk inflation while making players feel like theyre getting something in return instead of where we are now where entire regions of space are worthless and lame
the basic idea was sound but i believe that the lowestsec 00 systems were somewhat overnerfed  even the worst 001 system should be upgradeable to at least 1 haventhe real issue is that anoms are almost pure isk generators since theyre essentially the sov equivalent of l4 missions they need an isk sink analogous to the lp store
no even using the techniques he used you will not achieve anywhere near that in high sec youre basically claiming youre completing the equivalent of cargo delivery more than once per minute or 1215 angel extras per hour and then youre claiming way outside what i reasonably expect for competitively priced ammo  you know the ammo prices at which it becomes even possible to make that kind of iskhr well that or youre making 350500k lphr  and converting itbasicaly him making 250mhr relied on making 50 more lp than is possible in high sec and converting it at pretty outrageous rates that nobody really buysimo proof or stfulianged i want to be clear that i have no doubt whatsoever that some people are going to move to high sec for what they perceive to be better and safer isk but really now ting the numbers up with bull is not constructive to the purposes of the thread
you almost had good counter points until you started getting angry ask ccp to apologize to you for the current state of things dont take your frustrations out on those of us smart enough to take advantage of the situationthe spreadsheets and various other confirmations of said income automatically discredits your argument this is a thread where csm and ccp both wanted factual evidence of economical changes from a personal standpoint of the pilots due to the anomaly nerfspeople have provided said factual evidence through spreadsheets varying testimonies from different alliancesnow please stop derailing the thread and provide some feedback as per the topic discussion
if people werent pubbies they would understand that highsec players cant make any money people are just fabricating spreadsheets trying to get pubbies to believe this and counter the anom nerf ccp apparently wants us to fight and maybe try and break up the powerblocks death to the nc so maybe eve will become interesting again if the ncsm doesnt try and stop it to only fuel their own interests
no you linked to a highly contested spreadsheet about low sec mission blitzing with multiple agents and massive decline rates and claimed you are getting identical results in high sec  where the lp rewards are notably much less basically the isklp on faction ammo isnt high enough to make the kind of isk you are talking aboutas you said  theyre asking for factual evidence so provide please provide some proof of sustained 250m iskhr in high sec by converting with faction ammoliang
youre not representing the player base atlarge here we deserve better than thatheres a positive story on the changeburn eden recently setup camp in our space we know how they gank and weve adjusted our behavior accordingly while they are there not seeing much in the way of ignorant pilots blundering into them they enticed us to fight by reinforcing an outpost in one of our best ratting systems they know this too as they posted a screenshot of themselves running a sanctum in the system to caod  linkage before this change when any system could produce the same level of ratting everyone would have simply shrugged moved to an adjacent system and went on with their lives not so here as this system now has more strategic importance to our alliance than most of the others this change has helped them and all other smaller pvp alliances be more effective at combating a larger alliance as a small group than they would otherwise be it also made todays fight feel more important than it otherwise would have
im actively involved in tests new player programs we get many new players who join and move to 00 with very few skillpoints we instruct them to train into salvaging and destroyers and go around to anomalies to salvage for money while they train into battlecruisers before this change there was already a shortage in available wrecks to be had but this has made it much worse not only are there less people running anoms and more competition for them it also is forcing new players to go farther and into more crowded systems in order to compete with each other to find wrecksi dont have raw numbers but the amount of i cant find anything to do from new players has risen noticeably new players are our lifeblood in test and this change makes it harder for us to keep them around until they can become selfsufficient in null
read here little bees and nc brosefs is the template that your responses should follow so that i can present our case this is not feedback this is a templated petition masquerading as a call for feedback
my alliance lost a lot of good ratting space due to this change we had to kick a lot of carebear memberscorps to allow the pvpers who fight for the space to be able to get the isk they need i think that is the way it should be no way you can make 120k lp per hour in high sec unless your running maybe 5 characters each doing their owns missions ie botting
im not a bittervet ive only been playing since late last year so i cant say oh this is awful you need to go back to x date and how things were in y expansionwhat i do know is that before i took a little break shortly after the siege of 6vdt i did most of my money making up in deklein i remember running multiple sanctums and some days making upwards up 200mil after a few good hours of this money yes amazing money not exactlynow i cant even make that not exactly good money i cant take out new players like i did in deklein to tag along and help do what paltry dps they could in frigates just to get a feel for a fleet i was forced to sell an alt just so that i could get some kind of cash to buy a couple plex and some ships i neededive gone to my alliance forums offering probing services in hopes of generating some kind of incomeas i said im not an old player i dont even play a ton as it is but what i do know is that just a few months ago i could log on go to a system use my ships onboard scanner and typically find a sanctum within 30min knock it and a few more out and after two to three hours have made 50mil again thats nothing incredible and ive heard that lvl4 mission runners make money far easier far safer and in much higher sumstheres little to no risk in high sec and arguably none if youre not wardecced yet the rewards are so much higher i dont mine moongoo now will i ever theres only so many moons with goo to be mined and thats not something i have the skills for what i do have the skills for is shooting rats only things is theres not too many rats to shoot noweve is about risk and reward its the 1 reason i play it heavy risk equals high rewards yet what is my reward for precariously wandering null in hopes of finding some rats not much what is my reward for going belt to belt and ratting that way again not much forget trying to bring new players out along with me i wouldnt dareon top of this i see members of my corp so disgruntled over the lack of ways to make money theyre playing on highsec mission alts or going into wormholes where are my friends not with me in lowseci read this plan would cause alliances to fight more that power blocks would in time dissolve and that nullsec would be more of a war zone or so what i read gave me the impression to think was the idea behind this change yet turn outs for our ops is lower than ever overall alliance and corp moral is the lowest ive ever seen and is filled with much shuffling of feet and chat like what am i going to do today i could play a missioning alt but i hate missioning im not in a low sec corp to play in highsec on an altwhy would people dare go to fights when they have little to no means of replacing the ship theyll very likely lose i fear this idea has backfired and instead of causing wars or strife over turf people will tightly hold onto what they have and hope no one comes to shoot at them because well if that happens theyll have no money to fight back war costs moneyi have plenty of ideas on what could be done but ill leave those for the csm and brighter minds than mine to get outall i know is as one of tests grunts the reward does not an any sense of the idea match the risk and thats a problem for a game all about risk and reward
this issue almost went away when the new forums launched it should remain in light war decs need a revampthanks
its not about carebears such a useless argumentthats a totally valid way to play this game its about balance and yeah its too easy to use wardecs to grief without much sweat off the griefers back that needs looking into
i had to stop you right there you just called your character a toon reallysigh
requiring a second or third account for holding a titan is the least of the problems trust me also we dont need lower supercap entry barrier
im not looking to stop ganking i fully accept that anything can will and most likely does happen within the eve universe and that is simply the nature of the game all i want to do is reduce the risk for an individual taking prudent precautions even further id much rather give them a reason to leave me the heck alone and pick on the next guy through the gate lest of course if he is a corp mateso all you wanna be ganksters can rest easy you will just have to be extra careful in choosing your targets there still will be plenty of careless carebears out there for you to have your wicked way withplus the ship is still destroyed and the the cargo is still destroyed or no longer in your possession so the net result of an event is still the same for the poor bugger in the indy you dont complain when people fly with partially loaded freighters to reduce the potential value of a load nor when they scout ahead and avoid the system you dont complain when people single stack their stuff to reduce droppage this is just another way of reducing the potential value of one potential target to a ganking feet the ganksters are free to take me out anyway as the module is not guaranteed to vaporise everything and there might be profit in it but thats the thing eve is about riskreward and gives all players the chance to tweak the percentages in their favour better  on turret tracking on speed on lock time in refining waste and so on one of the few parameters that are not skillmodule tweakable is the 50 drop rule this idea changes that dont forget that it works both ways if you are unfortunate stupid enough to get taken by npc rats then your chances of recovering any loot is also drastically reducedi kinda like the idea of it being a permanent modification of the ship ie cant be undone as that adds risk for the pilot choosing this option that way you stand to loose more less hope of recovery in any ship loss but there still need to be an item in the cargo hold permanent and also reducing m3 capacity to expressly flag the existence of this mod to anyone scanning the contentsalong with the cargo reduction you would also take a permanent hit to max cap and quite possibly on max velocity tooin the long run i believe pilots have the right to choose to destroy what is about to be taken if they so wish a f you clause if you like i should be allowed to make it as difficult as i possibly can for you to profit from me and while this doesnt stop you from playing or from ganking me should you so wish it does  by fractions  increase the chance you will let me past and pick on the next guy
absolutely i couldnt agree more learn your ship and the best way to protect it if you dont then i have little sympathy for you im just seeking to add that little something more you notice this idea doesnt protect my ship or its cargo in fact it costs my plenty to train for and fit this modification permanent fixture so i need to buy one for every ship i have it even reduces my cargo capacity and affects the powercpu and cap available permanently all it does is reduce the potential value of the wreckage and in turn increases the chance of being left alonethe 50 chance of droppage is a value i believe a player should be able to tweak in his favour
the only thing wrong with suicide ganking as it is is that concord must kill you for ithurray for beatable concord
agreed but that said that if you want to be a s then are you trying to claim that the game should bend over backwards to make your road to douchebaggery all violets and roseswhile yes good tanking and avoiding the heck out of jita and other hotspots is a good first step some times you simply cant avoid a good ganking as has been said its part of the gamebut as you say if i have every right to be a girefing little gankster if i want and let all the carebears can go spin then why do i not also have the right to want to be a truculent belligerent little s and say s you you want to blow up my ship for the cargo well i will do my best to deny you that prize presses the big red button marked splode the loaddouchebaggery come in many flavors including wanting to give the middle finger to ganksters and by your own rational that should be allowed just as much as the ganking in the first place
so far the the main argument seems to be that you cant stop me from being a gankster its part of eve to allow douchbaggery of this kindi dont want to stop you as it has been said twisted and morally dubious routes round problems in the path of profit are a hallmark of eve and i applaud such thinking heck im the one proposing putting nukes in the cargo hold to  you over so how messed up are my moralsall i am asking for is a way of decreasing the chance of loot drop when the inevitable happens and my ship containing that titan bpo goes all sploadylikenow it seems that not many of you have spotted the obvious just yetthe 5050 chance of a module or stack dropping is currently locked it cant be altered but if it was unlocked then haulers would be free to decrease it but to be fair surely there would be modules that would increase it see i wonder how many of you would be equally opposed to a module that increases drop   not many i would guess and since when has ccp been in the habit of introducing something without the possibility of countering it
actually a destroy my cargo bomb as a  you sounds pretty coolthat said this is a microlevel issue youre not likely to ever see implemented given the various sucking chest wounds in the game we have to triage
or players acting on concords behalf like ccp was considering at fanfest
actually my friend here at work actually came up with a variant on this idea that so made me smile no actually it made me grin like a madmanrather than a bomb that attempts vaporise your cargo on ship destruction he suggested that you can use highly explosive devices that are disguised as something tasty they sit in your cargo hold and are prone to the same 50 chance of surviving as anything else then and here is the sneaky bit once they get jettisoned they arm and sit waitingthe ganksters have long since been vaped by concorde and you have limped back to base in your pod then the sweepers come out and loot your shattered remains as they gleefully chuckle at all the nice goodies they are scooping up they are unaware that there is one heck of a surprise in his immediate future any armed device that is dragged into the cargo hold of a ship will explode big damage inside the shield and armour so it acts directly on the structure if the hauler is smart he will have multiple devices on board to assure that at least one survives this doesnt stop the ganksters hitting you but forces the sweeper to think carefully about what he is sweeping up as to how you disguise the devices hmmn may be they have a holographic generator and you have to feed it a bpc so this aint gonna be cheap of the thing you want it to mimic you would be able to tell the fakes as they would be the wrong massmaybe you could set it to explode on being dragged into a hold or set a timer and hope that it goes off in their corp hanger for max damage  ho yes that would be good the key important thing is that these things need to be spaced by explosive decompression to arm transferring from hold to can or manual jettisoning should not arm them
i started writing a massive wall of text about how they sucked but tbh i think this is betterremove them or limit them to one per system at leastpromotes pvpadds risk again to 00makes logistics logistical againmakes 00 big again no more jumping to deepest 00 systems in 3 jumpscheers
supporting
no doesnt promote pvp it promotes being lazy by sitting at a gate for hours you can do what everyone else does and cloak by jb and gank people jumping in as they are not cloaked its easier to catch people it also promotes pos bashing something that has declined a lot from dominion risk see abovelogistics still have cov op transports rorquals jfs and carriers that can use cyno genscyno ship fodder are not affected so it really doesnt change stuff that much people still use scouts while moving stuff i dont know what part of null you are referring to but from hed to a system in paragon soul takes 9 jbs another 8 from a system in etherum reach to cobalt edge then a path going from tribute to tenal seems to be impossible without having gate jump from deklien to branch all are rough estimated i just checked on dotlan real quick but yeah 3 jumps for deepest system is a bit of an underestimate so no keep jbs cuz its a perk for having sov and also saves the dieing reason of pos bashing
its not easier to catch people on jump bridges with the right gang its possible but not easierpos bashing is one of the worst aspects of eve this was why the mechanics of sov holding changed in dominionexactly we have specific ships to move out juicy loot ect jump bridges makes its easy to move loot like this in any ships i wasnt trying to be accurate with my jump estimate but my point stands that in the past systems that would take 30 jumps to get to now take in general about 14 of the time with almost zero riskid like to end by asking you how many times have you been killed traveling on jump bridges compared to traditional gate to gate inorder to answer your first pointmartin
i can promote this i cant kill squat these days with all the jumpbridging around 
your just a joke who thinks he knows what peace is first off its youre or you are please dont try to use words that are beyond you when you obviously stopped paying attention in school quite early early enough that the proper use of contractions obviously befuddles you beyond your inability to properly express your opinions in english peace is a lot of different things to a lot of different people perhaps your ideal of peace is one where every human being is dead i think that peace is something obtainable where all people of all walks of life coexist and do away with ideas that suggest that other people are less deserving of life than othersill tell you what peace is peace is mutually assured destruction has anyone ever expressed the feeling that you should have been born sometime in the dark ages if they didnt they probably thought it and were just civilized enough to hope you never procreatedpeace is a lie a total fabrication of your mind maybe so but id rather be the fool who believes in peace than the bigot who fears so much of the world that the only way to approach it is through violenceyour definition of peace is where you dont get shot at and make all the isk you want my definition of peace is literally ending your career ingame so i dont have to hear you whine when someone suicide ganks you  my hope was that a few thousand people could make a show for global peace my definition of peace has never been expressed all ive asked for is an opportunity to show the world that peace is an option also all the isk i want is never more than enough to buy a few modules a month and a few frigates to leave in stations i dont plan to revisit for at least a few weeks suicide gank my velators all you wantpeace is a subjective stuffed toy it gets tossed ran over changed stitched and torn up again not to mention set on fire peace is defined as the absence of hostility hostility being just about everything you described being tossed ran over changed stitched torn up again and being set on fire  these are all hostile actions when theyre forced upon another person peace is the absence of these thingsthe goal in my book is cooperation i cooperate with you to take down my foes i cooperate with my foe to take down a common foe and what else is peace other than the cooperation of all beings who will you shoot when all your foes have been vanquished or assimilated even ifnoespecially if youre the greatest maker of war one who eventually conquered all else who would you make war with the only option left would be yourself the only challenge would be ceasing to make war so that you to put it in terms you might understand conquered your selfand along the way we get some laughs have some fun because this is just a game so please take your carebear peacemaking excuse of a pipe and shove it where the sun dont shine this is just a game which is why i dont see the harm in 24 hours of ingame universal peace as far as the pipe comment goes i took my pipe and shoved it where the sun doesnt shine i havent touched my pipe in weeks its still sitting in the dark corner of a drawer i soon hope to forget so that i never have to subject myself to the desensitized nature which the pipe creates maybe you should do the samebecause this is eve online and we all aim to misbehave you can thank capn reynolds from firefly for that one captain reynolds a fictional character said that when he was determined to risk his life to bring a truth to the people of the universe he lived in to correct a wrong which had been perpetuated by those in power also it was from serenity not firefly the difference being that one was a tv series and the other was a moviecan i get an amen folks i see no amens
it is much easier to be critical than correct  benjamin disraelii think we can see who is being critical and who is correct theres nothing wrong with striving for peace
this is in entirely the wrong forum but the world is slowly meandering towards real lasting peaceand i think in no small part the internet is causing thatthe barriers between people of different nations are breaking down  other barriers like religion and culture will take more timeas for the idea of a peace day in eve it would be kinda neat but i dont think it would have any meaning if it were dev enforced
the sentiment behind this post is dumb confict is what drives this game if everyone were friends it would die pretty quickly
unerf itallows concentration of cloaky douches ie station or true sec concentrations of cloaky douches as they dont have to cover as many systems before i would just move system now i cant because the risk isnt worth the rewardhas stopped mining totally in my areadue to the cloaky douches concentrationhas made industry totally stop in my area no minerals means no ships or anything being madeis not allowing me to replace pvp losses how does this encourage pvp combatgives the botters an unprecedented advantagewhy because i wont lower myself to bot to make enough isk to replace those pvp losses realistically ccp you have just made the game far more profitable for the boters isk farmers etc i dont know what you were thinking but this plan of action needs to be revised and scrapped
this thread is still bringing in tears
unerf it
less reliance on logs is the big one for me or just plain better and more accurate logs i fail to understand why logs couldnt have all relevant information if the server literally handles every single calculation and transaction between client and host in the game
less reliance on prewritten generalised responses to petitions not once have they helped or explained something i didnt know already plus they just infuriate you as you dont feel any form of quality customer support you just feel like youve been brushed off like some annoying tick
consistency no more coin flipping on what the result will be if the same issue is brought to two different ccp customer peeps
unify the petition and bug report system from a users perspective currently if a player files a petition say about a ship loss and thinks it may be due to a bug he or she is told that should be a bug report go file onea more user friendly method would be such a petition should get handed off from the gms to the bug hunting team without the player noticing if they need more info than what is provided the bug huntersqa can interact with the player as needed
yes back on topic lets get more support and input on this
chillax bros were gonna fireside it up whenever we have a spotlight letter its not feasible to do these on a fixed schedule because sometimes theres just not news to relate like i said at the chat the speech itself isnt so key as much as it is take questions from the community at length and openly the big question which will depend on the political winds is if we do one of these presummit such as may 10thish or wait until postsummit opinion seems to be shifting to a presummit one so we can go over our summit topics with everyone were already doing that in this forum see above summit topic threadsanyway glad you enjoyed it so much
yes presummit please i love the new threads the csm team has put up and i hope theyll lead to more constructive dialogue with ccp i personally would love to listen in on the presummit to hear what csm6 plans to do there based on the feedback in these threads
cant support this blatant advocacy of all the drned cursewords used in the recetn csm firesidethink of the children
give scs a siege mode which is required to deploy fbs
i suggest that dreadnaught get siege cannon which may work in unique manner for every type of dreadnaughtfirst dreads become antiblob weapon second dreads become antitanking weaponamarr dreadnaughts get beam cannon effect laser damage is focused to form one beam which cumulates the damage 1 weapon 1x dmg 2 weapons  2x dmg 3  4x dmg 4  8x dmg this approach allows focus fire on heavily tanked targets greatly multiplying the damage output on heavily armored high hit point objects smaller targets get significant tanking bonuses due to signature and movement example a pos is a perfect traget carrier gets 90 vulnerability battleship gets 30 vulnerability frigate gets 01 vulnerabilitygallente dreadnaughts get shock wave weapons  area of effect weapons which limit blobbing and spider tanking and encourage targets to scatter and attack from different positions instead of linear shootout shockwave have 98 emp damage 2 heat damage which mainly weakens the shields but damages armor only at a slow rate shockwave cannons have 30 km radius and slow but potent shock wave bursts which allows to counter are affect within given timeframecaldari get extra potent long range rail guns with very high alpha damage very slow reload timeminmatar get mid range potent explosive cannons with primary explosive and mild aoe effect shrapnel damage which renders small craft very vulnerable and can get rid of support fleet in reasonable time unless enemy employs hit and run tactics aoe effect is minor and does not damage heavy armor but unlike antiarmor weapons has no damage reduction vs size of an object only its speed and range micro explosive pieces break down very fast and discourage blobbing of low  medium armor targets drones die after 23 volleys interceptors get a chance to escape as their 1500 ehp can be sufficient to initiate evasive maneuvers a fast moving interceptor never gets hit very hard as it is able to outrun the explosion cloud
as a permanent member of the minmatar militia since my beginnings as a character i have watched militia combat grow and evolve remarkably over the last couple of years despite its arguable shortcomings faction warfare still draws a dedicated following and has had a devoted player base since its origin the hours put in by the pilots that patrol the faction warfare zones continues to be the winning feature as they provide the exciting game play not the underlying npc and system control mechanics i propose a more realistic scenario regarding plexes that utilizes ccp resources effectively and increases the chance the time can be allocated to making improvements to the antiquated mechanics of faction warfare simply put i believe some of the underlying code powering the recently added incursion feature can be harnessed to add a new layer of functionality and purpose to faction warfarethe mechanics exist now for system control through successive plexing encounters linked to a payperparticipation system on a pilottopilot basis this could very easily be adapted to award an lp payout to militia pilots engaged in system control pilots could be guaranteed awards for completing the various plexes giving them a solid financial reason to spend time focused on gang and fleet warfare instead of the lucrative faction missions similarly ecm and other features on a system wide basis based on sovereignty could also be easily pulled from the work done on incursions ships of every type in the game can now be seen regularly patrolling the lowsec warring regions between empires far from the stereotyped blobs of tech 1 noobs learning to pew there is no reason that toplevel faction warfare plexes couldnt be as demanding as incursion sites if they had the time to be revamped along with the control system itself which i consider the priority the militias are certainly capable of amassing enough force to complete them systemwide effects like cynojamming are also now highly relevant to militia zones as capital ship warfare between the militias is clearly here to stayplexes remain a very effective way of drawing out fun pvp engagements the problem is orbiting a button is so boring and fruitless that just about any other way of baiting a fight becomes preferable thus interest in plexing has grown stale some time zones participate more than others but mostly no one cares anymore who owns what space the lack of pushpull over systems makes the war seem flat in terms of universe immersion and impact and implementing incursionstyle plexing control and reward solves both the financial reward issue keeping pilots engaged in pvp not farming missions and the storylineimmersion issue there becomes tangible realworld consequences to the day to day fighting in militia territories that take some of the burden off the militia corps to constantly come up with reasons to keep their troops out in combat besides mindless killmail lustthanks to the council for your time and consideration i know ccp is busy and wants to stay on the cutting edge this is a more reasonable compromise that doesnt require a massive gamble revamping a system that may or not draw more players as supposed to working on more global improvements
we all know the broken nature of the bounty system in eve and it has been discussed many times before but i think there is an opportunity to fix this and simultaneously encourage the upcoming introduction of incarna and thus hope that this would actually encourage ccp to do thisbasic rules to new bounty system1 a bounty can only be posted onto a character when they have committed a crime such as would get them flagged in high sec or low sec under all the current events that cause a gcc andor grant kill rights only the specific wronged party would have a set period to place a bounty upon the criminal and could correspond to the typical current timers a limit to bounties depending upon the crime is perhaps a thought to flesh out2 to collect a bounty you must pod the pilot with the bounty on him is this tough sure but we know there are techniques such as smartbombing right before a player gets popped but that will be part of the funchallenge podding a pilot with a bounty should not result in a sec status hit or being tagged as a criminal 3 the player who had the bounty and was killed will find themselves waking up at a station where their med clone is at but in the incarna concord jail this mechanic would obviously need some fleshing out with the existence of clone vats or if med clone is not up to date etc but the idea is there or perhaps the pilot would arrive at one of several key detention centers such as at one of the trade hubs where lots of players are always to be found in their equivalent medical clone4 to get out of jail the player would have to pay the concord npc jailer the exact same amount as the bounty that had been placed upon them this would then negate the exploit of corp mates or alts killing and collecting the bounty not to mention the possible implant loss5 if the player lacks the funds to get out of jail then they would have access to a lounge where other players could leave postings or face to face interaction with those offering their services as a bail bondsman the bail system would work that if another player posts your bail then 50 of all future income earned by the bailed out criminal would be taxed and deposited into the bonding players account with a 20 interest rate added this would be represented in your wallet just as current corporate tax is assessed this would continue until the total amount of the bond has been paidthis would 1 fix the exploit 2 encourage interaction in incarna 3 would fix an old feature that should work and would be a way to answer some carebear complaints about gankers etc it would encourage bounty hunters im fairly new to the game so im sure there are holes in this plan but im sure some more experiences players could fill out this concept
this would be exploited a lot
if you removed concord from the game entirely you could nip suicideganking in the bud p
so the options are old lady with a whole broom up her backside or far too many fbombs  jokes and using gay as a punchline and making fun of jewish sounding names good to know  thanks for educating us all it was childish profanity for no reason other than to try to look cool or an inability to be professional sorry posting that crap in an alliance channel is one thing doing it as a csm offical chat quite another remember people have families my niece heard part of it before i could muffle it  which was the last thing i thought i would need to do not professional
this is a very good question and its key to understanding the ccpcsm dynamic game designers arent interested in letting players do their job for them like i said during the campaign the csm is a feedback group and advocacy group not a team of amateur game designers devs will accept macrolevel suggestions farms and fields in nullsec iterative ship balance stop abandoning features and smile and nod and ignore microlevel suggestions tweak blaster tracking 15 thats just how it works you persuade people by speaking to them in a language theyll accept and understand that said bff is full of micro issues the important thing to consider is that we have bff because it was a macrolevel suggestion iterate on all these little forgotten issues which was implemented not because each of the thousand papercuts were individually advocated thats why csm6 is interested in ship balance iteration as a macro issue put a dedicated team or a couple of devs on ship balance constantly rather than pushing out overnerfs or overbuffs every year or two randomly tackling the macro issues covers a wider range of micro issues from a certain perspective its a strategic choice on csm6s part one that you might not agree with but thats our perspective
youre a p terrible troll duderhere check it
no i am not a troll i admit i missed the warning as who would expect such a thing from the csm a fail on my part and others as it was so unexpected guess my point was in case you missed it it wasnt appropriate however kudos to a goon covering for a goon so rare in this channel soon the channel will be nothing but goons and you can be happy at the expense of csm appearing valid
if you think the csm isnt valid because i say  theres no hope for you anyway vov
i definitely understand it as a strategy for the csm i was only wondering why it seems that ccp is totally against even considering micro suggestions from the csmplayerbase reading these forums there are some very good micro suggestions that ccp should be at least taking into account when they go to iterate on existing mechanicsfeaturesall told i support what csm6 is aiming for and i hope it works
this is why i votedtroll proof 3
a good example of why is during the threadnaught on rockets there was a formula which we the players thought missile damage is derived from we knew it wasnt the official formula but from testing it was close enough in results that we pretty much took it as more or less the way it workedwe posted pages and pages of discussion on rockets based on that formula there were pros and cons of tweaking it this way and that discussions on if the recipe was completely stupid and if we needed to move from coke to new coke people spent hours thinking over that formulaso a couple years pass ccp finally announces were fixing rockets and tucked in that little announcement deep in the forums was a little tidbit saying the formula wed been working off of is nothing like whats actually on the servera lot of time as players we work from knowledge we think is true but it actually isnt
maybe its time to learn to use the most efffective file sharing waynow this was their first session and its not like they are going to give you explicit detail for 2 hours they would run out of things to speak the next month sure it could have covered more facts afterall this is a sort of csm report to the general public but csm are people like you and me
just checking in to say this was very informative and that the csm has my support a fireside chat like this is a very good way to reach lots of people whod otherwise only really notice the csms presence around election time mittani did speak like 8090 of the time especially later in the qa session more of the other csm were talking maybe to avoid controversy a bit the others should get more speaking time toothe macro approach seems like the best way to use the csmUFFFDs arguably limited resources good to see ccp veritas is picking up on the time dilation thing letUFFFDs see where it goes anyways keep up the good work im so far content with how i voted 
can i suggest a the production of a variety of signatures people can used to visibly support the csm in every post they make obviously different flavours should be make available 
i listened to it today pretty good very positive i like the approach this csm is takingone small request though  please cut down on the profanity
that was very good

this is in response to the csm 6 april 2011  qa session specifically 010734  thoughts on fixing mining and pve so it isnt boringwhile i did not attend the qa i did listen to the official audio file while no hard ideas were thrown around at the qa session csm mittens did ask for suggestions more or lesscsm qa thread can be found herefirst let me preface this by saying im a new player i reactivated my old old trial account when i heard eve had gotten a ui update and since then ive spent about 4 or 5 months running mission i dont mine spacerocks i dont build stuff i shoot mission rats and thats about itmy biggest complaint about missions and mission rats would have to be how hands off it feels while im now onto the more profitable l4s when i was running l3s i was doing them with a capstable myrmidon armor tank all i had to do was warp into the mission hub get everyones attention and launch my drones after that next to no input was required from me i checked to make sure my drones were safe and that my tank was stable and that was it if something went wrong i recalled my drones andor warped out depending how far down creek things were l4s with a battleship are not much better i deliberately moved to a capunstable tank if only so i would have to flick a module on and off every now and thenmy second biggest complaint is how stupid and numerous mission rats are while yes it does feel awesome to be tanking 20 guys at once it also feels very silly after a while i mean that last guristas pirate is either really stupid or really brave ive killed off all his buddys but goshdarnit if he keeps shooting me he might just get meso thats what i think is wrong with missions what would i do to fix itpersonally less is more sleeper and incursion ai have proven that rats in eve can be more intelligent than they currently are i would rather fight fewer but smarter rats than a massive blob of kindergarten dropoutsid like to move out to nulsec some time in the future but i know i am learning some very bad habits from fighting rats eve is a game with a massive pvp focus and in my opinion the pve content should be doing a better job of teaching the barebone basics to new players because right now i dont think its teaching anything im not asking for incursion levels of smart just something that can keep things interesting
so the csm said no one really laid out how they felt factional warfare should work well ok then i expect at least some csm feedback this is from mostly a pvp perspective one the things i found jarring was when the csm said factional warfare had meet its goal for pvp sorry but thats total false it has failed hard 2 years ago when i was an fc there was 400500 people online in channel at any given time 2000 players were actively logged on for the 1st 5 months just for factional warfare assuming minmatar was about the same as other militias the goodplex room pvp the timer pvp idea is awesome it becomes a sort of capture the flag by staying alive for 1020 minutes ship size restrictions lead to awesome 15 on 20 cruiser fights with no logistics and fun set ups militia window the factional warfare window shows you where the action is and whats going down corp leader boards and so on were fun the reward was the pvp you didnt get a bonus of owning a planet you got a ticker in the militia window which gave a personal pilot by pilot corp by corp instance reward for killing peoplealliance tourney involvement fw spiked to 600 people online in minmatar side alone at peak times for the month before at7 fw let players that were not part of a bug alliance a chance to fight in the at the problemsabandonment they didnt balance anything they just said f it itll work its self out the pvp is the reward thats all people need to use this forevereasily could of been a huge part of the npe a way to get people into pvp in the the same way incursions feel nowfactional warfare missions badly balanced they dont become public for anyone to wrap too let they were suppose to no one is even in fw anymore to defend these sites completing missions does not give you more control over a system having to keep going back over and over again means they had to make the missions short and fast thus the issue with bombers finishing them to easilysystem sov no reason owning a system ccp said the reward is the pvp bull if they were right about this fw wouldnt be the graveyard it is today impossible to tell how far along system contesting is different time zones meant the other side would just wipe out all your work every night larger sites could just be speed tanked unless you were fighting the gallente who were the only npc that web this is really stupidso with no reason to reason to fight there is no reason to pvp i will post my suggestions based on what i see as the problems with factional warfare on a later date when i have less work to finish but i found it important to point out what i see as the problems also it should note that a lot of roleplayers took part in fw it was like a haven before it became abandoned in the end ccp needed to stick a set of core gameplay in eve and fix it feature abandonment is something mmos looking for ways to keep players for just a little longer use fw has the potential to bring new players into eve with an easy fast way to get pvp while keeping pve elements

what we need is a methos to disable players who go about griefing in these hub systems regardless of standings players should not be able to activate any weapon of destruction if these systems were conisdered safe havens then trade would generate a safe area for thos wishing to make money instead places like jita are crowded and filled full of criminals all wanting to scam the first player who walks through the station door we need more power over the policing in these hub systems
sounds like we would be better off without you and your my way or i quit mentality too bad you didnt resign seriously folks the current csm crop should have been left to wither on the vine i will say that trebor wipe tree and vile hat in addition to kruton and uaxdeaf for their parthave the same sized heads as they had preelection even if uax didnt pay me the 50 bn isk we agreed on to sabotage geminate operationshe is still ok guy and kruton makes my salad crunchy so how could i complain about him ccp is getting what they wanted thoughmore publicity and more interest in the csm the mittani with his strong enough for a manmade for a woman mentality is getting the job done and while he may be ph balanced his enormous ego will push the csm to new heights and lows in terms of publicity and popularity should be an interesting year for the csm as well as those that follow them seleene would have been much better vice chair than some whiner douchette that threatens to withdraw because it couldnt get its way it rubs the lotion on its skin or it gets the hose again
ummm that was sarcasm dude
it was a joke please good sir please put down the mouse and step away from the keyboard
im all for innovation and driving for results though i have to admit that the informal nature of what csm6 has planned is somewhat concerning i dont doubt that there will be quite a fair bit of conversation and thorough picking apart issues to reach a consensus what i am worried about is the lack of transparency whether actual or perceivedas an example the community at large could see when csm5 was meeting how often the topics scheduled for the meeting the outcome of those discussions and other such accountabilities with the informal processes mentioned how does csm6 plan to keep us in the loop i would assume this concern is what gave rise to the fireside chats im hoping to dig into that sometime over the weekendim willing to give csm6 the benefit of the doubt why does that sound grammatically awful its new bridges havent yet been crossed and i cant just go into tinfoilhat mode right out of the gate wouldnt be fair still though cautiously watching before i get my stockings in a twistcomments from the delegates
the fireside chats act as a public forum and a give and take regarding csm6s thought process were open to altering our objectives based on information that is posted here or is relayed back through the fireside chats as for the reasoning behind the level of concern with regards to our persistent skype conversation i dont follow the logic the csm are entitled to their privacy with matters relating to documents which may fall under nda as far as i am concerned the backlash it is simply an extension of the inherent distrust expressed by members of the playbase when it comes to the nature of csm6 most of which is entirely unfounded and is often a simple case of judging the individual based on the actions of a group something that is frowned upon in i dunno human society as a wholecsm6 is entirely dedicated to the process and have taken steps to keep both themselves and the playerbase informed on a level that no other csm in the history of the establishment ever has that being said there are going to be individuals who outright refuse to see what good work is done based on internalized bias if our actions cannot speak louder than their words then i personally have no interest in maintaining a dialog with them
most of the time we have spent so far has not been on indiviual issues but rather on the general process what we should focus on for the first session in terms of topics not in term of stance though we do share a stance on most issues about communication how to accomplish things etcthere will be issue meetings with raw conversation logs but what we have done so far amounts to what every csm in the past has done through emails and informal conversationsthe difference is that csm 6 is doing much much more of that
i think most people want a fully transparent and open csm crann bUFFFDni have to say the fire side chat was a great startthough i would like to hear more from the other csm repsi think something that concerns a lot of people is the lack of information that the player base gets from these informal meetings you have on skype etcetcwhere you have regular discussions which are neither recorded nor made publicwe need to be able to see exactly how each of the csm reps are doing their jobsto be able to judge them and see if they are really worthy of holding that positionthe distrust part to be fair has been earnedas weve all seen the forum hype from certain voting blocks whos main aim was to try and stop changes they saw as being detrimental to their coalitions and style of playrather than doing what the csm is supposed towhich is greatest good for the greater player baseeven if that means pushing for changes that are detrimental to some but balance the game as a whole and make it better and more fun for example the time dialation seems more geared towards helping massive coalitions cram as many people as possible into one system at one focal pointinstead of looking at ways to bring forward a truely epic scenariowhere we get dramatic end game fights involving power blocks clashing full on over a massive battle front in multipul areaswhere a whole variety of different tactics can be used and come into play from sabotage and guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines to logistical interceptionstopping your enemy from being able to resupply its front lines etcetctime dialation does look to have some benefitscutting down lagthough it has the potential to bring some added problemsthe game will be slowed down but our real time reactions wontwill this lead to battles lasting hours that end in a stalemate as we will be able to react in real time to getting yellow boxedanyway so far things seem to be going ok though not idealwe just need more open information passed down to the player basewithin reason of course
im lost in counting all the jokes made by csm6 in this thread but as a comedy team you guys suck and i prefer comedy central instead or the muppetshowso please do what you guys are trying to be good in to be councillors of stellar management
just finished listening to your new audio blog and really enjoyed itjust an idea have you thought about doing it as a podcast on itunes could make it easier to access and double up as free advertising for eveive wanted a regular official eve podcast for a while but i would love if ccp sponsored more player created media like clear skies
the tier system needs to be abolished for frigates cruisers and battlecruisers low tier bs are pretty much all fine it makes no sense to have half the hulls in game be rendered completely useless by a lack of slotsfitting roomuseful rolesassault frigates and electronic attack ships need a fourth bonusreexamination respectively assault frigs are fun but rather underwhelming eafs are basically always outperformed by the corresponding recon would be nice to see the speed and agility of afs pushed up to match their t1 counterparts in addition to getting sensible 4th bonuses and for eafs to get an interceptorlike sig reduction perhapsthe dramiel needs a nerf at the moment it effectively obsoletes almost every other combat frigate in the game the worm and to a slightly lesser extent the cruor and succubus as well could use a little buff the daredevils about right for a pirate frigate  very powerful with a couple of unique characteristics that give it some flavor that other frigates lack but also a welldefined set of weaknesses that mean it can be beaten by other hulls in its class even when well fit and flownboth unprobeability and the ability to provide ganglink bonuses from offgrid locations should be eliminated for riskreward reasons in both cases offgrid boosting makes it possible to contribute significantly to the outcome of a fight without placing ones ship in harms way unprobeability greatly enhances this for t3 boosters and massively reduces the risks associated with running missions and escalations in supposedly hostile space without meaningfully reducing the rewards for doing somedium and large hybrid platforms in general need a reassessment as theyre rather underwhelming for various reasons small blasters and rails and the hulls that use them are extremely competitive and need no attention
super carriersjust that they are meant to be super carriers not mini titans
first  thank you for this initiative lets hope ccp will listen to youobviously hybridsgallente ships are the worst bag atmif you decide to fix gallente via ship changes you really need to fix all galente ships so clearly it is a gun problem for blasters the paper damage is ok it the applied damage that sux the reason is 2 fold tracking and range since the web nerf the answer is right there it really can be that simple boost tracking and give gallente web bonus or give speed bonus if speed bonus remember tracking suffers if web then remember why the nerf was introduced make blasters the shotgun weapon pg requirement of those big blasters need a look at since you cant fit them and still have a tank thats a bit harsh alternately rethink blasters completely scrap it give it a new name and make a totally new conceptrails plain suck and they are more complicated they really only do with antimatter so their damage type is limited and they dont do enough of it maybe they can be fixed with ammo changes
black opskai lae from morsus mihi wrote a very good analysis on them in the black ops  upcoming changes thread from 2009 even abathurseleene complimented his effortsi basically agrees with everything he wrote but what i think he missed is the timespan a bo is locked in place during a bridge it would be nice for a bo pilot to be able to cut the bridge short and jump to the covert cyno that would allow the bos to see a bit more action than just act as glorified bridges for bombers
infortunatly when ive created my char didnt saw any lightening window saying i was about to make the worst choice for general game funwhy use ships designed for very short engagements ranges when they cant survive until they get in to the said distance dont have enough speedwebscram base bonus to counter kitters dont have the appropriate bonus to make their anaemic blasters do real damage use huge amounts or their shy cap when shooting use t2 ammo with tracking drawback the shown numbers in eftinfo are not advantageapplied in game last question why should any one want to fly gallente for other thing than drone boats actuallyedit drone boats that can be more effective with a full rack of t2 autocanons than half high slots with neutrons or full ions looks like a big fail design or real issue that even a blind can see
i cant find fault with this statement
meh editblaster boats needs completely rethinking currently they dont have the speed or ability to dictate engagement range they dont have the agility to mitigate tracking concerns they dont live long enough to get into optimal and their energy reserves are too depleted even if they do warp scramblers shutting down mwds and the ascension of the autocannon were the final nails in the blaster boats coffinrailguns need significant changes such asone ammo type but a cool capacitorconsumption slideybar tied in with the overheat mechanic so you can melt your guns in one pop by discharging your entire capacitor into your weapons for a headshot or you can paintchip at short range with higher tracking obviously the former example would be in the red and there should be a safe caphungry setting for more artillerytype performanceshield piercing or armor piercing shellslower fitting requirements or changes to the hulls in questionactive armor tanking and the ships that use itsuck fix it the armor repair bonus on most hulls is a complete and utter wastedrone bw limit on myrmidonraise itinformation warfare linkscan we make these less crap or at least change them so that they actually do something for their racial classccp needs a dedicated balance team to tackle these issues they are too deep and too complex for a lone dev to jump in and make illadvised changeseve is an rpg at its core and to not have some dedicated staff devoted to what is effectively the core game mechanics  regardless of whether its an emergent sandbox or not  just looks silly just look at what happened with mothershipssupercarriers when one dev decided to take an idea and run with it  it was a disaster
not to mention the possibility of implementing an active direct counter to cloaking
there will always be a ship class that does x better than any other classesthe only solution to this is to pull a blizzard and nerf the  out of abc classes once every few months so that xyz classes are the new top dogits a ed way to run a game and i wont support it
sure therell always be a ship class that does x better than any other class and thats good and proper the problem is the classes or ships within a class that either dont do any role better than other classes or ships within their class or do every role better not going to bother with indepth examples as well see the last few pages but i dont really want to play drakes vs abaddons with occasional sc drops online
strong emphasis needs to be placed on the issue of power creep imo nerfing  buffing however both are needed to create balanceships that need to be nerfed imo dramiel  has rendered alot of frigates obsolete it excels in too many roles one of the following needs to be picked get rid of drone bay reduce speed  reduce pg to get rid of ability to dual prop  msesupercariers  not entirely sure what needs to be fixed but in their current form they make regular caps obsoletetier 2 bcs  imo although they are very balenced against themselves they are op in comparision to tier 1 bs all t1 cruisers and tier 1 bcs they need either a dps nerf or a ehp reductionmechanics that need changing imo the whole ecm jamming mechanic needs changing it is not op at all its just very simply unfun its a mechanic that really makes pvp not worth whileships that need buffingblack ops  i think they are actually quite ok as they are the main issue with them is the fuel bay as they dont even have a big enough fuel bay to jump a proper recon fleet to their max jump range i would recommend either increasing fuel bay by a factor of 5 or massively reducing the amount of fuel required to jump and bridget1 destroyers  with the introduction with the noctis they serve no purpose need reduction to signature and speed increase to give them more survivability against cruiser sized hulls and greater
the other black ops suggestions  this one are a good place to start on rebalancing their lineupif theyre going to be just a mobile jump bridgelogistics boat like so many enjoy pointing out then make them at least decent at it a larger fuel bay smaller fuel requirements for bridging and jumps longer jump range and perhaps the ability to refit their covert ops gang in the field maybe a larger cargo bay to carry ammunition for bombers and reconsand t2 resists the cost and training requirements for these things are immense  please bring the performance of the ship in line with what it takes to get in one
there was a post a while ago about changing the skill bonus on freighters from a maximum velocity bonus to an agility bonus that i thought was a good idea and seemed to have a lot of support please see
no its not and this is crap that gets repeated all the time by people who havent looked at the map and done the maththe problem is that there in only one conquerable 00 region that has more usable manufacturing slots than the system of jita two or three others come close go one jump from jita and youre way over 1000 manufacturing slots go two jumps from jita and you have more manufacturing slots than the whole of conquerable 00 taken together the welldeveloped region of deklein would need to use 70 of its production capacity 247 only to supply ammo for ratters in the region if you want to provide t2 ammo to your fleets  a whole day of ammo production in every slot in deklein can keep a maelstrom fleet lowest ammo consumption shooting for six minutesif you make hauling from empire harder all it will do is to make people stage their invasiondefense fleets in empire and completely remove any need for any markets and production in 00 outside of supercaps and ratter ammo
damn straight bagdon it is not an option to use pos as the access control in pos pretty much prevents anyone but a trusted core from producing things at the pos i think the main issues for nullsec indy really boil down to copious amounts of manufacturing slots nonpos and local acquisition of lowend minerals from the farmer perspective the regionwide intel channels means that everyone safes up well before you ever get into system surprises dont happen often unless you awox or the other person is stupid and soon to no longer be in 00 outside of the slot issue there needs to be a way to be able to locally source materials at a group level small gang while providing a plausible risk to the carebear gang from outside farmers looking to harvest carebear tears blob mechanics and responses being what they are and highly unlikely to disappear the small roaming gang needs to be able to hop in the system and out with a plausible chance of catching the indyoriented crewwspace would seem to be the best way to make this work a few meta comments related to that mineral compression has always seemed borked inevitably what you get now is that you pay somebody in empire usually kazuo to gather the mins and compress them your alliance jf logistics get your supplies out 2 jf for a super carrier somebody in high command then does your mineral reprocessing to avoid the station fee you then run crap tons of freighter loads with the uncompressed minerals to your pos while there is a bit of geek appeal in fine tuning the compression this has always seemed like a halfassed way of doing it why not add in explicit support for compression via the ingot concept compression levels on par with what a rorq does for ore heck run it through the rorq or something to add excitement and keep it lowsec and below make it such that an ingot works as input to the manufacturing job and you dont have to decompress it you also dodge the high command truffle shuffle of decompression make it so that partially used ingots get wasted or something still giving a bit of geekery for the high end builders balance a bit of risk versus reward by making sleeper sites or something new that drop tons of ingots for low ends thus if you want lots of low ends turn your wormhole array up to 11 to give better sleeper site outlets the wormhole in turn gives the ability of external roamers to dart in without tripping your region intel safety channel 5 jumps out by tons i am thinking about a half to a full carrier worth or something dropping in ingots of the trit pyer or mex shoot for a ballpark of half an hour to an hour for the site alternatively or in addition throw said sites into low sec to give carebear groups a reason to wander out or take said site and include it as part of the industrial level raiding said sites and taking ingots works on your indy level include amazing amounts of scram neuts and all sorts of typical level 5 mission fun basically try to make it that if a roaming game comes calling your chances of instawarping out is quite low cough logoffski cough make npcs bubble for extra awesome sauce the key is to balance risk versus reward make said sites also nonsoloable to keep the group focus think incursion level types of difficulty but yet almost doable with two carriers for the stupid make it extremely tempting for folks to take out caps for juicy stupid cap kills  hell give dreads a purpose related related to it pop a central vault and kill two birds with one stone
mine does add hauler spawns to the anom sites pveers shoot up hauler spawn but would spend a lot of time in vulnerable industrial ships bringing the mineralsore back to a station this increases juicy target traffic dramatically for small gang warfare it also improves the independence of null sec from high sec minerals it also returns the flow of isk in null sec that dropped with the anom changes
there is a problem when people get more minerals from ratting than they do mining but increasing hauler spawns to increase the acquisition of lowend minerals in nullsec sounds is good as long as you dont violate this principle to enhance synergy the hauler spawn rate should increase with the industry level i really like the idea of using the rorqual to create a manufacturing ready ingot perhaps give poss a bonus to pe when using ingot too formalize it as module mineral compression just seems like cheating to me
people mine on their own for their own income in null sec and arent bots i am suggesting hauler spawn anoms not just increasing the generic hauler spawns in belts
drakes should not outmine hulks and gathering minerals at a despawned anomaly after ratting ships cleared it out is a little tooo riskfree
mining through ratting is one of the major imbalances in the current pve system i really dont think it needs to be encouraged further quite the oppositethe primary method of acquiring minerals in eve should be through mining since thats all you get from mining not as a byproduct of a rival pve activity of course at the same time mining needs to be made not so 1dimensional and unbearably tedious  not least because things that are 1dimensional and unbearably tedious become prime targets for botting
i hope so the prime source of minerals should always come from mining i strongly believe the mechanic of refiningreprocessing which ever one people use to take a module and turn it into minerals not the one that is used to turn ore into minerals needs to get the nerf bat in an extreme way
one way of doing this is to nerf the reprocessing efficiencies significantly in all systemsstations bye bye 100 refine but boost ore mineral content to compensate this will make module mineral compression  loot reprocessing less viable and encourage local sourcing through mining perfect standings  skills in the best refinery should still only give 90 efficiency imowith regard to burning the fields if ihub upgrade levels were targettable substructures on the hub itself so a level 3 entrapment array would have 3 antenna models to target for example then smaller forces could interfere with rather than conquer the system maybe have them so that they can only be deactivated rather than destroyed while the ihub is intact so they can be repped up once the guerillas have leftbeen dealt withedit adding another industry upgrade type that reduced assemby array fitting reqs per level or similar would help too late here so i might come up with more random ideas by tomorrow or realise that these are bad
this is an idea that i had about 6 months ago regarding marketing for eve i went on a bit of a hiatus so i didnt get around to posting itremake eve never fades shot for shot with the new graphics and models change none of the existing scenes and add very little probably just a few scenes of ships that have been released since that trailer tier 2 bcs t3 cruisers ecteve never fades has always been and always will be my favorite trailer and is one of the biggest reasons i starting playing eve 4 years ago it is simply majestic and remaking it with the new graphics will make it so that it does not look remotely out of date doing this would most likely be somewhat difficult if ccp was to stay true to the original as remaking all the circumstances for the scenes would take quite a bit of time but i believe that the benefits would be well worth it attracting new players it goes without saying that eve never fades has a certain mistique to it that hooks people it is probably the single most influential factor in me deciding to try out eve and many people i have discussed the trailer with cite that as a big reason for them trying evebringing back old players as stated above over the years many people have tried eve and stuck with it just because of that awesome awesome trailer bringing its visuals up to date would more than likely bring many of those people back with the power of a huge nostalgiagasm
bring in new playersentice back the vets can be done in one fell swoop tbh balance the ships we have internet spaceship combat drives the game all the way down to the lp farmers miners and indies the fact we have such longstanding ship imbalance really taints everything make choosing your ship a real decision and not just lol gunna fly a ferox tonight trollface
mmorpgs players are quite easy to retain or make them run away but the easier is to never make them try more than a few minutesfor the beginner a few things can make him run away fast ships ui manoeuvrabilitytutorialsprogress systemfor the average new player the time invested playing has no positive returnlike it or not but the learning skills system is painful has hell learnings were even more stupid some people will reply me with accounts numbers etc but how many really play de game is a number that no one seems to like talking aboutits pretty simple just go there and look at it from time to timeive never seen more than a spike of 60k tranquillity how many real trials how many alts trial accounts and how many less 6 months and how many 2years  were playing in my humble opinion its the rewardskill progresstime spent that doesnt retain more players than that and makes every one and his alttrollmother say eves not about instant gratification blah blah blah all blah blahso there are too many old 55 guys that never play internet games too many young 25 that like instant gratification and not enough 2555 who this game attracts or simply dont like the progress system concepthard to create some marketing process around space ships fleet battles etc and associate those with the rewarding skills learning concept witch is mostly the one that makes players go away in my opinion
having played several mmos myself i would be inclined to agree with this if a player has to try more than a few minutes to accomplish something they will most likely give up even if what they could have accomplished is quite important new players dont think about the magnitude of a task they could have completed it boils down to did i get something done or didnt i i think the trick is to break things down a bit and take things in baby steps so the player can get something done every few minutes
ok great idea for a marketing video bold white letters on a black backround saying we are done fing arround and a fighters view shot of the most epic space battle ever with thousands of ships and lasers and missiles going everwhere completely lag free
how about more important things that need to be delt with mr csm i would type something but id be here awhileforget pos sheet and sort something people voted for u to do
the fact that the timers for anchor and unanchor are so long is simply ridiculousi mean i can see having it take a while to set up but when it takes 2 hours to set up pos and having to sit there with it the vast majority of the time and almost 4 hours to take the damn thing down its just silly pos are worth a good bit and the fact that for most people it is more cost effective to just leave them behind in my opinion shows that something is wrong see abandoned towers in wormholes or else where
actually scratch these instructions the macro instructions i would want to give to ccp would be make poses less eyestabbingly painfulall they should have to do is basically just run through setting up 10 deathstars and 10 complex reactions with 4 inputs and 1 output and coupling arrays for each inputoutput after that they should maintain those reaction towers for 2 weeks with at least 2 changes in reactions
we need queues for anchoring and unanchoring modules the timers are annoying but i can see the general idea behind their existence however i cannot fathom what game designbalance purpose is served by forcing me to spend those hours clicking a couple of buttons then waiting for ten minutes doing nothing then clicking another button and waiting another ten minutes etc etc as someone else said it should be possible to draw up a plan for a pos layout dump the requisite bits and pieces in space and click assemble and then have it build itself over a suitably long period of time the same goes for the teardown process  i should be able to access the tower management interface select whichever mods i want unanchored hit the red button and then walk away and come back in a few hours time rather than having to do each one individuallypos labs and manufacturing arrays need to be able to access materials from a common source rather than each having their own cargo bays i dont care whether this is achieved by introducing a new storage module or by having the existing modules pool their storage facilities once anchored but its absolutely infuriating to drop off a bunch of materials in the labs and start queueing jobs only to have to go back and reshuffle your materials around because you miscalculated and accidentally put too many datacores in lab 1 and not enough in lab 2 or whatevermore options for allowing people to access specific parts of a pos functionality without having to grant them roles that allow them to do whatever they want or even join your corp if my buddys pos comes under attack and i have a couple of pos gunners in an altcorp why shouldnt i be allowed to have them man the guns for him why is it basically impossible for me to offer full access to my labs and other facilities to my corpmates without also allowing them to take everything i haveeditthissssssssss only they should be obliged to tear the pos down and restore all mods and towers to their hangars at the end of the exercise as well
give poss slots like ships for the modularity bigger pos more fittings and have everything connected directly to the tower maybe save guns if it makes sense to have them outside though i think it might look cooler to have them more like turrets on hard points on the pos itself turning to hit enemys utilizing those fancy new turrets coming out allow to be able to deploy poss for self corp and alliance in addition to the whole deploying floating mods being a lengthy mess the role thing is even more so forcing it to be a corp asset getting roles in corp full of paranoid people can take like monthsso basically lot of the ideas here
mission one you should go through buying modules fitting your noob ship and then the very very 1st mission should wrap scramble and kill them they should get ganked and podded then they should wake up in goo fall out of the cloning machine and talk to aura who says something awesome like welcome back pilot did i mention your immortal
1 the reason newplayer experience sucks is because of the vets riskaversion they would never want to help them in fact they want them to stay in the dark for as long as possible because to them newbies were destined to a pad their killboards b satisfy their epeen and last but not least c ragequit because theyre a dime a dozen2 thats why ppl at one point or another heard the pvp suggestion check their employment history expand that to if its a 1 year old player avoid like the plagueif hes less than a month old hunt him down this is what happens when riskaversion goes uncheckedno one else suffers except the newbies who r usually the only ones who r boldnaive enough to take risks risks that theyve been tricked into taking for no actual reward3 the only way the newplayer experience is gonna be even remotely decent is if they were literally sheltered from the rest of eve which is not gonna happen due to vets exploiting alts for that purposeas long as vets look down upon newbies as nothing but expendable killmail fodder and treat them as such newplayer experience will be nothing but that thats where the problem really is
the npe is missing something to teach aggression mechanics that normally involves pvp so a way to do it would be to make a mission with npcs that cause flagging and have a dockable station in the mission location for instance or better yet make noobs test it on each other yep missions that send you to aggress other players or whatever
ui change to help improve the npe add an option to show the character skills window and the itemship prerequisites tab like a flowchart like the certificates flowcharts  like evemon skill flowcharts  its hard to tell what the relationship between skills is and what your training path should be from looking at a flat listlet nonnewbiecorp people join the newbie corp channels some of us veterans would like to continue answering newbie questions even after moving on with our careers
let me add eves progression system to all this skills learning system has nothing related to what the guy accomplishes he grinds he does boring stuff waiting until hes able to do other boring things before he can buyuse another ship and continue the boring stuff
remove wall of text in tutorials  npe missionsinformation needs to be given out in small doses often rather than in one lump having access to the text as well in the journalhelp screens is needed but the game should be trying to start moving away from having large quantities of text as the primary infosourceeg mission intros should have a clickable ministarmap showing the route with system names  sec statusestutorial also needs to keep better track of what steps have been completed and advance immediately with a comment thats right or whatever instead of needing to click next some parts leave a new player wondering have i done what i need to do  smaller doses will help thisbreak down the item attributes into subtabs or at least reorder them to remove clutter new people looking at a gun want to know damage optimal falloff tracking and dont much care about other stuff note i havent done the new amarrian npe missions on duality yet

yes please do fix gallante currently they are all i fly and it is becoming more painfully clear how broke they are

get rid of the selected item window perhaps by putting a set of buttons above or below the hud a small and easily achievable step to cleaning up the display
i like the api addons idea and id like to suggest ui skins ccpcreated or otherwiseotherwise its an mmo so we need a combat log window that scrolls properly and is colorcoded and lets us customize with high granularity which messages appear and in which colorsi also believe that in order to reduce the excelinspace feel the client needs to calculate some stuff for us andor warn us about it for example incoming damage is greater than your tank can handle is better than trying to memorize your resist and ehp numbers and trying to compare that to the popups about how much each enemy shot has done to you info about ships such as this type of recon ship typically has a 4070km warp disruptor or this ship is popular for its highdamage initial salvo at long range within the showinfo window would help newbies tremendously actually a tab within the showinfo page for each ship that is an evelopedia page would be awesome  it would let us write up this info ourselvesfor industrialists building in calculators and tools into the mining market or industry windows so that they could calculate stuff based on realtime market data skills and standings would be nice
it would be very nice for those of us who deal with bpos and bpcs to have a small tag or a different colour applied that would be a easy visual indicator of the difference between a bpo and a bpc same way as the faction ships have a small tag on them
when add bookmarkwindow is open nothing else in ui can be interacted with by mouseclicks this has to change especially since eve relies so much on mouseclicksremove most if not all rightclick menus has no place in a game not even windows is this rightclick intensive for a reason

you may want to try getting in touch with xaen he has written much on the issue in the pastsome of his suggestions have already been implemented but there are some good points which are still relevant
copying a bloody good one from xaens thread in case nobody bothers to read it
lighten up on some of the minimum window sizes i can resize the chat window until its useless but you mandate that the science window takes up a huge part of my screenextra small station icons we can choose large or small but the small are still much bigger than need beselectable font size for all fonts yes this might be a big programming change but its also a big problem for many peoplehow about placing the messages in a scrollable window
add more overview tabs this is a constant annoyance in large fleet combat it would help with client side lag to be able to break up the enemy fleet into smaller sections to scroll through
no modal dialogsit was a stupid ui element when ms introduced it its even stupider today when weve got twenty plus years of experience with windowed uis unless the choice the dialog offers is so overwhelmingly important that nothing else that can occur while dealing with it is of any interest theres no justification for a modal dialog even then a modal dialog is bad because the desire to get past it can lead to bad decisions but the eve ui is littered with them

two things1 the ability to offset your ship to the left or right on the screen was a nice addition being able to offset it vertically would be nice as well2 an option to put a small white triangular bracket around my ship where the triangle would indicate which direction im going would do wonders for placing my ship and the direction its going on screen while zoomed outoh and bring back the new neocom on the bottom of the screen idea
supported no reason not to have these
supported a fleshing out of drone rigs wouldnt hurt either
this is the reason i stopped flying gallente boats except for their droneboats all their turret based ships just utterly suck i made a quik comparison between my mael and a megathron in eft for 2 ratting bs with all skills at 5 both have similar tanks against rats and and are cap stable a mael get 140 dps more and almost 30k more falloff the only gallente ship that is able to even get close to a mael with the same tank is a kronos in short hybrids needs a boost really badly
actually this is not true post about this issues are even olderlinkage
 locked thread
absolutely
ah that was you i remember the conversation something like why is it that ever frig except for the rifter sucks theyre ing horrible do something supporting the proposal of removing or at least toning down the tier concept

yes gallente need a buff and hybrids tooincreasing the efectivness of gallente ewships is a nice start but without some hardwired minimum range eg no dampening a target below 10km locking range they would soon be considere op againarmor rigs  well amarr and to some extend minmatar also use them you really wanna see their ships buffed tooi would rather want to see some general nerf to buffer tanks and thereby makeing activ tanking more favorable  gallente rep bonus getting more usefullspeed buff really no thanks theres enough kiting going on already give gallente some bonus to counter the speed of kiters web rangestrength bonus or warp scrambler range bonus for example no mwd on target would give the speed advantage back to gallente inside the extra rangei fully agree on the need for more pg or lower hybrid fitting requirements and a bit more cap wouldnt hurt either
yup moar speed no armour rig speed gimp hybrids
how to prioritize easiest first so you can fit in the mostwhat i would like to see is something a bit less modest npcs doing something meaningful are we really to believe that the occasional merchant ship is the only noncapsuleer out there using space why not have them going into lownull and wh space how about an npc delivery service or rulebased financial institutions why not extend the economy to npc corps how about a share marketplace what about ipos to raise capital for a corp hostile takeovers hiring npc goons
bff really needs to set up a public request tracker where suggestions can be posted and individually ranked and commented by users there is plenty of software out there that could be used for this and no need to tie it to eve accounts
another mmo did that and people complained because it was another thing to register for
improving the process we cant affect the workhours or priorities that team bff has so the only thing to improve is getting our gripes to them cant expect akitat to always be around to compile or compress our whinesposts so the forums are probably not all that useful to themsuggestions have the forum moderators submit lists of what they see as the most recurring gripes or issues within the subforums they monitor we can submit only two things via forms bugs and petitions how about a simplified version of this form for a suggestion box complaint box etc its got category sorting which is a huge feature if theyre looking at what annoys us they might as well analyze trends and do rootcause analysis too so they can fix the root and get most bang for buck like they want maybe hire a psychologist to keep their economist companyfinally a comment were subscribing to eve so its a service as opposed to a shelf product and because of that they need to reevaluate their idea that only new features new products bring in customers increasing sales is important for a product but its retention and customer satisfaction that are important for services ccp is like a cabletv provider with outages and distortions in their basic channel lineup prioritizing increased revenue via more payperview channels and voip phones yeah
the icon that you use to adjust the location of where your targets appear needs to be made brighter as it is now the icon is super faint so people who want to move where their targets appear often have trouble finding it
then they dont need to make improvement suggestions and i find it hard to believe they would have the wherewithal to even form a proper improvement suggestionalso many trackers dont actually require registration to make anonymous suggestions

csm needs to give bff a big round of applause when they see them because its the team at ccp making the game better
rebalance gallente ships so they are somewhat useful in fleets again give interceptors a bit of a boost by making them the only ships whose mwds arent shut off by web scrams
before the nerf i had 2 carrier pilots that i used to do sanctums and havens with on a good day i could bring in 2025mil every 20 mins on both chars at same timenot that i would run anomalies all day the most i earned in a day and only did this once was 600mil during 68 hoursafter the nerf there was too much competition and lack of good sites worth running so i sold my one character and canceled the accountwe are lucky in test because we actually have a few systems with decent number of higher end anomalies its still possible for us to do sanctums and havens but after the nerf i have found myself ratting alot lessnow i only feel like running maybe 23 havens before doing something els because i hate doing the chemical haven and there is only 1 sanctumas an alliance we basicly became forced to engage the npc space right next to us so we can begin to do lvl 4 missions while still remaining in 00
the increased population pressure due to alliance members moving from nerfed systems and the increased risk of afk cloaking in the few remaining decent systems have made anomalies less than optimal for me log on for some quick solo isk making  more than 20 in local my anomaly running ships are docked and two cyno alts have been moved to empire npc corps where they are skilling for level fours and the ubiquitous draketengu
i espesially love the guy questioning the assumption that the change was bad was told to provide numbers to show it wasnt bad theyre basically working on the assumption that all 00 must provide proper income through anomaliesfields and farms can go screw themselves we also need deserts and wastelandshow did the change affect my income not at all how would it affect my income if i was still running around in immensea not at allthe farms and fields make you guys lazy and completely blind to treasure hunts in deserts and wastelands which is infinitely better gameplay and a much better target to aim for improvement
i have always been against pvp in a roleplay sense so when my alliances space was made worthless i had 1 option high sec lvl4s i refuse to fight for better space so i think ccp should either boost 00 space so we can all make good isk or otherwise boost high sec missions so i can make the same isk as i did before but in high sec thanks
do you actually get what we mean by farms  fields i mean do you understand what the whole picture entails etc
ive played civ and there you had places that no matter how much irrigation farming and tech you invested in still the results would be subparthose are desertssounds like you want everything to be nice fields that you can turn into farms
when you say we are you saying every member of the csm the entire eve community or what
every country has the government it deserves joseph marie de maistre i guess it applies to the eve community as wellwe get it already nc and friends csm 6 should be able to dictate terms to the rest of null sec and the anom nerf erodes at their ability to build a zillion gajillion member alliance its unfortunate that youre using your csm status as a passive agressive means of forwarding the nc agenda but i guess its to be expected
to be quite honesti havent really noticed that much of a change to the isk income i miss running my havens  sanctumsif you were hoping more complexs would spawn you were wrong in the 2 months ive been down here ive gotten 2 complexs ive gotten 3 dominiation spawns but no loot worth while to speak of oh escalations too i made 100m off my escalation that blowsoverall nothings really changed however if you truely wanted to screw with isk why not mess with moon mining limit how many moon miners per corporation or ie alliance train a skill to be able to take over more moons make 1 moon miner per moon just a few ideas
thank you for the opportunity to comment a wise man once told me if it isnt broken dont fix it you may not have heard this saying beforethe main concern i have with the removal of sanctums and havens is the effect on our corp newer memebers are now struggling to make sufficient isk to make improvements in ships and equipment most good gear is very expensive and previous goals and aspirations have been shattered the next point  i make is that some players me included just like to chat and run missions and such now we just chat and grizzle some people do not want to pvp or mine my corp stated it would give me more time to find my lost dronesyou would make me a happy chappie to return to the status quo

in the past sweeping nerfs to this game have netted results far removed from the goals intended this is because noone including the games owners can possibly foresee the ongoing ripple effects of changes to the rules in a sandbox environment the stated intention in part is to make null sec more accesible to smaller alliances i do not see this happening in the future certainly no evidence of that happening as of todayi am a member of a small alliance and that is something i now consider a misfortune one of the corps within our alliance has already defected to the nc more will follow the shame of this is i have enjoyed my time in null sec especially learning to pvp whilst having the income to support it but i have already moved my mining characters to high sec due to constant red activity i am merely waiting for my corp to move to high sec before i move my remaining two characters out as well i do not believe this change was done to benefit small alliances nor do i believe it was done to increase pvp as a reflection of the real world eve is an outstanding success we see the rich getting richer and taking over the political reins as an escape from reality it is therefore for those same reasons increasingly an overwhelming failurei trust this falls within the editorial policy of this thread
simple summary for the dribblersthis isnt an nc thing its a simple case of low risk having high reward and high risk having low reward high sec for the average ratter is better money than null sec this should just not be the caseif ccps as worried about inflation as they are it seems braindeadsimple to replace nullsec bounties in full or in part with lp earned from completing anoms either that or buff the hell out of the plex spawndrop rate because even doing those isnt very good or reliable isk per hour and thats if you have excellent truesec and upgradesi went through all of chimera constellation after dt and scanned down all the systems in it and all i found were drone plexes lol mag sites and radar sites and thats in a constellation that has 5 upgraded systems
that would be good if the only target was isk faucets it wasntnullsec had become a boring monotone field and that is now changed
note sure how much of this is relevant to this topic yes i know this is a bit lengthy as wellwell the changes have altered what my corp and alliance mates and i are doing in nullsecfor me i make approx 24 mil a tick less since the nerfso far we have have a number of people of corp and alliance say screw this and left corp and moved to highsec another group has left nullsecthe whole nerfing of nullsec definately has made carriers ratting havens and sanctums obsolete you can use a mach domi abadons etc and do hubs and such faster than what ya could in a carrieranother aspect of the whole nerf is people wont upgrade systems as much leaving more money in corps and alliances or if people still upgrade systems they wont be able to as much because of a lack of iskas for the whole concept of will make people fight more for better systems is an utter joke it will jsut allow the high end alliances charge more for mediocre systems they will still keep the top systems for themselvesthere is plenty of ways to balance out pve pvp highsec lowsec nullsec isk moons etc to say ccp is not biased in their desicions i and about 99 of the people out there would highly disagree with thatas for the concept of it will make it so small corps easier access to nullsec someone must have been smoking some funny stuff to think that up lets look at that reolistically small corps have few people and the ammount of plexes they can do per hour is small thus low amounts of bounties and small amounts of taxes for their corp thus they cant afford what the big alliances would charge for rent that being the case why would they come to nullsec to begin withi do beleive that these nerfs are going to cause people to leave the game and play something else its not like there isnt 100s of other games to playsome simple possible solution to fix the nerf is this1make all nullsec back to a 00 rating2 create a constellation ihub what upgrades installed there would affect all the systems in that constellation3then make the sites based on the ihub upgrades of what is installed or not installed with the current system makes the ihub a less functional item in the game4then create differant upgrades that would create example drones or blood raiders plexes in the system even if it isnt a drone region or blood raider area also you could have upgrades that boosts pvp op boosts5 make those ihub upgrades so you can remove them and not be destroyed but only a set number and or types can be installed at a time the effects of installed upgrades go in to effect after dt when the eventual nodt comes in effect would be 1 hour after it is installed or some set time period6 give accurate details on what an ihub upgrade does not the current this upgrade increases stuff in your system example this upgrase increases chances of drone plexes spawning by 7with these solutions would create multiple positive effects1 makes the ihub a major functional aspect of any system2 makes an amarr pilot in angel space more prosperous or effective or similar things3 makes corps and alliances think strategically on what or how to upgrade systems4 makes the constalttion ihub upgrades a tactical item in the game5 it gives ceos and directors better details on what they canwantneed for upgrades and such6 increases mining sites or combat sites or pvp boosts based on the corp and or alliances needs
right before this nullsec had a perfectly homogenous distribution of moonsseriously if you believe that anoms that the average grunt runs is any part of an alliances decision to invade a given region you are deluded
of course the average grunt hasnt matter weve had homogenous anomaly distribution for over a year but in the times before that i do have vivid recollection of alliances invading our space for some good trusechowever im getting some mixed messages here from the proanomaly crowd on one hand it wont change alliances at all since they got moon goo on the other it will ruin alliances cause the members cant get iskbasically what i find rather confusing regarding that position is if alliances are willing to fight for moon goo why would they not be willing to fight for good trusec no alliance i have ever been in has ever considered grunt income a thing to ignoreactually grunt income has always been one of the most important considerations to the point that they tell people to take breaks during wars to rat some isk why are alliances  corps leaving space now if grunt income isnt important
i seem to remember ccp being disappointed with the slow take up of t3 cruisers and only more recently becoming happy with the number in game id like to see a graph showing the number of t3s in game vs the number of systems with pda 5s installed can you ask ccps stats dept for that
heres the thing alliances arent moving at all regions arent changing hands because of this and i doubt they will because as good as the truesec in a region may be it still isnt really that good even 10 systems dont have reliable sanctums and when you factor in that theyre gonna be full 237 and the fact that they can literally be shut down by parking a cyno buzzard in the good systems its hardly an incentiveno alliances arent switching regions alliancemembers are just going from nullsec to highsecof course homogenous space isnt good but what they had before was better than this because even the best truesec 00 is still worse than highsec for making money its just ccps own special brand of shortsighted stupidity
i think the changes have been awesome it should be difficult and dangerous to live in 00 as another mentioned the risks are high as are the rewards even with out sanctums there is plenty reward in 00 and tons of reasons to live out there people should be ratting in belts where there is danger of being scanned and the like its 00 not empire the changes have been great keep up the good work
a cyno buzzard isnt going to cyno anything into a cynojammed system and heavens are still good for blitzing while waiting for the sanctuma new equilibrium has yet to be found same as with dominion it will take months for the effects to play out and considering the campaign by many of the new csm members it is not entirely unreasonable to think theyre holding out hoping for a change that will restore their systemsso all those anomaly runners ditching their 80m iskh capital ships to run l4s arent going to be risking their income any more during wars actually i have a hard time imagining any significant number making more than 340m iskh doing l4s in any case only time will tell how this change really affects 00 and currently it is too early to say anything for certain just as with dominion
people in my corp are reporting over 100m an hour in a solo tengu blitzing l4s for 5run bpcsif you remember longer than 6 months ago you might recall that everyone who had half a clue how the game works predicted that dominion would result in huge blobs of scaps being the driving force behind nullsec warfare and that whoever dogpiles more bodies into a contested system before the node crashes wins the fightill give you one guess as to what happened
the greatest satisfaction i get from all these changes to null sec is the knowledge that they will almost certainly blow up in the faces of those who brought them about history tells us that when greedy people discomfort the majority for their own gain it inevitably ends up going awry they certainly end up with the majority looking for a chance to give them a swift kick to the wedding tackle i cannot wait for the inevitable that is sure to follow
they should have been there all along then a carrier running sanctums pulls on average 25mil per bounty cycle 2025 minutes thats 75mil per hour in the best nonhidden type of anomaly in nullsec i think your numbers are highly exaggerated but i digress if your people can make that kind of money in high sec they should have been there a long time ago
its not a bad change at allthank god is what i say now you cant fleece your renters for billions you nullsec alliances have got it super easy after dominion stop crying and actually work for your space
after having gimped so many systems my main staple of income wasnt so much the anomalies but the salvage and rig production from it fighting for choice anoms in the better systems that are now crowded just isnt the option my enjoyment of eve comes from destroying the site and then salvaging not just the salvaging eve for me isnt just about 1 facet in the game its about mixing it up with combat and industry combinedwith over inflated lower sec system now being crowded for the choice anoms ccps idea to spread people through null sec has failed its just pushed people into the choice 1 true sec systems and left normal 00 a barren wasteland as noone wants it
keep up this kind of infantile behavior going directly against the rules of the thread and i will ask the board moderators to give you a forced vacation from the forums stay on topic stop mudslinging
what exactly is the point of this thread of course people who are adversely affected by the nerf are going to be unhappy  thats kind of what nerfs do individualanecdotal data is useless for judging the success of changes aimed at macrolevel phenomena and would id hope be dismissed out of hand by anyone in a position to make changesand phrasing your op in such a way as to automatically exclude anyone who doesnt share your opinion and then throwing tantrums when people go ahead and express their disapproval anyway is just sad
lolnot only is this pole of yours going to completely exaggerated depending on if its pvpers or null bears but it is insanely too early to see the results of this change trolling and discussion of moderation changed as per the forum rules steviesg
no
its getting quite annoying that you cant roam around looking for a target in 00 much anymore or is that 01 to 09 im confuse alreadythe 00 nerf should be review because its going to cost ccp customers in the long run even that they got dust on the roll atmeve online has been a game base on players for a longtime nowmy personal experience from eve online is that ccp team are quite good in their handling with the players and the csms should do the same to look after the players of eve online
we request your feedback unless its positive in which case we will ask for you to be banned from the forums
i think you need to climb down off your high horse afaik being a csm member doesnt entitle you to threaten other players with forum bansyour opinion stated as fact rather ruins the point of this thread since youre stating that the only acceptable responses are those that validate your opinion
is the feedback being constructive so much to ask there are people in the thread saying its good that this happened and heres why i think it was good and their feedback is helpful theyre not mudflinging and no one is jumping down their throats im asking you to please be constructive thats all dudes
in answer to your question one of ccps stated desires was to destabilize the larger power blocksgood evidence of this tension has appeared on some of nc alliance forums where they have been complaining that they arent being given access to the better truesec systems and as a result have less interest in fighting for the block as an entirety
so anyway the feedback is about 5050 some people are finding more creative ways to make isk others are venturing back to hisec to do l4s some people are happy with havensits my personal experience that mowing down havens isnt so bad have you guys who can easily do havens tried to do them and see how you fancy them there seems to be a reasonable amount of those knocking about after the changeim not sure if it will realistically significantly disrupt the blocs ability to coexist that being said im not sure how it will pan out in the long run there may be a slow rolling tension that will eventually erupt into an allout riot i dont think i or anyone else can truthfully forecast the real impact this will have on alliance level interaction and when we do see those effects well probably source those opinions too
im all for some changes to null sec to make things more interestingprenerf you could mine rocks or mine npcs and more or less be selfsufficient with a little bit left over for comedy exploding on the side postnerfits not really possible i knew people were angry about this nerf but i wasnt really prepared for how bad it actually is the upshot is its now more profitable in terms of how much my time is worth to just buy gtcs and sell plexes because the adjusted 170 an hour upper limit on what i can rat out just isnt worth it for ccp that means less players on the cluster and more people buying gtcs good for themultimately it smacks of a rather lazy fix on the part of ccp to avoid working on more pve content by trying to get interalliance conflicts to do their job of making the game interesting for them
it had to be done as it injected way too much isk into eve what irks me most is that we havent heard a peep about what else they are planning to make null worth ones time if one is not a robotic sheepcsm needs to bang on some doors and get a dialogue going it will be ndaed but it is the only way to get any sort of influence on the final outcomerepeatedly making procon threads will merely result in ccp devs becoming scared of leaving their intranet and push half baked solutions out that no one are happy with loldominion then why has most european countries and the us in particular not seen massive protests and revolutionspeople are sheep give them some bright lights to dazzle them and theyll gladly stand by while you ransack their lives  that is what history tells us
i moved back out to 00 space solely to experience the pvp fleet engagements and sovereignty games that the big alliances are involved in i had the understanding that i wasnt going to get rich i dont rat in a carrier and that when i lost ships id be able to set aside some time to run some havens or sanctums and build back upit worked out great before the anomaly changes if i needed something different or had to replace a ship id take a few hours scan some anoms and run up some isk then id be back into gangs and fleets and back into having funnow the reward for running hubs is hardly worth the risk im hesitant to take out pvp ships that would be hard to replace im not willing to pay more money plex to keep combat ships around or pick up an alt for mission running in empireso in short i am not satisfied with it i have a limited amount of time to play eve to begin with and now more of that time will be eaten up with running lower grade anomalies to recoup losses or purchase new shipsmodules that means less time in fleets and gangs less time doing what i moved out to 00 to do if i wanted pve id go back to empire and do it risk free
a lot of them have had mission running alts highsec has been better money than nullsec for a long timehowever until the patch sanctums were at least easy and reliable despite being worse iskhr than missions now its finally bad enough that its worth the rigmarole of keeping an alt in highsec and selling lp items over staying in nullsec and making terrible moneyas an aside i gave up running sanctums ages ago now i triplebox plexes i can run any tier of plex for any race and even then working out the time it takes me to travel scan and run plexes im not making more than 75m an hour because nullsec is a desert as far as plexes are concerned
when the new sanctum system was introduced i was extremely butt hurt as my old playing style of jump into system spam dscan on belts find helpless ratter pewpew was essentially thrown out the window im certainly glad that ccp has made running plexes less lucrative and brought people back into belts for rattinghowever i dont like the blanket nerf to the spawning of sites the issue here as far generating ludicrous amounts of isk with a fully upgraded system is that site spawn and despawn effectively immediately after completion instead of a nerf to the actual spawning of the sites i think a better choice would have been a change to the mechanic of how fast the sites spawn in the system the lower truesec systems should be spawning sites at a faster rate thus keeping up the benefits of owning and developing space thats harder to access and more dangerous to live in higher truesec systems should still maintain their ability to generate isk out of anomalies but the respawn rate should be slower than the more coveted low truesec system and to get players to move to more dangerous environments for greater rewards
real numbers from someone who has done both lvl 4 missions and anoms while not focusing intently on the task like a machinecn lvl 4 missions in a golemi used to bring in about 20m in isk per hour and between 2050m more in lootanoms in a tengui would bring in about 30m isk per hour and another 1030m isk in loot however from time to time you get an escalation with the potential faction loot drop at the end granted this would take extra time to travel there and most of those drops were disappointing in the form of 20m isk random modules that few really want the real difference between the two was that with lp you can see how distant the goal is for that awesomesauce faction somethingorother where as with the anoms like a gamblingjunky pulling the handle over and over you expected that at any given time you would get an escalation with a good drop at the endin reality i dont think i made a whole lot more running anoms than i did running missions but anoms definitely are more engagingstill think hauler spawn anoms are where it is at as far as a reasonable solution that no one will outright hate
i dont rat much so the direct effect to me is so far minimal but what i am seeing and hearing from a lot of people that im talking to is that the new system is not working as advertised even in good truesec systems few high end sites are spawningthat combat plexes are few and far between regardless of upgradesthat there seem to be a lot of fire sales of t2 ships in the nullsec markets one possible explanation is that people are selling up to leave for some reasonpeople are looking for new ways to make iskbasically this is making it harder for people who have trained up combat pilots usually because they enjoy the combat side of eve to make isk and making them drastically change their play it could be that they will be forced to discover the joys of the other activities in eve mining manufacturing research trading but i doubt this  if they enjoyed that kind of play they would be doing it already
infantile behavior get over yourself its obvious that youre not used to being disagreed with but your threat to ban me for doing so is infantile in itself grow up whitetree leave your dictates for your own forums this is eve online deal with it
leave gm white tree alone
you seem to not understand the whole purpose of wars is to force players to gasp interact with each other and not to allow them to simply hide under the skirt of concord like a bunch of scared children socalled griefer corps should rightfully be able to continue wars indefinitely this forces the aggrieved corp to gasp come up with counters potential counters include hiring mercenaries paying off the griefing corp or double gasp manning up and fighting them or simply pulling up stakes and moving on to a different corp all are ways to deal with a wardecor maybe we could just limit war time to certain zones and times and require a  pvp flag before initiating pvp and change the name of eve from eve online to carebearwowlovingsissies online what a terribad idea the people initiating the wardec are real people talk to them reason with them and if all that fails then hire reputable mercenaries against them or man up and fight them yourselvesyes lets allow only the elite who can afford to pay exorbitant amounts of isk to actually pvp in evethe wardec costs shouldnt be a barrier to wardecs the targets should learn to quit being such a soft target and you wont get so many wardecs learn to actually fight back and theyll quit messing with you altogether in short learn to play
i think the only thing they need to do is help newbie corporations out by giving a lot more information at the first war declaration that a corp suffers including links to tutorials or the wikipedia about wars and what their options are a list of vulnerable assets poses for example and suggestions about what to do to protect them instructions on how to find out info about the wardec corp and its members including setting them red and locator agents reminders to insure ships andor stockpile some war supplies within the 24 hrs they have perhaps extending the 24 hrs to 48 hrs but only for the first war declaration suffered so newbies have more time to prepare a cost analysis of what ships they could afford to fight in and for how long perhaps based on the isk amounts in the corp wallet
i myself am a miner and yes that is pvp eve is what it is because nowhere is truly safe as with all wardecs if you cant win move griefing is not killing noncombat ships considering a covetor can actually kill something it might be griefing if the warring corp chases you through three different regions over the course of 3 months for no apparent reason but then againyoud have to petition on that oneid be ok with more expensive wardecs i personally think wars ought to cost 10 million isk per week much larger deters smaller corps from ever taking on larger and potentially illorganized corps that make lots of isk but not skilled pilots wars serve a purpose in eve  they actually are best used against miners and haulers this is how you pvp in hisec and avoid sec loss in low1 for higher price but keep it reasonable for smallcorp gangs to cause some havoc
this is bull high cost war decs will protect new players from war being initiated against them aka griefing the newbies
i see a lot of words like griefing in this thread being thrown about so are these griefer type corps  individuals getting the ban hammer i mean you guys are reporting these griefer corpsright if they are truly griefing you should be able to correct the action as per terms of agreement upon logging into the gameright
this thread is amazingfinding out that molle told an ny times reporter that he planned to take over all of eve has made my freakin day
if you think your pet issue is not getting due attention i strongly encourage you to reach out and contact csm reps and tell them about your point of view if you dont think i have the expertise and knowledge to represent your concerns then learn me on them if you think im not gonna be able to tackle fw properly or raise concerns when new changes are proposed then convo me and sit me down for an earful on what youve experienced and what you think needs work i think youll find were all really approachable about this kind of stuff and want to learn as much as we can in areas we arent as strong one other thing our persistent skype chat gives us a great opportunity for back and forth with csm members who have more specialized knowledge about things information flow is happening really quickly which should make for a better informed set of reps
csm6 is truly an outrage and a failure of the systemgoons cannot be trusted with the same voting privileges extended to real eve players and their votes must be discountedi propose reducing goon votes to 35 of a real vote
i wasnt aware goons were black
youve never been on one of our fleet ops then
ive got to agreeare you telling me my nc alt should be able to go from 93pi in pure blind to g8ad in cloud ring in 3jumps  i dont think so thats only an example ofchave u ever had your nc alt in tribute  stargates are a thing of the past my friend who needs to walk that road when u can get from 1 end of tribute to the other in 3 mins or lessso get something done because all tese sov holding hand holding kids dont like to risk there internet isk
i personally think you should make jbs an ihub installation that puts it at a planet away from pos protection it allows a moderate force to incap it and the ihub can be used for fuelage a 2 link maxsystem where the 2 beacons on the ihub were 15km apart and within 100km of the ihub jbs have a very valuable tactical advantage that should stay the ability of the local populace to trap an enemy by getting behind them with jbs is pretty awesome they just need to be a little more vulnerable
people that need them are beyond help alreadybye jump bridges

good suggestions but you dont go far enough to promote pvp add risk to 00 make logistics logistics we need to apply this to corps and alliances living in invulnerable npc stations too the farmers need to be able to besiege the brigands preying on them on the few days per year they can organize themselves make the hordes at the gate brandishing torches and pitchforks a real inconvenience to do so we need to allow the services repair market contracts loyalty store fitting cloning factories on the previously invulnerable npc stations to be disabled  obviously self repairing over time  say a week  and allow residents with sufficiently high standing to the pirate faction owning the station to assist with triage carriers and logistics well adapt to any change and are sure you too will adapt to change that brings more challenge to the gamemore than happy to accept any reasonable limit on jump bridge networks  which range strikes you as suitable for empire to northern branch  three is obviously too few and we would totally agree with you there and are further pleased to see you have fully researched this proposal and have a firm grasp on game mechanics  lets double it and call it six to northern branch  eight to the far north of the drone regions  eight to the furthest south east also can we suggest further nerfing jump bridges by only allowing them in systems with a fully upgraded tier 3 gallente station of course allowing more than one station per system is a necessary prerequisite to balance this change we would propose allowing the conquest of npc nullsec systems where the npc faction does not have an existing station in the same constelation  limiting guristas to individual constallations just like sisters of eve mordus legion and others balance in all things makes this game interesting and change makes for interesting times
nothing to add to this just agreeing with mynas
are you some kind of dummy or something jump bridges dont confer tactical or logistical advantages that are useful for force projection or rapidly assembling and moving giant blobs thats some kind of dumb elite pvp meme that has no bearing on how theyre used in reality and furthermore
i think everyone missed the point to see if in the similated world such as eve peace can be made for 24 hours by mutual agreement of thousands of players we already see that dogs of war would die if they dont kill someone for 24 hours i wonder how many of those who will survive without iti can
conflict drives this game but so does cooperation this game would die just as quickly if not faster if cooperation between people ceased its my experience that it is the cooperative aspects of games like this that make them so successful yes eve is a sandbox game where piracy greed backstabbing destruction and exploitation are encouraged  but thats because there is an understanding that this is a game if you ask players how they feel about pirates suicide gankers and thieves ingame there would certainly be some animosity expressed but for the most part they would probably tell you and understand that it is part of the game maybe its the very reason they choose this game over others if you ask a random person on the street how they feel about real life murders thieves suicide bombers rapists and the exploitation of those who cannot defend themselves you will get a much different answer its true that these horrendous things are a reality of life of living in the real world but how many people would say that they consider them acceptable behavior do you really think that the majority of people in the world would see these things as acceptable rather than as monstrous acts of inhumanity which could only really be done by the desperate empathetically challenged or insane if we the people of the real world did not feel that way then we wouldnt have prisons or criminals or even laws in place to deter and protect the majority of populations world widethe sentiments behind this post which are the desire for global peace as well as unity and equality would help this game more than hinder it think about how many more players there would be in eve if the entire global population had access to it by calling them dumb youre calling the idea of peace and cooperation dumb imagine if the whole world had access to the internet were capable of affording to spend a few hours a week playing a video game and had the choice to direct their destructive tendencies and feelings into a virtual world rather than the real one i dont know about you but id rather my friends and the billions of people i dont know lashed out in a virtual world than in the real one if i owned one i would rather my megathron federate issue were blown up to send a message in lieu of a building a hotel or a school full of childrenthere also seems to be some continued confusion about what im asking for im not calling for server wide unfounded and indefinite peace between all players corporations and alliances i was just wondering if anyone else out there thought it might be amazing and progressive if an entire gaming community who essentially thrive on war banded together and agreed to take their fingers off the triggers to send a message to the rest of the real world24 hours no more no less
blitskin  thank you for seeing the message the world needs more people like youi dont think it would have any meaning if it were dev enforced i dont either it would only have true meaning if the community agreed but at the same time the devs are a part of the community so we would need their support as well and having their support would make this topic much more visible to a greater population of the community
peace peacei hate the wordas i hate hell all montagues and thee
greed greed is why peace cannot exist those with influence over others will wield it to satiate their greed this is why war never changes
last week eve online made an astounding global message an entire 24 hours of players participating in a peace rally over a 14 million players ceased fire upon each other to demonstrate to the world that we can live in peace if we try statistics provided to our reporters by ccp confirmed this informationsource broadcast report on npr 310am estimated listening audience 538side thought how many people play farmville everyday without fighting
it is an excellent point what is the better way to make on the real life news if not this i think it is a great way to get attention and bring more players to the gamei was playing other online games for years and only last year found eve i would play eve since the begginning if i would knew about it
amenno one in the world desires peace more than a soldier at war one of my favorite quotes i cant remember who said it speaking as a soldier in a combat zone i know that feeling all to wellyoure arguements are well thought out but based on false assumptions in the end we as humans are animals human children exhibit the same characteristics as puppies and kittens that is not just by chance to attain the peace that you want you need to eliminate the drive to better yourself in all humans around the world because there is always a winner and a loser conflictcompetition of all people would have to be stopped and the status quo enforced rigorouslyi dont know about you but that is a world i dont want to live in id rather go to war than promote a world where nothing changesyou seem the philosophical type read into bhuddist and taoists texts they both promote peace but they also understand that a balance must occur they accept war but do not promote it i suggest you do the samegerrick palivorn
lol and the follow up eve onlines 24 hour peace rally was undermined yesterday as a coalition of x y and z alliances moved significant invasion forces under the cover of a universewide ceasefire when the ceasefire ended the epic clash of forces promised to be the most destructive battle in the history of eve had the node not crashed
lol i was hoping someone would pick up the obvious followup blitskin  i think you missed the subtle point that it wouldnt even be newsworthy coughnprcough
un nerf 00 or nerf highsec
change it back already ffs
nerf it moar
nerf highsec i thought lev 4s were supposed to move to lowsec what happened with thatthat should shut those empire carebears up and bring balance to the force  whatever this game is getting ghey world of tanks is out of beta
keep it 00 is not supposed to be some huge isk making factory with no feel of being killed go rat in the belts you can still make 40 milhour easily you just have to pay attention thats how it is supposed to be the dynamic was ruined with so many people doing sanctums
do not un nerf it ever stop whining cos you cant fleece your renters for billions a month for crappy systems
unnerf it
what we want is pretty basic we want to make fighterbomber wielding supercapital ships more reliant on their support fleet and less of a direct UFFFDber deathbringerhow to do itwell we have an idea and before you go ballistic remember that this is an idea and were sure ccp will nerf itchange the way fighterbombers work and have it so that you can still launch all the fighterbombers you want within limits of your shipskills but you can only directly control 5 of them at a time that means that a supercarrier can launch 5 fighterbombers assign them to a gang mate launch 5 more assign them to another gang mate etc etcthis means you will not be able to launch 20 fighterbombers from a supercarrier and send them all to incinerate a thanatos in 2 seconds it does however mean that you can assign 5 fighterbombers to each of your lil friends in the fleet and send them forth to be the messengers of your burning furyremember were not proposing messing with the final total amount of fighterbombers you can launch and delegate just the amount you can control and delegate at a time you can of course also launch 5 fighterbombers and make them attack a target of your own choice if it pleases youbut wait theres morenot only do we propsoe limiting the amount of fighterbombers you can launch but also the amount of drones yes we want to limit carriers and supercarrier just like other ships ie they should only be able to field 5 regular drones at any given timeseriously the reason we are proposing something like this is that we feel that supercapital ships are being used way too much as betterthaneverythingateverything ships when we in fact think that they should be used more as theshipsthathavetotallyinsanetanksbutprovideotherswithadditionalfirepower ships did that make sense probably not but anyway we hope you get the gist of the direction we want to move them in and the way we see that happeningremember that this is still just an proposal and we want your feedback on this so please post constructively and you just might make a difference in the eve universe
this sounds curiously familiar from somewhere
i would rather have the dreads buffed into supercap killers imho your solution sounds a bit too complicated for easy realization
zuluzulu
lol and what was the reason these changes did not get implemented on carriers personally the two things that need to happen to scs 1 limit the damage they can deliver to structures if scs cant declaw poss and shred ihubs stations and tcus dreads become the workhorse of nullsec again reduce fighter damage output by 20 and make it so fighterbombers cant hit structures 2 increase their vulnerability to subcaps a fleet of 30 dreadnaughts should crap their pants at a 10 man sc drop a 100 man bs fleet should be able to cope and a 100 person ahac gang should laugh as they declaw the scs without losing a ship to do this slow down and increase the sigs of fighters and fighterbombers to make them susceptible to bs weapons and sb bombs then split the capital and subcap drone bays so they cant carrier infinite amounts of drones unfortunately if you remove their subfighter drone bays on all carriersscs people will quit ratting with them we dont want that
i like the idea of the normal dronesbut having to assign the fighter bombers to fleetmembers is not really a good idea cause what happens if that fleetmember gets blown up 
good idea regarding assigning bombers bad idea nerfing fighters and belowdreads still need a buff but this is a nice outsidethebox idea to start with
zuluzuludid anyone bother to look at the date of that devblog they knew there was a problem in 2007 yet they didnt change anything edit damn alt setting on the forum 
the same thing that happens now the fighters go back to the sc to await further instructions if there are more subcaps out there the sc can reassign those fighters to another
ccp greyscale has made it clear that nullsec is currently up for several passes of refinement aimed at driving conflict and presumably favoring newer alliances slightly over older larger ones following is my four step proposal for a system that would do just that1 unnerf nullsec anomalies period pilots need ships to drive conflict risk vs reward et al the rest of this plan is predicated on a return of nullsec to previous states2 levy an asymptotically scalar monthly fee against corporate entities based on the total number of pilots that are set blue to them even those inherited by alliance settings this would create a vast isk sink with the largest entities paying the most into the system over time this should make the maintenance of uberblobs utterly impossible forcing alliances to choose smaller groups of allies for their coalitions smaller coalitions mean more neutrals more neutrals mean more targets more targets with smaller blobs makes eve online a healthier game3 implement a way to produce moongoo from planetary interaction and remove it from all pos moons make the process of producing each type of moongoo sufficiently complex as to exceed that of producing robotics remove pos mining equipment from the game and replace it with modules which mine raw pos fuels such as liquid ozone and strontium clatherates yes strontium clatherates storing our ships in nullsec shouldnt be quite such a chore if you want us to use them for conflict making some of the fuel accessible directly by the pos itself lowers the isk sink bar for small corporations and alliances to access nullsec4 limit jump drives and jump bridges to being able to take a ship only to any system a gate in the system of origin could take it to but reduce the cost of each jump significantly lets be honest this is how it always should have been yes you can try to avoid the incidental gates and camps to wage your war no you cant get there in thirty secondsi hope folks can see that these changes would go a long way toward fixing the current conundrum that is nullsec and i suspect the changes would be a lot more fun than the current hosed situation there
almost stopped reading expecting another oh noes mah wallet topic  1 sanctums were added as an extra income there was more conflict prior to them being introduced so the argument falls flat goes without saying that if everywhere is the same there is no incentive to aggressive seek greener pastures for the botherd and conflict is for the lulz only  look back 23 years and compare the type of conflicts with what has happened since dominion  they are gone good riddance2 penalizing people for banding together in an mmo hmmm would certainly make eve the first to do such a thing  the isk sink you are looking for is in the sovereignty maintenance system make it scale horribly fast after the first few systemsconstellations and you end up with us type confederationsalliances just with the added juice from epeen which will promote even more war3 no comment other than hell yes static income should not be a part of a game where income actually matters alternatively the operations should be made extremely vulnerable to attack so that a perpetual guardpatrol has to be in place to protect it4 will happen in some form but not before a nullindustrial revamp is ready i think a lot of or even most people think the jita reliance is a little over the top so is just a matter of timewill be quite interesting to see what the protect the status quo csm of this term does ccp appears determined to try to fix null so question is if they will try to help shape it into something usefulacceptable or hold their collective breaths in defiance
ditch sanctumsadd hauler spawn anoms
sovereignty doesnt matter if youve got the cap fleet to say the space is yours and unlimited blues in your coalition to back those claims up big alliances wont pay the sov bills for vast space theyll just hire more renters and claim imminent domainalso eve has always been the first mmo to penalize people for working together see cspa charges npc corps original lack of taxes npc corps being immune to war while player corps arent capitalismthe asymptotic fees would be small and manageable at the lowest levels but would become huge and unwieldy at the numbers that tend to produce uberblobs
dont unnerf it you guys dont have enough good ratting space maybe you can go take a5 stop crying and put the work in for your space i heard you all got beat down by the pl feeder corp
stop crying is all youve got to contribute1 i dont and never have relied on anomalies for income many other vocal players apparently do andor did2 ccp promised us their clients that with dominion all space would be worth taking we were given details as to how the system worked we adapted to it investing countless hours and isk to do so only to have our trust breached by a visibly arrogant dev who seems convinced the current solution is the only solution they have done this kind of feature baitandswitch beforeand its never been a particularly good marketing technique for them3 people are leaving the game due to this change we as players will probably never see real figures as to how many but anecdotal evidence proving this seems to be abundant the isk fountain people refer to probably wasnt enough to even fully accomodate the vacuum these subscription cancellations will leave in the market especially if a suitable isk sink to incent players to change their behavior were implemented4 ive presented a proposal that removes the most isk from the biggest botter and blobber alliances while creating a healthier atmosphere for conflict and the best you have to say is stop cryinghow about this start thinking
not true you simply suggested a mechanics change that favors alliances and coalitions that are large enough and rl fiscally strong enough to use outofgame assets to functionthe nc would likely just set everyone in the coalition neut and set most everyone else red and continue to use all the outofgame assets we have to organize and function like normal no skin off our back sucks to be the little alliances that use ingame mechanics though
a very good point i hadnt considered using outofgame assets and solely outofgame assets for id purposes still it seems like this could be very unwieldy at large scales what would happen for instance if you guys encountered a large neutral fleet instead of your predicted red enemies can fcs and pilots all pull off this feat
as we currently sit it is highly abnormal to be shooting at neuts anyway other than in small gang warfare in small gang warfare you usually know the names and ship types of everyone else in your fleet so it is quite easy to identify who doesnt belong
remember the sum of these changes not solely fees for blues are intended to increase the odds of precisely such alliances seeing new neutral fleets that said im still interested in whether or not its possible for the alliance to function as stated if theyre caught offguard by a reasonably even neutral fleet
alliancescoalitions that can field reasonably sized fleets are known entities though the only people impacted from such a change would be ratters who would have to check the player info on people who enter their system coalitions wouldnt blink about getting rid of ingame mechanics if the costs for using them were noticeable and the benefits were really rather small
but mittens cannot ramble on impressing himself with his cunning linguistics in a mere 30 minutes
i for one will be passing up on the next episode of the mittani showmaybe when they introduce more characters into the plot and get better writers i will have another look
there doesnt need to be news to relate to have one the qa session is as you say valuable in its own rightid suggest doing both one presummit and one a few days to a week after the minutes are releasededit any chance of rotating them across timezones andor allowing those of us who cant make it to email in questions ahead of time
and nothing of importance was lost
if you like the nerf say so here best change in a while hopefully the blobbing will start to go down as things return closer to normal null sec was becoming really quite unfun
best change in a long time tbfh keep it
death to nullbears
supported too much easy money in old sanctums
why should ccp stop there nerf mining sites as well and moons rate everything is going soon will be supercap online even i can fly a nyx but i am happy with my thanatos nerf away ready for next chapter in carebear tears
nice one ccp too much income and not enough slaughter in 00now we only need something to efectively counter the hordes of supercaps
if the issue were supercaps price they could simply significantly increase the materials needed to build themthose who dispose of the necessary resources will still build supercaps in big numbers the only difference will be that if youre not in the biggest alliances all youll be able to do is count your losseswait and see
given that certain statistics indicate that nullsec players who blitz l4s for lp in tengus are making roughly equal isk to the isk they would have made simply running sanctums how do you feel about riskfree isk being funneled from hisec to nullsec as a result of this change
that needs to be hella nerfed too
qft p
high sec is everything but riskfree that could be true ifplayers running faction pirate missions werent crowlling in their billions bps faction stuff rewardsbountysplayers running sanctums couldnt run them faster than you can run one lvl4 in a faction bs dead space equipped witch is not the case of every player spending some hours per week in gameplayers running incursions sites in high sec have same risk than those running them in 00 w8 they come clean them in high secat this difference in 00 you can shoot any rock without problems try to do the same in high sec you cant just say lvl4s give the same income without knowing if its someone running several accounts that does this all day vs someone spending a few hours per dayweekthe statistics dont say that you are better in 00 running faction pirate missions knowing youll maybe cross a red or something else once per weekmonth but players doing this can and they do in several postsi would really like to see those statistics in detail by comparing players walletsactivityi cant believe there are only some fcs and ceos having the advantage of running those sanctumsheavens what ever because this only means the issue is not the missions system
please come back when you know what you are talking about
please come back when you have something to say until then dont waste you time trolling
supported blitzing makes a paltry quantity of isk and a lot of lp which is traded for other players isk if anything it removes isk from the game economy via lp store costs whereas dominion sanctums were a massive and unregulated isk fountain that injected huge quantities of raw isk into the economy moreover since the method relies on being able to convert lp at a high rate just how sustainable do you think their income is going to be if people start doing it en masse hint not at allim also impressed that so many of these former sanctum junkies were able to acquire characters with the ultrahigh faction standings necessary to blitz efficiently in the short period of time thats elapsed since the nerf man those guys work fast
i see where you are going with this yes i agree nothing past lvl 3 missions in low sec i like your thinkingbut in all honesty what has been said above applies 1 it isnt an isk fountain2 you need to keep taking these missions going back to the base more frequently and it only applies really in npc 00 which isnt a considerable amount of 00its all about risk vs reward there needs to be risk if you are going to be rewarded in 00 this gives more experienced players a reason to play the game and lets all the wow gold farmers have their fun in empire if they want to come down to 00 there are rewards to be had but 00 should not be an isk farm with out any dangeryou can work the belts for probably 4050 milhour if you are looking for more than that i dont really know what to say that is already more than it should be anyway too much money in game
topic became old hot after the first five thousand posts about the changei want to know what else is being done to make null worth bothering with for the nonsheep part of the populationi want to know if they are going to bring heavy missile damage projection inline with other medium armamentsi want to know what they plan to do about neutral rr and other unscoutable aspects of eve combati want to know when they are done playing space barbie and get back to working on eve properno support because saying slinging mud to the left is as bad as slinging it to the right
i still think they need to add hauler spawn anoms instead of the easy to bot bountycentric anoms
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
the majority of that income is from lp rather than isk which means even if your statistics are true that income will rapidly decrease due to competition to try and sell the items that can be redeemedthis can be see if you look at in eanms which have already dropped by around 67m while the tags have increased in cost resulting in the value of the lp dropping by almost 50 already
invalid argument the csm was invalid before you said 
im quite happy with mittins talking most of the time rather you hate him or like him he is a figure that people recognize almost instantlypeople who want the other csm members to talk im sure that can be arranged in following chats for for this one let it goas for professionalism if being gay for each other and making  jokes gets to job done and even gets talks with ccp to open up go for it
mittani and other prominient goons have stated that their goal is destroy eve see the original threadnaught they have not been able to actually do it in game and this is the last place that they can try to destroy it remember you get what you pay for but tbh the goons of today are not the goons of 2007 so i am not quite ready to condemn mittens and co but i feel that i may be proven correct in my assumption that they are still on that endeavor
literally controlling your game
beg to differgoons leader plays an  and also said himself hes one in real life
but then we wouldnt be able to read any crap from you anymore unless you cheat and let your 4 year old nephew take the test for you  which i suspect will happen 
as much as i dislike the way the mittani and others campaigned for their csm slots i am certainly willing to sit back and give them a chance to prove themselves now the dust is settling and actual work is getting donewho knows we may actually be pleasantly surprised which would be nice
incarna needs to be optional to not have a severe effect on multi client stability one of the best things about eve is that you can play several clients on a computer both in required player focus and computing resources for many players myself included multiple clients is what makes eve entertainingi would love to see walking in stations a loadable optional environment with a ticker box like the load station environment one this would allow to run multiple clients without wasting resources on stuff you wont be doing on more than one client at a time unless you have multiple personalitiesmake it so
i absolutely agree ill be very unhappy if im forced to walk in stations when theres no practical reason to do so
agreedi have no interest in cq
keep it up i lolled hardand what you say is truejust ridiculous the way missions are set upmassmurderer online anyone 
cripes some of you gots are the worst
what happened to the post of the long list of items the player base already voted on to be fixed from the last csm
supporting it has really gotten ridiculous how much time and effort that ccp is putting into incarna instead of refining existing content i mean dont get me wrong im sure walking in stations will be cool and all that but id rather never get that content and have functional fleet fights improved ui better balancing and sov tweaks not to mention actual stories for pve content and fixing old ideasccp by all means finish incarna but then i humbly ask that you spend a year fixing all the other stuff youve implemented and make the game work really well and make it fun youve had some ideas and content that youve implemented that sounded so freaking cool and then it didnt work how you wanted so you just left it do die and moved on a perfect example of that behavior is faction warfare as a concept its awesome as hell as an actual feature its completely lacking support and gives no incentive or reason to do it at all it wouldnt have taken that much more time to do it right and figure out how to just make it worthwhile but instead you pushed forward so please fix the game i want to be able to say that i like this game when my friends ask what im playing
capitol ships should have things like this battleships even but the game is not ballanvced though and is too big to even get into something like that i like your idea though
i agree
i agree
myrmidon is dead everyone flies drakes make myrmidon alive give it some potent boni for its role ie damage for piracy and ganking drakes role is survivability and all range engagement in fleetsmyrmidon deserves 125 mb bandwidth full rack of blasters and it can be strong again an option to substitute drake superiority
i want to speak of gallentebut not in a way give more etci wanna show you some examples how gallente got cheatedwhen you gallente everything suggest you that your weapon is drones  learn drones wellbut then suddenly no bc can use 5 heavy drones  sentries not even a command ships d kronos elite bs made mostly for npc killing can not use 5 heavysentries and got miserable dronebay even thought that its prototype  megathrone can  this is unbelievable btw tanking abilities of kronos are also  as it has poor resists  shortage low slots where u also want to put some damage mods  problems with capa t3 ship can not use 5 heavysentries even if u configure it as drone boat  well basically all proteus version are pretty useless but may be it really ment to be so hyperion high end of gallente bss useless ship as it bonuses are nonsense well may be for mission running it is ok though but that is itnot going to cry about blasters it is just require to be pro to use them solo or in fleet then it is pro fleet why gallente navy didnt invent rig that would significantly increase blasters only optimal some how drones control  mechanicslogic screwed alway beenyou cant broadcast your drone using drones window for reps egyou cant lock it using ctrlclick from drone window only right click menushortcuts are only for all drones you can not give command to specific selected drone unless you do right click and select an action from many options which takes too longyou can not teach your drones what to do when last order done why wouldnt be possible to create few players scripts and assign those scripts to drones in drone settings nothing too intelligent but eg after current order complete engage similar class target  higher class target  smaller class target  stay passive as we have now in settings  return and orbit  return to drone bayor when hit broadcast for shield  armor  structure  allwhy on earth drones returns to shot old target when i told them to shot new one and they seem to accept new order new target is in range and everything is right

in about four weeks the megathron will be the final gallente hull to drop from evekillnets top 20 its currently at 16 with about 110th of the kills as the abaddon no 1 right nowwhy are gallente hulls not used they dont dominate their intended range close range and in return can get kited really easily due to speed range fitting and tanking issues weve heard them all before so how can gallente dominate their intended range heres some suggestions1 better tracking from blasters2 tracking bonuses to drones on all gallente hulls 5 small drones from a gallente hull should count for more than 5 small drones from another races hull since drones are the gallentes preferred antifrig defence 3 bonuses to webifiers in some form rigs perhaps 4 easier fitting requirements for gallente weapons so they can use what they were going to use for a fitting mod for tracking enhancements andor webifiers instead5 boosting baseline speed so that if the gallente hull wanted to nano it up a bit they would be able to go as fast as their minmatar counterpart if they were to say fit the same number of overdrive injectors 125 speed as the minmatar ship fits nanofiber internal structures 94 speed increase im looking at you myrmidon and brutix 6 hull rigs to catch up with trimarks and cdfes to increase ehp so that damagetracking mods and webifiers could be fit on the ship instead of tanking mods this is very similar to 4 above
with all of the ihub magic though you have to ask what makes it worthwhile for the system users to band up a fleet and fight the frustrating part for the farmers is that once you get anywhere close to targets due to alliance  coalition intel channels they all dock up the only ones you catch are the supremely idiotic fun everyone once in a while as those tend to be juicy but very very spotty there has to be a mechanism like the agony proposal that makes it worthwhile to respond early quickly with a suboptimal fleet anything ihub based is just going to devolve into blue ball wait undock carrier repair rinse and repeat the optimal strategy is to blue ball because there is not a huge loss if one waits the alternative is endless grief from high command if the pitchfork ends badly which it usually does the circle of life then continues with large amounts of docking  posing up until folks stop roaming the area moreover what incentive does a roaming gang have besides a bit of grief afk cloakers do that job just as well it would be nice if farming null sec was not a lotto and you could have some sort of reasonable expectation of a fight ala faction warfare on the mining front i agree that it should come from mining but with the caveat that it is a lot easier for folks to scale to x miners than to scale to x pve toons ignoring bots tie it to the comets or whatever ccp was dreaming up a while back toss in a new strip laser and add new ore that yields that tons and tons of low end materials the never a perfect refine scenario is interesting two other options would be to 1 tweak the reprocess results ala t2 bpo  bpcs to not yield the original inputs or 2 eliminate compression by never allowing a reprocess to yield more volume than its perfect input scale by x the second idea would be craptacular though without sufficient warning and some way else to source low ends in quantity
minerals  hauler spawns dropping raw minerals and extra high yield scrap mining as current but with mining bonus added to prospecting arrays think static command bonus belt stripper no not that kind of stripper silly dumb ie no attackdefence automated not targeted by npcs mining facility that spits out jetcans as it goes through a belt yield pretty low compared to actual miningtechnology adapted from rogue drones art department will love adding bits and pieces to human tech i think  has to be manually deployed to a belt and activated think onlineanchor requires fuel of some sort relatively low ehp but indestructible see below goes dormant when wrecked reinforced and autorepairs after 1218 hours needs to be reactivated after autorepair failure to do so in x hours allows remnants of rogue drone ai to take over and it morphs into a rogue drone properproduction more assembly linesslots in general material efficiency upgrades ie modifies me of print when built in station with upgrade ninjaboost to null invention efforts as well as base manufactureerrm and thats it for me i thinkmuch easier to expand on the last loot nerf named modules cannot be built so their reproc values can be tanked with no ill sideeffects unnamed modules should all have size increases to be really unwieldy bonus faction modules should have a significant increase in reproc value makes the trash drops less trashy while increasing overall mineral supply
1 its just too easy getting all the stuff needed from empireboosting local 00 production can only be achieved by making outside resources harder to get
make sov activity basedno in theory it increases the chance you get a completely onesided gank with a mineral drop that you cant move yourself anyway small gang warfare  shooting ships that cannot shoot backof course in practise you move it directly to either a station or a pos and from there further with jump freighters no point in suiciding industrials as form of small gang pvppeople dock up as soon as there is a red in local because it is beyond ed to not dock up well or at least allign out pve ship against pvp ship is suicidal volunteerly doing pve ship  700 dps or so from anomaly vs pvp ships is full  i am personally all for a system where sov is not based on blobbing a few timers activity based sov is still imo the best idea who actually lives in a system gets sov with some other stuff to make it a bit more fun for also those who want larger fights that will create small gang fights but no it does not give a roaming gang the capability of disrupting sov or something like that and it shouldnt imo the more you boost the pillaging kind of ability in eve the more people will be forced to blob to counter that
im still for adding small anchorable structures in belts on planets on the sun that have relatively low hp so a gang can harass it should have one timer of no more then 1h to allow defenders to assistupon destruction it could drop fancy loot or other stuff that was needed to build itthe structures if intact would give bonuses to the planet sun belts like more orefaster respawns in belts the structure on the sun could provide a reduction in pos fuel cost system wide harvesting the energy of the sun the buildings near the planet could provide bonuses to pi or wethe buildings could also be temporary disabled by hacking modules and skill and repaired put back online by science skilled people hacking would give some of the mods needed to build that can be sold on the market and repairing should require mods or minerals or sothey should cost a few hundred mill but no more this way the attacker can get rich from destroying them theyll cost too much to put in every 00 system and cost enough to want to defend it
and you just boosted blobbing and forced people even more to create huge powerblocks
let the industry upgrade tweak the moon content in the systems when it reaches level 1 some of the useless moons will all of a sudden contain a few random non local minerals the higher the index the better the minerals
back to this idea then were back to why should an industrial player move to null sec because short bot mining and super cap construction the reasons are pretty minimal that problem would spiral outward and end up with very few shipsmodules for sale in null sec and rather high prices for them thus constraining pvp im out here to pvp but im not short sighted enough to miss the fact that modules and ships dont magically appear on the market you have to solve the industrial situation if you want to remove bridges
seriously to folks that say logistics should be harder have you actually run logistics to 00 not zomg this one time in band camp we ran a freighter with a huge escort and it hella scary real sustained logistics ie supporting a corp or alliance for months it is barely palatable as it is and is one of the worst activities in eve but it has to be done and the pew pew both interalliance and your roaming gang getting targets relies on it getting done folks would gladly give up getting stuff from jita if it could be sourced locally at anywhere near a reasonable premium of cost time and  or risk manufacturing slot access is fundamentally critical as it opens the floodgates for the average industrialist ie not those of us who build supercaps to flood the market with said ammo t1 ships and modules slot access could be alleviated if pos access roles were fixed pos access roles would be preferred due to the tastiness of destruction but that revamp is probably not happening any time soon slot access might increase farmability due to lower cost  greater availability of goods but probably not by a significant amountyour best opportunity is to address the supply  farming issue in some sort of a combined solution give the ability to reasonably locally source reasonable not sourcing a supercap make said new sites reasonably pinnable in terms of avoiding logoffski  instawarps where you are trapped for periods approaching say a siege or triage cycle to give a roaming gang a chance to actually get them without having to log nearby in space the prior day a couple of examples  make new ore types with wtf levels of lowends that has a chance to spawn a warp bubble with a 13 minute duration think mercoxit but without the stupid geyser put said ore type in belts for easy scanning  location  create new wspace class 6 with copious amounts of low end ore bonus to ore yield as part of the anomaly bonus and another link to null sec if you give your average industrialist access to slots to build things and the ability to locally source it at a reasonable risk the roaming gangs will get those juicy targets they want heighten with something like the agony thing and voila small gang awesomesauce
so heres an ideamining is boring and risky in null rightand alot of people dont have the time or even want to ratsmall gangs need something they can shoot that will drop something they wantso my ideadeployable mines in null roid beltssimple concept uses pi stuff to build a structure the structure can be deployed in sov 2 space two tiers one that just minescheaper and one that also refines it will gather minerals as long as its online it requires pi fuel and or ice fuel has some decent health so 1 or 2 will take awhile to kill it but a gang of 6 can get it in a few mins it drops pi  whatever is stored in it at the time for the looters the mining deployable grabs what ever roids are in the belt and mines a bit of everythingso what this will do is give more independence from jita give the people with less time more passive incomegive small gangs a way to burn something and grab some loot to bootmake mining less boring by not doing it at allkeep in mine pun this thing should not out mine a retriever and should fill up after x amount of hoursalso when dust comes out you should be able to steal the structurejust an idea
industrialization imo is limited in 00 for the following reasonsavailability of slots as previously mentionedavailability of lowends in 00 empire botting miners supply low ends to eve at low prices there is no incentive to put a mining ship in a belt in 00 for lowends hauler spawns dronenpc drops and  provide building material some balance of the riskreward with respect to lowendsavailability of t2 components in 00 is pretty much nonexistant and needs to be imported perhaps there could be an alternative source of t2 components based on missions or anomolies or somethingregional t2 inputs as soon as you overly regionalize various materials what you create is a jita market that means everyone hauls their crap to jita solution in my mind the best solution is using pi on moons to extract moon goo and get rid of the pos miners have regeneration randomized so that new sources of moon goo appear all over new eden there can be biases based on regions but having the good moon goo wander around all the moons in all the regions will break the tech monopoly and prevent future ones it will also be attackable via small gangs and dusti feel that randomization on regeneration should be applied to asteroids too i also feel that high end minerals should be found in lowsec in smaller quantities as it is almost more dangerous to mine in lowsec that 00it has always been my opinion that there should be a strip of lowsec between the major factions to break the jita monopoly and create 4 market hubsin summary moving moon mining to pi spreading high end moon materials and minerals around all areas in a somewhat biased fashion and create a good riskreward for 00 lowend minerals could create a selfsufficient 00 community with little or no ties to empire
another recent post in fis was to allow the creation of datacores via pi i thought it appropriate to post it here too rd on planetsmoving moongoo entirely to pi would improve nullsec industry but its impact needs to be carefully looked at it might be better to have both pigoo and moongoo
add rewards for burning the crops like salvagable mods that have been destroyed during a raid
pretty much the people advocating jump bridge removal have no clue on the dynamics of 00 alliances most of us hate being reliant on jita but nulsec industry isnt sustainable going along with the anom changes ccp introduced industrial hubs could be further adjusted with modifications to increase mining amountother industry bonuses along with a module capacity limit on ihubs leading to specialized systems rather than every system has everything in this way the systems with bad truesec that anom runners no longer care about could be specialized for industry and if these modules were disruptable could force a need to defend them otherwise risk the industry in the system being significantly hindered
well lets ask the other way around how many ppl would you be able to support with only local production capabilities atmno offense but maybe you are just too many for the enviroment you live in if it wasnt for easy access to empire
friendly bump this topic deserves at least a little more attention that it is getting
what others have said make a herculean effort to address eves many pitfalls in lapsed development abandon featuresetcthat will lure new players in with a game that the developer still cares about word of moutharticlesreviews from people seeing ccp fixed what was wrong or is on a quest to make their product better not just more or bigger fix one thing and declare a laundry list of things they are tackling next then follow through with it and communicate the processproblemsold vets will come back if all of the above comes to passif ccp just wants more nubs to fleece then make more inspiring trailers that look great but dont reflect what the game is or what it will be for years to come if ever to sucker bitter vets back string them along with lies about fixing this or that make a token effort to fix one thing that isnt too hard then scream about it from every mountain top when that one thing gets done lie about doing more while on a mountain top then dont do anything else repeat every year or so while charging down the path of new shiny for nubs to fleece and chasing gaming awards to feed ccps hubris
i would love to see this rather than a big bubble  many of the other suggestions would be great to
ability to name pos structures as we please having 4 corp hangars and trying to find something in them is pain in the assability to name tabs in corp hangars as we like individually for every hangar ability to make as much tabs as we need would be good too maybe have a reasonable limit say 2030 tabs topsaccess management not only for pos itself but hangars and ship bays giving roles to people isnt an option when you have 3 poses with 6 corp hangars and need to give him access to only one roles help but they are limitedif above is implemented i wana be able to giverevoke access within edit member menu
make it possible to enter a password during character selection
poses have always been awful and the ccp made them worse ui needs a serious overhaul and some form of in game central tracker would very useful pos fuel its too bulky and too fiddly the old proposal of fuel rods was brilliant but reduce the volume doing multiple runs is not my idea of fun moon goo needs some form of overhaul scrap this naff idea of racial distribution that being said there needs to be a high value goo that makes a decent amount of isk to help support alliances poses need some form of supercap defence currently supercaps are essentially immune to pos defences mods also need to be far more resistant to fighter bombers buildingpulling down towers takes a lifetime and is so boring i would rather chop my own balls of with a dull rusty spoon building towers is a huge pain the building ui needs updating i would suggest talking to the ancient egyptians about a more recent design forcefield access needs an overhaul passwords are a pain and the system should have an option to allow blue entities to enter poses need some mods that allow personal itemship storage ofc theres the huge problem of how you empty it to remove mod director more inforcefield mods need to be nameable silo sma cha etc stront timers need more control like the station timers but still require stront to run possibly allow remote modifications reduce stront the item volumethats all i can think of right now
going pirate means only flying larger ships that can tank the sentry guns or spending an even longer time looking for decent pvp im not really interested in scanning down miners or pve ships the concern over standings seems a bit overdone you gain standings for the faction you fight for and only lose standings for the faction you fight against its not that big of a deal its not nearly as bad as screwing up your sec statusin faction war i generally will fight just about anyone i run across yet about 90 of my fights arewere against the opposing faction i can go pirate and stay in fw but leaving faction war just means i will have about 10xs fewer pvp encounters that makes the problem worse i really dont have hours and hours to spend warping from system to system for a decent fight joining a large war like fw should be a solution for people like me i should be informed where the fighting is and what is needed so i can go fight instead finding decent pvp in this game is like finding a needle in a haystack if you have all sorts of time i guess eve is ok but for those of us who want a bit more action on any given night  eve currently fails hard fw should be the answer but its not
not entirely true overall activity wins out over after downtime when you are defending or attacking an area with a large number of systems that are held by the same side the baseline status quo right now since you can force respawns into those systems throughout the day after downtime beats overall activity when you are defending or attacking one system that has been occupied while all the other systems are occupied by the other side ladistier a couple of weeks ago for example in this case all of the respawns into the system happen at after downtime
yep
you can tell that a race is weak when nobody anywhere is saying that they should be nerfed

it was impressive how many great designers where out there competing at the create a new starship contest how about starting a create a new ui contestthere are a lot of good ideas out there just lets find some common sense and let the artists use that as a base for their creativity i know ccp is working on some kind of new interface but why not help them with that taskthe actual ui is a real pain in many ways i have rsi and thus i also mean real physical pain and its imo actually not fitting into the way ccp is going to be an innovative future oriented company
yes this there are tons of very creative players around who could possibly come up with some great ideas for ccp to impliment
really minor onelet us search contracts by description againi miss just being able to wander into jita and search firesale when i was bargain hunting or construction kit things like that
reading all this depresses a new player like me1 year old because im coming to realize now that all the time ive put into gallente has been wasted i wonder what the stats are on how many players who quit eve are of the gallente race when they realize just how bad we suck
more bull numbers from made up formulas please
supported boost hybrids too
i support this product andor service
supported it wouldnt take a insane amount of resources we are not asking for uber new graphics or anything just balancing them in base number of slots changing base stats have the ships differing in the abilitys that increase per level and type of slots they have highs of missiles or guns one more mid or one more lowallot of people here could think up some pretty simple numbers close to what it should be just takes implementation
let me give you another example ill not even try with bcs or cs gallente class its an old horsehyperion  the megathron fills the same role much better making the hyperion pointless and an expensive hangar queendominix versatility is there any other bs in the game except the rattlesnake that can fill the same number of roles

supported i have just finally cross trained matari because gallente have the worst ships and gun systems evar i would like to be able to use them again
ccp took the time to add a pilot license tab to the character sheet but why oh why does it not tell you the date when your account is set to expirerenew i would think that would be the first thing one would expect to see on this tab
if it would be at all possible instead of nerfing everything try adding to ships and modules typically everyone using the same guns on different ships everyone in major fleets using ancillaries and very little of the other race guns for the ship they are using i would say that needs to be fixed pvp needs to be looked over you dont see pilots telling you to use the race guns for the race ships these days anymore
my top 4 of the littel annoying thing from the view of a wh inhabit 1 no repackacking of items in pos hangars2 its not possible to save a pattern for a fleet everytime someone set up a new fleet you have to go aaaaall the way through everything new wing new wing 6 new squads rename every squad set free move create advert blabla thats just annoying and timeconsuming for no reason3 why the heck isnt there a simple pos modul to repair ships armor or boost up the shield i mean hey its a big spacestation but i have to refit my ship with a remote armor repper and fly out of the ff to repair the simple armor of a droneand whats most annoying is the situation of shieldtankers and pvp you ever jumped into a onyx at your pos when everything has to move fast your shield ist about 14 there should be a simple pos modul or something to recharge that shield it couldnt be really true to refit the ship with shield booster and then start with an emty cap or wait for 2 hours until the shield recharged itself i get the fact that the shieldbonus that comes from your skills and implants just activates when you hop in to your ship but shieldrigs and shieldextenders are assembeld into that ship even when nobody is piloting it so why exactly is that shield bonus missing when i board the vesselthe really ridiculous part here is the fact that you dont have such problems when you undock from a staion4 corp bms nuff said
1 please allow us to change chars inside the same account without the need to login again2 add a a reminder popup window for calendar events with a configurable time from zero to 30 minutes in increments of 5m with a snooze and ack buttons the snooze will allow the window to popup more times until it reaches the time of the event and continue even after the event has started until the user acknowledges the reminder window also after we login the reminder window should popup for past events to show us what we have lost while logged out this way we can give a real use to the calendar because a calendar that doesnt remind me that i have an appointment coming up its not useful for me since i do not have it open all the time one after another the events just happen and you not even notice then until days later today i have to use my outlook calendar to plan for ctas and pi because i need the reminders and the game doest provide them3 please allow us to keep a collection of bookmarks in the cargo instead of independent unique bookmarks the idea is to allow us to export all our bookmarks to one only object and then load then in another char my biggest problem is that i want to share bookmarks between my alts and i have to export 500 bookmarks on sets of 5 to a cargo keep 500 bookmarks in the cargo that take forever to load bug trade them to my alt and then import and repeat this again and again and again for all my alts that is time consuming and annoying please lets us play the game like we want it allow us to select all export to cargo see only one object there collection of bookmarks object and them trade one object to my alt and import it to my bookmarks colection4 please save our overviews settings in the server side5 please allow us to stack items inside a pos or a carrier corporate hangers6 please allow us to open cans inside a pos or a carrier corporate hangers7 please allow us to see what items in the cargo of ship or hanger are damage by adding some visual symbol to the icons8 please allow us to see what drones present in the drone bay cargo of ship or hanger are damage in armor or structure by adding some visual symbol to the icons9 why when im opening a cyno and have the necessary fuel but separated in small amounts it doesnt allow me to open the cyno until i stack it please fix that10 why wait 30 seconds after i enter a fleet or change position inside one before im allowed to jump a gate or change a ship what is the logic if nothing comes up please fix that also11 in the inventory window the search doesnt look inside any of my cans so i still cannot find what im looking for can you fix this is very annoying12 very annoying to have to stop training before we jump to a clone i normally forget to start the training again and i loose days before i realize that im not training anymorethat is it for now bye thanks
tracking issues in a forum is not efficient nor it gives the user any feedback on what the devs are doing with our requests  suggestions i recommend using a specific tool for that a task tracking tool like redmine
wanted to write something similar it was a great idea to implement a calendar but it does not even provide the simplest features to make it useful show notifications for upcuming events after login like the ones for finished skills new mails etc do the same while ingame xmin separately configurable before an event with a notifcation or a clickable popup for afkers if you want not as default ofc advanced feat use this for stuff like pi timers or invention or whatever maybe a button in the pi interface to simply place an appointment in the calendar for the last cycle of the extractors nothing fancy though i would be happy to even get any notifications at all  activate toggle window for all windows that you can open from the taskbar not only for the fitting window its really hard to close them with these microscopic small x button ctrlw is an option but therefor the window needs to be in focus and a toggle could close the window even if its somewhere in the background make it possible to open also the tree of an item in the market window when clicking on the item category and not only the items overview maybe with ctrl pressed or a button i bet many people dont even know that you can click on the category because its just text same goes btw for drag and drop of the fitting from the fitting screens ship name and no its absolutely not obvious that the name is dragable o andor maybe add open market categoryhierarchy to the rightclick menu makes it much less clickintensive to find similar items in the market window make view market details also available in the compare items window fix announced next targets markers in the overview without making it necessary to switch tabs every view min to clean them up so they dont show up on wrecks or cans oh dinner time 
this is something thats bugged me for like  ever im sure others have issues with thisso i want to discuss losing skill points when forgetting to upgrade clonei am all in favour of a penalty if there needs to be one i dont think any other mmo does this however why should i lose a ton more skill points than someone with less skillpointsi recently lost cap ships 5  ouch  well i forgot to upgrade  why well because there were a big battle going on you die you quickly jump back in a ship to fight again forget to upgrade it happensfair enoughand please none of that well you wont forget again nonsense it wont be my first or last time and im sure its happens to tons of playersso ccp take the highest level 5 you have and remove itbut i lost 43 days just for not upgrading my clone seriouslyis this a joke again i dont mind penalties but 43 days is wrong very wrongnow if someone else with less skill points forgets to upgrade and say only has a low level 5  they lose probably a few daysis that fair really i dont think sopeople dont mind paying more for upgrading clones but getting severely punished for something minor just because because people have more sp is not rightpersonally i think it should be removed i dont see the purpose of it rather than just  people off
i personally think an automatically update my clone option would be a good addition to the game however i do not support the removal of the clone system in eve it gives choicesvalues to where you place your clone and is a good isk sink
the game keeps a log of what skills you trained and when they should remove trained skills chronologically starting with the most recently trained and going backwardsive never been in this situation so i dont know if thats the way its done or not if it is then its correct and should not be changedeve is a game of personal responsibility and consequences the skill point loss should remain for failing to maintain your clones  personal responsibility  personal consequences
thats your problemu believe sp maintenance is something minor and since its anything but thats what u get for neglecting it not because u had more sp but because u neglected to maintain that sp obviously u didnt value your sp enough to care
its your own fault for not updating the clone i mean its not as if you didnt notice that you got podded
its not some penalties but a punishment and i agree its absolutely stupidunless it makes another 15month subscription or another ragequit justified that oneloosing your shipimplants already hurts enough but the full skill training time is dumb so eves scientists are smart enough to make you jump in to another clone but too stupid to make the system autoupdate your personal data when you dockfair enough they cant make blastersrailsplatforms work properly so why would they be able to do thatto be perfectly honest there are more penalties than fun at the current state of the game then you have tards begging why people dont answer to ctas or do other things than grind missionsmaybe its some masochist game they have the right to have their fun too but from some normal point of view a lot of small stuff like that is completely stupid
 this and to add in my 2 cents having an automatic med clone thing would nullify the point in having a clone its there to set you back isk if you rush then thats your problem here is the very simple process that goes through ones mind when they get podded1 oops i got podded now i am back in station2 yay med clone updated3 yay in ship and undocking only 3 steps 
lol you guys are the best trolls1 you didnt even read the post before posting hence making you look dumber than forrest gump2 offer no real constructive feedback  obvious troll is obvious3 because of parts 1 and 2 your brain is unable to come out with anything even noteworthy of my attention simple troll response duh your fault4 trolls only troll for attention as they dont get any from anywhere elseso back to it shall wefirstly and this is for the trolls and people who cant readi never said there was an issue with penalties infact im sure i said the oppositeso you points there are completely invalid see above 14so lets reply to theseobviously not the sharpest pencil in the case are we maybe if you read my post properly you would of seen thisbut coming from veto corp who obviously has no clue about this stuff big fights and stuffyour opinion really means nothingsorryi think i just made my pointthis is more relevantperhaps you may understand also that when you doing you know pvp  i know this isnt somethig you have much experience in especially fights you cant always clone back to a med station as you usually have to get back in the fight asapupgrading a clone isnt always you first thingbut i think i said this alreadywhich you failed to readyour name fits you well so lets get back to itthe issue is why have such a massive hit for not upgrading your clone 43 days and i bet its been like alot more for some people is unfair it simply iseespecially when others with less skillpoints dont lose as manyso what we are saying is for my loyalty as a long term player paying years of subs and lots of training i should get penalised more reallyim already paying millions more just upgrade my clone but then i get a double whammy as well whilst lower skilled people dontmy reason for saying remove it was well is there really a half way solution perhapsi dont see the reason for this mechanic apart from annoying people what purpose does this serve penalising people for not upgrading a cloneyes you say its a game mechanic but why why is it even there now its probably because ccp thinks it will keep you in the game longer but to be honest im sure many people have left the game because this has happened infact i know they havethey spend daysweeks training only to have it taken away from a minor eventand yes it is minorno one has yet come up with a reason why its therejust coslets do an experiment thenand see if your thinking changesthis is for 30 mill  players go pod your self dont upgrade pod yourself again and when you lose your hard earned which you played and paid for level 5 then come back and say  your happy
hey look at it this way you will not need that alt to allow you to play and fly your titan if you can pod yourself to an alpha clone imagine how much you would be saving
1 and u ignore the post that clearly answers your question of why it seems so unfair to u guess what its notu just thought sp maintenance is a minor thing even though u knew full well what the consequences r if anyones that dumb its u2 look whos talking3 see 24 translation ure looking for attention by whiningoh of course u didnt say iture just crying so much about it this whole time derp u never had to jump back in and get podded againu did it because u were too stupid to check what u consider something minor and paid the consequences for it deal with itnews flash ure not entitled to an everlasting wowstyle easy mode just because u think uve reached vet status if u and whatever u call your longterm experience cant handle something this simple roll an altthey cant fly capital ships or have up to par armor tanks shield tanks guns missiles ewar fittings all of the above if u cant handle all those perks roll an alt then u can see what its like to be a powerless newb again and wonder why he shouldnt be punished as much as ubesides the above its to punish stupidity namely yours ure just mad because u got what was coming to u since theyre as stupid as u r they wouldve lost something else just as valuable eventually and still quitthere u go with the minor event again thats why u lost what u lostbecause u just dont careso u want ccp to prevent your losses for intentionally getting yourself killed just biomass after all its the same thing because either way u chose to let it happen
stopped reading at this point i think i found your problemtake your mistake like a man stop whiningi found out recently my clone was outdated howi check eachandevery day my sp counterhow to fix i go find a med bay pronto and update my clonewhat the hell is such a big dealproblem with doing such a simple taskthe only fixing here that needs doing is your memoryperhaps an auto switch but this system is working fine it penalizes absentminded pilots who think they know bettergives me an edge i like that
drake why are you so angry man the poor bastard is really having issues be cool dudehe was flipping out that once he was able to fly a titan he realized that he needed to have a second account to play the game now he lost valuable sps and time because he just realized that he had to update his character i am noticing a theme
holy  its holier than though troll drake  againdont you get tired of trolling assembly hall and the forums with your constant angry childish attitude really dont you i mean is there anything you do agree withor do you just enjoy being a douchei mean for example
wow baaldor  you got some real  i need attention issues or is drake your alti dunno you guys should like hook up and rewrite the game or somethingcos you opinion really matters to me and others ermmm ok perhaps not
i think the clone upgrade feature works perfectly well you just need to keep an eye on it and make sure to purchase and upgrade that has room to grow into what happened to the op sucks no doubt but its a well known part of the game and i just dont see why it needs to be changed
sounds like personal problem
i believe the phrase your looking for is u madoh and awesome to hear we have one less foolish supercap pilot thanks to his absent mindednesson second thought maybe it is a personal problemoh and hi to noir okeep those tears coming op keep those tears coming
yes i too am an attention and confirming drake is my nerd raging angry alt
a autoupdate to a preset level seems like a sensible idea it does seem odd that after selecting omegawhatevertron level clone it reverts to noobtron every time why not have it stay at omegatron if you select it once until you run out of iski understand that players should be able to mess with eachother that doesnt mean the game interface itself should be designed to be a diabolic as possible doesnt ccp want more people to playthough having clones in the game have a progressively higher cost for higher skillpoint characters 20 million for my main where as alts are a million or less so for more deployment or loss costs of the more skilled character it is still a good idea to have clones in game
u mean the  loads of your own 13 year old posts in this thread alone the difference is we didnt lose 40 days of sp like a dumbass u did and ure crying about your own stupidity
indeed it seems your lights are on but no one is homei did laugh though knowing youd lost that level 5 so thanks for that
supported conditionallywhat i support is a popup reminder saying warning you are about to undock while your medical clone is outofdate if your capsule is destroyed you will lose skillpoints are you sure you want to do thisi do not support any other change
1 you imply your time is valuable but clearly you have enough time to look up kbs and reply to people and argue that ccp needs to hold your hand for everything2 if you are a capital pilot then you should have half a brain to update clone all the time especially since you imply to be so ubergranted you are posting on an alt tough guy lol 3 why the hell would you change your med clone station to a station that doesnt have cloning services 4 when you grow up to the age past 15 youll start to learn your proprieties such as taking a second to do what you need to do then also realize its only a game 5 you forgot to upgrade your clone deal with it 6 see 17 see 28 see 39 see 411 see 1012 see 112as to why the med clone is there its so you keep an eye on your skills and cant repeatily die and respawn at whim if it updated automatically with a set charge then it means you could keep dieing and coming back and end up in negative money but still be able to go in deeper therefore it nullifies the point in buying a clone upgrade if you were to stop med clones when you reached 0 isk then people would undock anyways knowing they dont have the money and risk it and die and then make a huge pointless rant to ccp to change it and new people cant fly capitals so they cant lose the skill if they dont have it its kinda a scaling thing you supposdly have more skill then a newer person therefore that newer person may think its unfair that you have an advantage over them because you can fly a cap they can not please stop replying your parents need to limit your use on the keyboard and obviously have failed to instil any form of discipline in you for ranting endlessly about something so easy to avoid and then throw a temper tantrum over it
you also neglected to mention that he has a second anus on his forehead
lets face the truthalthough u may not like this system it is a core mechanic that ccp will not be getting rid of in the futuresecond something ok so e all watched the future vision vid a please pretty pretty please dont make eve have ground combat i did say lease b what happens if u are killed outside ure pod like on the vid in eve fiction u die permanetely
all i asked for was feedback constructive feedback i am well used to being disagreed with i didnt threaten to ban you i dont have the power nor the will too i threatened to report you through a feature that is available to every individual on this forum it is not a dictate to ask for civil discussion
forced vacation means banned
i have a few corpmates that can no longer afford to plex their accounts because of the anom nerf the truesec of tribute doesnt allow for any more sanctums than i can count on my hands they simply dont have the time to go make enough isk to support a plex and are considering leaving eve because they literally cant afford the opportunity cost that is now necessary for eve less people in 00 means less conflict if we dont have a crowding of null then there is no need for people to fight in order to gain space
sanctums especially because they are paid for by the owners of the system should be available just like level 4 missions are available to anyone in high security space nothing less nothing more having an alt in empire just to spin a couple of missions is a ed excuse for a game mechanic removing the easiest way to get to some quick pve content is not a way you develop your gameto ccp next time you decide to throw market and general pvp data to the lead economist and think about nerfing legitimate players income for the sake of a greater good please include statistics about how many bots were active in the observed period and calculate their impact on the global economy thank you
hi gentlemen my observation 00 got vastly depopulated in a very short timespan many are very angry at ccpmy own alliance we have found ways to adapt but we had to immediately write off xx bil isk of now unused and worthless upgrades and infrastructure which never paid for itself by nowi see a huge impact on classic renters becausereasons for and against renters in a powerblockspace renters do pay rent renters could increase fleet numbers but then they pay less rent eventually renters harvest space which would not be harvested and bring the same value otherwise renters do whine eg about the cloaky parking in system about unfriendly roamings  renters do cause trouble eg you need to deliver them logistics for ihubs large upgrades  renters tend to be illoyal and potential spies renters could create conflict of their own disturbing general business renters demand visible profit most renters were there for maximal profit with minimal riskshort a powerblock takes renters as long as the income generated by them is worth the troubleprenerfsituation was that most renters obviously were worth the troublepostnerfsituation is that most are no worth the trouble  not willing to pay the amount of rent to be worth the troublegone for good are renters which were only there for huge profits with minimal risk no ninjasalvagers no ganks a master you can whine at for even the slightest bit of trouble you should be able to handle yourselves my opinion many of them were just greedy parasitesgone for bad are small alliances who tried to get a foothold in 00 who tried to get at least some decent income so their members could afford more shiny and powerful ships as eg capitals factionships etc who would use those ships for conflict and pvp on their own or for their mastersin my alliance we have adapted you can optimize your ships for other kinds of anomalies still there in worst truesec so you may still get decent ticks you may revert to more mining and production away from nobrainsstupidshootingeasyisk to haveaplandosomethingwithbrainsisk if you dont want to pay the same rent as before be of some military value to your master be pet not renter do some dirty and mercenarystyle jobs for them get involved into their business and help them become part of them throw out some rebelling renters for them be the first line of defense to unfriendly neighborsto be honest the absolute main and disastrous problem for ccp is their total disregard of any kind of respect towards their customers and their total lack of decent communication and reasoningin consequence people do overreact in anger instead of adapting and i expect some percentage to be done with eve for a whileccp could have done better publicly discuss the changes in advance give more time to prepare so all investitions could have been written off be more honest about the real changes devblog is in part outright lying at ccp customers rebalance just bountyloot first if changes were urgent to reduce iskinflationi am of the opinion that this changes especially the accompagnying lack of competent communications with their customerbase has lost them credibility and i bet that it will cost them dearly in cancelled subscriptions and reduced overall growth
i take it you have added this suggestion to the industrialization thread would fit nicely in a revamp of null industry as a supplement to miningthen again it would need some tweaks as the hauling required just for current hauler spawns is almost as tedious as mining itself  perhaps special versions of scrap metal most hated drop in eve that give very high yields in reprocfreeloaders are prone to anger when their ride comes to an end nothing new there would have had the exact same response with a bountyloot nerf instead as the end result is similarit was announced what 34 weeks prior to the change going through ample time to start cooking the books to balance the loss of income in the short term
im not in any kind of high position in my corp or alliance so i have no feedback from the bosses about changes to corp revenue but for many of the grunts this has removed some of their capability to reship quickly and expand personal assests this affects new 00 players much more than those out there for 6 months or more before the changes this also hits the people with little time to play quite hard as there is more competition than before for the bounty sites to spam for an hour or two before logging offour leadership do a very good reimbursement program and when coupled with insurance our players dont loose much isk to a ship loss but processing claims can take time a new nullsec player thats lost a few ships quickly might end up very poor very fast reimbursement on the way doesnt help if i cant reship now and get back into the fun and not every corp is as cool as ours about this some of us have multiple characters to speed up isk making many however dont and its these guys that feel the pinch the vaunted push button  recieve bacon at fanfest has slipped up on the greasy kitchen floor one of the principal reasons for the change stated was to allow small aliances more access to 00 when in fact this change makes it an awful lot harder for the new guys coming out to fund their operations facepalma final point is i now have no idea what level 5 military upgrade actually does aside from fill up some dots on a bar answers on a postcardalternatives are there of course  extra plex types and mining can be viable for those with the right skills in place and if the situation stays as is we will of course adapt as a large corp in a large alliance we have the flexability to do this smaller and newer guys will to repeat my point earlier suffer this the most 
pre nerf i ran sanctums and havens exclusively and even during crowded hours could run them almost consecutively at times only having to jump to another system to find one that was open it was quite easy for me to make 3035 mil in a half hour barring the random hostile that would run through the area this actually led to a great deal of fun in the form of impromptu home defense fleets after the change i was shocked at the number of havens in extremely low truesec systems it wasnt so bad during non peak hours but at peak times said systems were full to the brim and it was impossible to find an open haven or sanctum before the change i would have just gone next door or a few down into an out of the way system but its no longer an option now since those systems are below the threshold for even havens to spawnfrom what ive seen those out of the way or pipeline systems that formerly had people running anoms are now desolate and lifeless i actually transferred money back to my old highsec alt to buy a tengu and blitz l4s since its guaranteed sustainable and really quite good income compared to jumping clear across a region just to find one of the few systems with open havens and sanctums since the change ive actually made substantially more isk from pi than i have from running nulsec anoms not because pi is fantastic but because im usually on my highsec alt when i need to make some isk this has the unfortunate consequence of robbing the corp and alliance of tax revenue if i may the change in itself was not a terrible idea however the issue arises from the average truesec threshold that was chosen to spawn havens and sanctums the result renders a vast majority of nulsec systems to be trash for those that want to run anoms for their isk a possible solution could be to reevaluate the threshold for high value anoms andor to cause them to spawn in a given constellation based on a constellation average truesec rather than the truesec of the individual system additionally the riskreward could be looked at again to more accurately reflect their rarityone additional statement as i understand it the reason given for the change was to break the perceived stability in nulsec and give different empires a reason to invade and conquer better space outside of access to better moons or just better truesec systems unfortunately in the current state of the game no one is going to launch an alliance or coalition wide invasion of a region just because they want to run sanctums the anoms are if you will an additional reward for controlling space and not the primary reason in other mmos when you raid you raid for the big ticket items in eve this would equate to controlling the high end moons and the space itself the anoms are essentially the lesser items that drop along the way to the boss and the big ticket loot yes theyre nice to have but at the same time they arent worth raiding for on their own in fact they arent even a determining factor in whether to raid what im trying to get at i guess is that from where i sit it seems havens and sanctums are not nearly relevant enough from an alliance perspective to prompt the massive military and logistical commitment involved in taking over and defending a system constellation or region from another established power
you talk of blitzing for lp being a guaranteed sustainable income and demonstrate that you fail to understand one of the reasons why anoms were hit so hard yet l4 missions werentsince youre blitzing the majority of your income is now coming from selling items to the market rather than putting your cup under a pure isk faucet also you should be aware that as more people run missions the value of the lp will reduce due to competition to sell the items that you receive so the market will to an extent balance the income differences between l4s and anoms making those anoms appear more valuable than they do at this timeas a result of this the anomaly nerf is also an l4 mission nerf that many have been crying for also i see as a result youve started putting more effort into pi as will many others now this is a good thing as it will also feed into the market reducing not only the prices of pi goods but also goods that rely on pi products eg pos running costs  cheaper drugs and t2 components  modsthe reality of this is that you wont be able to afford every shiny ship you ever wanted by repeating a brainless activity ad infinitum but instead these treats will still be available to those who use their brains and adapt
which still makes more isk then 00 just not in terms of printed iskeveryone of us doesnt give a  where isk comes from as long as we get it for being in 00 i wouldnt mind if all bounties were changed to lp at least we can still rati totally agree that the isk faucets needed to be nerfed but they should have made some sort of new lp system instead of making 90 of 00 worse for isk making compared to highsec
you did read the bit about lp coversion income being dramatically reducedthe lp conversion on in eams has already halvedyoure post basically demand easy access to lots and lots of isk and then makes up some random figures about hisec l4s to justify why you should be allowed to rat your way to an sc without engaging your brainthe reality is that getting rich in eve is achieved by getting involved with the market
it means probation
the free market is incredibly resilient when the profit of one lp item drops people will shift to another the constant hunger for faction ammo makes it possibly the most sustainable of all lp items but it too is subject to ups and downs people will adapt to market changes this is the core principle that ensures blitzing level 4s remains profitablethere is additionally a disconnect between what people want and expect between hisec and nulsec i am personally in the camp of nulsec should be risky but profitable at least more profitable than hisec the issue is with adaptation hisec is a never ending faucet of profiti do not disagree that a change had to be made what i do disagree with is the severity and how it was made despite ccp touting eve as a social networking tool this change seems to endorse a playstyle of use anonymous npc hisec alts for your money making then jump back to your nulsec pvp main its not terrible for fountain deklein or generally any residents in a region with some good truesec systems i just ran some havens tonight because the system was nearly empty the change seems to harm small alliances that may have to settle for terrible space if anything it seems to endorse a nulsec powerbloc napfest fear is one of the most powerful emotions we have in this case the fear of losing what decent space a group may have trumps a desire to attempt to upgrade to slightly better space
lp  redistribution of isk bounties  printing of iskformer will balance itself as it were in due time latter leads to ever increasing priceshighsec mission lp will probably end up around 500750lp once the dust settles was around that level immediately prior to infiniteisk patch aka dominion and with the promised dynamic agent quality the overall lp intake will drop as well  or getting involved with someone involved in the market  and then robbing them blind
this i really dont see why it couldnt just be modules which would have to be sold to convert it into isk it would solve the isk printing malarkey vovdisclaimer i dont rat because i find it mindboggingly boring ive better avenues for getting iskedit and it would make it slightly more of a chore to actually get isk from bots it would make it easier to grief people by salvaging their anomsmissions and it would drive up the demand for the noctis
if there is more lp in circulation then the value of that lp is worth less
prenerf 2sanctums 2 heavens each system worked fineafternerf weve kinda lucked out on it due to having 3 systems with security class 7 08 to 10 our best the 10 has 3 sanctums 67 havens same applys to the 092 and 08 but out 073 has only 1 sanctum and 4 heavens and i for one concider 073 fairly high so i dunno what ccp was thinking with this the other problem this change has brougth along our good systems are now being perma campt by afk cloakers in my opinion ccp shoudnt have rolled out this terrible patch without also patching afk cloaking way to gomy2cent im not asking them to make it like it was before but atleast patch it to a level where it makes sense instad of binding the number of annos to the sec status why not bind annomaly bountys to the sec status that would make space different and ppl would still be able to make a living in zero space and maybe you get a bonus sanctumheaven if system has a station or something like that of if you hold const sov something along the way
unfortunately this is part of the problem why go find a decentquiet ratting system when you can sit in empire and spam level 4s why have the hassle of constantly watching your scanner andor local when you can mindlessly spam level 4sthe trouble is that level 4s are reliable and uncompetitive you dont have you battle against corp mates or alliance members to be the first to logon on get into the beltsanoms no matter how many people missioning the agents just keep doling out the missions
unless youre making isk off lps then baseline income from l4s is pretty poor once you get into lps it gets very competitive loot and salvage is also competitive and subject to disruption by other playersthis thread is going exactly the same way as the last one lots of players who were used to an endless sources of easy isk are only prepared to move onto another source of easy isk not even realising that the grass theyre heading for is about to get massively over grazed because is it does matter how many people do missions sadly figuring this out requires a brain and those whining here havent had to use theirs for too long
oh this is very true i personally didnt get involved with lp or salvage when i was running level 4s and as such would make around 100mill a day if the rng was kind to me but youre right for the more hardcore mission runners i guess there was alot competition over selling goods now living down in a nullsec pipe system making the iskies is alot more problematic alot of through traffic and not many anoms in npc space lots of shooting and getting shot at though which is fun
so you agree with this change level 4 combat agents are spread out though not to the point where they are rare and the quality varies widely
because of this overly ed change now my corp has moved back to empire thanks a lot ccp hope this is what you wanted giving in to the cry babies once again
simply fact is that now the old bad 00  witch bevore upgrades nobody wants is bad again not as bad but still bad while old good one 08 and down is even bedder ok that there need to be a divrence i understand but such a so old richt systems even ged richer and the upgrate system is nonsense now only produce coasts in bad systems so i only see 3 points to change first i understand ccp afford to make the true sec more important again and by this reducing the gained money in 00 a littel fact is 00 was in compare to emp to rich clearly it must give more money because of risks but this was too much so what can we do1 make the sanctumswitch are the highest spawn down from every system witch has 02 03 or so must be discussed to lower with 1 more every 02 less securety so a 02 has 1 2 havens 3 to 4 hubs and small rubish a 04 gets 2 witch 3 haven etc always make haven second incoming rate 1 more thant sanctum hub witch is also ok make 1 or 2 more than haven so a 1 would have a total number of 4 sanctums clearly more than rest but still ok and the gap is not so big like now 02 0 sanctums 1 like 8 wtf and also second make the payout of the pirates more depended on the true sec now i only see while chaining like it makes 500k less max bounty do more there in 02 it would be ok if a howle sanktum only gives 18 to 20 million isk in 1 30 to 35second optionmake everything like bevore 4 everywhere but change even more massive the outcoming like in 00 its only 15 in 1 its 35 to 40 third withc i like most because it would even push mining better even as i do not minechange regions so every region has at least 2 to 4 1 3 to 5 09 57 08 etc so even close areas get bedder clearly this again will lead into all want this but ok you cane mike it depend a littel on the range to high sec like a area like peroid basis where you have to fly thorugh at least 2 other to get into emp gets a factor withc increases the number of total 1 systems by 15 or so and allwys its only a  of total systems in area witch are so so we still have diverences but will have not the problem like now tribute has only 12 systems witch sancutms left and also with very vew and tenal has like 40 to 50 and over 12 witch are bedder than all tribut once
to everyone freaking out about the change you must realize that this needed to happen ccp changed something they thought would work turns out it injected isk into eve faster than a hooker with a turkey baster ccp noticed this and pulled the plug to a certain degreewith that said however this solution is not ideal without some form of making 00 more selfsustainable there is a reason 425s get shipped into 00 in a jump freighter in order to build supercaps while i applaud the eve community on this innovative workaround to the logistical nightmare of very large build orders the industrial worthaspect of systems should be looked at as wellim not going to give my own anecdotes pastpresent involving the changenerf because i dont believe them to be a valuable metric on figuring out whether or not this was a good change in the end look at the numbers the faucet was opened hard and gigantic injections of isk into the system is a bad thing i repeat a very bad thingthe discussion of whether or not more money can be made doing lvl 4s also needs to be thrown out of the discussion lvl 4 missions are fine because while the individual players are making more money potentially lps are a sink lvl 4 missions do not inject a disproportionate amount of isk directly into the system they just serve to funnel isk into different areas also with more players running to the hills to do missions in highsec this should mean less players in null running anomalies and a deflated value for lps making them even less profitable win winhowever back to the industrial aspect of the systems i think that drop rates for items looted from wrecks should be increased and bounties should be decreased more salvaging more looting and melting and less mindless faucet industrial activities are another way of funneling isk to different places rather than injecting it into the economy make mining tritanium in nullsec worth a damn create more sites with the abc oreson the flip side as well nerf highsec a bit make it less profitable to afkbot mine reduce incomes from lvl 4s a tad stuff like that a slight boost to 00 and a slight nerf to highsec might make 00 look a bit better than grinding missions just to buy a plex just to play the gameps at csm it looks bad when you try and encourage a discussion about the proscons of this change when you color the dialog right from the start by suggesting that you have already taken a position on the subject im not trying to imply that you have improperly moderated this thread tried to keep it on topic by bullying people into giving you the answers you want to hear coming at the subject with the idea that by virtue of there being billions of people screaming that this is a bad idea automatically makes it a bad idea is a proclivity im not sure you can afford as my understanding goes you are the voice of the playerbase but this does not always mean that you should mindlessly heed what they clamor for if a thread went up from players asking for officers to spawn in every single system nonstop and literally every single player in eve gave it the olethumbsup it would still not be good for eve
thats probably because you were running lvl 4s for minmatar back in the day sure lp value is a scarcity thing however i honestly didnt get into running anoms much and continued doing lvl 4s like usual on alts because i can run those while doing other stuff unlike anoms everyone went back to the way they had been doing things before the complaint is how ccp handled this it hurt almost entirely the smallernewer corpsalliances and was nothing more than a temporary boost for players in bigold corpsalliances because the older guys already had assets in place to take advantage of this moreover they also hold good space so they are still benefiting from this change this accounts for a good chunk of the nc and the goons the smaller guys invested in assets based on the mechanics as they were only to get what amounted to a sucker punch with the nerf bat that is the complaint
so youre claiming semi afk single boxed missions without blitzing are good isk belt ratting is far better isk than that after some chainingive done both going for bounties  for decent income you need to dual box and salvage  and blitzing for lp  very low ticks  blitzing has been the most profitable though i dumped all my lp moved into manufacturing when the nerf was announced as it was predictable that the lp market was going to crash as it has started to
this made me sad  its exactly the kinda thing that ccp fails to see and shoud most definatly be brought to their attention if they want people to get out to 00 and get involved in real alliances they need to make it possible for new players to have stuff to do nerfing anoms very badly has made it so theres much less stuff for them to do
i have 5 boxes and it seemed to me like the lp stuff started coming down in value almost immediately after the dev blog about anoms
this entirely for me the change isnt bad at all but i had the resources and skillpoints to move around and get into different areas to make isk depending on how the market winds blow newer players and small alliances arent nearly so lucky and as i said previously this change essentially says gtfo of nulsec unless youre part of a massive power bloc and have the resources to actually hold good space
im going to make a very basic reply and i belive i can speak for a good majority of 00 pvpersthe amoms funded pvpless amoms  alot more grind or moving out of null sec to high sec and overall  less pvpcsm can you please educate ccp please srlsy because at the end of the day its not all about having a slightly better economy its about a game and the game is here for fun not to be a massive grind fest which this game is turning more and more into and this is just the tip of the ice berg because game is sooooo broken and we only play this game because there is nothing else like it in the world and ccp abuse this big time and most of us dont even see it
does it really though id be interested how much newer players can make in a bc in the non sanctum  havenspersonally started out my null sec life belt ratting in a harbinger in npc space we had plenty of visitors who wed trap in the pocket and kill whenever possible to encourage them not to come back or linger too longif id of had anoms available id have made more but i never had problems replacing ships especially since id run those drone anoms that no one else wanted collect the mins and build my own bcs and when i got lucky and got a hauler spawn id store those up to have enough to build my own bspersonally i think something has been lost due to players expecting their cash ticks that they then spend on goods imported from jita
i think you have a good point here while i think the anom nerf was poorly handled i think the raw imput of isk into the economy was a bad thing i used to semiafk rat on an alt in a 007 system and made 30m iskhr while pvping on my main i didnt have to compete much for anoms and when i did lose the occasional dominix it was cheap to replace now i rat for 15mhr or mission for 10mhr  lootlp i think the original dominion upgrades where poorly thought out and should have focused on improving spaces industrious activities mining and building scales much better allowing for greater system population more people in a system its easier for them to ship up and fight
since were opining on his post tbqfh i was killing 800k18m triple bs spawns in 00 in a vexor with 35m sp he doesnt have to have this  spoon fed to him just go ing do itlianged i should point out that the bc spawns were mother ing evil and i couldnt do those until i had maybe 5m sp and upgraded to a myrm i should also say that this was in serpentis and guristas space amusingly enough right where test lives now
60mhr prenerf juicy battleships12mhr postnerf crappy elite frigs and cruiserssome regions have no sanctums and even some have little to no havens there is less good stuff to go around and its usually taken by someone else or even camped by bad guys im not interested in paying for a 2nd account l4 mission slave so i can fund my character in null before i could spend 20mins and easily afford a cruiseraf and now i have to spend an hour to afford the same thing i dont have tons of time to play so when you lose a ship it hurts a lot more people who live in good true sec regions dont feel the nerf as much compared to other regions with garbage true sec
the anomaly nerf is exactly what was needed it is doing exactly what it was meant to do on two fronts first and foremost it is causing some destabilization in the power blocks alliances that were nothing but buffers and cannon fodder are moving back to high sec telling those who they were paying rent to  off and looking with greedy eyes at different space and you can already see on various forums the friction and fighting going on over sanctums and havens secondly it helps slow down the isk facet that was just full blown rocketing into the gameit is true new players are not making the 100 million isk an hour like before in every system in null sec players are having to put forth effort into finding other income to make up for the change those who are putting forth said effort are still making very good isk those who cant adapt and still expect unlimited ship funds and to be able to dine on nonstop isk no matter what have left for high sec where it is easierbottom line is the money is there and the change has separated the ones with initiative from those who are lazy all in all a very good change to the game this game needs more changes like these to create more conflict after all this is a game about blowing up internet spaceships not everyone sitting around a camp fire singing kum ba yah and trading kitchen recipes
careful there if white tree sees this post which does not agree with the nc leadership he will have a moderator delete it remember new players should be able to go straight to null sec and be able to get in motherships in a couple months now you better take what you said back
and if theres more isk in circulation isk will be worth less rat bounties are fixed and not adjusted for inflation so anoms become less desirable the more they are runwow its almost as if eve has a free market or something
whatdo you have any idea how many corporations are affected by grief wars think of the amount of petitions for that category alonewar declarations need to be reformedotherwise the game should have the tag line eve online  everybodys an join now
make em cost 1m per member in both the target and your own corp same for alliancesay a corp with 300 people decks a corp with 20 people the total cost to start the war is 320000000 alliance a with 3250 members decks alliance b with 2521 members makes the total cost to start a war by 5771000000promotes actual corp growth too
i like that idea though the obvious flaw would be that members would be forced to enter their alts maybe not even used but i support the topics op it is to easy for a deccing corp to have fun there is imo no balance for a corp who dont want to have a wardec cant afford to hire mercs or is to small their gameplay suffers in favour of the deccing corp there should be at least a way that an alliance could pay concord not to accept a wardec for a period of time maybe with the same approach guilliman r uses an alliance has 100 members concord protection is 100000000 that would be 52 billion a year to balance it one could say you can pay only for 26 weeks a year
being decced for two to three weeks doesnt constitute griefingbeing permanently decced by the same people no matter what corp you are in all the time is
do you actually have any real data to support the many corps affected or are you are making over reaching statements based on nerd rageyes welcome to eve
the cost of war decs can be very expensive all depends on who you war dec how many wars active blah blahi think to make low sec better they should make wars active only in low sec
cool then make all space losec and null sec
1 but dont think its enough boost to traking needed also
first off a few introductory wordsthis is the reincarnation of a proposal i made over a year ago which like most of the feedback on the new forums got completely ignored by ccpwhy are better forum tools needed for ahassembly hall is the only formal venue there is for players to raise issues to the csm there are other means of contacting them but the forum offers the distinct advantage of allowing raising and discussing proposals in a public timeindependent and selfdocumenting fashiondespite their importance the ah forums suffer from a series of deficiencies offering few features to aid in the process of raising proposals voting and finally managing them and their interaction with the csm and eventually ccpa summary of existing problems with ah proposals arent categorized in any form while the issues raised range from the art department to game balance to technical problems to metaproposals like this one similar proposals cant be grouped  duplicate proposals arent avoided you cant give a negative vote you have to not vote to disapprove as a consequence people that post multiple times wrongly lower the approval rating of the proposal pretty much only proposals on the front page get attention so people resort to bumping thereby displacing other potentially good proposals since the csm has a limited capacity to raise proposalsissues even proposals with excellent approval get buriedforgotten given enough time once csm picked up an issue the proposals cant be tagged as having been raised and they cant be linked to the csm wiki the same applies after the issue has been approvedrejected by ccpto improve these issues we propose the following additions when creating proposals offer a selection of main categories additionally allow adding search tags allow searchingfiltering the forum by number of votesapproval ratingcategorytags a tag cloud would be interesting too allow voting for or against a proposal or to abstain you could even make it more granular like conditionaltentatively support on the thread overview show the number of votes that is not the number of posts  the current approval rating link your vote to a proposal not to a specific post of yours so you can easily change your vote if you change your mind without having to search for the post in question to edit it allow csm members to link a proposal thread to raised issues on the wiki possibly give csm members limited mod powers to organize categorize tag merge etc ah threads structure the proposal text input for example 1 situation  condition 2 issue  problem 3 action  solution stop locking threads after 90 days of inactivity an idea doesnt necessarily get worse over time and since when does ccp react in under 3 months allow only one vote per account per threadid like to get as much support and input as possible for this proposal it benefits all players active in ah and the csm i will update the lists above as necessary

yes kinda thought this was what we were going to be getting with the new and improved forums instead we got bigger portraits the ability to like individual posts for no meaningful result and the ability to post as anyone we want apparently oops
mynas you sir are a genius
lol when used for quick intraregion travel jbs seem tactically awesomereasonable when used for quick interregion travel jbs seem strategically op and unreasonable
ok well im not going to reply to that e troll that goon guy posted but its good to see some people taking it seriously and recognising that jump bridges in their current format need to change how about moving jump bridges off poss so it still allows for fast travel and the tactical advantage of jumping around gangs but makes people vulnerably againi realise the majority of people in sov holding alliances will be totally against this because they like having their totally safe way of travel and are opposed to being shot
we took the threat seriously thats why we voted in the current csm we dont take these suggestions seriously though sorry
notice everyone opposed to jb removal is in the nc how curious jb as they are only serve to ruin pvp via disuse of gates and rapid forming of blobssupported
notice everyone in favor of it fly elite wulfpax how curious
pretty sure drone regions coalition isnt in the nc nor is the goon cluster nor are the alliances in the south however you will notice that sov holding alliance members in general support this because they actually want to get something useful out of all the isk time and effort they put into obtaining and holding sovfurther im starting to notice the characters complaining about the existence of bridges seem to be in large part alts if you feel the need to bring out your alts to strengthen your position then you already realize you hold an extreme minority opinion
im not in the nc and wouldnt like them removed or even nerfed to heavily  people would switch to titan bridging as the norm to compensate however a bit of tweaking could make the nullsec landscape more interesting or in erspeak dynamictie jbs to planets have dust mercs able to mess with them in some wayhave them limited to one or two specific planet types such as ice oceanic storm something relatively uncommon many systems cant have a single jb a bunch have one where youd want a neighbouring system to also have one a rare precious few have two or more and become shiny places i saw one 00 system with 4 ice planets browsing quickly a few with 3 this will differentiate space more separately from truesec or moons particularly empire entrances  for example in provi kbp has an ice ymp does not while with oceanic the reverse is true a change like this introduces some more scope for conflict and new targets during invasion but doesnt force it on the sandboxjb interdiction would be a bit easier in that a wide range of gang makeups could do it effectively rather than a select few but the networks arent exactly 100 safe currently so no gamechanger if anything 3 and 4 bridge systems may become well populated guarded and saferi also like the suggestion of planet characteristics having an effect rather than just planet type its a bit more opaque though and possibly harder to code  are they anything other than superficial values codewise alternatively different planettypes could have different effects on the jb such as reduced fuel usage from plasma pairs increased range on ice pairs ocean jbs being able to transport supercapitals but having a cooldown or something however without restricting alliances to picking and choosing one of such types youd get wide proliferation again perhaps racial jb variants could do the same tricktldr jump bridges can be changed to make the game more interesting but outright nerfbatting or removing wouldnt solve anything
i wasnt trolling  i was absolutely serious you consider the biggest advantage the territorial powers have to be their invulnerable jump bridge networks though you seemingly ignor the likes of burn eden who simply destroy jump bridges at will when they are inconvenient to them and to drive conflict we consider the biggest advantage the pirate alliances have to be their invulnerable npc stations we are looking for some give and take here you nerf our abilities permanently  we are looking to be able to nerf yours temporarily on the few days a year we are organized enough to bring the fight to you the mechanics compromise was serious too  pick a number of bridges from empire to the furthest reaches of space and we have something to talk about  compromise by giving us the ability to take unused pirate sov constellations to fill in the gaps and well be more than happy to discuss it the art of negotiation is greatly enhanced by putting yourself in the other sides shoes and looking for what they would settle forif you are not trolling ignore the likes of white tree and engage with us if you are trolling then he is right about you you say move the bridges off pos definitely not going to reject that out of hand  trade it off for  say  cloaks using fuel and balanced against ship class and ship mass and you could probably have a agreement on that in minutes
i like this guy he brings up some good pointsand i agree if people want it nerfed then have it at some kind of compromise if you are too damn lazy to make the effort then dont have ccp cater to your laziness get some ships and blow the jb up as for pos bashing being boring well too bad its the same way its been since the start dreads already have such little use now its pathetic as for why the jbs should stay like mynas was saying you want to nerf sov alliances yet do nothing to alliancescorps that stay in npc space there has to be some benefit in being in a sov alliance ccp already killed 70 of desired null space get rid of jbs and there will be no point in claiming sov then there wouldnt be any need for capitals because no one would be fighting over systems you just want to keep on killing null for your own damn benefit and not thinking about it for everyone else
i would think the trade off should be related to the mechanic under review so including a discussion of cloaks in general is meh potential tradeoffsjb gate cloak when loading grid on the other side of a jb you get a 3060s cloak as well as a jb activation effect although im not sure this is easily programmed increased jb hp w perhaps a reinforce mode to allow saving decreased jb fuel useincreased fuel capacity the reason i keep linking them to the ihub is that the ihub is an alliancecorp asset that could easily be retrofitted with a fuel bay and they already have a configuration screen that could be updated for inclusion of jb operations your ideas on incapping services at npc stations is worth of discussion but not applicable to this thread same goes for multiple outpostssystem reducing npc space and the like 1015 including gate travel which i think it roughly is atm i would prefer it if jbs range wouldnt allow interregion travel which is currently the case often
i think you missed the subtle point that it wouldnt even be newsworthy coughnprcough npr has over 20 million listeners a week also if news organizations like cnn and the new york times are running articles on their front page about a man who is only drinking beer for lent or how much jlos buttocks is insured for im not really sure theres much room for you to speculate what would and wouldnt be newsworthypeace peacei hate the wordas i hate hell all montagues and thee and there are his dying words to consider a curse on both your houses its funny that you would quote from a play which ends with the two houses coming together and vowing a lasting peace once they have a full understanding of the situation they are able to put the past behind them  the true cost of war has finally been revieled to them and the price they have paid in blood was a steep oneeve onlines 24 hour peace rally was undermined yesterday as a coalition of x y and z alliances moved significant invasion forces under the cover of a universewide ceasefire when the ceasefire ended the epic clash of forces promised to be the most destructive battle in the history of eve had the node not crashed and i would probably be in one of those fleets dropping cynos alpha striking you and screaming gud fite in local people playing the game would not undermine the gesture or cheapen the message it could be amazing publicity for a game which most of us feel ranks far above the rest it could be a fluff piece on npr at 3am it could be the most boring day of eve since the servers were down for two days we could also make sure the world knows were doing it make it a big deal the squeeky wheel gets the oil and as long as were playing with hypothetical speculative situations26 weeks later the server population of eve online has grown significantly since their ingame demonstration of peace caught the eyes of people world wide blah blah blah rest of article ccp creators of eve online have commented that with the massive increase in subscriptions and therefor revenue they hope to expand their developmental team upgrade hardware and continue to find ways to reduce latency issuesyoure arguements are well thought out but based on false assumptions in the end we as humans are animals human children exhibit the same characteristics as puppies and kittens that is not just by chance in the beginning we were animals in the end meaning the end of humanity well have been one of few if not the only creatures in our galaxy to become self aware create culture and art and look beyond ourselves im not sure what characteristics youre referring to  puppies kittens and babies are all very cute and make me go awww im sure you mean to suggest that human children exhibit the same selfpreserving animalistic characteristics i agree they do but theyre also not the ones in charge when they gauge the intelligence of another animal scientist will remark that xanimal has the cognitive ability of a human toddler 1023 months old now flip it around  human toddlers have the cognitive ability of an animal that eats its own poop and pees itself when you turn on the vacuum compared to most other mammals a human babys brain is greatly underdeveloped at birth both in a cognitive sense and in reference to motor skills  but the fact is that it will develop beyond that stage unlike our furrier friends
i dont know about you guys but i play this game so i dont have to kill people in real life also i thought this guy was hardcore trolling until i saw how much time he as actually put into this thread forum warrior ftw changing pirates into carebears one by one through the power of hugs by day selfrightous grammar i by night
to attain the peace that you want you need to eliminate the drive to better yourself in all humans around the world because there is always a winner and a loser conflictcompetition of all people would have to be stopped and the status quo enforced rigorously i dont know about you but that is a world i dont want to live in id rather go to war than promote a world where nothing changes humans have been at war their entire existance we already live in your nightmare where nothing changes the way i read your comment suggest to me that you think that bettering yourself is done by squashing other people under your boot conflict and competition will always be and there will always be plenty of forums for them case in point the very game which has brought us all together id just rather those forums of conflict and competition not be the streets and playgrounds of our neighborhoods or anyone elses but i digress the point is 24 hours of peace in game to show the world that we can cooperate and coexist im not so naive that i think everyone around the world will drop their weapons and start singing kumbaya because we didnt pop each other for a day when people host demonstrations its to bring awareness not because they think theyre going to change the entire world in a dayyou seem the philosophical type read into bhuddist and taoists texts they both promote peace but they also understand that a balance must occur they accept war but do not promote it i suggest you do the same i have read some and i also love traditional japanese history and culture as well as samurai ideology  which adopted many of buddhas teachings in bhuddism it is not so much that a balance must occur as people must realize that suffering exists all around us and that there will always be suffering so long as we crave for things i realize you can apply that to my craving for a more peaceful world but it also means no more craving your neighbors lawn mower or your brothers wife or your boss lake side house the idea is that by only taking and using what you need to survive there will be less suffereing in the world people will be happier because they wont always been in a state of wanting which cannot be fulfilled i accept war as a part of our existance but it is my personal feeling that if i did not try to change it i would be promoting itit is not all war which i am opposed to perhaps it would be better phrased as senseless conflicts which perpetuate hatred violence bigotry and inequality i support the soldiers who fight to erraticate these things to stablize regions which have fallen into disarry because stability is required to progress
1 news flash there is peace even in this pvp game the peace between players who r too scared to fight one another if even the slightest risk is involved and so they blue each other and only settle for newbies and other easy ganks theres peace between players and each others alts between players in blobs between corps in alliances and even between alliances in coalitions2 u just want a different degree of peace and ure intolerant of anything less since u somehow still call the constant blueing that is eve warmongering whats next ure gonna complain about killing rats because theyre just as artificial as the player characters who kill them3 u really want a wow clone go back to wow and roll on a pve server be warned players still kill npcs there so maybe that games not for u eitheror any game that has any degree of conflict whatsoever4 better yet step away from the screennotice your artificial part yeah its all makebelieve u want to make the world a better place start with the world not in one individual makebelieve space game
eve is real though right
supported  hating this fittings thing cant save or access any fittings even clearing my fittings out and resetting settings clearing cache you name it it still does not work
mittani said in one of his posts on fhc that players have two basic opinions of ccp ccp is incompetent and ccp ignores old features shc vets will know this as lolccp and awesomeyou can fix a lot of stuff but its hard to cure sloth and basic incompetence
i have always felt i was rather aggressive with my ship fittings but never exceeded thirty or so after i lost mine twice to patches i got the message that using full fits is suboptimal while identifying common bits and excluding others allows for one template to be used for a whole range of fits  also works well when specific stocks run out or i want to change riggingsccp is under no obligation to run every little thing through sisi or the forums and i can easily see how an arbitrary limit of 50 could seem sufficientbesides software job security hinges on intentionally creating issues that requires additional hours to sort out
i no longer have ship fittings for polaris wraith exotic dancer and cattleaside from that im having fun messing with my caldari mission runner friends rapidly dropping iskhour rate that they bragged so much about now they have to work up another faction or deal with being jammed fifteen minutes out of twenty and fighting the rest of the fiveno really that whole group was smug scumbags
you live in the land where a seller can change a product to the detriment of the buyer and not expect anger from the buyer
nope but since it is mainly cosmetic a complaint merely means that seller must take appropriate steps to rectify situation within an acceptable time framedoes not mean that i automatically get the right to participate in sellers rd efforts or get to influence product strategiesconsumer law is gospel here in the eu d
unerf itmoving back to hisec is the better option for our small casual 14 man corp than trying to live in trusec anymorei hope there are changes on the cards for currently its looking very bleak
well space should have different value on that i agree with ccp but the way they have gone about it is just wrongso instad just flaming them to take it back etc here a sugguestion as to how to change iteach system with military 5 gets 2 havens 1 sanctum baseshould the system have a station 1 haven 1 sanctumand now the catch bountys in anomalies will depend on sec status right now for the most part lowest bountybs in sanctum is 9xxk max 12m  so this would mean that in 000 to 02 you get max bounty bs of about 600k to 950k 0304 800k to 125m 0506 950k to 14m 0708 11m to 16m 0910 12m to 18mthis would be a boost instad of a nerf but it would still make space different
un nerfplease dont make huge changes like this without consulting someone it seems like no thought was given and changes were made
yes this pleaseand on the note of bug reports they need to be followed up better as a recent example i opened a report about the character creator crashing my os in the first few days i received a few responses asking me for log info and other data i provided all that was needed and i havent heard back since its been in since 48 its frustrating that a major bug like this isnt getting more attention before the patch the creator worked just fine for meafter the most recent patch its brokenim sure i cant be the only one
hating this idea with the white hot heat of a million suns much as it was flamed the first time something like this was suggestedwhat was it two threads each with over 20 pages of flame against the idea i remember there being some creative suggestions for the demise of the ccp staff member who suggested it too poor guy whatever happened to him oh yeahhe got promoted im fairly certain it wasnt for this idea though
110 pages on the one pretty epic threadnought
how about1 ban use of fbs in low sec2 introduce a siegelike mechanism for scs required to deploy fbs
and then still you havent fixed the core of the problem scs are ridiculously overpowered making them not overpowered in low sec and fixing them in a position for a couple of minutes to be overpowered doesnt remove the actual problem that they are overpowered
want to make dreadnoughts effective in pvp vs supercarriers add two new modulesa capital warp disruptor with scs not immune to itb propulsioninhibitor sphere much like an interdiction sphere but it reduces all propulsion within 30km of the dreadnought by 75 can only be used in siege mode
any idea how long 1 sc with fb needs to kill a sieging dread i think it was somewhere around 3060 sec
there has been two major changes to scs since then i believe first making them pos ornaments and the other making them opnessonastickso they have tried but back then they made the mistake of running it through the maggot farm ie us first and the emorage when epeen is on the block has always been significant makes no sense that they cant control anything themselves though surely one flight is manageable support on the slowing down and increasing of signature on fbombers and to a lesser extent fighters ideally id want capitals to be as helpless as drunk puppies when venturing out without support and let the worlds tremble when withwhile limiting their antistructure ability sounds good on paper it will make them purely anticapitals which risks mothballing them again  so theyd need a secondary functionperhaps gangbonuses in the same vein as that of titans or ability to drag x amount of ships with them when they jump
any idea of how long it would take a battlecruiser to kill an interdictor you still bring them though dont youit would be idiotic to propose buffing the dreadnought to the point where it could stand toetotoe with a sc the idea is to give the dreadnought a reason to be used in the fight and to make it so the dreads presence helps the rest of the fleet
true but there is a difference in prize between an interdictor and a dread
and a sc is around 10x the cost of a dread add to it that because it costs so much you would be an idiot to put nonfaction modules on it add to that insurancehuge difference
true but the role for a sc as i see it is to kill capital shipsnot to kill subcapital ships by the dozensthe fact that a sc can kill off anything except more sctitans is where the problem isor do i have it wrong 
fightersbombers should have their own bay and the normal drone bay should be more constricting i shouldnt be able to carry 100 medium drones on top of a full compliment of fighters and bombers in my sc and throw them 20 at a time at an enemy i agree fighters should still kill bss or they would be useless droneshowever the other big problem with an sc is that a dread is worthless in comparison as in not even worth the 110 price comparatively if you can save up the 15b you should just keep saving a dread provides no benefit to the player that owns it while an sc can a dread is a onedimensional ship that is outclassed by the multidimensional sc zero incentive to train for or own a dread i dont blame scs for that i blame dreads having existed since what 2004 with almost no change in fact theyve been nerfed at least once it comes as no surprise that they have become obsolete
recently gun and ammo module icons got a size indicator which indicated whether they were small medium or large sized this shows up as a s m or l respectively on the module iconcan we have this on other types of modules such as energy vampires and energy destabilizers in particular it will also be of great use on repair and remote repair modules
even if uberblobs continued to use ingame means to identify friend from foe with a huge isk fee i think youd just see a new grunt position in alliances open up the seteverybodyneutralanhourbeforethebillcomesguy and after the bill is issued with no blues seteverybodyneutralguy becomes seteverybodyblueagainguy
this is like cold medicine we are talking about solutions to a symptom as opposed to the actual disease the actual problem is that the idea of taking sov requires that an alliance destroy another alliances tcu and place one of their own because the defender can have anyone come in and defend their tcu and destroy the invaders is the reason why a small allaince cannot take a single system from a coalition no matter how worthless this is because to allievate the problem of tz warfare we have reinforcement timers which is a cute way of saying game paused batphone your blues why does sov have to boil down to sov structures in the first place because thats why everyone blobs they cannot control how many the enemy brings to the fight so they have to get as many people on the field as they can the longer the notice the more blues can be rallied
thanks for putting this up and going to the effort of getting this organised in the first placehaving a listen now
neveralso all of your credit for the greatness of the qa session give it to me give it to me
you have to be joking profanity and insults is getting talks with ccp to open up i cant even follow the logic of that so i am guessing there is no use asking for stats on that lol that is perhaps the dumbest thing i have read on the forums ever so i guess some congrats to you are in order
im just saying your asking a bunch of people who obviously like to joke around to be serious one more thing have you seen how ccp presents themselves im sure they goof around and do the same things this csm does around the office any company that holds a fanfest where socialbility and alcohol are the rules of the day can sit down a be childish for a few hours while talking about issues that could possibly make the game better
if profanity is being used as an emotive tag because of the passionate believe held in the opinion its not a bad thing as long as the major point comes across and the profanity and goofiness doesnt drown that out then its all goodeven devs want to kick back and relax occasionally even when it comes to serious business that is the csmwhen it comes to the first meeting in iceland though they should temper the profanity and use it when its absolutely required call out bs when you see it but do it with a valid and weighty argument as to why you think its bsthe mittanis voice is good and he knows it so he uses it as often as possible
in before its internet spaceships and pixels an youre freaking out over cussing
that works but the ops problem was where the frack is my ore in all this junk rather than what crystals i brought which i can understand it can get annoying if you plan on stripping a belt papaercut issue right
dude that is soooo not funny
wow you really went to the effort of necroing this thread for that pile of good job bro
well reading all this has given me a headache sorry i cant pay any more attention to it goon supporters or whoever fire at me if you will  this is a huge mess and a joke  and a year of this no one else will pay attention either
i am not disputing that certain conversations and the topics contained within will be under nda obligations i am more concerned that the perception of official meetings which are not covered by the nda will fall through the cracks and not be documented resulting in a lack of both transparency and community engagement as i mentioned before the community has come to expect a certain level of disclosure as part of being kept in the loop meissas further explanation about using different methods to handle day to day business pretty much ties this one up in a nice package and addresses the concern i think we can move on from that pointwhat i hear you saying is that raising concerns about how csm6 is runwill operate is somehow a manifestation of conspiracy theories based on ingame stuff in other words youre telling us that our concerns are not valid and that were just scared because oooh evil insert block here is in power run for your lives i dont believe this is fair accurate nor profesional it says that were too insignificant to put aside other issues and focus on bigger concerns how arrogantawesome what kind of steps not asking for a detailed list but even a highlevel overview we can see things like fireside being a huge success anything else that has already been achieved even in the short time span since official election to csm6 i would believe it reasonable to assume we can expect further awesomeness in the near future we do after all have to give you all time tough call here we know theres always going to be someone who will disagree just for the sake of disagreement and to cause chaos that said by what guidelines does csm6 decide what is legitimate concernconstructive criticism and what is just spam combined with the commentary about backlash im not exactly convinced nor sold on supporting the efforts of csm6 if what were going to have is a term of council that arbitrarily decides what is and is not legitimate we might as well just call it a day now its easily negated by developing a few key deliverables or achievements to complete before the term is up we saw such efforts by csm5 with the ccp deliverables as well as csm deliverables we started treating csm as project management rather than free trips to iceland im hoping we see more of that and not just throwing things into the can because its some conspiracy theorist again granted were going to have fluff that belongs in the trash even into csm 50000  meissa thanks for your summary and deeper explanation well done
this will be the best csm yet sean is a great choice for vicesecretaryps meissa update your signature to this one
csm5 was bad fixing minor thingsvoting in that method is bad im sure that they are included under these many blankets

stating my accumulated observations of eve shipsship and color options that appeal to females females being different than gay mencovert cloaks for covert bs they then might actually be what they are supposed to becarriers that carrybridge squads supercarriers that carrybridge wings dreads that knock the crap out of things big and small then they might actually be what they are supposed to bea sensor damp gallente bs platformrethink the eos right now they are basically scorpion buffs which seems to be a bit crosspurpose with other gallente ships not sure but they need some love as a command ship and the boosts it providesbuff the ew frigs range and lock boosts might be in orderfind good fleet options for caldari and gallente ships a rail buff might solve this issuegenerally going through each ship and each race and finding a good balance from one race to another obviously there are some roles which are hard to compare but finding a good useful balance between at least all the different races of ships if one ship is not really a dangler and not used or exceptional in an area then it should be be buffed or altered to give it a role comparible in usefulness to the other races of ships every balance cycle should the least used ships in the game statisticallyedit oh and t3 frigates someone forgot them
sup vile hows life treating youanyway simplethe retribution and coercer each have but a single mid slotyea no im totally seriousno really i have no idea what they thought wed doyea i agree totally gayanyway tell them this for me its dumb stop being dumb every combat ship in eve without a jump drive needs a minimum two freaking midslots to be viable in a fight one for propulsion one for tackletheres always been this little gaggle of people who are like no its cool they fill a role nicelyno they dont there is no role that ship can fill that every other ship in the game including the rifter cant fill betteralso gallente suck do something about it instead of nodding along with us
about dread on top of regular cannons a dread should get siege cannonmodule which works in unique manner for every type of dreadnaughtfirst dreads become antiblob tool second dreads become antitanking solutionamarr dreadnaughts get beam cannon effect laser damage from dreads is focused to form one beam which cumulates the damage 1 weapon 1x dmg 2 weapons  2x dmg 3  4x dmg 4  8x dmg this approach allows focus fire on heavily tanked targets greatly multiplying the damage output on heavily armored high hit point objects smaller targets get significant tanking bonuses due to signature and movement example a pos is a perfect traget carrier gets 90 vulnerability battleship gets 30 vulnerability frigate gets 01 vulnerabilitygallente dreadnaughts get shock wave generator  area of effect weapons which limit blobbing and spider tanking and encourage targets to scatter and attack from different positions instead of linear shootout shockwave have 98 emp damage 2 heat damage which mainly weakens the shields but damages armor only at a slow rate shockwave cannons have 30 km blast radius and slow but potent shock wave bursts which allows still leaves enemy a chancecaldari get extra potent long range rail guns with very high alpha damage very slow reload time for breaking tankminmatar get mid range potent explosive cannons with mild aoe effect shrapnel damage which renders small craft very vulnerable and can get rid of support fleet in reasonable time unless enemy employs hit and run tactics aoe effect is minor and does not damage heavy armor but unlike antiarmor weapons has no damage reduction vs size of an object only its speed and range micro explosive pieces break down very fast and discourage blobbing of low  medium armor targets drones die after 23 volleys interceptors get a chance to escape as their 1500 ehp can be sufficient to initiate evasive maneuvers a fast moving interceptor never gets hit very hard as it is able to outrun the explosion cloud
i thought it was the position of the csm that the minutiae of game balancing wasnt their concernthat said ccp probably has no idea what makes certain ships unpopular and in trying to buff them will manage to  it up completely so i guess csm input is neededthe problem with the gallente ships themselves is that while theyre supposed to be very close range they dont have the speed or acceleration to get there in comparison to minmatar ships which have a more flexible engagement range a competentlypiloted cane for example can kite at point range with barrage or crash into someone and shove 700 dps down their throat with fusion or emp that said its always impressive when someone with a deimos manages to gank an idiot in a vaga that let himself get into scram range but ganking idiots who dont know how the game works isnt really a viable niche for an entire race of shipswe talked about this on kugu and more or less agreed the best buff to gallente would involve an acrosstheboard reduction of inertial modifier having gallente ships accelerate extremely fast but not have a very high top speed would augment their supposed role of closerange dps very well theyd have the acceleration to clear say 1015km from a standstill very quickly but not the speed to dictate range in any sort of extended fight as a minmatar ship would increase in blaster tracking the dps advantage of blasters is moreorless negated by the reality that without a 90 web they have some trouble tracking within their ideal range increase in the grid cost of toptier autocannons gallente being primarily small gang or solo orientedships unless droneblaster boats have some fleet role i havent heard of find most of their competition in minmatar and at the moment autocannon fitting is pretty broken blasters do more dps on paper yeah but youre almost never able to fit a tank and neutrons at the same time a thorax for example after fitting an 800 plate and an mwd cant even fit a full rack of ions without downgrading one to an electron a rupture can do the same with 425s and two utility highs virtually all cruiser and battlecruiser hulls can fit toptier autocannons with no issue due to their disproportionately low fitting cost even a vagabond which makes special mention of its low grid can fit 2 t2 lses a yt and 425s with no fitting mods save a pg4 ive literally never seen someone fit dual 425s to a minmatar battleship since the only reason to do so would be for the extra trackingother balance issues nearly half of the navy faction cruisers are awful and unused the navy exequror osprey and scythe are terrible it really shouldnt take long to figure out why if you just compare them to t1 cruisers black ops need more jump range as was mentioned but moreover i think their role in combat needs to be overhauled completely specifically they should be the battleshipsized counterpart to force recons the sin should have a point range bonus the panther should have a web range bonus etc along with an overhaul of their offensive systems and a general increase in speed and maneuverability to complement their role because right now they are absolute pigs an increase in range would be nice but theyd still be boring to fly if theyre basically inferior versions of t1 bs the cerb and the eagle are awful cerb needs a role sniping missile boat is hilariously bad for obvious reasons and the eagle needs a general buff to dps to make it competitive with the zealot and the muninn
its nothowever things like this thread are useful ammunition for going to ccp and saying hey dudes look at this massive list of horribly broken ships you guys really should assign a devteam to work on ship balance full time which is the underlying objective behind this thread
the tier systemby getting rid of this it would produce a huge increase in the number of viable hulls that and there are a fair few t1 ships that could just use a buff so ill lump them in as welli obviously havent covered every problem ship here but the ones that stand out the most to me as fixes thatd be fairly straightforwardferox  extra midomen  more grid seriously being unable to fit focused medium pulses and an 800mm platemwd at max skills is utterly ridiculouscaracal  more grid should be able to mount hams or at least hmls and an lse with reasonable skills a third low is debatable but would bring it up to par with the moa in slot amount and help compensate for the tiny drone bay and relatively low dps this ship hasmaller  25m3 drone bay would be an excellent start im cautious about suggesting a damage bonus in place of cap use because itd be easy to unbalance this a lot of people have suggested hams for this ship as well but im trying to keep the suggestions fairly simpleeasy to implementthorax  more grid having to mount the lowest tier guns just to squeeze on a measely 800mm plate without fitting mods is ridiculous and acr rigs cost as much as the hullstabber  another mid up its natural speed and change the speed bonus to a falloff bonus right now the rupture does basically everything better all tier 1 frigates  up their hp give all of them at least 2 lows with a varying number of mids and up their fitting stats a bit let them be the lightest fastest tacklers of the t1 frigate lineup rather than just newbie rubbish you ditch after the first few tutorial missionskestrel incursus inquisitor  distribute an extra slot to each low to gallente and amarr and mid to caldaribreacher  this deserves a special mention for having the downright hilarious 422 slot layout give it an extra low and midcaldari navy hookbill  dear ccp during the dev meeting in which you decided a 5 mid missile frigate should have 206 cpu max skilled how drunk were yougive the hookbill at least another 3040 cpu so it doesnt have to resort to laughable meta levels across the entire ship just to fitok so its a lot of requests but my view is just that half the ships in the game being made pretty much obsolete is not fun for anyone variety ftwand for anyone preparing to point out how much i missed  just because i didnt mention something doesnt mean i think its fine just that i have no easily implemented suggestionsedit moreeagle  needs more grid it requires 2 fitting mods where the other sniper hacs need 1 or less this might go some of the way to fixing this joke of a ship but until rails are sorted i doubt well see many more of themcerberus  needs a bit more cpu and about 15 more power grid a hac should not have fitting issues this badcruise missiles  significantly increase flight speed at the cost of flight time no weapon should be relegated to pve simply for being so broken in pvp
i think this is the only idea ive read so far that is remotely interesting make grav sites into super mineral extractingproduction zones how this will be done i dont know as the csm has repeatedly said ccp does not want specifics and micro level suggestions so doing something with grav sites and thus the mineral index already in place something could be done
the high sec or kinds in null i agree suck since theirs less risk in high sec but to believe their no high sec risk is a full lie to your self a good way to fix is bigger or just more of them or make a forth variant of the ore and let it be a 10 more density as that would be sufficient to bump it up several levels of valueand jump bridges should get longer ranges player pays on the spot for its use and be able to select their destination as this aids in the dream ccp has which is large fights and many ship go boomanother way to make null mining work easier and to make a better mining barge as the current ones suck
i guess i should probably outline it for those that dont want to read the whole massive thing remove all arbitrarynonfinancial caps on infrastructure development in nullsec ie allow for heavy concentrations of infrastructurenerf hisec industrial capacity such that highly developed areas of nullsec can at least theoretically compete or even exceed itallow for private stargate construction enabling transit efficiency maximization possibly paired with removal of jump bridges if in the works anywayslower the scale of sovereignty so that there are more claimable unitsrework the index system to better target activity incentives
dam thats a mighty nice summary you have their sadly im in high sec as i finish college and well the indy in high suck already sucks badly so more suck means less want to play or kill all high suck except training areas as much nerfing as high suck getsyou know here is a decent idea forget death traps worm holes we should be considering making null much deeper so their will be a reson for fresh ultra dense trit out their ans such could make it like 40 jumps out from the nearest high sec and thus you can finialy leave high sec alone and have a end game really deep sub null sec spaceso basicly have it with the sleeper ai new ores and new moon goo and bring the t3 stuff out in to the deep null secs would fix every thing
would be a much better world if all opinions and reality itself obeyed your every command wouldnt it if imports are cheap and easy then no local industry will evolve and existing industry will atrophy look at western societies today for real world proof of this very simple truth bridges are a slice of the problem but irrelevant in this thread as it focuses on the bigger slice the industrialization of nullproblem is not just how to make null selfsufficient or even an exporter but to do so without making people want to claw their eyes out and having every five man roam break the back of ongoing operationsop keep the thread on topic or a moderator will there are plenty of whine threads available for bridge procon and anomaly mudslinging for those so inclined
your understanding of forums is only matched by your understanding of null sec industry it boils down to this high sec supplies null sec because the cost to produce is significantly lower in high sec than null sec risk is part of costing decreasing risk of null sec is a bad idea people in null dont want to mine low ends thats why i think null needs hauler anoms
have you even read the thread the whole idea is to discuss possibilities that will help wean null of the jita teatproblem now is that prices are not only rock bottom in empire but importing it to null has the same low risk attached and takes less time than hauling goods amarr  jita  in short there is no reason why any sane person would start building in null  even bloody supers are built by reproccing highlowsec goods carriers for christs sakeand i have said as much but if you have ever tried looting from a hauler spawn in deep null then youd wish you picked up mining  just as tedious but with more clickingwill be a great part of the solution but even you cant believe that dumping a crap ton of minerals into the system solves all the problems
that sounds a lot like what i just said except i was referencing comparative advantage to explain the situationi much prefer hauler spawns to mining in null sec muuuuuuch prefer significantly less risk than having 5 mining alts slowly grinding on ore to just be hauling the minerals to a station plus who would mine low ends when there are high ends right beside them easier to hand that task off to pveers
so i set up a nice fully armed death star style pos one day and im wondering if you knew a good lawyer that could sue to get the 10 hours of my life back
why is this on page 8 to the topespecially cuz of the captains quarters on duality now
while lore makes the races and bloodlines different with the advent of face changing why isnt it possible for a change between races when it is already possible to change between two very different people of the same racethough having option of changing gender would make things kind of weird but hey people can do it in the 21st century ever hear of michal jackson or that one son of ernest hemingway
this represents about 90 of my complaints with eve and i have no idea why it isnt at the top of everybodys list why does it take up to 3 seconds from when i mouse over something before i can click on it
actually if i were to choose a single thing that i would want ccp to weed out as one of their papercuts the showupasneutral bull  that noise
ridiculous mechanic
hey everyone please comment
congratulations for your idea being mentioned in the dev blog
unless ccp has stated it wont work with the current code etc i dont see this as a bad idea 1
two thingsa this is rediclous make them bigger the name isnt bad but there need to be serious changes to make it fitb make assault carriers current supercarriers into a tii version with better logistcs this could also solve the titan problem tii titan logistics ti damge tiii moble jump bridge with ok wepponsi support
well the hyperion would be a much more viable boat if it hadnt been intended to replace the megathron instead of just giving the gallente a decent sniper bs but in tiericide one of those two would need a change hell even before tiericide
gallente can use web drones to catch kiters buff web drones
anyone else can use those drone too unless you mean to buff by ship change bonus it wont help gallente the least
if you try to scoop drones and some of them are out of range they should be returning by default instead of staying idle
1 ability to add bookmarks to your places tab from orca corp holds and in fact any sort of hold that isnt yours including cans2 right click on bookmarks and add to places tab no more dragging and dropping
about 2 why not have both  drag and drop is a blessing in most ui why get rid of it when you can get both 
this hardly ever mine anymore but still how can such an annoying bug not be dealt with for years
i got the same issue while fitting ships with modules in a container after a while i had an afterburner in the container that i couldnt use i had to log off and log back in to realize it wasnt in the container anymore this bug is spreading
any news ccp you are heard us universe of cynabals and dramiels oh wait some drakes trueis your insidious plan how much the fish
this issue would be solved simply by ccp accepting the csms recommendation to create a continuous balancing role within their development teams once that exists this would be addressed making debate on it futile so not supported to prevent diffusion of focus from continuous balancing
went away on work for a week  had hoped to see a few more supports but you know youve just got to get the message out there
ive always found clone upgrading a bit stupid ive never forgotten to upgrade and probally never will forget this however doesnt prevent me from thinking its kinda mental i see no reason why clone upgrading shouldnt be automatic or have some sort of warning dialog and i find the argument that remembering to upgrade your clone is a vital game mechanic to be more then a little failupgrading your clone is vital obviously its meant to give death a cost having to mindlessly do something so incredibly obvious as upgrading your clone when you die is easy yes but that doesnt detract from how stupid it is to have a mechanic with which the drunk and stupid may hurt themselves as amusing as that may be for no other reason then neglecting to click a few buttons that no reasonable person would ever decided not to i dont see how the way it is its much any different then if you were required to remember to hold ctrlshiftalt and type waffles every hour or be disconnected for all the meaningful decisionmaking it brings to the game if you think it does bring meaningful decisionmaking to the game frankly youre an idiotif eve were an fps game this mechanic would be similar to spawning you right infront of a pit in which you can fall to your death everyone knows to not take a step forward and jump to your death lolfail but it doesnt make the situation any less idioticdespite all that this op is fail
just like learning skills
the most precious thing in this game is skillpoints we wait wait and wait again some more to get skills and you can finally get into the best ship fit with the best equipment after 300 in subscription fee then they can take it away from you i dont like it neither i can live with losing isk that represents many hours of gameplay but resetting your skillpoints to 1 month ago this has to changebottom line skillpoints are directly linked to real life money by subscription feesisk is directly linked to time played and indirectly linked to real life money through plexi say do not mess with the direct link to my bank account
they cannot take anything away from you only your own stupidityforgetfulness can take skill points away from youi dont support stupidity
yesyes it iswith great sp comes great responsibilities chief among them learning what you should have learned the first day of eve never undock before you check your medclone
the only time it could possibly be unfair to lose sp when you go pop is if you didnt have the funds to buy another clone but if that happened you should quit now anyway
id support this if the op wasnt such a horrible tool
lost sp tears are best tears
your not being trolled people think your a troll for a few reasonsthis topic has been posted everytime someone looses spyour acting like a babey who lost his bottleyou think justifying everything will win people overyou lost sp man up get over it this is eve not wow and the only time you get sp back if your account gets hacked afaikhowever i will support this because you have really nice hair
and here i was hoping to find more lovely responses from the opoh well
i think it is very fair yes 
so youre saying that hyper inflation is okdespite the fact that there are some fixed costs  isk sinks which would become more and more meaninglessi could say that since there will be less isk then prices will be less so the anomaly changes will have no effect since the market will adjust to players having less isk so who can complain but that would be me distorting the truth to match my agenda just like the csm members who started this thread
a lot of items which come from the lp store such as modules and ammo are high risk items which are routinely destroyed in combat or are to be used as a resource the isk is removed from the market and the demand is high so lp blitzing is relatively stable as an income source
this is completely untruefor any item an increase in supply will result in a decrease in price as a very good example lp increased in value after large quantities of courier bots were banned and the amount of lp in circulation decreasedi have to say im really very concerned that you cannot understand this especially since the results are already showing up on the marketpersonally i expect lp items to continue to decrease in value for a while until players have stabilised other areas of income at which point they will recover noticeably but not to the levels they were before the anomaly nerf was announced
buh lp and isk in the form of faction ammo isnt used and consequently removed from the marketgame wot im very concerned you cannot understand this actually im not but it does make you look silly
i didnt say it wasnt constantly usedthe amount being used is already being supplied so where exactly is all this extra ammo going to go demand doesnt scale with supply unless the surplus causes the price to decrease  lowering the value of the lp  stimulating people to use it more oftenyou do know that there arent magical fairies buying stuff off the market
the incentive to go out to null sec has gone weve seen a recent influx of applicants who are bored of fighting for space that has to no real gain or profit for them how that effects the bigger alliances i dont know probably not all that much as a lot of them have had years to develop fad wads of isk that never really filters down through the alliance yet for a newer player venturing out to 00 who cant fly a fantastically fitted tengu i can imagine it must seem rather pointless especially as already mentioned how much easier and safer it is to do the same in empire
again i wasnt talking about a fresh meat noobie showing up in null for the first time in their brand new hurricane all wide eyed and bushy tailed i was talking about experienced players who put pressure on the players holding good space the players that dev was having fuzzy dreams about invading more valuable space because of the change yeah those players corps alliances the upandcoming those are the ones who ate the nerf bat with the anom changemy complaint is how ccp handled this
if youd stop with your paranoid not my ncsm stuff for just one second youd realize that no one in this thread much less the csm members actually thinks there isnt any problem with the way anomalies currently work giving out a straight cash payment for shooting rats is idiotic and shortsighted on ccps part but instead of changing nullsec mechanics to halt inflation they just nerfed the  out of them so people move to highsec instead it was a lazy rushed and stupid decision like so many of ccps or do you actually believe that less risk should equate to greater rewardsince you apparently get sexual gratification from whining about sovholding players being somehow unfairly represented in the csm which is hilarious i really dont think theres any getting through to you unless you can objectively see why ccp ed up hint you cantas an aside and this goes to everyone who think theyre goddamn warren buffet because they rmtd 30b isk sunk it into goods and make money from trading its easy to look down your nose at those filthy nullsec plebians and go well if you really want to make money you gotta run six charons around empire like i do just as its easy to forget the vast number of consumers and producers required to make such a venture possible and how sensitive it is to competition
amusingly this is exactly what hes trying to point out about lp conversionliang
how about the ncsm starts demonstrating thats its non partisan rather that stating at the beginning of the thread that the only acceptable point of view is agreeing with them that it was a bad idea im hardly being paranoid when its that obviousactually i dont think theyre unfairly represented the majority of players that didnt vote created this issue what i do think is its unfortunate how blinkered theyre making themselves appear in that they seem willing to let the economy burn to get the anoms put back in a hideously broken stateactually most of my time in this thread has been arguing with members of test whore being completely idiotic by claiming mission rewards are magically immune to market forces i notice that youve decided to give up on that least even if you refuse to acknowledge i was correctloose translation  were too lazy to use our brains we can only cope with hitting scan and warping to the closest anomaly and we think we deserve a super carrier if we do this for a couple of monthsits really sad to see how many people want to see this great game dumbed down what next demand a 50m sp bonus every year as well
lp conversion isnt that sensitive at least i havent noticed much of a change while competition in tradingmarket manipulation can put you out of business competition for lp items digs into your profit by very little considering the vast array of items you can churn out of the lp store and the relatively elastic demand of lp goodseven when you have lots of competition churning out the worst isklp items you still make more money than anoms a tengu running sanctums all day which is currently impossible makes 4555mhr that same tengu efficiently blitzing l4s can pull down 100mhr quite easily churning out faction ammo inb4 pubbies going well i slowboat through missions in a golem and i only make 20m an hour one of my corpmates went up to highsec in a tengu for a week blitzed l4s for a couple hours every day and came back to fountain with 5b from cn invulns and torps in that same time i scanned down four constellations every day and tripleboxed every available plex and am sitting on less than a billion in loot now you tell me that isnt completely broken
if you think this is anyones goal you are laughably deludedno ones claiming theyre immune they are as affected by lp inflation as anoms are by isk inflationcongrats you continue to miss my point if everyone used their brains and did highsec tradingas only an acutely scientific and brilliant mind can operate spreadsheets and click autopilot on an obelisktrading would become vastly less profitable every sort of business that isnt a skinner box of pres butan receive isklpore is not only relies on those skinner boxes to exist but would utterly collapse if a significant number of people started in on tradinghaulingmanufacturing etc
first thanks for toning it down back into civilitylp inflation balances out mission running if to many people do it then the rewards are lowered isk inflation puts everyone in a hamster wheel where they have to keep chasing just to stay in the same place except for those that are benefiting from whatever is broken and causing the inflationto an extent this just makes me want to say go back to wow im afraid just as cross training is important incase your favourite ships get nerfed being flexible in the way you make isk is important those who diversify and dont put all their eggs in one basket should expect to reap the rewards
those causing the inflation buy ships and modules and are as hurt by inflation as anyone else a manufacturer for example would be relatively unaffected as their variable costs would increase alongside the prices of their goods as both are affected by inflationeither way noones arguing that anom upgrades were a bad idea and too much of an isk faucet the problem is ccps addressing the issue fails to do so threefold1 anom rewards are still in the form of isk bounties which was the problem to begin with converting some of the rewards to say concord lp having rewards be primarily dropbased or increasing the currentlyawful rate of complex spawning would help reduce inflation while keeping nullsec profitable2 risk becomes even more inversely proportionate to reward which is the opposite of what it should be obviously no matter how you slice it especially for the casual oneaccount player that logs in a few hours a week to rat up some drakes or something highsec is better more consistent and safer money than nullsec even taking into account lp depreciation3 while the stated goal of the change was to make nullsec less homogenous with the intended effect of having players in lowvalue nullsec fight for highvalue nullsec all of nullsec is currently so valueless as far as ratting goes that instead of people moving from one nullsec region to another theyre just moving from nullsec to highsecits this complete and utter failure of ccp greyscale to understand how this terrible game even works that es people off the most and they fact that he didnt think to go to the csm for better ideaspreaching to the choir between my alts ive done just about anything that can be done to make money and moreorless had success at it after a year of highsec trading i got burnt out having to update orders twice a day and wanted to relax and make money independent of time obligations for school and workregardless none of that applies to this argument because the point still stands that nullsec is crap money for high risk while highsec is good money for low risk
does nobody think this isnt a cheat to the sec status system if you think that people should not be able to suicide gank others without some sec penalty then in theory you should be in support of this proposal basically pirates who earn their hard earned cash ganking should be allowed to use that money to increase their ganking skills but people who have squeaky clean day jobs earning cash on the right side of the law should not be able to just dump that cash to an alt who ganks its just cheating the sec status system if you break the concord laws and gank then you need to get a sec penalty money laundering and free transfers allows people to commit crimes without paying any sec penaltyif the income from ganking isnt enough to cover the costs then it should be allowed to die off as a profession not be artificially propped up by alt accounts
gotta say its a little disheartening to see the csm chairman give such a useless response to a thread in the assembly hall could you maybe expound on why yeah no or maybe just not post in the thread at all if you arent going to be constructive about itbut back to the topic i think the op has an interesting idea and some valid arguments to back it up based on initial impression i would support at least a good discussion on the matter
in or out of universe the ability to monitor every financial transaction ever seems a bit of a drastic increase of concords powerand besides this is a game where betraying the trust of hundreds of people and taking their stuff is not only condoned but a key point in its marketing a little dirty laundry is par for the course
exactly as far as i know ure probably the first person to make a thread about this because the 10s dont want to face the consequnces of their actions and everyone knows it and the funny thing is theres another thread in this same board that wanted to nerf sec gains talking about consequences of crime i asked them about the same problem ure bringing up and theyre like oh were not gonna do anything about that because we 10s should be above the law while anyone attacking us should not be the 10s just want their high sec alts to be safer with a suicide ganking nerf because theyre too scared to use the same space they farm killmails intheyre the real carebears plain and simple
1 you may notice that concord does not have sov anywhere2 you may notice that ganking someone in high sec does not impact your standing with any space holding entity3 you may notice that people in the real world with a lot of money are allowed to do stuff that other people arent allowed to do4 you may notice that the bank corporations in the game are caldari so it would seem logical that players do not use them as a chunk of players actively shoot caldari navy ships something i would think would anger the caldari banks5 if youve been paying attention to the rl news of late you will be aware that boa received a slap on the wrist for being involved in laundering billions of dollars for s american drug lords and no one got in trouble if thats how it works in the real world with fairly unified government opposition to such activities i would imagine such corruption absolutely belongs in eveso no your proposal doesnt make sense from a game mechanics standpoint a real world standpoint nor a game rp standpoint
the thing is concord doesnt care two hoots about money they only care about security
nopefirst its a crap idea that serves no purpose what perceived problem is it supposed to solvesecond its easy to circumvent ooh look i contract 1 unit of tritanium for 1 billion isk surprise my alt buys it or i trade him an item in station or i trade him money in station you dont want to tax trade by sec status rightthird its a crap idea that serves no purpose
boy is this what everyone voted for snarky comments by the csm in the assembly hall where presumably these kinds of ideas are to be discussed do we really have to put up with this from them for another year and just when they were starting to win me over
it really is a dumb idea though whats next i cant contract ships to my pirate alt because hes got negative sec status my pirate alt cant dock up in stations my pirate alt cant purchase ships and modules my pirate alt cant receive bountiesthis is a poorly thought out idea that would only introduce a very slippery slope its easy to circumvent through any number of channels as exampled above and would not introduce any new or interesting gameplayno not supported
yeah remove pirates plsall are nabs anyway
is it ignorant nc mouthpiece day i must have missed the memo concord does hold sovereignty the sanctum constellation in the genesis region is mostly held by concord 1 system there is held by interbus see above this has exactly what to do with internet spaceships it makes complete sense i dont support it but that doesnt automatically make it nonsensible
you may notice that pakshi tar and other systems might disagree with you
here have a hypotheticali am in deep nullsec i am 30 jumps from the nearest concord ship i have not been to highsec in a yearwhy would concord be watching my bank balancealso as meissa said its so easy to get around with contracts and the trade window that there is no point in even considering this nerfing jita alts is just stupideve is a sandbox not everyone wants to play like you do pointless changes like this arent going to force people to play your way there is always a way around it
you boot a corporate spy  war decyou say the wrong thing in local chat  war decyou create a large and popular corporation  war decits too easy to declare wars for ridiculous reasonsmaybe thats the starting point for reformation

alternate redgreen flash would be the simplest solution surely
holy  sticks  faced monkey ersthis would be the bestif they implemented this along with a fw rr fix well people might start thinking they supported their ingame features instead of thinking up new ones to poorly implement
this is brilliant
why in hell do people keep suggesting  that will completely  colorblind people just to be clear i like the idea but holy  the game is pretty damn hard to play already
great idea well fold it into our ui asks

the only people saying keep the nerf are the ones that sit in jita scamming to make their isk what is the point to live in null sec anymore the only thing that goes on are fleet battles but without space to fight because of the nerf you mine aswell live in highsec p
so moving huge fleets through a single portal using the same amount of fuel as it would take to move two ships acording to wormhole mechanics how can this be correct i hate the way titan and other captital can be used as jump bridges with no extra penties for the mass they are moving through wormholes become unstable when too much mass goes through them dosnt it make sense then to have more fuel required to keep the portal open for more mass as this would take more energy to keep stable here are three ways to limit this note each is a diferent individule way to fix things they are not all ment to be implemented together but are different ways to fix the same problema by fuel the more mass being transported in the jump the more fuel needed to complete it a skill would need be added to conserve more fuel per level b add a standardized UFFFDmass limitUFFFD for the different caps therefore multiple caps would need be used to transport a large fleet a new skill would need be added to improve the standard limit per level bigger ship would have a better mass limit but lower range plus there own greater mass would need to be added so to add a level of balance between them and the smaller ships c add inaceracies to when the ships arrive at the cyno if the ships going through the warmhole are of substanial mass when there mass values are added together they wil not appear in perfect formation but a few would be scattered from the intended destination and a third of them would be throne out of formation the more the ships way combined the more they are desilinged and scattered this would agin infasize multi cap usage for jumping large number of ships
d move to worm hole space
that isnt the purpoe of this topic
its a reasonable hardmoveblob idea
hi this is already the case please learn all mechanics before making further complaints
hi this is not the case at all please learn the game dinamics before making yourself seem dummer than u seem nowthat is by rangetian carriers and dreds have a base of one thousandthree thousand one hundred for jump freightersfour hundred for black opsnote another of the base amount for the type of ship jumping is added each light yeari think this mechanic should workwth mass insted of distance as i duely noted in my thread
but it already costs more to send a ship with higher mass through a bridgethat is what youre talking about isnt it
urgit only costs more to send a ships fartheryes it costs more for a high mass ship to go through but only the ship creating the bridge for instance a freighter uses more fuel to get through than a dred but it can have as many ships jump through with no extra cost excpet if they are going more than one light yeari double checked this aginst info in the wiki
no it doesnt go take a ship through a bridge  any bridge black ops titan jump bridge pos module  and see how much fuel it uses now put some armor plates on that ship or run a mwd and jump through same distance jump more fuel consumeddug this up for youozoneneededshipmass1000000000500lightyearsdistance and mass in therethe rest of what youre saying isnt making sense of course it costs the ship or pos module more fuel when bridging higher mass ships  theyre the ones creating the portal please try rewording and explaining better
because wikis cant be wrong you saw it on the internets it must be true bridges shut down all the time because too many people go through people get yelled at all the time for having their mwd on while going through bridges because of the dramatic increase in mass it causes spies will do this on purpose to break up fleets and throw things into disarray
hi you are literally edright now the more your ship weights the more fuel it takes to go through a bridge of any type at all be it pos black ops or titanthanks for looking stupid in public
wait wait waitare you suggesting that freighters dreads etc can open bridges for mother ships please explain what you mean by it can have as many ships jump through with no extra costseriously i do not understand what you are trying to say here sidenote the reason people say to turn off your mwd before jumping is because the mwd increases your mass and thus increases the fuel you burn they wouldnt say this if mass didnt burn more fuel
as a smart phone user i love eve gate its a great way to stay in contact when your away from the game i wanted to post this in a eve gate forum but i cant find oneproblem 1the mails character allotment has been reduced to a tweet in the past i was able to plan entire campaigns from almost anywhere in the us with my corp mates but now all i can do are 1 liners uselessproblem 2th eve calendar is cool but due to general human laziness goes mainly unchecked by the greater part of the community it really needs to be linked to the actual eve server just like the mailproblem 3eve gate voice doesnt seem to support smart phones i thought the whole idea of eve gate was to unbindUFFFDthe player from the computer but there is no need for eve gate voice if you need your pc and headset to use it you can just as easily log oni cant make myself believe the devs really intended for us to be screaming eve jargon at the top of our lungs in the middle of the local coffee shopi think my car on the drive at five makes for a much better place to resemble a homicidal maniac ive done a few tests and if the driver next to you sees you screaming like a loon pounding one fist madly against the dash while your other one is white knuckled on the steering wheel and covered in spittle there is a 90 less chance that sucker will have the balls to cut you offplease fix 
the other problems i dont particularly care or really need or havent really thought about because i truly am disgusted with eve gatebut if they are going to push this pathetic little spacebook at least make the bloody thing worthwhile by making it less like twitter and more like a proper eve mail boxive been meaning to write a very nasty letter to ccp to demand an explanation as to why on every other browser i can paste a long eve mail but in my insert smart phone here the maximum allowed characters are mysteriously truncated to a pathetic couple of lines or less w t hseriously i can go to the forums or any other package no problemso what was the thinking or the idea behind that featureyes fix it before i throw it away all together
this ive opened a few tickets for pi in which the response told me to create a bug report since i know how to avoid it im going to just avoid doing exactly what triggers the bug and that bug will thus not be entered into their system by my hands it frustrates the  out of me when im told to basically copypaste my petition into some bug report
we should be allowed to whip any gms responsible for faulty handling of petitions at fanfest
ccps customer support is the only one ive ssen so far that separates bugs and customer ailments this strictly a more humane process would be you have any problem you contact customer support these people are trained for handling customers they get the necessary information to usable format cs forwards the problem to where the resolution occurs  customer told of results profitedit everyone would win players would be content or even happy because they are handled by nice people devs and game admins would no longer be pestered by long threads of qa
thats just not possibleive done some work on servers and specifically on logs1 it would increase database load considerably as each transaction now needs to write to the db2 the db would be huge so huge that they would need to start deleting logs as time goes on depends on the hardwarewhat they have done is strike a balance between performance and logs it seems to me that they put the emphasis on performancealso depends on what they are recording it might be as simple as user a at 2011422 1633 pm sold small amour rep 2 for 1000000000 iskso when they view the log all it shows is that u sold a rep for isk not that ur client disconnected or that your ip was different a better idea would to be let the gms ask the dev team for what kind of logs they need and where based on the types of petitions they get most
moving threads around still doesnt make it any clearer for the noob having a sticky that says fireside chat thread with zero replies is not going to make the impression of a lively discussion decreasing the chance of anyone clicking on it csm communication is horrible to find out what they are doing you need to dig and dig noob comes to eve online site if he finds the csm menu on that page to begin with he will find there is little of interest in it then they might make it to the forums only to have to keep being rerouted to a section of the forum that is not meant for the csmthe best way to find out what the  the csm is doing is to listen to an audio file that is not hosted in the place that is supposed to be informing you about the csm you can slice that anyway you want its bad communication period
make hisec systems lowsec when they regularly hit 500 or over for a weekif you want a role playing reason say its because concord cant cope with the sher volume of traffic or the corporations that have the market hubs in their stations arent paying enough tax to have effective policingthat would shake it up
bingo its a pain for sellers and buyers and you want to implement this i do not like you sir not as a buyer and not as a seller and not as a role player
well they kinda promised that after a year and a half of focusing on incarna theyll start focusing more on the restthen again they promised all of incarna will be completely optional and would you look at that the first part of it cq is now becoming mandatorynot just that but it also looks like one and a half years might very well turn into three years or even longer
this was evident from the moment it was made clear how far they were in actually developing incarna ie when they showed us they had done virtually nothingalso ccp this is my last active account going dark shortly maybe if ccp changes direction of eve ill visit my characters in a few years assuming eve is still around
supported from someone who regular googles awesome brand new mmos i love eve but i cant take much more of this stupidity
first off 1 request i have is that every ship greater than a rookie or t1 frig have atleast 2 mediums this includes mining barges and destroyers in particular a mining barge with just a scanner and no civilian shield systems is an easy kill to pirates and a destroyer with no boost drive or no shield will not be able to hunt fast flying pirates either pirates all fly the same ship you know the one and having just 1 medium slot further strengthens its problem with high dps and super high attackinterception speeds as for all other t1 ships i think you should use sandbox theorycrafting to construct them based on stats type size and faction originship class determines amount of highsfrigate  14 highsfleet t2 frigate 5 highscruiser  6 highs personally i think cruisers need more highs to make them atleast capable of taking on frigates as they are now they are both vulnerable to their larger battlecruiser and smaller frig brothersfleet t2 cruiser  7 highsdestroyer battlecruiser battleship  8 highsship size determines amount of lowsfast attack ship  12 lowsmedium frigate  23 lowsdestroyer  34 lowscruiser  45 lowsbc  56 lowsbs  67 lowscapital  8 lowsship faction technology determines amount of medsamarrianminmatar 23 meds low sciencegallentefleet or navy 34 meds military researchcaldaripirate 45 meds high interest in sciencesleeperstrategic 57 med stolen technologiesjovian 78 meds highest technologiesas for drake  evasive manuervinghigh speed manuevering skill should give each pilot 525 chance to completely evade a missile completely allowing for fast flying ships like interceptors to quickly shake off drake missileshowever ships arent the only thing that needs changing weapons and equipment are basically what makes the ship do what it does so perhaps weapons need more balancing or new additions as welltwin blasters  twin weapons would be attached to frigates as a twin shot or group shot weapon that only takes up one space this will allow frigatiers to strafe heavier ships while still having highs left over to equip missiles smart bombs or other tech to aid in their attack twins are not duals which actually have a faster rate of firetwins fire 2 shots at oncequad flak or aa blaster cannons  quad shot flak or aa defensive weapons could be equipped to destroyers and cruisers to allow for them to take down small fast flying frigates while still concentrating their artillery on the larger vesselsother ideas ive posted  artillery weapons create a splash dmg which dmgs nearby ships railguns have a chance to penetrate hulls and pass through ships into other ships in a single line of sight lasers can cause burning or engine overheating autocannon bullet spray can slow down or damage manuevering of ships by tearing apart their finswingshullsaddition of more weapons could also help balance combat between different classes of ship  350 cannonsdual medium lasers for destroyers vs cruisers 450 cannonsdual heavy laser or blasters for cruisers vs frigatesdestroyers specialized weapons could turn the tide for players of certain factions caldari missile scrambler  emits a beam which would scramble incoming missiles and send them away from the original targetgallente drone scrambler  emits a beam which would scramble drones and force them to either become disabled or attack random targetsamarrian tactial laser strikes  could allow amarrian pilots to attack cruicial parts of the ship disabling weapons shields or mobilityminmatarian nukes  minmatarians could launch heavy powerful nukes as a last ditch effort to destroy their attackers

i actually really like those ideas oofor the guns at least
hybrids should be buffed in the same manner that created the godlike projectiles  through ammo revamp and minor tweaks to guns that much i can agree with not sure the high thermal options are kosher though as it targets amarr resists rather than caldaribut reducing mass to get intercept speed mass affects acceleration topspeed and agility  you have to adjust speed a little and inertia a lot to compensate or gallente will be used as kiting boats with very few exceptions especially if they get better tracking options 
 umm whatthis is a problem for game balance how
1 take a look at what ships are hardly ever used2 improve those ships especially in their roles and put them for 23months on the testserver until the general consensus is that theyre fine
dear csm vile rati caution you to take the comments in this thread with a grain of salt after glancing over these three pages half of these suggestions are so ludicrous i shudder to see them added to the game i have spent the better part of my eve career studying the game mechanics and the ships of eve so i can run the various pvp training schools that i have founded over the years it should be noted that some commonly held opinions regarding ships and weapon types are nothing more than uneducated nonsense point in fact sensor dampeners suck wtf are these people talking about they they land jams 95 of the time inside of deep falloff exceeding 120km they are the perfect countermeasure for ecm and logistics ships at range and are practically over powered as the are people just do not understand that it has a more specific role then ecm and not everything in eve can or should be able to do everything the biggest issue facing eve right now in terms of ship balance is so blatantly obvious it is the balancing of carriers vs dreds vs supercarriers once upon a time dreds were win and massive revelationarchon fleets dominated eve what should have happened was a buff to all other racial dreds and carriers that would have resulted in a far more balanced playing field but instead we got the nyx and aeon now there is hardly room for anything elseccp did not expect that titans would be so prevalent in game well the same freakin thing is happening with supercarriers tonow do to their double oversight we have supercarriers and titans online dreds and carriers of all races should be the bread and butter of any fleet in 00 suppercarriers should be far less numerous then they are now and titans should not be able to one shot a perfectly skilled archon in triage are you kidding me all other issues in game are a distant second to the current epic fail disbalancing of capital warfare period who gives a  about blasters right now fix nullsec warfare psall ccp had to do in order to fix the damn doomsdays was give it an explosion velocity like what we have on bombs this way only other capital ships would absorb damage and any battleship that was not sitting there completely stationary would absorb next to no damage see how simple that wasbut no some moron came up with the death ray instead
has someone already mentioned gallente sub cap line active armor fitting requirementbonusspeedcap regencpu issues etcalso hybrids dpstrackingfitting requirementsmy 2cts contribution hopping sanchas will annihilate the gallente federation so we can finally get our sp back and train lasers
the fact is that ccp except when the game first launched have not cared too much about balance admittedly at first there were some really broken features such as hardeners and damage modules stacking without penaltythey have had all the information available to them in real time but apparently chose not to use it every time a player buys a ship or module in eve they are voting about the relative merits of that object so for instance the eagle is demonstrative awful because its selling at less than it costs to produce the dramiel is overpowered because its price indicates that is the casemy recommendation is that the developers acquaint themselves with the bell curve a class of ships should be valued on the market within a range of prices or perhaps better profit over build cost if a ship type moved more than a standard deviation of the mean it should be flagged for review that flagging perhaps should be published on the forums and suggestions invited for its nerfing or boostingif a ship class moves two standard deviations from the mean the expectation should be that the next patch will address the issue of that shipthe same process should be conducted for modules and there should be a look for patterns within the market data for example i am sure you can use something more sophisticated than venn diagram but the poorly performing eagles and ferox are also members of the use rails set and the rail set is notable because a lot of its tech ii types are trading a low to negative profits so perhaps a solution would be to give a small boost to rails and see what happensthe key is that these adjustments are continual at each patch  not done and forgotten a complete revision would be signalled by the failure over a number of patches to move the target group back into the central part of the bell curvethe advantage of this system is that the developers need not themselves be leet pvpers even though some maybe because they are using the market and therefore utilising the collective knowledgebase of the players
i second that remember what happened to the moros instead of ccp making other dreads better the made them all stinkbut my idea to make dreads better might not jive with youi want tech ii dreads dreads were the first capital ship and they should have a tech ii variant by nowbasically thier tech ii bonus would be 1 increase to damage2 increase to hp3 roll bonus would be to half the time and cost for siege modei would put the cost for each one of these babies around 45 billionok back to hybridsthe reason why i suggest the changes to thermkin layout is that gal are kinda gimped when it comes to pve using turrets basically kintherm is usually a secondary damage type for most rats so that means when you use lets say blasters to rat with half your damage ends up being tertiaryso having ammo types that gives you more of one type of damage type will allow you to rat more effectivly with gallenteas for the speed bost via mass reduction yeah it would be great finally gallente doing the kiting and not getting kited
rework the whole gallente blaster core doctrine without morphing blasters into a poor mans pulse laser or autocannon keep the drone boats as they are bin the roden lol missiles brainfart
tech ii dreds quoting what is probably the stupidest post in this thread being that you could just buff the current dreds just like ccp buffed motherships if more intelligent people posted more realistic and well thought out ideas then just maybe ccp would be doing more to better the game instead of screwing it up with each passing expansion but instead you get crap like this please visit your user settings to reenable imagesit would make far more sense to introduce a faction dred after current capital ships were rebalanced for at least a year
i told you it would not jive with youyou could just boost regular dreadsbut dreads should not be on par with sc or titanshow much does a dread cost how much does a sc or titanyou can dock a dread you cant with sc or titanall you want is the game to go back to dreads online which it was for a while i remember something like 500 dreads on field at one pointthough i do like the idea of faction dreads i dont think ccp will be doing them any time soon maybe cuss we would have seen one with incursion but what we got is a pirate faction sc so chances are more faction scs are in our futureas for tech ii dreads you might think its a stupid idea but i dont tech ii is never a stupid ideathat would be like saying oh man there is this bs and its soo much more uber then my caracal lets boost the hell out of caracal but keep the price the same and you are calling me stupid stop drinking the yellow listerine boss
1 drake is fine it just happens to have abilities that are good for medium size fleets atm not to mention 90 of players can fly a drake2 artillery was buffed for very little reason and now the alpha is just mad3 angel ships4 removal of space priests i think going towards mainstream mmo way where you got healers was very bad decision not to mention it made carriers less useful in process i think this is also aftermath for needless buff for logistics back in time5 gallente ships are fine you could talk about balancing hybrid ammo and oomphing railguns whatever which brings up suckiness of caldari hybrid boats
1 remove the cap penalty from the mwd and replace existing mwd cap bonuses with something more suitable i believe that meta level should also have a more significant impact on sig res penalty and cap usage2 decrease the fitting requirements of medium and large blasters this is essential for fixing some core gallente issues that revolve around the requirement of fitting large numbers of high grid and cpu modules such as plates cap boosters armor reppers and mwds3 change to penalty for active armor rep rigs4 give interceptors their roll back nerf the dram
fixing existing stuff does not  adding new things you must fix what currently exists first it is sad that i need to type out and remind people of what should be simple commonsense feed your brain because it seems to be dieing a slow death
1st dreads are fine for the costrisk if anything the seige counter should be reduced 11 billion is not that expensive especially with alliance reimbursement and insurancei think you are just butthurt that you dont have a titan and are upset it can one shot youbut if you want a ship that has more meat on its bones and is able to do more dps and still dock cost half that of a sc then a tech ii dread is what you are looking forimo i will always advocate to adding more flavour to pvp then just making things more vanilla
reinstate the moros drone bonus it was dropped from 50 damage per level of skill training to 20 this crippling nerf was done without advance warning and didnt even make it into the patch notes until a couple days after the release of the patchintroduce a cruise missile version of stealth bombers keep the torpedo one currently being used but bring back the older cruise missile version with its bonuses the current models are great in 00 but not as useful as the cruise missile version in high sec
tbh we can go on and on and turn this into an nonconstructive troll thread but i wont bother doing thatbecause the important thing to remember here is that the odds of your ed idea being implemented in game is next to none so i am quite content with letting you go on and on and on about lol tech ii dreds in place of a broad spanning capital ship rebalancing across the board for all raceswow just wow lol
yeah this is starting to feel like a tennis match i am nedal and you can be the other guy that keeps on loosingoh yeah his name is federersorry man this aint wow this is eveonlinewhy you would think a ship that costs 110 of a sc or even 140 of a titan should be on par is beyond methough a sc rebalance is needed as the nyx is teh win atm and the minnie one needs major lovethe only answer other then nerfing the hell out of titans and scs and in the process reducing thier cost so that people will still fly them or boosting dreads to the point where its 2008 again and all we see is dreads online would be introducing tech ii dreads into the mixeven though ccp has not been talked about it before i would not be so confident that it wont ever happen in the future
anything that deviates from every single person stacking on as much ehp and dps as possible is obviously bad for the game
i think a few extra high slots on dreads with the option of capital sized nosneut with siege bonus would add flavor to dreads or tech 2 dreads
in addition to balancing the races which is related to weapons the most important component of the ship eliminating the teir system in another topic is a good idea for accomplishing balance and having more use of ships that normally are the odd things that no intelligent people would play with ie ferox compared to drake
there should be a reward or a strategical reason why you should care about conquering systemsa few examples  fw missions from agents only spawn in conquered systems lvl5 missions something cool at least  npcs in plexes have more bounty as usual but only for the faction holding the system  combine two eve features open a wormhole connecting the system with the militia home system reinforcementsmake enemies suffer  decreased lprewards the more systems occupied the worse  we have incursions they have system wide implications lets do something similar  yes docking rights
one of the biggest disconnects between eve and other mmos is the lack of immediate skill feedback due to game play having skills and skillpoints distributed via the completion of ingame missions and quests would provide that sort of virtual crack that keeps the other major mmos pumping even a small experience point distribution will keep people keeni like the idea of profession arcs that is an excellent way of familiarizing the newbie with pvp or whatever in a gentle way
i couldnt disagree with this one more im so so happy that eve has no kill x wolves get y experience points thats one of the defining good differences between eve and all other mmos the skilling system is unique and a good thing no need to change to an xp system
maybe an icon that tells us the character is new from a new account and new owner it can also be deactivated by people who just created a new altthis will help older players identify genuine newbie players who need help
no weirder than it is in the 21st century
in here because its not a feature or idea or a test server issueif you feel constrained by only having 50 fittingsif you think ccp has just nerfed the much improved fitting system for no apparent reasonplease supportsign this petition for a solution to this nerf1 just remove the limit2 keep a limit but make it much bigger3 enable the use of unlimited local fittings to augment your server fittings4 some combination of the aboveposted for rage consolidation and hopefully effectedit i couldnt understand why we had no response to this simple and easy to fix issuei even asked this question in the ask a dev thread and expected this simple question to be picked early as low hanging fruitlittle did i know they were considering selling us back this functionality we once had for free for mt thats macro transactions btwi request people sign this petition and tell ccp what we think about this ideawithout using crude obscenities pleasei would like to keep the moral high ground
i really cannot understand why 50 is not enough between the two races i can flycaldari and amarr i fly a grand total of about 15 shipsall of which have 13 different fits depending on need i barely have the patience or care for that many fittingsi dont see any reason why unlimited local fittings shouldnt be allowedi mean its storage space on your pcnot on the servers but at the same time i cant believe how many people out there are so butthurt over thisill support it for the fact that local fits should not be restricted thats just dumb common sense
thanks for the support and i am glad that your not effected by this i had over 90 fittings at the time this happened would have had more but they got killed in a patch disaster one timei can fly every t1 hull subcap for each of the 4 races and i can also fly a fair few of the t2 plus some of the industrials i own more than 50 different ships now add into that the fact that some heavily used ships can have upwards of 10 fittings for them a missioner for example could have fittings for short and long range highlow dps highlow tank cap or noncap stable plus different resits combos for different rats and thats just one ship i can beat 50 fittings with just my missioner bss without even trying now it used to be stored on my local pc and used to be unlimitedhowever in a bid to add the ability to take your fittings with you they changed it to serverside fittings so you have them no matter what computer your on which is fine but what they didnt flagmake clear when testing is that they were only storing 50 and due to inadequate testing it failed badly when faced with old fits that contained modules that have changed names or ships with morefewer slots and such so it hit tq with this sudden unannounced arbitrary cap and for many people failed to even port 50 fits across to the servers now this wouldnt have been a major issue if the feature just allowed us to store our 50 best fittings on the server on any computer and run the rest on our home computers but no this patch means you cant use local fittings in game any morethat is why were less than pleased we really do useneed more than 50 fittings and this feature we didnt really need broke that for no good reason and without any warningcommunicationtestingthere was no need to break this feature there are a dozen ways to fix it pick one
im no whiz with computers but unlimited local storage is the option i would have chosen apart from the ships i can fly t1t3  ore there are corp and alliance fits that i need to access regularly server fittings are fine for those who use a different pc every time they logon but i use the same computer daily come on ccp think before you act please
ive had over 100 fits beeing srp director its kinda important to be able to fit all ships and know what they are like and recommend fittings to people which i can now only do for a select few shipsand 50 not enough i got 3 fits for every carriercombat triage combat triage 1 for every dread 1 for every sc thats 20 alone for just capitals 5 logie fits 4 dics 4 hics 3 zealot 3 muninn hey look an other 19 fits right there lol do i really need to continue heh i havent even touched battlecruisers2 for each tier2 bc of each race battleshipsthats like an other 10 fits atleast recons and oh tech 3 ships for which i allone had 20 fits together lol
i stopped saving fittings when the limit came about i havent used the feature since
this is the most ed implementation ever to this game i had nearly 300 fits stored and most all of them were used regularly by request from other pilots unlimited local storage or no storage at all you can go and get kicked in the teeth whoever decided this was a good idea thanks for ruining a working feature i suggest next you remove the undock feature as we clearly dont need to undock when you dont want us to fit ships
with just a small amount of fitting variations for just a few of your favorite ships youre already stretching or breaking the 50 fitting limit when they announced the serverside fitting feature i had supposed it would be in addition to locallystored fittings andor without such heavy limitationswhen it comes down to it a saved fitting doesnt have to consist of anything more then a few dozen itemid numbers and if every single suscriber to eve stored 500 fittings on the server each itd only take around 25 gigs to store them all by my rough guestimation provided there were no optimizations involved this may seem like alot of numbersfittings in a personal sense but for a major mmo database i dont see why it would be a problemexample urlfitting12044204814481317043152611300111019013153814381130611183124561this is redurlthis is the format by which a fitting is conveyed through ingame chat linkage its not even intended with storage purposes in mind and still doesnt take up much space with a specialized system it could be easily more efficientand to save you the trouble if you just really gotta know the example is an enyo
i support thisremote repping neuts should get global agressionand  go blinky  this will discourage ill pvp practice
allow a skill removal session where one gets back half the skill points of removed skills hell charge us 1000 isk per skill point or something and make it a concourse service only available in starter stations or somethingi can think of some skills id gladly purge from my nyx pilot and reuse to make her even more awesome im looking at you exhumers 5at least make it interesting
i think this is a brilliant idea which aside from the obvious gameplay benefits no more futile mashing of keyboard yelling goddamn you ccp and your server11111 could look very cool if done properly kind of like the start of the tyrannis trailor with the close up scene off the naglfars artillery
a communication suggestion would be to adopt a similar formate like engineering reports cryptic does for star trek online they are orderly well structured give a good overview over the current work and state of the pipeline and thus leave a feeling that the devs are doing something and development is moving on
clonejumps are currently a usability nightmare 1 no reason to pause the skill queue jump and resume it again this should be handled automatically behind the scenes if this is a technical requirement 2 allow jumping from ship to ship why do we have to be in a pod to jump all the session timer delays are annoyinginserting implants same as 1 i havent checked maybe its already fixed  updating clones  please send a notification mail if the clone must be upgraded we get insurance expiration mails but no clone update warning mailchanging ships  remove the 30s session timersits probably a workaround to reduce server load or something like that if yes delayed writes or write on undockdisconnect could be a even better optimisation without usability implications
well the fact is i payed twice the cost of a t1 bs for my dram and fittings and i did it because the dram is a t1 frig murder mobile its powerful and lightning fast thats what makes it worth 34 times the cost of a t2 frignerf it and you screw the people who own them if you think its unfair to go up against a dram in your caldari rocket mobile run away and fight something on your level or better yet stfu and buy one yourselfeither way asking ccp to make it easier for you to kill ships is crap there are strategies for killing every kind of ship in eve if you arent getting it done look some up and fit accordinglylet me counter a few ideas posed so far with reality raising the price is crap if anything an inflated price would only make bpc providers farm harder which means more available drams ans the price drops once againboosting the other frigs is crap how far you gonna boost them unless you make them all as fast and powerful as the dram it still has the advantage in the end what you have is the dram being just like everything around it only costing 10 times morenerfing is crap that angers me its better to shoot an eagle between the eyes than clip its wings i would rather see the dramiel bpc removed from the game than see it sullied with a nerf via butthurt its not a god ship its just the games fastest frigate big woop some frig had to belike the old saying goes if everyone in the universe was unique no would be
price as an argument at this stage were it to be accepted as valid then it would only apply if the death rate of the things was equal to the t2 hullst1 bs you compare it with  which is most definitely is nottake the other pirate hulls and run them through the same logic they too are very expensive and very powerful but they die to the slightest slipup and have numerous counters even in their own classbut 25 faster than interceptors which are meant to be fast it is in the name while still having tankspank
nerfing something is never good for the game and surely will not make other ships issues become more easy to acceptthe dramiel has 2 points that need a close look but not a nerf such has its speed and drone bayinstead of nerf the dramiel wy not just give t1 hulls good speed improvements and some drone bay t2 hulls the so demanded racial bonus and some drone bayspeedwould not make t2s overpowered would not nerf pirate frigs some need real love and t1s little more useful but if you ever think the good game is that a 10cts frigg can take down a 100m frigg fingers in the nose you just play the wrong game better play ps3 with downloaded cheats on internet
we already tried the nanoage making it t1t2 frigs only and reinstating it will not make it better as the exact same issues will arisebesides makes no sense to rework 2030 ships just to make one broken hull seem less sofrigate balance t2 navy pirate and higher tiers is actually pretty damn good apart from that one ship with no discernible downsides it needs vulnerabilities or be forced to make sacrifices ie pick one or two from speedtankspank but never all at once just like practically all other hulls dops dramiel can be killed by t1 frigates already just requires a custom fit that is generally useless against all other things
guristas are junk compared to angel in general others have half the slots and double the damage guitarists have half the slots and more range for missiles ie quite useless
this is a really stupid complaint to make a thread about eve is supposed to be harshforget to update your clonebe penalized for iti could swear that the max amount of sp that could be lost was exactly one weeks worth so if you lost say amarr carrier 5 you actually only lost 7 days of it and it is still partially trained is this not correct
5 off the top of your highest sp invested skill
post with your main
you lose the highest level 5 skill you havethats itvaldore  not even closeim sure lots of people would love that idea though
op 1
all three of you are wrongstart sp leveltwo poddings later to emulate opoh noes my sp backboneso what does this tell usa you will not lose 1 week worth of sp its 32d worth in this caseb you will not lose 5 worth of sp i lost 50 of the highest sp skill its possible the 5 is when you have a lot less total spc you will not lose one level 5d the op is talking s
bleh nvm
where was all this isk based bounties are wrong during the twelve months when it was being milked where was it in the epic whine threads in the 4 weeks from nerfannouncement to implementationhindsight is 2020 and all that but blaming ccp for something the null crowd lined up to be complicit in is beyond ridiculousrisk in null is only higher than elsewhere in the weeks it takes to get jammers and bridges online after that you are only safer if you remain dockedif it was the great wild west that some wants to believe then the number of deaths would be significantly higher than they arewith no defensive patrols needed no logistics operations needed and nothing for roams to do other than dock locals up risk is limited to a few hours a week when blobs collide over one timer or another
last time i checked they did own space and there hq is in yulai wich is suprisingly owned by gues what concord
in my assessmentso i have to echo the sentiment of sorry
buy stuff direct trade sell tada new mechanics avoided at the mere cost of sales tax and broker feehmm so you now want to make it a crime to trade via direct trades too  what if you just fail to notice the guys secstatus before engaging in absolutely legitimate trade  last time i checked not even in rl would the policejustice system be so incredibly stupid as to arrest you for buying a used car from a registered sex offender since hey you could have checked or something like thatso ok direct trade out of the question then well how about replace direct trade with  undock warp to random bookmark jettison scoop up with alt too complicated and risky you say  or maybe also penalize people for looting wrecks of outlaws  come onwell how about selling 1 trit for 1 bil isk then  wait what now you also want to deny people trading on the market with people of opposing status  or maybe make it so that only outlaws can trade in lowsec while only positives can deal in highsec  what about 00 then how do you handle it  or maybe you just mean penalize them randomly since they cant see whos sellingbuying stuff  waaaait a minute now youre proposing people to see who is the issuer of the order  what about the fact you cant select the best order and you end up buying from the best priced one anyway and you still end up buying from or selling to an outlaw if youre an honest citizen  the hell  now you want us to be able to select the order too what if i have two guys one outlaw and one honest citizen each with their own corp and each has the share for the other guys corp just pay anything you want as dividends wait what  you want to make it a penalty to simply receive dividends from that  well how about the great new griefing method you just introduced destroying any targets sec status down to at least zero seriously stop now before you end up having to change just about every imaginable mechanic that can be used to exchange goods andor fundsunenforceable things or extremely hard to enforce or unfair to even think of enforcing without regards to circumstances should never go past initial hasty proposal statusim going to just echo the yeah no sentiment here
to plug in the loopholes1 all sec status drops in this way will come with a warning so newbies wont be tricked into it2 all of these sec status drops will penalize both parties by reducing sec status all the way down to the exact amount of whoevers lower including direct trades3 knowing that the criminal is an outlaw on the run and intentionally buying the car off of him to throw off the trail or aiding and abetting him in any other way is still a crime4 ejectingjettisoning will also have the same sec status drop as a trade since that is aiding and abetting as well5 accepting a contract from an outlaw will have the same penalty6 if an outlaw attempts to accept a contract a mail will be notified to whoever made the contract asking if he is willing to accept the consequences of aiding an outlaw if so same sec status penalty applies to the contract maker7 make no mistake u can still market tradeu just have to accept the consequences for doing business with criminals8 all market orders can be arranged with the option of sec status factored in and all outlaw orders will be highlighted in red9 if even 1 corp share is owned by an outlaw the corps ceo will be penalized the same way the instant he starts paying dividends10 once again all of these sec status drops come with a warning11 all of the above is void if both parties r above 5no more loopholes no more riskaversion behind high sec anonymity circumventing sec status and not having to earn back your high sec access
get out
i propose giant floating pink elephants be added to space everywhere just because anyone who offhandedlyand correctly dismisses this idea as stupid and pointless is obviously just being snarky and i r disappoint how dare you make reasonable judgements that pointless meaningless crap shouldnt be added to the game we should obviously give my random floating giant pink space elephants a serious discussionid sarcasm here but honestly if you managed to miss it i fail to care
translation it works and ure mad about it
translation its such complete fail that he has determined you to be beyond reasoning leaving nothing to be said beyond no thats stupid and various iterations thereof since hes unable to communicate on a level low enough to actually debate it with youyou apparently support cutting the game in half changing massive amounts of game mechanics and adding an abundance of grief just because you feel like it no thats stupid
explain exactly how does it cut the game in half when all a 10 has to do is rat back up above 5 or r u just talking out of your ass as well and think being 10 should have no consequences
all we have to do is change the entire game in random arbitrary ways for no reason in order to make it so that 10s have to rat up to 5 is that what youre trying to say no thats stupidwhat the crap im bored enough to humor this inane concept1 have you read your own proposals there are conflicts2 random antired emo rage penalties noted3 you realize this isnt actually a proposal or rule of any sort right so why are you listing it as one4 im not even sure what you mean by this its halarious that you think letting 10s ruin other peoples sec status against their will is a good idea a 10 can jump into any ship left in space there are fair amount of these and the original owner takes a sec hit lol this also conflicts with 1 just how does that work eh would i be able to prevent 10s from jumping in ships i leave idle in space does that mean being a criminal means you cant steal how does that make sense if so why cant i prevent whoever i want from doing so if i can awesome youve just destroyed a game feature congrats i can now leave all my ships safely drifting in space in highsec protected by concord why bother with stations56 okay so lets cut the economy in half the red market and the not red market78 fancy oh wait actually it isnt9 oh so 1 share owner of any corporation can go red and begin screwing over the entire corp at will that sounds great doesnt it you realize shares cant be taken away right10 feel free to repeat yourself no really feel free to repeat yourself11 arbitrary limit for the arbitrary ideas notedshow me on the doll where the naughty reds touched you your rabid devotion to centering the entire game around sec status is halarioustldr no thats stupid
i am pro
stop it with the red  green crap please i like being able to see when people are shooting meif this goes through i will not be able to see that since red and green on the eve overview are the same color to mei like the idea but would strongly prefer the method to visualize this be something other than color otherwise its another piece of the eve ui i cant use very well much like the map and heat management part of the uithe last thing this game needs is more freaking color codingbut hey who cares about color blind people amrite
1 nice thinking
so simple yet so obviousmake it blue instead
that could work if the right shade is choseni would really prefer they move away from color coding the ui at all but that would be a decent enough compromise since i know a redesigned ui with colorblindness in mind will never freaking happenthere are a ton of different type of colorblindness redgreen is the most common followed by blueblack but really if you want to use colors in a ui you really need a good system of creating contrast so that colorblind peeps can use it toothe current eve ui is complete  at this and considering the lack of concern i got at the ui panel and at the dev qa regarding this i dont see it changing anytime soonso really judging that the csm sees this as a good idea i think itll get through and itll just be one more kick in the  for meand yes i like the idea but would rather another indicator was used other than color maybe an icon or somethingjust stop making the ui worse for me i mean first wide screen goes away then that stupid autopilot change now this  its really really frustratingalso if any of the csms want help understanding what im talking about i would be more than happy to answer any questions they have
a large number of corporations in this game could be considered dead meaning that there is 0 activity and only 1 or 2 characters usually alts remain in the corporation this has the action of freezing a large number of corp names and tickers as many of these were from the early days of the gameproposal after 180 days of no action within a corporation any character logging in the corporation is closed all the assets end up in the personal hangar of the ceo and the wallet is divided among shareholders if the corporation owns all the shares the wallet empties into that of the ceo all the characters in the corp will then be put in npc corporationsthis will remove a lot of clog from the game as well as free up corp tickers and names and all that business if someone has a cool tickername they really want to keep they should have to play the game to do so
cant think of a unique name or just really mad that some stupid nameticker you want is taken
sorry if this is a repeat of already submitted ideas1 can we please have some type of sov structure for wormholeswhile my corp understands that wh space is not connected to new eden we think it would be nice if there were claim units that could be deployed in wh space only 2 after being able to claim sov then it would be nice to have upgrade structures they need not be as powerful as 00 new eden structures my corp has held a wh now for over a year and a half there have been times when we have gone three or more weeks in a row with no grav belts very few ladar and sleeper sites 3 it would be cool to be able to build or take in a station egg into the wh even if it is a smaller version of normal this would allow services to the players that live in wh space could even make it require increased fuels or something to run might get some good fights with players wanting to take over the system and station 4 for the love of god let us moon mine in wh space we have 50 moons in there that we can do nothing with could have them produce moon goo that is only good for t3 production or some kind of new ship or mods in future expansions we dont care we just want to mine em 
1 no wormholes are specifically unclaimable for a reason2 no even a c1 can produce more money than a 10 truesec system3 i would agree this one would be rather cool i am sure the answer will still be no however4 no hell no dont break the game by adding moon mining to wormholes where they can be near invincible and create massive isk with no riskneedless to sayunsupported
do not turn wspace into 00space please all this sovereignty stuff is one of the main blobbing factors because these structures have massive ehp and as you cannot bring supercaps to the wspace and bringing dreadnoughts is far more tedious that subcaps so the one who owns that station in wspace gains too much advantage over the one who wants to capture itso i think you just want to make your happy carebearing even easier
awww you and your corp want to feel special how cute working as intended farm your staticobviously you know nothing of sov warfare its hard enough with capitals this would only serve to further entrench wh dwellers materials for t3 production are already found in wh space i wouldnt mind seeing hidden ice belts in wh space as i believe that if players want to be 100 self sufficient they should be able to but adding more resources for the sake of more resources is stupid
made this post knowing there would be some people that just cant help but to flame that is ok with out players making suggestions the game would go nowhere to those of you talking about hp on sov structures yes i know regular new eden sov claims have high hp what i am suggesting is sov structures that are for wh only they could be balanced to be able to be taken out with a battle ship or battle cruiser fleet hell we pay the same pi taxes in there as ever other player in eve we want to know to whom and why if we dont get comparable benefits of normal space living as for moon goo i do not see the problem it wont break the game in fact i think it would enhance it maybe some t3 battleships or something in the future that would require wh moon goo have any of you ever tried keeping a pos supplied with ice products in a wh it can be a nightmare our exit is always in low sec think of a corp keeping 25 pos fed in there and what it would do for the ice market not to mention the control tower and structures market to the flamer crying about carebears in wh space obviously you have never lived in a wh try it some time and compare it to the logistics of 00 life we have no local in there much less intel chans to let us know people are moving through our space the only way to survive is guard toons directional scans and pvp skills so your post is about useless try constructive criticism it is much better received
so here is from wh dweller sounds almost like vault dweller p1 hell no wh dont need sov but i agree wh need more love maybe in form of upgrades but nothing compared to current sov mechanic wh will never be yours it is belonging to people living in it if you can keep it its yours no super sov structure makes it more yours than it is already2 as said before i agree wh need some love upgrades maybe but they should focus more on spawning more wh than spawning more sleeper  gravi  magneto  etc sites and they should eat tremoundous ammount of fuel maybe materials that could only be gained from wh moons or maybe some totally different thing ive read somewhere about wormhole stabilizer proposalas someone stated  farm your static  thats the beauty of wh so move from your c3 with hi static into something more interesting and you will get more money and more pvp3 no no and no fix pos mechanic that will help we dont need stations in here stations as they are now are indestructible not to mention link with sov mechanic anything in wh space must be destructible i dont want people to be albe to dock and hide if you want to hide in wh turn on that cloak you have if you want more services thats where pos mechanic can be discussed maybe repair module or being able to repackage things or reproces but it all comes to changing pos behavior maybe just for wh maybe for all space 4 i agree that lack off moon mining not moongoo mind you by itself is something that is unresonable why cant we mine we have the technology p but what shall we mine is question maybe mentioned fuell for wh specific structures maybe materials for future t3 ships t3 frigsdestroyers anyone but i dont want t3 bsstldrwh need more lovebut dont make it another 00
if anyone disagrees with me they are flaming and trolling tinfoil pure speculation but im of the opinion that the game would be just fine most ideas are pretty crapedit in all seriousness dont expect many changes to wh space its one of the few features that has been introduced with excellent reception and thrived since its inception ccp doesnt usually make a habit of iterating on things that work as is
ah right you are i mixed him with mercutio the one tybalt killed but it doesnt make anything i said after that little mix up any less trueanywho its been fun thanks for all the discourse although it would have been nice to have more thoughtout counterarguments to go against
regarding the jamming of npcs they just gave them some nice jam strenght but fit eccm and you should be fine however the funny thing is that people whine about the fact that they get jammed but they also dont get hit by the railguns but aparently nobody bothers with that
maybe youre just afraid of change
although the new combat hotkeys added a lot of functionalities it often feels a whole lot clumsier and slower than the previous incarnation the most glaring problem with the current version of combat hotkeys is that you are no longer allowed to use hotkeys directly on the objects you click from the screen even though the overview and the selected items menu fully recognize the object you are selecting without any problems in order to understand why this inconvenience occurs well have to take a look at how the new combat hoykey system works combat hotkeystarget approach align warp etc only work when these two conditions are met1 an object has to be selected the selected object is shown in the selected items menu and is highlighted on the overview the user can select on object by clicking on it or using the updown key to scroll through the overview2 the overview has to be set on focus when the overview is focused the window will show a white box within the window boundaries the user can set the focus to the overview by clicking on it or using the set overview focus hotkey the updown key for selection only works when the overview is set on focusby looking at this the reason why combat hotkeys dont work outside the overview becomes fairly simple even though the object is selected the overview is not set to focus simply removing the need to focus on the overview wont be advisable as there is no way the client could know whether the user is chatting or issuing an order from the hotkey especially when using hotkeys that bind to alphabets or shiftctrlalttherefore i propose this simple fixwhen a user clicks on an object in space automatically set the focus to the overview this way the user can use combat hotkeys by simply clicking at the object and using the hotkey instead of trying to find the object from the overview or resorting to the selected items window the way combat hotkeys work will be the opposite to the previous methodhotkeyclick  clickhotkey but its better than nothing
you are mistaken hotkeys work in space just fine i dont know how youve managed to miss that i suggest you undock right now hold w and click on something in space i suspect youre a little confused at how the hotkeys are supposed to work
no the people saying keep it and expand upon it  is the 89 of the playerbase that is not in null but is still affected through skyrocketing prices on everything due to inflation
i tought only titans and black ops could create bridges and last time i checked my black ops isnt a capital shipthis is already the case why do you think people cyno in caps and not just jump them trough titan bridges cause according to you that saves fuel rightand regarding the skill gues what the skill jump portal generation doesand activitaion is not the creation of the bridge that only costs 1000 cap for a titan bridge and 100 for a bo bridge but it is the fuel cost for ships using your bridgethats some wicked stuff ehh you idea is already ingame o0do you really think people care if they are flinged away from the cyno you do know the cyno lets everyone in system including enemy fleet know that there are people jumping in there so i for one would be very very very happy if my ship gets thrown out 100 kms and survive the onslaught
owning a titan is enough of a hindrance as is with the one redeeming factor being the bridge and maybe getting to one shot some idiot every now and thenplus the changes youve described are already in place you can bridge a titan through another titan if you really want to but it just uses a ton of fuel
for fittings bookmarks notes contacts datacores and other junk end to those threadsinstead of a player having a character sheet as top tab they would access their ship computer sorry ive been watching alot of tng lately which would allow them to store as many fittings bookmarks contacts pre prescribed contracts contracts you use alot to sell bulk items which you could reupload edit the ship computer would store youre character sheet and have access to your training regimenalso you can make notes which would be called datacores which could store all kinds of useful information on them the calculator and notepad browser could be moved up here for roleplaying your datacores can be traded or hacked from your ship computer if someone decides to hack your ship and browse your cpu databanksyou could also access the map bounty hunter tracker agent tracker stock tracker other various tools that immerse you inside the universe of eve online
fantastic this needs to be kept up
while i generally support the newer features even the pi stuff i really miss the polishing of the older features for example that goddamn pinned windows dont stay where they are supposed to be problem which has been plaguing the gui for like forever it has always been around since ive started playingi support the thread authors ideas about less shiny junk more polished old stuff please ccp listen to your playerbase and the csmi really love the ccp soundwaves team work so far keep it up guys
well for starters i would say that the bounding spheres of all ships would need to become much larger but the bounce coefficient needs to become far more lenient in the outer layers and the way a small bounding sphere interacts with a large one needs to be readjusted so for instance a small ship could have far less of an effect on a large ships trajectory but the small ship should be able to intrude in the large ships sphere to some degree without being bounced back like mad and while inside a pos shield all of them would be significantly reduced optionally also reduce speed when too close together but only while inside a shield and when too close to another shipbasically a sort of enforced collision avoidance ship navigation automated subroutine if you want to consider the rp implications that would work from a practical gameplay standpoint as a very soft antiblob technique which would also have an impact on the way bumping worksso say if theres a bunch of supercaps they would tend to drift apart to a relatively large distance unless all ships are actively trying to move towards the same point and it should be harder and harder to clump together the closer they get and the more of them are aroundhowever at the same time battleships should be able to move with relative impunity where supercap movement would be already somewhat restricted cruisers could flock together relatively closely or even fly by the barely moving and still attempting to approach one another supercaps whereas frigates would hardly feel any difference from the current modelin other words ships should act far less like giant rubber balls with a relatively clear size and instead act slightly more like a bunch of objects charged with the same sign of static electricity but the strength of the interaction would be smaller the larger the sig difference would be
interesting ideai like it still trying to wrap my imagination around it more but it seems workable and a good way of helping the blobbing issues
no it was only announced at fanfest infront of 300 people and put on youtube 3 months before it was implemented
buff the legion please dear godno onemidslot shipsco ops cloak for bo so we can get into 00 but limit number of bos per alliance to stop huge bo blobs appearing from nowheretime limit the cov ops cloak to 15 mins before a reset to nerf afk cloakers and make cloak game play a bit more challenging thank you sul
ok so i am seeing a lot of back and forth development of ideas related to fix this fix that kind of ideas which are mostly really good i think but would i be wrong to say that most of us here think that ship balancing in general for ccp should work like this 1 not making ships obsolete nor overshadowing their similar counterparts every ship has a specific purpose2 when buffing  nerfing ships as needed be sure to consider how it affects its role making sure those purposes can not be done better by any other shipanyone think this is reasonablepersonal note i still want to see dreads with more turrets also happy easter
way to go poaching peoples ideas off them btw  loland the idea was shot down pretty fast because of how laughable it is yes i can understand that trying to get the figures correct may make it slightly less of an argument but its not like fleetwarps even takes those things into consideration all ull do is make a blob auto deblob once out of warp which tbh will only add to its defencesno need to actively deblob so were not all a massive concentrated target for bombers guys the server does it for us woohoo
im reposting my first post as some people are asking for a more generalised balancing set of ideas so i thought id offer you lot thislove some criticism on this be ultra harsh so long as u spank me afterwards lol
first off logistics and i mean the convoy of freighters style needs to make at least a partial comebackseverely nerfing or even eliminating jumpbridge capabilities would be one of the necessary facetsin fact you could go even further and completely replace jumpbridges with playerbuilt stargates instead but more on the necessary limitations laterthe other aspect would be to significantly slow down the crossuniverse travel speed of jumpdrive capable vessels a dread should not be able to cross the entire galaxy map anywhere in the same order of magnitude for duration as a frigate warping to zero and using stargatesa much more significant depletion of capacitor reserves when jumping combined with a short jump drive spoolup time time in which the cyno needs to be kept lit on the other side and maybe even a temporary postjump debuff on capacitor regeneration speed should do the trick quite nicelythe larger the ship the longer the spoolup time so for instance carrier or dread could jump in 10 to 15 seconds a supercarrier might need 20 to 30 seconds a titan would need even up to a full minute but a black ops could maybe jump with but a second or two or even no spoolup and a freighter with somewhere along the lines of 5 seconds you know very rough ballpark figureswe need not just smallersized farms and fields which frankly i doubt will do that much good but on the other hand what we do need for sure is more of the larger stuff  in particular player owned outpostswhile there might be some coding limitations to one per solar system are there any from a gameplay perspective they should no longer even figure into the sov fights so fiercely let the tcu be the only thing left as far as thats concerned and let us place an outpost at every planet in fact let us place multiple outposts per planetand as far as farms and fields go how about this  asteroid attractor gravity well generators placeable in asteroid belts to increase the ore respawn rates anomaly stabilizers placeable near wormholes to increase maximum mass that can pass through andor duration andor even regenerate transit mass on an hourly basis miniposlike structures with no projected shield that can be anchored anywhere especially near gates all of them playermanufactured and the max allowable size of them determined by development indices or even new ihub upgradesalso back on the matter of playeroperated stargatesfirst there would need to be a limit to stargates per system by having unoccupied gravity resonance nodes that was the correct technobabble for it right be the only place you could mount one and there would also be a need to have a separate limit with regards to size of stargates allowed in each of them which would determine their maximum connection rangethey would cost at least as much as an outpost with similar build style consume oodles of fuel while onlined as a main economic drawback they are capable of being disabled through regular attacks as an additional economic drawback would be able to be used by anybody to jump through as the huge tactical drawback to the equally important tactical advantage of having them in the first place with only a minor economic advantage the ability to charge usage fees for passage based on ship mass with corpallianceblues determining discounts and thats pretty much it enemies just pay a tad bit moreeach of the gates needs to select another gate of same size in its range as jump target and after downtime if they match they function much like a regular gate pair until either of them runs out of fuel or until either of them get damaged too much by enemy attacksownership change does not reset the link it has to be manually severed and it only happens at dt too want it down now shoot it
obviously most of the solar systems would only have one or at best two spots for small gates lucky to even reach fully across a constellation while some might have none also not guaranteed to have any spots for a medium gate in many systems to link between constellations and very few systems per region would have a spot for large gates at all to link across regionsalso back on the matter of wormhole stabilizers the highest tier of it available only with the best ihub upgrade would be able to simply keep just the wormholes leading into wildspace from completely collapsing indefinitely while also slowly restoring mass allowance even if that might mean it can take quite a while to get any decently sized ship through wormholes into normal space should be able to collapse even if you dont use them at all at best these structures just delaying the time to colapsein case the structure is destroyed while stabilizing the hole the wormhole instantly closesall those farms and fields structures would also consume some sort of fuel and the wormhole stabilizing ones would consume most of itin wildspace since you cannot claim sov you can not anchor any of those stabilizing structures so you have to keep defending the other side too while also being most likely limited to a small trickle of mass even forced to just use the pods most of the time and maintain two separate sets of ships on either side
if were adding structures why not a mining platform that a barge could anchor to so they could mine more safely i mean by the platform offering a mild shield boost so system campers dont shut every thing down just cause one i was in null the number one killer of all indy activity was the long afk system camper if a barge could tank a mild attack for a little bit while the main pvp force can respond to then many more would actually consider null mining to be worth will venture
i have done much mining in this game over time and i have done a decent amout of null mining but i keep running in to the same short fallsif im to haul for some one else i have to spend a around a half hour play with a calculator to see what the other guy mined to buy his ore i believe if their was a hanger to auto purchased the ore going in to it at a set rate from the hangers owner this would inspire group mining activities in high and nullnull is way to easy to shut down completely from on player in any unknown ship cloaked up chilling in local all day i believe a mining platform that would supply a decent but weaker shield to those anchored to it to counter its nice shield affects it could be made to burn a fuel say heavy water it would function in a small part like a pos tower would take some anchoring and fuel to run can be left up like a pos i believe no guns would be fine unless they feel the need for say 2 low in lasers to help with rats when no one is at the site while its left on over nightim seeing alot of complaints that null cant be self supplied on their ores i really believe such a simple unit could be very use full i have heard of some ideas in the past an chatter that a rorq or orca should move it around but im not sold on that idea in the spirit of poss i was thinking it could be a multi part structure that could be upgraded able say adding more anchor points or some thin use for towards what a mining post could beim not sure if its a decent idea but say a high end version that a large null operation may like i would say to add a refinery that could hit perfect refining and that it would refine the ore thats placed in its auto purchase hangeras i believe the future of poss will be a single structure thats able to change shapes as diffrent modules are installed i believe that this mining platform could be made as the leader in this drastic rebuild of play held structures
yes 00 eve definitely needs more people spending hours on mind numbing tedium
get more accounts it will be a lot less boring
i like the way that they seem to annoy a whole lot of people
tabs and varying levels of restricted access to pos ship maintenance arrays seems kinda strange that i can stash stuff securely in corporate hanger arrays yet everyone has equal access to all the ships in the ship maintenance arrayan easier way to anchor structures in specific locations the current system is painfulneed the ability to refit t3 ships better looking towers and arrays the towers look artistically horriblebetter uidrastically reduce or remove the penalties for refining orestreamline the production and extraction process with moon mining and reactions having to link multiple silos in various ways is tediousredesign poss and arrays so theyre easier to live out of especially so in wormholes most 00 systems dont have stations which means we need to live out of and depend entirely on poss
at best such a system could be introduces as kind of last days in the accademy storyline where each mission nets an appropriate skill level boosting data injector
oh wow this is an excellent idea
yes
one of the best ways to improve the npe is to overhaul the ui which is already badly needed for all new eden residents not having a million and one options thrown in their faces will helpgive new players more to do than mining and mission running mining in high sec is painful and often impossible due to the army of mining bots running unchecked and rampant using the excuse new players can participate in all aspects of the game right on day one is crap and we all know it they dont have the skill points experience nor the game knowledge to do this
015226 hint owner pi ogan can only have 50 saved fittingsand i hardly have any fittings since ive been changed computers so muchon my old computer with all of my saved fittings there are 84 xml files thats just the number of ship types not including the variation of fittings for each so a limit of 1000 might be okay
while 50 is a lot i do keep a lot of different fits usually from fits i see linked and other fits for specific things or even humerous fitssuch as a logisitics hyperion or minerion pvp hyperion pve hyperion wtferion etc and it adds up quick i do love the server saved idea but yeah needs more spacelink a gmail account or something to it for additional space or something lol do what most us companies are doing and outsource the stuff

also to add on a weee bit more for science and industry i would love to have less multiple windows pop up for starting jobs having something all on one screen would be lovely also curious if having something like a productioninvention calculator like evemeep would be good just have another tab that you can go through bps select one and if you have market info exported to a file it can use those from whatever region you want to select from and it will calculate the cost and profit of it and same thing for invention i figure it cant really be something that will off balance anything since obviously it would be pretty much the same thing as what evemeep will do but it will make things easier for new players as they wont be overwhelmed with having to install 3rd party programs and what not plus it would keep more people focused into the game rather then alt tabbing out all the time
re default windows sizes too largei totally agree where this is important is people with small screens re fonts could use a little flexibilitysometimes on a large screen its very hare to read certain buttons or text re left or right menu barcould we have a large or small icon in the menu again a large vs small screen issue
1 afk lightorange light to signify your afk and perhaps allow a custom message to be displayed to people who try to contact yousorry i am away for the moment please contact such and such or look atblah2 on overview i would like to see next to the stargates what sec they lead to3 show the actual percentage left on shieldarmourhull on targets
space ui no popup dialog windows making bookmarks looking up systems alliances corps etc the problem is that these windows disable everything else give us back the small tactical display window or hot keys to jump immediately between different camera zooms tactical overlay display velocity vectors of ships this should only add small load on client side tactical overlay provide different grid overlay options 1 spherical coordinate grids current with longitudinal angle divisions with angle numbers 00 through 36 like runway markings on the equitorial plane 2 rectangular coordinate grids navigation give us a command to fly away from things opposite of approach popup map show waypoints  systems in the route log show new ships entering the grid also audio cue would be nice dscan cycle timer for scanner so you know when you can hit it also give us autorepeatmap ui separate buttons and hotkeys and for galactic map and solar system map
basicly right now an older player knows things likeif i orbit to close too fast my weapons cant track if i fly right at someone i lower the transversal velocity to 0 and thus its like im not moving as far as hit goeshowever ask any player how combat works in eve and they will tell you its just approach and fire orbit shoot forget they will quote that there is no skill in eve combat its just weapon range  hit change no that i have outline what i see as a problem here is some solutions 1 turret tracking guide in game as part of tutorial just stick this
or turn the option in the overview for this on
yes becuase excel sheets in space is much better than a working ui with visual feedback in fact lets take what you say a step further why is our shields armor and hull shows with graphics that should just be numbers on the bottom same function rightjust put everything in a list not to mention why do i need to see the transversal for every ship and object in spacei dont need any of that information omg clutter just one ship thats all i need to worry about
i need the transversal of all the ships in an enemy gang so i know im kiting all their damage tyvm
yes becuase adding an option for new players to help them understand how it works when they only have to deal with one target at a time means you wont be able to use the overview once you need more complex expanded informationand my idea totally threatens your current gameplay less excel sheets more uibut nothing wrong with having excell sheets for when thats what you need look at wow people make custom uis so that wow looks like eve with spreet sheets and infor all over the place however most people dont want or need that level of clutteryou have to have a simple system to start with the option of more complex systems as you get more advanced and need more information drowning people in information is not the way to keep new players aroundi hate hearing people say that eve combat is all click and forget
i miss that guide so much i emailed them about one time and said they have no plans on putting it back up idk why as it was awesome as for this suggestion i like it im hoping when they redo the ui they have like a little window of brief info at the target its self like transversal size type etc and i think the past few trailers had something similar to a little info box at the target so something like that would be cooland i agree if ccp is going to focus on making the game prettier then they should change a few things so people will actually look at it instead of focusing on a big box of text the whole time though id personally would like a gradient bar but all the same lol
support for the general idea of utilising such basic and clear methods to help move eve away from excell in space keep the excell for people who have grown attached to it but in many ways its just an inconvenient clutter of information instead of a helpful tool that allows you to take in important tactical information at a glancethings like vicible velocity vectors would help too engine trails can provide this info too to some extent so i could watch what is actually happening on the view screen instead of watching for numbers in the overview table showing that raw info is pointless for most users in many cases they just need to know when the conditions are right so that their guns have a good chance to hit and when they dont hit so oftenwell or at all
exactly its not about taking functionality why do people always get so defensive at the idea of new players havign an easier time even if it wont effect thier gameplayalso i found the old guide on eve files
i would say one of the best ways to deal with it all would be something akin to the google workload adapted for ccpevefirst off have at least one team bff not necessarily all the current team members nor just the current team members to permanently work on little fixes on a constant basis and nothing else without fixed release schedules but encouraged to pick the workload in such a way that several new microimprovements would roll out every 4 to 10 weeks at most hey if they can roll out one at a time per week great but 3 months in between would be a bit too much if you get two teams or a larger team even better ideally at least half of them would be volunteers as opposed to forced assignments especially the leads if anything like that even exists at all in such a team format and the team composition not necessarily frozen but thats administrativehr stuff so i doubt its worth dwelling on itthen you split their workload in three separate stripsthe first strip the bulk of it say 50 would be determined by semiregular crowdsourcing in fact one of the first assignments for one of the new team bffs could be to brainstorm about a way to streamline that prioritization some rudimentary agenda item browser and a tiny evegate hook for any player to browse it and redistribute his personal focus choices however he sees fit the team bff members would then also attempt to guesstimate the needed workload for some of the higherpriority items and cherrypick the shortest estimate ones first leaving enough time for the mass of players to change their mind about whether they still consider the larger time estimate ones important enough considering the probable workloadthe second strip the middlesized one say 35 would be determined by ccp management since hey theyre still the boss afterallthe third smallest but not too small strip so the remaining 15 or so minimum would be reserved for pet projects of the actual team bff members whatever they personally feel would need improvement without any out of the team influence on what that might be no amount of player whining nor bossyerrbosses to mess with itmost importantly they should keep an open communication pipeline of rapidfire updates about what theyre working on right now and what the rough ideas for a fix might be so the community as a whole could be used as a sounding board or brainstorming bucket you know something like a phrase or two every couple of days or so that would be awesome
nice akita though i think it doesnt stand a fireballschanceiniceland of being implemented i think the idea is a very good one though i personally would bump up team bffs pet project share to 20

all faction items should be available on the market contracts should not be the only market for faction modules
damage indicator for items that can break advancedfaction cristals and such
its also far more costly than the interceptors and doesnt have the warp speed of some of them or the resists youre argument is subjective comparative and other big words i dont know the meaning ofwhat i do know is that this whole nerf is being caused by nothing more than butthurt plain and simplebutt hurt hurt butt people whos butts have been injured as in omgzorz111 teh dramiel is 2 fast for my cheap ship my bad skillz and my hit fit not fair nerf it wid fyreas revealed in my book 10000 statistics i pulled out of my ass 98 of all nerf requests come from some crapsuleer who got pwnt and couldnt figure out how to get even so they ask the devs to cheat for them by making the offending vessel easier for them to counter with whatever garbage shipskillsfit they use
because warp speed is always a major factor in pvp also you will lose ten times more of any other factiont2 frigate out there compared to the dramiel so in the long run the dramiel is in fact a cheaper investment
warpspeed really how many cases off the top of your head can you mention where that has been a deciding factor  in most cases it actually gets you killed as you come out ahead of da blob on long warpsresists really have you even flown an interceptor last i checked they do not have t2 resists at all but only the racial resist bonus not even sure about racial not that is matters much as they dont exactly have stellar base tank values to begin with
are you suggesting ccp add some real consequences to piracy this wont go well with the pirates 
who said they absolutely had to besides u if they dont want to put in the effort to then they can live with the consequencessimple1 such as2 so far im not getting much but this is stupid this is stupid this is stupid cause i said so x 90013 its another example of the realism that someone thought they could use in their argumentsmaybe if u actually read it u might not be so ignorant now4 read 11 gj on talking out your ass once again5  6 which can be remedied by going above 5 or staying a 10 and using that market what part of that dont u understand7  8 see 5  69 if your corp members cant be trusted its your fault for doing so especially by giving them ownership of your corp and since ure that stupid a spy can easily steal all your assets anyway10 most likely i will because ure the one ranting with halfassed arguments11 see 2and u trying so hard to disprove a proposal by going stupid stupid stupid while saying little else is even better because it only shows how uve got nothing and if u really must know ive found many 10 high sec mining alts ripe with hulks and mackinaws save the doll question for them cause im sure they could use a shoulder to cry on when they cant carebear behind their alt in peace
there are all ready real consequences to piracy being unable to comfortably enter highsec most notablyyou and the op just want the bad people to go away unfortunately for you game mechanics explicitly allow the bad people to exist ergo you are playing the wrong game
there are a lot of people whining about csm members brushing the idea off with little thought mainly this is because the idea is terrible stop getting mad about csm members not thinking every idea is great and running off to tell ccp about it that isnt what they are for  also to the carebears that whine about players with low sec standing  without piratesgriefers the game would be completely and utterly pointless the thing that puts eve ahead of the other games at least in my opinion is that there is always that element of risk without pirates there is no point in the game being an mmo you might as well just play single player being a pirate is harder than you think making money is difficult and you tend to go through ships a lot faster than missioners for example    removing the primary source of income for some of these people ie stopping their industrytradermission alt giving them the isk they need is frankly stupid
cant support the proposal ofc there are some interesting ideas in the thread tho like taxing direct isk transfers as an isk sink people could avoid it via contracts but then it registers in the history
there are plenty of other mmos that address these issues by putting in safeguards against player deceptionswhy do you choose to come to a game that advertises itself as a cold dark and harsh universe and caters to hyper competitive players and try to change it i think we can have a game or two in which anything goes
having to use alts to allow you into lo sec is a minor inconvenience so you can stop it right there with the oh i cant comfortably go into hi sec wah wah bswhat the op proposes is an actual mechanic that is harder to bypass thus all the crying pirates in this thread including you
i really dont like how csm responded to this ideabut idea itself is stupid im not csm so i can be like this d
this threat should of been locked after the first reply just sayian
so lets say urist mcminer is jetcanning in his shiny new osprey stabs mccutthroat strolls along and flips his can since apparently urist is aiding and abetting stabs his sec status is now all the way down with hiscongrats youve invented sec ganking
it doesnt work it griefs huge sectors of the game for nothing more than your personal whim and it destroys the whole sandbox thing you cannot force people to play the game the way you want them to how would you counter a big scary lowsec pirate contracting from his jita alt to a brand new character then on to the 10 followed by biomassing the newbie and starting again theres a way to get around your insane little system
yes posting a simple no to a complete  idea is short sighted obviouslygas this threadtia
1 how exactly hard is it when a 10 can a stay dockedsafespot until he gets a bite and b turn on his carebear alt whenever hes being camped or in any other way facing even slightest amount of risk2 how hard would it be instead to rat up to 53 this is only gonna put in real consequences of being 10 by limiting their time in low sec so that prey or other players can get a better chance at venturing into low sec and not get blobbed every time no more no less1 ure assuming urist and stabs arent the same person behind the keyboard2 revision in high sec the flipped will not take the sec hit and if the flipper is 5 or below npc customs will confiscate everything he stole out of the can in case they r the same person good thing u brought that up so congrats uve just helped me plug up another loophole 1 theres your sandbox back how hard was that2 recycling low sec status is an exploit and bannable3 and ull still be devoting sp training sp time spent and isk on skillbooks purely on throwaways4 u still have to haul it all the way out of jita contracts dont haul for u
1 you know nothing about how lowsec works please go live there for a while so you can understand what it is that youre doing2 why should people have to bother when the system as it is works fine3 it wont limit the time they spend in lowsec it will simply make them find ways around things you cannot eliminate lowsec piracy thats why its lowsec 1 lets assume they arent2 so youd like to see jetcan mining and can flipping removed entirely as well and where did npc customs come from theft is none of their business all they care about is contraband doesnt matter if the npcs ate it or the flipper stole it urist mcminer the newbie has just lost out what next remove suicide ganking too make highsec into hello kitty online quote1 irrelevant thats not giving the sandbox back as its still going to be hard as hell to actually live in lowsec without stuff getting hauled in2 im sure ccp will love to devote resources to banning all of lowsec 3 takes what five minutes to train contracting the high sec status hauler alt is still the one doing the moving the newbie is just distributing4 if youre a 10 with a highsec shopping alt chances are you know how to haulwhat would you do about leaving stuff in a corp hanger if im 10 and i dump some ammo into my corp hanger is everyone who takes it 10 now too more sec status griefing
this made me chuckle shoot me up an email and ill teach you how to comfortably bypass that consequence free of charge
the amount of fail contained within this idea and the concepts that have been invented to support is simply amazingremove stealing from the game oh wait things that get stolen get confiscated for some reason so why is there stealing in the game at alladd sec status griefing fix by simply removing all game features that get in the way perhaps thatll solve that whole stealing problemchangebreak corporation shares mechanic corp hangars corp everythingdivide the entire game between red and not red so much for that whole completeinteraction thing you were going for ccp the bad people shot someone in lowsec so we need to drop a nerf bomb on the entire gamemaybe we should split the entire eve server into 2 shards and upon falling below 5 youre simply moved to the red server thatll fix everythingno thats stupidif youre too illiterate and void of thought to understand why these are bad things frankly id be surprised if youre able to feed and dress yourself
im to lazy to search if someone already mentioned thisbut has anyone considered the consequences of this idea on pirating i was almost on the boat until i realized it would mean a pirate will never again get a single cent in ransom money just sayingokay stopes being lazy and remembered the idea was about money laundering and most large isk corp theirs arent negative sec lmao
i think a minor tweak will fix this issue easily  you cannot place a minimum buy amount if you are margin trading the fact that you can is what is enabling ppl to use this as an exploit or if ppl want to specify a minimum amount its cool but then you have ur iskies tied updont want your isk tied up as a legimate trader thats cool  but y would you care for a minimum amount what do you guys think 
denoting wreckloot ownership is contrary to the basic game mechanics of eve onlineall wrecks should be ffa
loot ownership like learning skills has outlived its usefulness and practicality i agree that its time to remove this archaic concept
agree
i also agreeif not only to see the mission runners tears overflow even more now we dont just ninja salvage but ninja loot as well
what kind of fail ninja are you that you dont loot alreadyand i suspect youve all neglected to realize this would render you nearly unable to bait mission runners into destruction
supportedafk autopiloting should not be rewardedalso my carrier aligns and warps faster than my freighter but my freighter can beat my carrier in a sub warp speed race wtf
supported a bonus to speed is nearly useless the only use i can think of is for auto piloting freighters trans versing high sec
the prereq general ship skills all increase agility
supported
having proposed the addition of the standings icon to locked targets this is another logical ui improvement to aid in differentiating friend from enemy ill supportps a general solution for color blind people should be looked into independently something like configurable colors or flashing cadences marquee types etc for instance if you have a redgreen deficiency you could switch to yellow blue coding
why dont they allow the players to customize the color they want depending on the action
good stuff
good idea of course if color blindness is really a concern theres a simple solution that could probally be applied to other things as well change the bracket shape in the case of assisting you i think a simple green  would be fitting i dont really think hybrid brackets for helping and harming simultaneously really need to be taken into consideration
sure why nottheres bound to be irrational butthurt over this though
the corp services should stay corp hangar assets etc but the corp name should be deleted
its more of an issue that back in the day a large number of 5 letter word tickers were taken which means that people today have to use stupid numberletterpunctuation combinations to get what they want its not fair that someone can have a corp name forever if they registered it in 2003 then summarily quit 2 months later
i can agree that at some point a corp nameticker should be revoked assets would have to remain available perhaps they could just switch the corp name to something like amarr corporation xxx like they do with bad names then if the ceo returned or a new one voted himself as ceo they could petition and have a new corp name giveni think the process leading to corp name revocation should have pretty high requirements however i think the minimum should be all of the following1 no ceodirector logins within the last year2 no online pos3 no active office rentals4 less then 5 members that have logged on within the last 6 monthsand finally if a corporation took the name of a dead corp there should be a way for people to know i think that a line should be added to the corp attributes it could be called original name registration or something similar to that for a corp having the name first it would show yes for a corp taking a old corps name it would say no
amusingly i think my pirate corp would fail to meet this criteria despite having everyone active for the last year ed im not a huge fan of the idea but i think the only way it makes any sense is if nobody from the corp has had an active account for a year  and then simply rename it
nope just control freaks like yourself gee it must be so because your the one that tells everyone what to think gee none of the nerfs or buffs we have see were due to player comments and suggestions you truly are one of the ass hats of eve if you have nothing to add to the discussion but negative bashing go get your jollies in someone elses thread please
you disagree with me so you are flaming and trolling tinfoil
max thanks for joining in on the ideas i like some of what you had to say i am not stuck on forcing a wh sov structure it just seamed like a good idea for using wh only upgrades like i stated could make the structures have lower ehp or some other way to balance them cant say i am thrilled with spawning more wh but that could be a draw back of using a grav belt upgrade maybewh dockable stations sure make them burn some kind of fuel we have to mine from wh moons that works for me i dont mind as to destructible that would be cool also maybe a few ways to do that 1 link it to a pos if the pos gets taken out the station can be unanchored and scooped 2 if it runs out of fuel it becomes destructible this way if you kill off the corp living in the wh it will go off line when they cant feed it and drop all their goodies when it goes boomas for farming our static nope sorry we are not in a c3 we dwell in a c1i am not asking for my cake and eat it too i know better this is eve for every benefit there is a drawback i do not want to see wh space turn into new eden null sec either i was just trying to bring to the table some ideas that we have been kicking around a while and possibly some ideas for adding more dimension to the game
you seem really insecuremaybe you should see a therapistalso feel free to address the points i made about your idea not just the points i made about how naive you are
points what points saw none except to say no it wont work and that no ones ideas are any good geezsh some people
i agree with these points as for something like moon mining if and only if it would only be suitable if they were small individual modules not connected to a poslike you said you have 50 moons if all 50 moons are making profit over the running costs of a pos you can have 50 large starsdeathstar setups and no one is going to bother to risk jumping in 2 dreads to take them all out the idea of someone setting up a pos and making capitals just to destroy them is impracticalso having a small module that mined moons that was destroyable by typical ships would be my only way of supporting that as for the sov upgrades well its kinda pointless dont you think all you would be getting is the increase spawn of sites and tbh it makes well enough money as it is ccp just nerfed the hell out of 70 of null space value i really dont think they will do anything to increase the profitability of it nor should they the sov structures would also need to be a lot weaker as well and for outposts that would make it a bit too easy as you can jump clone to outposts and store unlimited amounts of stuff there so one could find the opportune time to store fuel and scouting alt and never have to worry about fueling up a pos during a period where the pos needs to be refueled hell you wouldnt even need a pos with an outpost the ideas are cool i give you that but its really off balancing things as it would be making things a lot safer and a lot more profitable
try this one dumbass
i live in wh spacealmost 2 yeahtwoi am insane i know d  years nowand as for your proposalsnononono no no noand noif you turn whs in something like rest of kspacethe whs would not be whs anymorehence not fun p
ccp hates people that live in wormholes they have said before that they never intended for people to live in them permanently how dare we not want to take part in their 00 clusterf blobfest so i doubt they will ever do anything to make our game easieri dont think we need sov evictions arent exactly an easy thing to pull off as it stands anyways and making it harder would be unwelcome but i am sick and tired of living out of the terrible pos system ccp slapped together years ago and never revisited
got a link to back this statement up
just saying that you have very very obviously never attempted to handle wh logistics 50 deathstars for moon mining that could only happen with a direct hs static and even then its not easy you would have to break about 23 exits a day assuming every exit can handle roughly 900k m3 of fuel being run through it in either an itty 5 or an actual freighter to get that kind of fuel into the wh i dont care who you are maintaining that many large pos inside of a wh is nothing short of freaking amazing and near god like
i edited it a little to focus on points of interests  im not sure you got my idea of upgrades spawning more wh is not a downside its a upside it is the nonus we need more wh means more systems to farm more chances for pvp more chances for hisec exit we live in c6  sometimes when we are not into closing wh over and over again we can go half a week without hisec routeanything that increase spawn ratio of sites inside your current wh just turns it into another 00 system upgrade i dont think ccp wants wh dwellers here goes fallout again p  sorry couldnt help myself p to just sit inside their system like in giant bunker  the idea of docking itself is what i dont like always try thinking about changes not only from your side  ie im sitting in wh and i dont like that i cant dock so i can store my 100000 bazylions of ship and multi million tons of tritanium and taht i cant be scanned when im in there and i want to be albe to clone myself into station from hisecthink about attackers that goes into your wh they see your pos they keep eye on you for more than an hour mapping all active platyers watching closelly as you do your rounds of sleeper sites sporadiccally showing for few seconds to observe if you use dscaner maybe drop a core or two to get your interest if you sit in a pos and do nothing if you can just sit in a station all this would be lost all the fun of hunterpray games would be gonethe idea of wh is that you have to live on short supplies if you can just clone into wh it will be no longer a whif you can just dock in system to hide store ships and cargo its no longer whagain i agree that poses need more attention and im glad current csm is onto itnow going further with your station idea of destructability just for the sake of argument few days are you mad wh is about small scale engagement unless you go for a siege you dont bring more than 20 ships usually taking down a pos in wh takes roughly a weekend you start shooting at friday night and finish midday on sunday this is long enough already destruction of any stationlike thing should just fall into this timeline but not additional its just goes of with the rest of the pos or it should niot be protected by forcefield so it can be reiforced and after that destroyed within a day tops and i dont think it even should have reinforce timerim sory about being so sceptical about your ideas ive spent my share of time in 00 a little in low and now im going for half a year in wh i dont want wh to be easy in turns of getting more money making sites or just by being able to have stationlike luxury in there wh needs more selfsustainability not more cash it needs to be albe to repair modules reproces then repackage have sources of ice maybe another use of moon mining and more connetctions more connections more fun  profit  now back to farming your static subject so you live in c1 what static do you have there
i love that idea
preatty much this fix pos mechanic  give us source of ice maybe solo moon mining like someone sugested and i will be more than happy to live in wh for another half of year
ive lived in a simple highsec static c1 for many months nowive often thought it would be nice to moon mine there for profit and something else to get intounfortunately i understand that moon mining would destroy the way wh life currently is having 50 moons in my system would be plenty of incentive for a wh corp to take over and push me out you would then be looking at worse than 00 sov holdings due to the increased logistical difficulties of a large scale assaultright now small independent corps can live and operate in wh space moon mining would destroy thatstations in whs nosov in whs no i hear enough arguments that sov has ruined 00upgrades in whs ehhh have to really research prosconsredesign pos mechanics yes
idea not supported wormholes are the last places of freedom in spaceeditwe need that
how about a little of the current setup and a little of the ops idea with a different spin
what reason is that other than ccp saying no
more pvp for everyone
yes please
this would be awesome
if you want more pvp get out of high sec
you want to troll me gd is  that wayi wont answer to anything here after thisa simple thumb down would have been enoughyou guys got enough pvp out in null and low secthis is a whole other topic
please make it easier for me to gank mission running battleships kk
no he is raising a point in which others will read and have their opinion influenced you need to learn proposals have 2 sides i also think no because it destroys a profession and makes it a bit harder to kill idiots in multibillion isk ships in lvl 4s
way too many dumb safe mission runners who think their pirate bs vs a salvage destroyer is equivalent risk
i would like to have this seen by the new csm for more imput and feedback this idea can be easily fleshed out and mines could be revived
i have done much mining in this game over time and i have done a decent amout of null mining but i keep running in to the same short fallsif im to haul for some one else i have to spend a around a half hour play with a calculator to see what the other guy mined to buy his ore i believe if their was a hanger to auto purchased the ore going in to it at a set rate from the hangers owner this would inspire group mining activities in high and nullnull is way to easy to shut down completely from on player in any unknown ship cloaked up chilling in local all day i believe a mining platform that would supply a decent but weaker shield to those anchored to it to counter its nice shield affects it could be made to burn a fuel say heavy water it would function in a small part like a pos tower would take some anchoring and fuel to run can be left up like a pos i believe no guns would be fine unless they feel the need for say 2 low in lasers to help with rats when no one is at the site while its left on over nightim seeing alot of complaints that null cant be self supplied on their ores i really believe such a simple unit could be very use full i have heard of some ideas in the past an chatter that a rorq or orca should move it around but im not sold on that idea in the spirit of poss i was thinking it could be a multi part structure that could be upgraded able say adding more anchor points or some thin use for towards what a mining post could beim not sure if its a decent idea but say a high end version that a large null operation may like i would say to add a refinery that could hit perfect refining and that it would refine the ore thats placed in its auto purchase hangeras i believe the future of poss will be a single structure thats able to change shapes as diffrent modules are installed i believe that this mining platform could be made as the leader in this drastic rebuild of play held structures
i like this idea it would essentially be buy orders except right at the pos for ore would be nice and would promote mining in other systems instead of cluster ing a mimatar station though im sure some people will cry that they wont have all their miners to kill in one spot lol but yeah wouldnt reduce the flow of logistics wouldnt be moar carebear or anything just takes less of the excel  out of eve would probably inspire more corps to have more organized building stuff i have seen some of the stuff some drf corps do for mining and quite frankly its a lot of work mostly in excel and excel is boring
id take this to the farms and fields thread if i were you in null this could be a good target for small gangs as well as a handy thing for the carebears to play with
care bears if their to be named still need some help for the inferior barge damage taking thus shutting down null and any potential of cheaper ships for the core that their trying to build for
i have a simple suggestion use the client side process to determine if it can hit the target offload some of the work to the clients the server doesnt have to handle all of the mechanicestheres nothing that cant be done some famous guy quotedid use the display graphics to determine if an object is there there has to be some way i understand its a lot of physics just one of those fundamental flaws that sticks in your craw when playing and you know its not acting realistic
i like the idea of some kind of cover mechanics at some point not too realistic but a compromise of some degree just to add a bit more realism to the game i think others are correct to say that the technology just couldnt manage it right now especially on top of the existing lag problems but the future is just around the corner and i think itll soon enough be a possibility
hilariously exploitable
unfortunately as much as thats an awesome thing for a single player flight sim styled combat space game its very difficult to do for 1000 players on todays most advanced commercially available computer techccp have to do all of the physic computations otherwise clients will hack the client side and hey presto nobody can damage u thats a pretty ridiculous hack practically the god button in eve tbhas much as i love ur thoughts on a perfect eve its next to impossible at the moment although if you could build a workable quantum computer and give it to ccp it might work tho ccp might spill some coffee or dead rotten fish all over it and blow it up accidently
if you think longer about it it might be a counter to the massive blobs we have todaycause how many times do you shoot thou a fleetmember before you hit the target if you then damage that fleetmember instead of the enemyhuge fleets would kill themselves dresulting in smaller fleets and then the server should be able to handle itbut in the first few days i fear that the server will die a lot
or itd just result in fleets operating at wing level maybe even squad for people like pl same number of ships just smaller units
this wont work out and probally wont work out for a very long time however if andor when the servers have been vastly upgraded and eves terribly old halfdead core code is completely redone this idea would be excellent
how about instead of having npc 00 a static negative security status the more a system has faction npcs killed in it specifically belt rat and anomalysignature rats not mission rats the higher the security status will go up to a certain point lower than 00 and when an npc 00 system has a small amount of ratting in it or no ratting the security status will decrease over a period of a few weeks or any other arbitrary amount of time to 100 this would address certain systems being ratted all the time and also it would improve immersion in that a faction does not have an infinite number of pilots and in killing them off their numbers will decrease in a given area certain factors could factor in to the rate of decrease of security status such as number of belts number of stations number of planets etc but the basic idea would stay the same more ratting  higher security status less rating  lower security status for npc 00 only
why the limits with the recent nullsec nerf this should be rolled out for all of null if it goes anywhere
the only nullsec that small alliances can get in to currently is npc nullsec which in nerfing just hurt the small guys as well sov 00 can be upgraded whereas npc cannot so npc nullsec would benefit from having dynamic security status more than sov 00 im not saying that it couldnt be rolled out for all of null but it is most useful in npc
jump drive for large capital ships that dont need a cryno ship to jump to increase range if used from a booster jump pos stationdrawback must be built with a new mineral found in randomly seeded veld in low sec when mining the veld it will pop into your hold but you cant tell what roid will have it unless you mine itwhat would happen would be a gold rush into low sec by alliances for control of low sec space for mining operations this would make the natives of low sec go on the war path 
capitals dont need a larger jump radius also alliances wouldnt mine for themselves lol theyd just buy it finally this random mining aspect suggested is crap
i dont follow the logic in a cyno jump drive that doesnt require a cyno fieldhow much of a boost range are you talking about 5 50 5 would be more reasonable if it happened and booster jump pos stationplayer owned station station btw so is it a module on the ship an upgrade to the ship stats itself or just an open ended jump bridge for capitals only where would the ship spawn at in the new systemwhats the actual purpose and reasoning to this idea i really cant support this as it lacks detail of why this should happen to be honest it sounds like a plan for you to get more kills while in low sec more then any form of game change
i click random buttons too
csm6 opted to forego player base consideration altogether and instead push their own agenda dropping all support for dozens of widely supported enhancements and changes requested by the player baseit seems their motto is that every other csm before 6 sucked and they csm6 are the best thing since hot buttered bread and they know whats best for the playersits what happens when you vote a bunch of nullsec goons into office kinda like real life p
actually youll find that the topics we plan on discussing at the summit in may is the overarching umbrella of a lot of the little issues that players have voted on previously  using the thread below and also the wiki article it references
supportedill take quality over quantity any day in the end if you have large quantities of features that are low quality broken unfinished and not polished what you really have is just a very large pile of steaming we want high quality game features ccp not steaming piles of 
supported ofc
supported i joined eve 15 yrs ago im not some elite vet with all these awesome skills etc im a fairly new player who came to this game after listening to 3 yrs of bragging from a roommatei was intrigued by the depth of thought which went into the development of the game and how players interactafter the last 2 expansions i have been a part of tyrannis incursion i find myself scratching my head surely the same company that my roommate was bragging about is not the same company that i have experienced i dont even know what the good ole days were but just by word of mouth they sound better than what we have been getting recentlydurin
or alternatively 00 would need to become more selfsufficient to avoid the mindnumbing tedium of that and the potential proliferation of station plus the other stuff makes it more likely for people to come closer to selfsufficiency since one of the main draws of highsec is the insane number of stations and therefore si slots available importing skillbooks and blueprints sure doesnt need a freighter if you could fit most of the needs for a few months of an entire region in a frigate easily so that only leaves datacores and lppurchased items as the remaining big draw of highsec
but effort they have grown accustomed to living on microwave dinners and now loathe the idea of having to prepare a meal even though it is better for themselves and the community as a wholetwo biggest hurdles that i can see are solving the mineral supply without making people want to suicide out of boredom from mining increasing number of slots available for manufactureresearch to actually meet the needs sort those and everything else falls into place
if you remember we had a discussion a couple of months ago that was exactly about thislink
give electronic attack ships a new role and game mechanic allowing them to temporarily disable certain player resources moon miners station services custom offices etc and even raidsteal resources this will give a way to burn the farms aswell as raid them possibly prevent eaf from using cloaks to balance it it will also give the eaf a new role which would increase its usageas for a new type of farmccp has mentioned planetary rings why not be able to set up mining colonys within the rings and harvest their resources passivly similar to the pi system mineral yields would depend upon the planet type and possibly true sec status or industry level and upgrades in the ihub would also be a new farm to burn with the eaf idea then again low secnpc null sec corps would have an easier way to get mineralssteal it from somebody else would possibly increase pvp by forcing hd fleets to form more quickly or risk losing resources to a roaming gangas for keeping t2 production in null sec perhaps a new discovery system for moons new types of probes that could find a limited resource on moons i dont forsee people placing poss on moons just to snatch up so many units of moon goo and then moving it on when it runs dry though perhaps it would be used on moons that already have poss n them for other reasons not a great idea but an idea none the less
personal industrial array  a station upgradeshort descriptionintroduce personal station upgrade modules called industrial arrays which will allow individual players to have their personal manufacturing slots in player owned stations you need to pay the installationmaintenance fee to the owner have sufficient standings with the station owner and have appropriate skill to use itabout industrial arrays  bullet version built from simple materials mineralspi stuff  why t2 materials are too touchy and prone to be monopolized this eliminates t2 material whines and can buff the pi market by increasing demand industrial array gets a bit of damage every time its used set it up that it would be completely useless and destroyed after some time of using it actively an array must then be replaced  why boosts the economy requires effort from users and regulates production cost each array creates 1 manufacturing slot for the owner you can have maximum 11 arrays active limited by skill to cover all manufacturing slots that a character can have different arrays for different types of manufacturing slots  much like current pos assembly arrays types of arrays that one can use are limited by the level of a new industrial arrays skill you can even implement these arrays so that they can not produce capital components and ships and leave that side of the production to poses only to avoid buff to the capitalsupercap spam industrial arrays can have material modifiers that would make a balance when it comes to high to low end ore ratio if station gets conquered by a hostile entity the new owner can destroy your arrays and you will lose materials and blueprints that were used in active manufacturing jobs an anchor of personal industrial arrays would be a new station service similar to fitting cloning or other services it could be made visible and vulnerable like any other station service when it gets incapacitated all active jobs will be paused until the service gets repaired reasons behind the changes and detailed explanation stuff in empire is cheap because of two main reasons abundance of basic minerals trit pyerite mexallon and availability of almost unlimited numbers of manufacturing slots in npc stations until mining gets some kind of revolutionary fix there will always be a shortage of basic minerals in nullsec because as we all know no one moved to nullsec to mine veldspar additionally a limited amount of public manufacturing slots will become queued up if the production is forced to be done locally and even the most basic t1 stuff and ammo will be monopolized by the corporations that own the stations and have private manufacturing slots in them it will also hurt the simple member of a corporation without sufficient roles to use those private slots and will make only a few people in the corporation very rich while everyone else suffers that is not a good and healthy environmentwith industral arrays as upgrade modules in player owned stations individual players will get the initiative to start their own manufacturing businesses combined with mineral modifiers even the notso richskilled players that cant flyafford rorqualsjump freighters can start contributing to the local production this will result in more localised production more stuff on the market and lower prices slightly above empire which will lead to more pvp because when you always have cheap local stuff theres no need to be afraid to go in small gang instead of waiting for a blob that makes you as an individual relatively safer
why should industrial arrays be damaged over time the minimum cost per hour in an npc station for a single manufacturing slot is 333 isk on a monthly level thats roughly 240000 isk  job installation cost of 1000 isk per job in jita for example this is 807 isk per hour or roughly 581k isk industrial arrays that last for a month could have a price tag between 250 and 600k isk  enough space to make a difference between different types of arrays without adding up to the cost of the final product additionally when you install an array of a certain type and you decide to unplug it from the station to fit another one the unplugged array will be destroyed manufacturing effectiveness will then depend only on players capability to handle production and plan aheadwhy material modifiers and not something else like denser lowend ore versions because denser lowend ore versions will bring the biggest mining profitability nerf possible denser ore versions in deep 00 space will solve the lowend materials problem but it will also make lowend minerals worthless and the highsec economy would collapse along with the mining profession by introducing carefully balanced material modifiers to personal industrial arrays well only have balanced modifications of highlow end mineral requirements without messing with the material supply players that have means of exporting highend minerals from 00 space while still making profit would still export it players that have means of importing low end minerals from highsec while still making profit would still import it but the most important part is that players that want to gather materials in 00 space and use it for local production without depending on imported materials would also have means to do it and profit from it while not having to focus on mining veldspar of course since a system and whole economy of 00 space would change if these changes go live i can only guess and not predict for certain that 00 population will be much more diverse than it is now and that there will be players that will focus on extraction of low end ore for profit even in 00 spaceconclusion and effectsif we want to boost local production in nullsec drive the prices down and seed the market because we want to have more small gang pvp in relatively cheap ships that you as an individual can afford to lose give the ability to simple members of an alliance to contribute to the production and market seeding and see what happens the only way to seed nullsec market with locally produced stuff is to give the initiative to simple members to contribute while avoiding corporate bureaucracy adding personal effort and personal investmenta healthy well seeded market full with items that are produced locally with locally extracted ore will be beneficial to everyone small alliances that dont hold whole regions of space and multiple stations can again survive in 00 space if they have enough capable individuals that are willing to deal with the industrial side of the game players in large alliances will again after leaving highsec to join the alliance get the possibility to build stuff independent from the corporate bureaucracy that is present in the big alliances mostly because of the valid security reasons additionally small industrial oriented alliances will benefit from selling the goods to large pvp oriented alliances alliances will be much more careful who they blue because bad blues would not be a threat only on the battlefield but on the market too even alliances that are not internally strong enough will have a decent amount of failscade space if free economy where every individual can compete on the market would make clashes in their member base in one word the political landscape of 00 space will become much more colorful and interesting instead of current blackandwhite landlordpet picture with the dominant shootorgrind mentality

pretty sweet the personal industry array nicely covers the material and slot bottleneck as well as dodging the pos  slot access issue while it does not help with farming you could blend it with something like the playerbased incursions
i think the dependence of nullsec on jita has less do do with a lack of local resources and more to do with the armies of macro and slave miners in empire that produce cheap ore you can already get upgraded belts in conquerable null pi prooduces pos fuels now and moon goo is everywhere from lowsec to null the problem with belts in 00 is that mining barges cost 200 mil and have negligible defensive capabilities so a skilled purifier can make quick work of industrial workhorse ships if you want farmers in null then you need to elaborate on ship classes made to operate in deep space when the pioneers went to the frontiers in the early days of the usa they took or created the tools for the job even maw  paws wagon train had rifles and blades handy still none of this will change market realities if a bunch of 3rd world slaves will mine tritanium for almost nothing in empire then nullsec players will never be bothered to produce it locally the empire slaves can produce at the same rate with zero risk also empire has more assembly lines availiable than even the best player built outpost nullsec has too many bottlenecks and risks to be competitive with the safe green pastures of empire spaceim also not too keen on bringing more farmers to null the great anomaly nerf only recently drove mobs of sanctum farmers away and it is the best change ive seen to null in 2 yearsone possibilty that might work would be making the hauling of base ores undesireable as it stands now you only need to fill a jf with 425mm railguns or something similar and cart it to any said supercap procuction area refine and build there is no incentive to produce locally when you can fit a super capitals worth of minerals in a rhea this might have the added bonus of forcing power blocs to actually produce their own super cap blobs and curb the nyx and aeons online trend we have seen since dominion that could also have the downside of further reinforcing the drone rmt supercapital production line which is already protected on 3 sides by jumps too long to make with capitals any tampering with ore on this level would warrant a long hard look at drone regions drop rate and would probally warrant adding a region or two of npc null space between geminate and kavela to allow capital movement
make it harder to haul and null buys less from high sec that leads to mineral prices crashing in high sec there is no incentive for them to stop mining ore until the market becomes overfilled with trit sell orders and collapses there are no variable costs involved in mining in high sec so this decision point never triggers
a reprocessing nerf at null sec stations or a tax based on how many items have jumped thrue a gate over the last 48 hours seems the easiest way to go this would make the tranport of ore to jump freighters more interesting as mass before tax at the gates becomes another point of contention during null sec wars and another isk sink whs if you find the right ones would allow a way to get around the tax
ok after reading the entire thread and seeing what others have said and combining it with my brief nullsec experience i have come up with my own thoughts on the matterfirsti believe the fix depends heavily on stations starbasesposs and updating how they are handled my beliefs on this are partly inspired by eve lorethe lore inspirationcapsuleers are the pinnacle of new edens modern society we are the elite our isk while each individual unit is insignificant normal citizens of our galaxy revel at the value our currency is far more valuable than any local currency peroid this is why according to lore countless civilians will line up for jobs on a capsuleer ship despite the extremely high risk of death npc corporations and thus the empires within hisec are not capsuleer based they do not have the capability run operations that yield the same potential as much smaller capsuleer operations as such is it not a sound belief that an empire of capsuleers would be far more productive and well off than an empire based off of normal citizens i believe sostationsthe changes i would like to see to stations are pretty small really here is a quick bullet pointed listremove perfect refining from npc stations instead require a pos pos refinery in next post and perfect skills to do that task or a null outpost allow outpost refineries to be upgraded to the point of fulfilling perfect refining like current npc stationsallow outposts to be upgradable to the point of having 500 research or manufacturing slots but not high amounts of bothas far as the refinery efficiency change is concerned this would make mining any ore in nullsec much easier to refine than in hisec reinforcing the capsuleer  noncapsuleer dichotomy put plain and simple our s is better also a change like this means miners will be more inclined to mine in nullsec as it is easier to get higher profits from your work without maxskilling your character this in turn means more mineral production and possible exports from nullsecthe suggestion for increased research  manufacturing slots is quite simply to help combat the fact that it is easier to produce in highsec the real solution to this problem imho is possstarbases possill start this off with a simple fact anyone who has lived out of a pos in their current state for any length of time has come to somewhat the same conclusion they need drastic improvement as such here is a list of improvements i would like to see to possimpliment the poss flogging the dead horse modulization of starbasesmake the starbases dockabledrastically increase the storage capabilityeveryone who docks gets a personal ship  item hangar that uses shared max m3 that is upgradable on the tower through more storage mods providing increased personal security vs other members of the corpcorporate hangars use the same m3 shared storage but behave the same way as a corp hangar at an npc stationthese changes to poss would in effect turn them into ministations so to speak except they will still lack the market infinite storage and invulnerability of their larger outpost brethren by providing the poss with these changes you create or rather enhance players existing ability to to live out of these facilities and be productive while enjoying themselves in what feels like a safe environment lets face it sitting in your ship next to a control tower when youre docked feels kinda lamealso a ccp dev did state at fanfest that they want all kinds of structures to allow us to enjoy wis eventually poss will need to be reworked in order to allow this what better method than to rework it with the goal of making null easier to industrialize
for what purpose to reduce the pvp and thus players in null sec it is hard to pvp if it is hard to find shipsfittings which dont magically appear in outposts any more than they do in pirate stations there has to be a rational reason for players to mine low ends in null and there isnt one with your nerf what your suggestion will do is increase the price of low end minerals in null sec and increase the price of high ends in high sec for no net benefit to anyone if the nerf is severe enough people wont haul minerals between null and high high sec will starve of high ends and null sec will pay almost the same for low ends as high ends again no net benefit
rolesroles at poss are currently a huge problem if they were to change with the method mentioned in my previous post a complete reworking of the roles system would no longer be needed though some roles do need a touchup here are some changes id like to see with the roles given the idea of dockable starbases is implementedallow the ability to based at a corporation member to a starbas preventing the necessity to give blanket access to them allallow factory  lab slots deployed at a starbase to be rented out on a personal basis ie use corporate allows corp members to rent it personally while selecting alliance lets any alliance members who can dock at your starbase use it setting it to official allows only those with the appropriate rent factory  lab slot roles to use it and only on behalf of the corp as it works currentlychange rent factorylab slot role to allow installation of a job on a corporate level removing the necessity for the factory manager rolefactory manager  quite simply this role after the above change would be used solely for its assumed intended use of managing the factories this role would allow the individual to monitor both corporate and personal slot usage and cancel or deliver jobs as neededsecurity officer  in a starbase this role would allow you to remove itemsships out of a players personal hangar as space is limited and the corporation owns the tower this is required imo trust in your ceo and his delegated staff is implied in circustances like thisroles such as security officer  factory manager should be able to be set on a based at level so administrators can be set for certain possstarbase pos refiningstarbases should be capable of refining at perfect levels with max skills in exchange for the convenience of getting perfect refine at a pos the refinery takes time to process the ore a million m3 for example could take 10 hours as a loose example conclusion  summarybasically the changes mentioned for the stations combined with those to poss and the roles used for them would allow for a massive degree of control and ability to delegate which in a heavy industry corporation is extremely needed if everyone is to be able to do their jobs on a corporate and personal level adding these changes will allow for the use of these existing resources much more effectively when performing industrial operations in nullsec this will also allow those corporations who wish to remain in hisec the ability to create their own homes and possibly even drive further conflict in hisec as moons will be more sought after if for anything other than placing your hisec corps little slice of heaven now that i have my view on industry sorted out let me get to the small gang warfare   in a new post
reading this thread is very interesting being an outsider looking in i see everyone is complaining about mineralsso to push industry into low and null sec the first easy step should be tonerf all high sec refining yield heavilylow sec gets current ratesnull gets buffed refining maybe from an upgradebasically make moving minerals from high  null sec unprofitablemoving ore just to get a refining bonus would be risky and an utter pain ore is much bigger than mineralsto prevent the module reprocessing exploit that you would see from this module reprocessing will get no refining buff from reprocessing in null secwould this not force some form of null sec industrialisation and combat empire mining bots
is mineral compression a problem that needs to be fixed are jump bridges actually a mistake are nullsec logistics actually too easywhat would the impact on nullsec industry be if we fixed pos roles and added a personal hangar array giving individuals the ability to securely store things at a pos with the ability to build from and deliver to personal hangarswould nullsec industry benefit from better refining through a pos refiningreprocessing structure that provides 30 base efficiency but responds to player skills and implantswhat would the impact on nullsec industry be if the hulk was given double the current shield hp
encouraging small gangs to roam into nullthis is hard most people who havent gone out to null and lived there at least for a few days are afraid of it why stories of powerblocs massive blobs etc the reality is these things do happen but a small gang is pretty much able to move freely with minimal resistance from what ive experienced recentlynow i know this topic is extremely flammable around these parts but my opinion on this is that local is the problem yes i am a proprietor of delayed local in nullsec i wont get into a debate on it but i do want the csm to see my reasons why i think local is a bad thing and how it would help fix their proposed problemso here are a few reasons i think delayed local in nullsec is goodpromotes picketing def 4  5picketing results in teamwork which in an mmo is a good thingpicketing also results in combat pilots who want to pvp being stationed to protect industrialists who are mining being the front line when roaming gangs show up initiating small gang combat whilst combat is engaged industrialists have time to flee to relative safety this gives both sides of the pvpers what they want a fightpromotes more widespread usage of the starmap and its extremely large amount of delayed data yes delayed is good it means its fallible perfect free intel is bad for gameplaypromotes fear and uncertainty when alone lets face it despite there not being concord null shouldnt feel safe unless you have friends to back you upimpedes solo work  botting while both of this will inevitably continue at an extent a single player running a one man multi account mining op or even monitoring several bots in a system becomes a much riskier operation and makes the botters cannon fodder for those at the keyboard this is obviously a good thing anything to discourage automationpromotes use of wormholes as a method of bypassing pickets and potentially gaining access to systems that are active as with anything involving wormholes though its all about your luck regardless of which side of it youre onpromotes bottling  from what i saw in my brief stint in null the player base is very spread out everyone holding as much sov as they can and spreading out so everyone essentially has their own personal slice alliances and corporations would be more encouraged to bottle up as close together as possible to ensure pickets and security nets are more secure and response time of fleets is quicker when a hostile is spotted the bottling in turn increases the ease of logistics when performing the industry work for an entire alliance while it may still be required you likely wouldnt need to go 7 jumps to get to the closest outpostadditionally this may prove to free up some space in null for newer corps and alliances to come bottle themselves up obviously new blood and additional space for people to take over is a good thingnow with all those reasons you obviously need something to give the defenders some sort of edge for living there obviously you cant defend a gate with a pos you can however introduce deployable equipment such as mines turrets and other fun stuff to make picketing and defending a system against small gangs more interesting assuming you have the isk ofcoursemy personal favorite is setting up a minefield around a stargate any neutral or hostile that comes in has to safely scramble through it and whatever warp disruption bubbles you may have placed to prevent them from easily escaping itbasically my vision is to take away the free perfect intel and use that as an excuse to add more toys to defend with oh and if the attacker is wiley enough they might just bring their own deployables 
and that would be bad because if a majority of the lowend minerals peddled in highsec is from bots as claimed time and again and the end goal of this whole exercise is to help null declare their independence from jita domination then who cares sorry chribba nothing personal in the ideal world null production should reach a level where they become exporters and not just a black hole spitting out moongoo when markets are favourable
the problem has more to do with the low end minerals in null sec basically who in their right mind would mine veldspar in null sec when they could be mining crokite or arkonor this would simply lead to an increase in high end supply leading to noticeable price decreases for ship for a little while before supply and demand stabilize with fewer people mining in null really that would be a harsh nerf to the drone regions and do little to convince people to mine low ends in null secit is great until you realize the massive market disruption associated with such a change unless you enjoy ninja mining high end resources then doing the actual manufacturing of pretty much every single module and ship you use for a few months while the markets stabilize i dont think you would like the results all that much even when they stabilize there will be a lot more scarcity and higher prices for pretty much everything
as for missing dominion features what about treaties allowing simple things such as docking rights in return for percentages of sales or refining or the right to anchor structures in return for iskmonth
i am writing the final pos misery proposal document for the csm based on various inputs including this threadone idea im developing is a way to specialise towers in a similar fashion to the way t3 ship subsystems or ihub upgrades work the idea is that inserting a certain upgrade into a tower unlocks new abilities or precludes others we could also weave in the new ai developed for sleepers to make those weapons more effective when automatedfor example one upgrade may perform better against supercapitals or automatically focus on their fightbombers but becomes more vulnerable to battleships another may increase moon mining yield at the cost of shield hitpoints the end goal of this is to make towers more interesting and varied as well as giving more opportunities to use a wider variety of fleets ingame here are a few examples of ideas ive had so farsiege toweronly large guns can be onlined no smalls or meds massive damage increase huge tracking penalty and a sig radius bonus to all external modules energy neutralizers gain a rof bonus ecm modules become effective vs supercaps and warp scramblers can tackle them stasis webs cannot be onlined on a tower with this upgrademakes the tower deadly vs capitals and supercapitals but very vulnerable to battleshipslogistics toweronly small and med guns can be onlined no larges reduction in cpugrid use of cyno beacon and jump bridge modules removes random locking delay for modules and grants them a scan resolution bonus any modules on this tower become incapacitated upon recieving armour damagemakes the tower deadly against small ships such as bombers and other gankers however it becomes much easier to disable by a heavier force such as rr bs or lone capitalsindustry towerreduces cpu cost of industry modules like reactors and labs at the cost of shield hitpoints shield hardeners cannot be onlined on a tower with this upgradesupport towerincreases the capacity of chas and smas along with their access range medium guns use less grid and recieve a slight range bonus the tower loses any inbuilt shield resistances and shield hardeners cost triple cpu to onlineim open to suggestions on what other specialised purposes towers could have also what limitations should there be on these specialisations if any eg should the upgrades be disallowed in highsec or even lowsec
some sort of change to the mechanics to allow easier managementconfigurationsetup of personal poss better management of pos rolesas it stands single users are unable to set up their own personal poss without receiving corp roles that give them access to every pos if this was changed to allow corps micromanagement of which users were allowed to config specific poses eg a trusted group that was allowed to config all poss a logistics group that manages say jb poss but not supercap staging poss and also managing poss specifically allowing eveguy x to access y pos in z system that he rats in this would be much more practicalfrom a corp viewpoint they could manage pos security far easier while allowing more users to help with logistics but not in a way that potentially compromises them in the case of a spy from the corpalliance members viewpoint the little guy this means they would be able to set up their own personal pos to safe up while ratting for example with much less hasslepersistent pos passwordson a slightly unrelated note making the entering of pos passwords and by extension jump bridge passwords persistent would be great having to enter a password 10 times going up and down the z0rtal is somewhat irritating if the password was persistent this would be much more pleasantxttz your ideas seem pretty good i like the specialized tower idea

when i was a noob i found the thing that kept me playing was a community of players who would train me to play the game answer my questions give me advice and so on fortunately i found a highsec corp that trained me in the early days i think ccp should formalize some kind of teaching or apprenticeship positionjob in the game do this by making actual people who can take on the designation of instructor or make different names for the various empires when a person has that designation they can get listed somewhere that noobs see and the noobs contact them to get a person who teaches them how to enjoy the game in some ways then as the noob continues to play the instruction gets compensated if the noob hits certain milestones the details of the compensation system could be done in a a variety of ways and some of those ways are bound to be more functional than others for the purpose of making the idea clear ill propose one system as follows recognizing their are probably a myriad of better ways to implement the main idealets say bob joins the game as a noob and the mittani is an instructor who is listed on the new players board instructor listing as having had some success teaching new players and is available to take on a new guy for instruction the mittani will answer questions from bob teach him game mechanics chat with him invite him to join the l4 high sec missions or small gang gank fleets or whatever if bob upgrades his account to a full account then the mittani gets paid say 50m mill isk i dont care precisely how much it is or if it comes from ccp or bob or out of the ether now what happens is that bob has an actual human encounter with the mittani who is a pro and teaches him this is highly likely to entice bob to stay make friends with the mittani and his corpalliance become a paying customer also the mittani will be superior to any tutorial in educating bob on how to play the game since he is able to answer questions if the mittani is good enough he can teach several people at once lead small gangs of noobs into lownull sec space and have them do team activities and the mittani is getting paid for how many of them are enjoying the game and activating their accounts some of them even joining his alliancecorp win for the noobs win for the mittani
putting the idea of nerfing aside for one moment there are a few things which currently dont make a lot sense about the overall balancing aspects of the super carrier and need to be discussed before any conclusion for change can be madefirst off the super carrier is first and foremost a carrier which by definition is a support vessel intended for logistical and combat purposes the combined adjective super promotes the ability of being able to excel at its original purpose with perhaps additional abilities so where the carrier is intended to be an antisub cap vessel with the ability to provide logistical aid the super carrier should excel at these tasks in a sense it does and provides new abilities such as the fielding of fighter bombers which allow it to become an anticap platform comparing its ability to deal with capitals against the carriers ability to deal with sub capitals the super capital seems to be much more efficient at this task which in my opinion shows that the vessel is more of an attack vessel then a support vessel hindering this role probably needs to be considered it is in my opinion that the super carrier should be just as effective at taking out a capital class vessel as a carrier is at taking out a bs or bc class vessel the super carrier should be seen as a multipurpose platform its size and name should allow to do a bit of everything but should also be known as a support platform a carrier vessel of this size should be able to move independently of a fleet but not to the extend that it can knock out entire fleets of subcaps this i believe is already met but perhaps needs further address as noted by others in this thread in terms of hp this i struggle to understand it has similar hp to a titan and also has the ability to issue similar dps with the exception of the doomsday device cost is a useful fall back to identify the ability of a ship the super carrier is more then half the cost of a titan and yet is more effective in a fleet or at least close to there is something definitely wrong here in my eyes the titan is not a support vessel it is a vessel which carries entire civilizations to planets the flagship of fleets and the bringer of destruction the titan is almost the opposite of this the largest ship in the game and has absolutely no ability to defend itself against anything but capitals i wouldnt want to keep the people of earth in one of those if it could be destroyed so easily i would rather buy them all manticores it would be cheaper anyways more to the point the titan in my opinion should be the ultimate attack ship and its price should reflect this it is by no means twice as good at killing capital ships as the super carrier and this is where it needs to be in terms of each vessels health i think this should be reflected by price the carrier is 800 million or so and has 350k or so hp the super carrier hull is 135 billion or something on the order of and has 26 million hp or more the titan hull is approx 45 bill and has 27 mill hp in terms of ratios the super carrier is 13 times the cost of a carrier and has 74 times the hp plus a massive increased combat ability the titan is 57 times the cost of a carrier and 77 times the health of a carrier with similar combat effectiveness to a super carrierin conclusion hp is unbalanced with the titan requiring more or the super carrier requiring less the super carrier also needs less dps in order to set accordance with the price the titans power is in accordance to its price somewhat although is a little weak in my opinionfrom the ratio comparison with the carrier it shows that the hp value of the super is in the right place but reducing slots may be the answer so that the hp cannot be used so effectively it is the dps that needs to be knocked in my opinion which is in accordance to the ideas provided in this thread in my opinion the titan need a hp bump also
no
honestly any kind of nerf should be a last resort or a counter to a truly gamebreaking mechanicim more in favor of buffing the underpowered than i am of nerfing something that may be a bit overpowered are there some areas of a super that probably need to be tweaked sure but theres no reason to try and tear down the buffs they got in dominion that actually made them useful supercarriers are endgame ships it takes close to two years of training to fly them properly and they cost as much individually as a small carrier fleet they should be fearsome and scaryanother solution to the supercarrier issue though could be to buff standard capital ships dreadnoughts in particular to start they need to do more damage so either give them an extra gun or two this would require altering the ships model though increase the damage of capital guns would end up buffing titans as a secondary result though or give them a unique role bonus that adds extra damage to their xl guns this would give dreads more bite you could even add a damage bonus to ships with say greater than a 10km sig radius to ensure than the extra damage only gets applied to supercapitalclass shipsthe second thing that would need to be addressed is their tank even a sieged dread gets shredded by a supercarrier i would suggest buffing their resists andor total hp to at least give them a little more time in a fight against supers if the dreads damage does get buffed that would mean that standard carriers should probably get an hp buff as well lets face it they were always a bit too fragile to begin withid also suggest lowering the cycle time on the siege modules since being stuck in place for 10 minutes can be a death sentence in the middle of a warzone they need to definately be lowered to 5 minutes in length bringing them in line with the triage module id even support lowering the cycle time more although that could cause some stront issues on longer pos siegesalso and this is more of a petpeeve than a major balance tweakbut alter the size of the models carriers need to be sized up to be more inline with dreadnought size since right now a machariel is as big as some carriers and supercarriers should be scaled up to roughly half the size of a titan theres no reason the naglfar and phoenix can dock but the supercarriers cantin short maybe try to focus on potential buffs before we get into heavy nerf talks nerfs have a way of spiralling out of hand and the last thing we need is for supers to be taken back to a mothership level of uselessness
dreadnoughts arent underpowered though the only major issue with dreads is simply that postdominion supercarriers vastly outperform them and everything else in most useful roles and that the one areas where dreads work better than supercarriers pos shooting has greatly diminished in importance thanks to the new dominion structures like ive said elsewhere if every supercarrier was deleted from the game tomorrow nearly all of the problems with dreadnoughts would be removed as well and buffing dreadnoughts to compete with overpowered supercaps has knockon effects  for example their performance against subcapitals or carriers or titansthe major balance issue is with supercarriers and not just against dreads but against the rest of the capital and subcapital ranges too so thats where rebalancing should occur  otherwise are you going to propose a raft of buffs for titans carriers battleships dictors and hictors to bring them up to scratch as well using the newlyoverpowered supercarriers as a baseline and then changing everything else in the game to fit around that is a pointlessly time consuming and inefficient exercise for ccp

my all fittings were deleted in this change by some strange mechanicsi want unlimited space for fittingswhythis
50 fittings is not enough i only fly frigates dessys and cruisers at the moment young character for two races if they want to keep a limit on serverside fittings add an option to save selected fittings to the server but keep unlimited local fittings personally i collect fittings fielded by friends and enemies so that i can figure out both how to useimprove them and how to counter them by fixing an annoyance that affects a portion of the player base theyve broken the fittings feature for everyone the shame is that a 3rd party app like eft outshines eves fitting management in so many ways anyone halfway serious about combat eventually discovers eft and afterward cannot play eve without it the goal shouldnt just be to fix fittings to allow server storage and unlimited local storage it should give eves fitting screens at least the same level of usefulness as eft
max 50 seems a tad on the low sideid like to see it raised a lot hopefully this can get sorted soon tm
what he said this would be awesome especially if we could create large bodied characters like the amarrian politician portrayed in the empyrean age novel i could just imagine seeing a character like that in game in all his or her glory on that note the ability to make realistic fat characters is needed imhofat by capsuleer standards is curvy by american at least as far as the female characters are concernedanyways fat giggling and the ability to make our characters well rounded is a must excluding that imho is a form of discrimination against the well bodiedand yes the jiggling needs to be client side not server side

 no this is not another request for a super massive able to eat belts in 5 minutes requestwith all the love given to indy side of things how bout some love for the gas minersmy idea is basically a t2 version of the noctisslots6 hi4 mid3 low 1 gas harvestorreduction in chance of cloud causing damage per lvlcompress gas maybe for the rorqdiscuss
gas harvesting is already pretty low income this will only drive prices down further
youre mining the wrong gas then
mykoserocin gases are useless as they are for synth boostersthere is not enough demand for better boosters so cytoserocin gas is largely useless except for the few manufacturers of the boosters themselveswormhole gas for t3 is farmed like crazy the only gas worth mining is the high end stuff and that is only because of its bulk and as a direct result of that bulk it is more practical to react it inhouse than export it outsorry but gas harvesting is simply not a profitable venture when compared with alternative activities
i think you are seriously misinformed i mine and sell booster gas the guy im selling to cant get enough gas to keep his pos running full tilt and he is buying from multiple miners and mining it himself add in the fact that every cyto is being bought for 60k or better in jita18millhour wh gass are a bit differnt the cheapest gas c70 is being bought at 300 roughly 2mill per hour for c60c70 and c82 however c28 the next lowest iskper hour is about 17m 1697123434 isk per hour isk per hour only goes up from therefyi mining veld in highsec nets about 825m a hour mining ark is roughly 30m per hourso tell me again how gas mining is not profitable

this is good the previous overview setting was a bad place to put transversal information as you really dont need to know the transversal for every single thing on your overview

i would tell ccp to rehit the prevailent overview bugs that always seem to come up when switching between tabs quickly using tags in fleet and switching presets seems like the hud windows when pinned has many bugs when opening new ones like the minimap scanner or nesting within hud windowsthis is across all my clients very annoying to have to redo things on the hud half the time
my ships are made from the tears of carebears noobs and lost sp idiots that cant remember to upgrade their clones
that this seems to be the sole reason to not improve the clone mechanic in some way is the very reason i find the way it is to be idioticccp supposedly wants to mitigate the relatively massive learning curve of this game so i dont see why senseless pitfalls like the remember to upgrade mechanic exist when it adds no meaningful decision making to the game adds no element of fun or depth and is totally worthless beyond the longpast occasion where i enjoyed the petty elitism of laughing at those who managed to forget an upgrade
my mistake then 50 sp of the highest sp invested skillcant really fault me for being wrong ive only ever been podded thrice and never without an up to date clone p
dont worry i just wanted to prove the op never been double podded and wanted to change a mechanic he doesnt know anything aboutalso no pilots were hurt in this little exercise as it was done on the test server
id rather they introduced a hardcore mode in evecharacter gets double training speed and triple skill effects but is unable to clone  permadeath just make leadership skills unavailable
strangely enough i kinda like thatbut they could farm those chars out and sell super cap pilot strength type pilots course once theyre dead theyre dead
hell yeah id go for that

op this just recently happened to me too but luckily it happened early in my career and i only lot twoweeks of sps i sympathize really i dobut j kunjehs right dont think its gonna change any time soon too many other pressing matters out thereand yet theres an elegant solution i wish id had a popup hit me in the face with a hey doofus youre undocking in an alphalevel clone youre gatecamp revenge plan can wait another thirty secondsjust sayin
huhthen hows it i lost an entire level 5 skill and two weeks of training timedoes this mean theres a skilltime cap above which only a percentage of the sps are lost that seems a little overworked and soft on ccps part tbhme is genuinely curuious
how many sp did you have at the time and what was the rank of the skill you lost all of level 5 in
in my experience there is still more than enough salvage  however new players are generally too lazy to bookmark cas before they have been completed for salvaging and ratters are too lazy to drop off bookmarks of completed cas at some pickup point for salvagersi never had trouble finding free sanctums in fountain even after the change  but my ratting times are usually between 8  16 eve time i can imagine that competition during euus prime has become pretty tough but then people should be in pvp fleets during primetime anywaysmy impression is that many people either love running havens or have no clue about the range of their onboard scanner  sanctums at a little more remote locations within the solar system would almost always be empty even if many havens were occupiedhavens  sanctums have similar iskh for me if i do them in subcapital ships running havens in a carrier is painfullevel 4 payouts vary wildly based on lp conversion rates and skills  therefore no easy comparison is possiblecompare one mission runner with good social skills doing soe level4s in gicodel with another mission runner who has bad social skills and is running missions for cn in motsu and you will see a very noticeable difference in income  even though both are doing highsec lvl4s for fairly mainstream factions and dont rely on exotic means of lp conversion building stuff from bpcs edit as i have said elsewhere my preferred solution to curb isk inflow from cas wold have been to replace some sanctumshavens with drone hordes with a chance that is based on truesecwould have nerfed isk influx from bad truesec  would certainly have led to many complaints but players could have adapted to the new system and system upgrades would have retained their value
i have not felt the so called burn of the nerf yet as i live in npc space atm but i used to live in scalding pass and ran sanctums in a thanny all the time at that point i was pulling in the full amount of a ring sanctum in 20 min and would finish a station one in about 35 min so i was pulling in around 20 mill every 20 min not bad at allthough now i am in a 04 system belt ratting in a gila and am pulling in 1318 million every 20 min which is pretty good for belt rattingnow as i recall there are forsaken hubs which give you a bunch of bss and its worth ruffly around 1520 mill and can be done in under 20 mini think if ccp added more highend mid range annoms like forsaken hubs to low end 00 systems 01 to 05 i think this would help offset the isk lossas imo i tink ccp added annoms to the systems to make it so more people can rat in a single system so having the isk income of belt ratting in the system be the same as the annom ratting is a good thing
wow you really are clueless do you really expect a huge bc gang that lights up intel channels to have pvp handed to them are people gonna hop in their ratting tengus and do honoureable spacebattlebolded the parts that are wrong hth
i was initially worried about the changes but even with increased competition for the havens there are no sanctums nearby i can still make 3540m per hour by chaining the forsakenforlorn hubs thats respectable enough that i dont have to resort to missioning to get by
really the biggest problem in new edenand here i was thinking it was the bots or lag that were the biggest problems
1 thats exactly what happens when u live there so u can stop pretending otherwise2 because it doesnt3 get this through your thick skull no ones trying to eliminate low sec piracy ure just blowing things out of proportion because u cant handle even the slightest of consequences or efforts just like them htfu seriously 1 not safe enough behind an alt huh2 10s dont enter high sec unless theyre passing by or going to trade hubs take a few seconds to observe high sec im sure ull be relatively safe doing so since u value safety so much3 where did suicide ganking come from oh righttalking out your ass once again1 reread 1 or better yet look up irrelevant like i said before htfu its the least 10s can do2 only if they biomass throwaway alts3 and once your hauler takes the sec hit hell be useless as well4 and apparently u dont know anything about it judging from 3if a 10 attempts to take something from the corp hangar the ceo will get a warning if he allows it he takes the sec hit any more rants while ure behind
1 reread the revision then start wondering why a 10 would canflip in high sec if anythings fail its your constant ranting and lack of reading comprehension2 u griefed yourselves by letting your sec status go down that far and not doing anything about it seriously htfu3 more like u run every time ure about to get shot at and hide behind your high sec alt wheres the interaction there4 ure the one that suggested the 2 shards thats your stupidity for uamazing how anything a 10 does is pirating but anything that happens to them is griefing
if anyone needs to htfu its you 10s exist they have consequences already your ideas are bad and you are dumb get out
name those consequences that cant be worked around til then keep on ranting cause we all know how u like your safety
everything can be worked around thats kind of the point of having alts not being able to enter highsec is a consequence whatever the voices in your head tell you this can be worked around too all it would do is make it hilariously easy to ruin other peoples sec statusalso 1010
if it can be worked around its no consequence at allof course u can still pretend otherwise the only ppl this would affect is r 10s and their alts u could also rant some more and just straw man your way through the whole thread again thats also an option
youre a lot better at strawmen than i could ever hope to beshow me on the doll where the big mean 10 touched you
you must have a very limited mental capacity if you believe this and what of nullsec do you want all your ridiculous and poorly concieved ideas with limited jetcans abandoned ships trade restrictions and random customs interference to be extended into to lawless space lowsec is already lawless with oversight which makes your entire concept of absurd arbitrary restrictions on everything rather stupid unless you want to change all of space to highsecaside from all of this if you managed to cease being overly dim witted for 3 seconds youd realize not only are your emorage inspired ideas bad but that no matter what kind of idiotic restrictions you can think of 10s could always use 1dayold disposable alts to middleman between highsec alts and criminal alts no amount of restrictions can matter when the character is thrown away afterwards kinda renders your poorly thought ideas a bit pointless dont you thinkepic entertainment watching your aimless justifications chase each other in circles however
i like the idea of having corp wardecs price scale to the number of relative corp membersthough as previous people have stated corps and alliances are generally loaded with iskthe price will make no difference to the largest corporations in the game ie major alliances such as goons or it or the likethey are rich enough to afford even the highest pricesimho it will not affect lownull sec in any way because obviously you dont need a wardec to fight out there the current system is basically punishing players who want to form a group and in a game where grouping together is practically mandatory this is terrible for the games evolution if all the current corporations and alliances remain in their current positions and power bases the game never changes and that is also badbasically as i understand it the wardec system is a way for player corporations to bribe concord the supposed international police force that keeps peace in the eve universe in order for concord to look the other way when that corp attacks the decced corp if the game is trying to be as realistic as possible then this should be extremely difficult to do im sure if you tried to bribe interpol youd get laughed into submission if you offered the equivalent of 2mil isk to themon the flipside corps should be rewarded for thier standings imo so to balance id ask that concord standing of the deccing corp give a discount proportionally
thats because you can see only those who use this skill to scam you cant even notice those who use it for legitimate purposespurely amarr trained player would say that ecm skills are useless and should be removed because they can be used by other players against him if hes not careful enough sub capital pilot would say that fighter bombers skill is useless and should be removed because it can be used by other players against him if hes not careful enough nontrader would say that margin trading skill is useless and should be removed because it can be used by other players against him if hes not careful enoughi see a pattern here
no scamming is part of eve margin trading is perfect for it also it is a highly useful skill for traders what you are saying is the equivalent of removing battleships from game cuz they are used to gank ppl
i actually ran into this scam about a week ago when selling some old stockpiled mega pulses in jita as per the usual i viewed the market details and spotted an outragously awesome buy order buying higher than all the sell orders as you can imagine i was stoked some instant awesome cash started yapping about it to some corpies as i went to sell my pulse lasers and wham you do not have the minimum quantity it required something absurd in the several hundreds i only had about 30 i didnt die as often as i thought i would when i stockpiled d i took a closer look and thats when i learned that you can actually set a minimum amount on buy ordersnow i agree the scam is very clever i am also a fan of scamming being a part of eve and i dont think it should be flattened at every turn with that said however i do think scamming should have its own risk just like everything else in eveas such here is this quotenow with that quoted i would like to see buy orders with a minimum amount disallow margin trading will this stop the scam no but it will make it a hell of a lot riskier to the scammer risk v rewardin the scenario of the scam that i found the order was for something sick in the several hundreds infact the order was right around the amount of all the mega pulse turrets in jita combined valued somewhere in the several billions several hundred of these turrets likely placed on the market by the scammer in question were set well overpriced but still cheaper than this incredible buy orderlets say i had bought them all up to sell them to this buy order bam rejected im stuck with a stock of mega pulses that i cant use and selling them at their actual prices will put me at a loss this is market pvp this is winhowever if said scammer puts that order up with the proposed change and i buy his turrets for the same thing he just cancels the buy order leaving me stuck with the product yet againnow lets say the scammer puts up the sell and buy orders and goes afk or logs off now here is where the risk comes in i buy them up hes not around to see that i did and then bam i sell to a fully backed buy order from a scammer reversing the scam on himwith the anonymity of the market you cant track who that buy order belongs to until you successfully interact with it making it a high risk scam reversal with potentially ground breaking rewardsdoes this fix the problem maybe not but what it does do is bring risk to the scam hell that change might even make people more inclined to bite the scam is that a bad thing depends on your point of view but buyer education and common sense should always rule the daytldr  add risk to scamming
the problem is the negative impact this has on people using the margin trading skill for less nefarious purposesthats the balance that the smart guys in iceland are supposed to be paid to solve destroying the usefulness of the skill almost entirely in order to prevent a couple of scams which lets be honestonly take advantage of greedy people is not a proper solutionit seems in this thread that the people who are opposed to margin trading are people who dont use andor dont understand margin tradingunsupported
its rather ironic i lost something like 4 billion isk to the margin trading scam just within the past week or two quite honestly i never realized that players couldnt go into negative isk partially due to the fact that players require a positive balance to be sold in the character bazaar margin trading scam works very well and is completely capable of catching a person as many as 3 times before they figure it out i myself fell for it withing my first 6 months of playing and having never gotten into margin trading again something more than 2 years later you think you can beat them to the sale on those buy orders they have up but thats quite impossible as they do not really exist knowing its a scam really doesnt help unless you also know you cant win thats 38 billion isk goneanyway yeah it needs fixed even making them liable doesnt help as all they need is a couple weeks to train the skills on an alt for it to be worth better than a billion isk in one successful scam transfer to alt biomass rinse repeat
where is the negative impact in not allowing a buyer set a minimum amount for margin trading this simply makes the scammers have a risky proposition while legitimate traders can continue to margin tradeim fairly new to the trading side of things and i am hoping someone can enlighten me as to if this will have any impact at all on legitimate traders
no you should be able to tractor loot owned by another person but you should still get flagged for it this makes noctiss incredible bait ships that will really f a carebears day up
i half way agree wrecks left for 1 hour should turn blue having wrecks sit for 2 hours then disappear is kinda lame if they cantwont loot them in 1 hour they should be ffa
i like the mechanic the way it is this way i can blue a wreck just before a ninja gets to it and before they can get to the next one and the next and so onrage and tears over lost loot and me not falling for his fail bait operation  the best
i agree on one condition the wreck of a pvp ship is still owned by the destroyed ships pilot
yes please
great idea
this will not happen ccp already said they would do it if they couldill support it anyway though
agreed dead corp names should not be kept around for all eternity
what if a corporation has less than 5 players would it need to meet all criteria or just oneotherwise if no ones been on for half a year in their corp kill the corp they arent using it
yes please
whybecause a few bytes of data sitting on a backup disk somewhere creates such huge problems for the database by the same argumentation all character names should be freed up automatically if person doesnt log in for x days  now that would be fun notcorporationalliance names and tickers has almost as much value as character names in some cases more so why else would goons deliberately hijack bob back in the day if not to annoythanks but no thanks
here how it looks like right now 00 have sov sov i based on controlling more and more of connected systems but it can be also used for just controlling one systemin theory the same can be used in whbut in wh things are a little bit different you control system if you can hold the system no ammount of virtual sov mechanic will change that in 00 you have tcuetc that you have to use to claimcapture system in wh where all combat is ususally limited to as long passage is open few hours usually when moving larger forces such mechanic would block all possibility of capturing whin wh no one will here your screem if you hold the system its yours if you cant well say hello to your cloning station
since possession and sovereignty of a system in eve comes at the barrels of your guns and might is indeed right these claim units already exist theyre called ships you have outgrown your system move to deeper wh space or split your corp and take another similardepth system wormhole space was specifically designed not to have stations i suggest that you move to nullsecwaa waa can i have free isk with no effort please

ninja salvagers often are flagged to the mission runner thats really the whole point of ninja salvaging to get the mission runner to aggress so you can come back in with a gank ship and take him out
okay ill start here as much as i would love the idea that convincing you guys would be enough to change something in eveit sadly wont if the ideas that are brought to the csm and passed up to ccp dont get acknowledged then neither will mine and to an extent i agree that this change would most likely be too much work for ccp for the small change that it would bring forth that said my main goal in this thread was not to change anything but to simply state my opinion apart from that the people who would have to vote on my behalf would be the mission runner crowd which for the most part have no interest in pvp what so ever because while being a solution to much confusion it would do just thatoffer a new opportunity for pvp in high sec while eliminating a risk free way to earn isk first off i have to say i disagree that ninja salvaging doesnt cause a problem so being a topic that has been beaten to death im not too sure where to start i think ill start with your quotes on page one that everyone values so highlylets break them down and see what they actually bring to the tablekeep in mind that i will treat what ccp says as gods word just for the sake of argument after all it is their game1 ccp mitnal in quote one the link doesnt work so all i have to go on is the quote itself and not what was said in the thread and the quote says nothing other than that ccp wants it to be a mini profession and doesnt consider salvaging as theft2 gm faolchu  in quote two say the same thing basicallythat its an intended game mechanic and not an exploit i for one never said it was an exploit but that it was a bad game design but ill get to that later on in this postthe key part of this quote is the bottom half eve is a harsh placeits a do or die worldwhat is harsh about scanning down a player who cant shoot youand salvaging his wrecks while he tanks the mission nothing at all its free isk not only that but it takes nothing to train an alt which can do thisi estimate two weeks if not less even faster now that we have the 100 training time bonus on new characterscontinued below
3 senior gm ytterbium  this one is very very interesting and a major key in my argument you quoted the part that you wanted to see but not the relevant part one of the most used arguments are its not your wreck and only the loot inside is yours i am going to kill this argument once and for all now againkeep im mind that we are taking the word of ccp as the word of god the part you should have quoted is thiswownow this brings a whole new light on the subject now doesnt it this is a senior gm who states that the wreck does in fact belong to the pilot who accepted the mission this along with the fact that the wreck has my corp name on itcan not be shot or tractor beamed by anyone but myself and my corp clearly proves that the wreck is in factmine he doesnt say it belongs to me as long as my loot is in therebut that it is plain and simplemine4 ccp prism x  in this quote ccp prism x took it upon himself to get a little sarcasticno  sherlock but he doesnt address any of the key points players bring up in this or any other thread on this subject all he says is that its not stealing which clearly contradicts what senior gm ytterbium stated in the quote above as far as i know taking anything from a wreck that is mine which we have proven to be mine is stealing so either they need to talk it over what it is exactly that they wantor to fix the game mechanic to reflect this choice like change the ownership of the wreck when looted so until they decide what it is they wanti will call it bad game design simple as that why because the game mechanic doesnt reflect what they say it is intended to be5 ccp incognito  this quote confirms my statement from above and again contradicts what senior gm ytterbium stated in his post it confirms my statement that the game mechanic doesnt reflect what the designers intend it to be hence its bad game design as i have said many times in this thread bad game design which causes confusion and these threads that keep arising on this subjecthe has spoken with the designers and they have concluded that the wreck is not mine but the loot is why then after the wreck is looteddoes it remain unchanged i still cant shoot it or tractor beam it as a salvager or someone not in that corp this again confirms a problem and a contradiction in the game design as far as salvaging goescontinued below
no it doesnt but the facts above prove that it is and i hope i helped clear you nicely prepaired quote bible up a bit and maybe even convince you that there is infact a problem at hand that causes this confusion what it is and how to fix it i will leave up to the developers to solve in my opinion flagging the salvager at least in missionswould solve the problem while opening new doors to pvp in high secand spice up mission running a bitposts have been taken from the thread linked in the op on page 10
why bring up this  over and over its boring1
yes please flag ninjas as thieves just for salvaging so i can blow up more mission runners im krustykrab and i approve this message paid for by the krustykrab for ninja president alliance all rights reserved
with your points on the quotes ill say one thing ccp devgm
no only loot thieves are flagged for aggression thats kind of the whole frigging point of these threads its inconsistent that salvaging and looting mission objectives doesnt flag for theft support op not that anything is likely to change
i like the idea of bringing back mines i pledge my support with the following behaviors1 mines get treated like warp disruption bubbles and are an object launched from any ship with the appropriate skills then anchored2 anchor time of 30 seconds per mine3 mine is anchored where its launched no ability to move it around like a pos module you launch it right click anchor and it anchors it right there4 mines are only able to be launched for corp all kill mails go to the corporation as is with poss this should prevent the concord issues5 mines utilize the corporationalliances standings and trigger on any pilot with 00 or less standings and not configurable6 mines should stay deployed in space for the same duration as a gsc can when anchored7 mines should be unanchorable by anyone within 2500m8 mines detonate on detection of a target ship within 5000m so long as that ship is traveling over 30ms9 explosion radius of 7500m on t1 mines and 10000m on t2 mines10 cant be anchored within 20km of a stargate11 cant be anchored within 3km of eachother12 comes in the flavors of 2 combined damage types emtherm  kinexpl13 only anchorable in nullwh space14 only one mine can be anchored on grid at once15 cloaked ships still get decloaked at normal range16 mines should cost 12m for t2 with top end damagenow that seems like a lot of stipulations but with it all working together this is how i picture the situationscenario with my rulesmy corporation starts basing out of a null system that happens to be a dead end we decide that we want to make our system a royal pain to get into without our being able to take actionwe purchase a large amount of mines and several interdiction bubbles we spread the bubbles in a sphere around the gate preventing anyone not in a nullified t3 cruiser from warping out within those bubbles but far enough away from the gate to prevent instapop on jump in for neutsreds we deploy our minesthe net of mines is huge spanning the entire area just deploying 20 of the mines takes 10 minutes plus the time of flying your ship to a location thats not within range of another mine to deploy itweve spent hours setting up our entire minefield while doing so were vulnerable to attack but when were done our minefield covers the entire gate area except for one safe little core a neutral jumps in oh  this im not flying through that minefield burns back to the gate and leaves without any mines detonating in this theoretical safe zonea cloaky jumps into the system lets say we dont have a guard posted he flies very slowly and deliberately through the minefield at a brisk 29ms to avoid being blown to kingdom come by the mines because hes within the decloaking range of the densely packed minefield his slow journey through the field leaves him vulnerable and detectable acting as a deterrent for afk cloakers entering the systemneutral shows up in local a patrol warps to the gate if they see a cloaky ship slow boating out of the mine field they destroy it assuming the cloaker doesnt trigger the mines first if the cloaker stays in the safe zone around the gate cloaked the defending group merely has to search that small area to reveal the intruderon the flip side if the gate is unattended the intruder can unanchor the mines or just slip through them without being destroyed or if the intruder happens to be a fleet of enemy warships they can blast their way through the mines or if the entrance is manned be at a disadvantage against the defenders adding a new feel to spontaneous engagements overall mines the way i envision them would add the ability for some awesome tactics on both the attacking and defending sidesthrow in a minelayer ship that gets a bonus to the anchoring and unanchoring time of the mines and youve got yourself an awesome new game mechanic
i thought id expand a bit on minelayer ships the way i envision them id like them to be designed with hulls similar to the style used on thesegate keeperdrudendevastatorhayconsilurusimages pulled from deviant arts entries for the create a starship contestwith exception of the gate keeper design i dont prefer any of the ship models they just illustrate the kind of feel id like to have a ship specialized in mines look likeinfact the gate keeper design would make an awesome mine layer ship and is personally my vote for such a rolenow as far as how the ship functions is concerned id like it to be able to boast a formidable tank but lack a real offensive capability as such it should be able to fulfil either a shield or armor tank role should the pilot decide to armor tank it or fit a less than omg shield tank they can fit unbonused ew modules point web tds etc etc the ship should be able to field 5 unbonused medium drones and have no weapon mounts on the highs but have 2 high slots available for its usenow as far as the mines are concerned give it a bay specifically for mines that can hold nothing else similar to the orcas ore holdgive it a bonus to the anchoring  unanchoring time of mines so that it effectively can deploy and remove mine threats once every 15 seconds at maximum skills requiring 25 minutes to anchor 100 minesi know my idea is far more of a monstrosity than others as far as quantity of mines but honestly if were going to have mines we need to be capable of creating vast fields of them if youre willing to invest in themguestimating 100 t2 mines under how id like to see it work youre looking at 100m  1mea to set up a large minefield at any given time someone can come in and unanchor or destroy those mines or trigger them dying and requiring you to replace themhaving the mines not trigger unless the detected ship is going higher than an alloted speed creates a way for people to get around a minefield should it be unattended by the owner or they are capable of fending off whatever defense is being fielded while they crawl through itnow obviously lag is a different story but honestly thats up to ccp to figure out
for the rest of this year can ccp please not come out with any more broken expansions instead how about they focus on all the previous junk they crapped out over the past few years an expansion entirely dedicated to fixing all the past stuff that was supposed to be functional yet isntccp can even call this expansion retrospect  rectify
inb4 the statistics show that new content attracts customers more than polished contentbut seriously this has been proposed a billion times adapt if you cant make the bugs unbalancedness and grind work for you eves not your game still i support it because angel  is stupid and hybrids could be cool
i have an idea ceo missions these missions would be offered by the ceo of a npc corp they would be incredibly difficult 35 people working on them but would have incredible awards you would need to have a certain standings and would work like storyline missions but would take more missions to get one
you mean lvl 5s
no i mean something harder and more profitable than lvl 5s
you mean incursions
but missions you can choose where the lps go you can have it closer to where your main area youre around is
like doing lvl 5s for the corporation you mission for
again harder though its basically harder that lvl 5 easier than headquarters incursions and more profitable than lvl 5s but not so much as incursions
you mean like doing a level 5 whilst there is an incursion ongoing in the same constellation
this thread delivers
when i logged on to eve i pressed r or z twice to do a barrel roll but my ship did not do one and i blew up this must be fixed asap
confirming tackled titans need to have a barrel roll available
what would you say if you could buy back skill points that you missed by missing that endding training sesion or when you take a brake from eve but forgot to set skills a charicter should have a max amount of skills that they could posible get due to there age of charater so ccp could figure the max amount out and offer for a price to get back some or all of those lost skill pointsjust a thought
no
no
is this the same guy about the capital v skill lost and no make a deposit on paying for lost sp buy keeping your clone updated at all times
you mean office rentals
help with what corporation names tickers in particular are as coveted as character names and carry the same historicalemotional significancejust imagine some noobcarebear corp in highsec acquiring veto used for ease of recognition because someone forgot a bill or they decided to take some time off thanks but no thanksps since you have probably got your mind set on a specific corp nameticker why not ask cs to contact the ceo through email assuming you dont already have it you may be able to purchase it like normal  or is it the null selfentitlement demanding stuff for free again
no
part of the problem here is that cs will not assist in these matters i recently tried to obtain a chat channel that has been abandoned for the use of an alliance i plan on forming in the somewhat near future and i really wanted the channel name and hoped that as it is dead and abandoned ive been in the channel for about a month with my character on from server launch to dt with no activityccps official response essentially told me that should i want to obtain the channel or corporation they actually mentioned corps despite the fact that i didnt mention it at all that i was the one responsible for getting in contact with the owner of the respective channelcorp and they could not provide me any information on who owned itthey wouldnt even give me the character name of who owned the public channel because of this i seriously doubt they will send an email on behalf of another player to someones personal inbox starting such a policy as well would cause a cataclysmic overload in ccps petition hoppers as wellthough with that said i do think something needs to be done about it as forming corporations these days does require a lot of planning if you want a good name let alone a ticker worth anythingmore importantly to me though dead chat channels owned by characters who are no longer subscribed needs to be fixed ive formed about 2030 chat channels in eve the ownership was retained to me i stopped using them and i was communal enough to delete the channels so the names could be used by others if they so desiredin a nutshell theres something old and dead in several facets of the game that are irritating to many people but somehow it must be fixed while keeping the history intact
corps can exist without paying rent were not talking about active corps here were talking about corps that are populated by people who dont play anymore and werent closed out likely because they all rage quit ive been in this corp for almost 3 years so you can take your tinfoil hat off i dont have any designs on your corp ccp designed corps without a designed death upon abandonment as more players play and more players want to start their own corps the possible tickers will eventually run out that is something ccp should address sooner rather than later along those same lines corp names will eventually run out as well granted we can use garbage names like sadguipwaer for a while before we reach that point and that too should be addressed before it becomes an issue in my opinion for tickers weve really started to get to the point where people resort to nonsensical tickers because they give up trying to find one that isnt already takeni cant complain but noobs are usually the ones trying to start new corps and they dont often have a billion isk sitting aroundbecause isk sinks are good things because active corps already pay for a lot of stuff this would be a rather small amount in comparison i would imagine it being maybe 100k isk for a corp full of newer players i didnt suggest an amount simply because ccp would be better suited to determine the right balance between not burdening corps and clearing out dead corpsthey really dont when ive played in high sec war decing corps none of my alts are in one currently targets were picked that had a lot of players who autopiloted or flew around in expensive ships that we drooled over as we watched fly past our camps for active war decs granted each high sec war dec corp is different but targets are rarely picked at random simply because it is a target rich environment even with the most basic filters it improves the game by allowing new players more opportunity to express themselves in the corp name they pick instead of letting failed corps hold their names foreverps supporting my proposal
i dont know about anyone else but to me putting the pos password in for every session change is stupid pos passwords need to be saved to a list that will automatically be referenced by a pos for clearance and can be edited at will like places arewill you join me in asking for a bandage over this papercut
it would be better to be able to set the access to certain things that are attached to poss to be based on standings instead of passwords but whatever it can be amusing to be able to access the jump bridge network of an alliance you are no longer blue to or drain it by using mwd  always a good time but they really shouldnt have to change the passwords to said network every time someone leaves the alliance to keep it secure
every wh have an object called cosmic signature attached to it few kilometers from wh centerthis thing can not be addded to overwiev you cant interact with it warp to it see it on dscan you can select it if by chance your mouse is at the right spot wen you clickbutthis thing alse decloaks cloaked shipsit is good that wh decloaksit is bad that non interactive  unseen object decloaksmy proposal is to either remove it or just change some flags in db to make it that cloaked ships can just pass it without decloak
sounds resonable

you have a point
a bright point on a field of darkness ffffff on 000000 if you will
1 fully supportedincidentally if anyone from ccp reads this well it could happenthe total silence from you on this subject is what were talking about when we say you dont communicate with us well enough
the cover mechanic can easily be introduced in incursions or other missions where ship numbers are limited giving it an unique and first step to a true space immersion
they already have 23 complete code rewrites on the list but this can be added after thosecarbon is one rewrite and changing everything to support multithreading is another because of those one is gonna happen and multithreading is much more needed that losand no combining it all into one rewrite is pants tingly ed no developerengineer in their right mind would ever do it and keep their job
all eve needs to be perfected is chesthigh walls
so what do you think about the whole 00 thing now
i sence much hostility in this oneprithee art thou engorged with irei see no reason since the items up for discussion are ones the entire player base has been wanting discussed with ccp
supportedposs need lots of love
ccp
that is actually a pretty awesome idea
i find it odd that the shortest ranged guns aparently go on the slowest least maneuverable ships in the gamereally when was the last time someone saw a blaster ship outside of an undock campgank or pveedit i do like the idea i saw earlier where blasters got a boost to alphalower rof and rails got a boost to roflower alpha still doesnt adress the fact that gallente ships are slow and ponderous and the first thing a new gallente pilot should do is train minmatar
i wonder why caldari gun boats are even suckier than gallente gun boatswhen was the last time you saw feroxrokh outside of your ship preview window
ok this is cool and all but can you first lighten the anom nerf a bit while ccp is working on farms and fields so when it falls apart people can still have some isk to fall back on instead of having to wait out jump clone timers and run lvl 4s
i live in a 00 npc sov area my alliance has been there 5 years we have 6 systems that are npc sov this was not a problem before the new sov changes because all of the systems would get the same amount of sites for farming for npc nullsec systems i propose a mechanic that would increase the systems worth somehow whether it be through a combination of missions faction and cost we are willing to do the work and understand having better systems would require us to defend them more but that is the nature of every system we also welcome more targets why not allow us to leverage these npc factions so their systems are betterthis is a very niche reply seeing as though there are not many npc owned nullsec areas but i dont think it should go overlookedthank yousan
starbase pos refiningstarbases should be capable of refining at perfect levels with max skills in exchange for the convenience of getting perfect refine at a pos the refinery takes time to process the ore a million m3 for example could take 10 hours as a loose example this would be a huge mistake at those numbers a 5 man crew in a couple hours would back the station up for a couple days would be best to drop that down to around say 30minutes enough to be use full but not have a small alliance backing it up for weeks
here are a few of my ideas for improving pos mechanicsuser level pos roles would be a grand thing player a can online modules and fuel pos aplayer b can offline silos on pos a and b but not cplayer c can has full control over pos c but cannot do anything with a and bimproved notifications showing time left not just amounts and i wouldnt mind audit logs on pos structures so you can see who took what out and whenmake anchoring levels do something to reduce the time it takes to anchor a module increase a queue or allow for multiple things to be anchored simultaneouslya better anchoring interface that allows for some sort of templating of where mods are anchored in a pos for more uniform configurations or corp standards make starbase defense management useful for something besides gunning my idea would be something like marketing skills level 1 allows for remote management within the same solar system level 2 extends that range to systems within 5 jumps and each subsequent level then doubles it level 5 allows for remote management anywhere within current region the ability to unanchor guns with ammo in them i dont care if it gets eaten in the process some sort of notification of lowno ammo in pos gunsallow regular or capital tractor beams to pull unanchored mods towards you as if they were canspersonally id like to be able to build a tower kit in the station complete with some sort of fitting to say how i would like the modules deployed and a few hrs of fuel said kit is then brought out and anchored and i come back in a couple hours to find everything in its place and then i begin onlining but that is probably wishful thinking
the api is shockingly lacking when it comes to pos i cant tell what the fuel consumption for lohw is via the api this could probably be fixed with fuel pellets i cant tell which container is at which pos via the api ccp stated in a roundtable that xyz coordinates not planetmoon would be not that hard wait youre saying theyre not in there already to implement  i cant see pos configuration anchoredonlinereaction configuration via the apialso its not possible to filter modules by status onlineanchoredincapped on the overview

i agree with you therethere are all manner of activities for a new player to get involved with right from their first login check the new citizens useful threads page which needs to be merged with the new citizens useful threads page with mitnals link in new citizens qa sticky being updated ton point to the right pagemany pages in the wiki are already referenced during the introductory missions  people just need to read that copious amount of information work through the tutorials with a completely new player say your noneve spouse or workmate and listen to what kinds of questions they askall a new player needs in order to get involved with life in nullsec from day 1 is a friendly capsuleer willing to show them the ropesmy only request at this point would be for ccp to bring back the original opening sequence where aura is narrating the story about earth humanities reach into space the eve wormhole its collapse the fall of spacefaring civilization the rise of capsuleers then segue into the you have become what most people fear rifterflyingthroughasteroids clip more background to the story highlighting the harsh cruel nature of the world in this gamethe five career missions lead the player through industry missionrunning combat astrometrics basic pvp equipment ship loss and working with the marketall that is left is for the new player to find a gang to hang with there is nothing a tutorial can do for annew player beyond this point the pilot is capable of flying their ship navigating to a destination system taking part in the market and engaging in piracywelcome to the world of capitalism and piracy indeed
they are underpowered in relation to supercarriers though which is why they should be buffed to take this new ship class into account that is what you do when you add in new features you first try to buff the older features to bring them up to snuff you dont go to nerfing down the new feature unless you have no other choiceehh thats semidebatable pos bashing is still probably the most important aspect of sov warfare since it is the only way to gain control over the tech moons that drive bigalliance sov warfare the ihubs are just an extra annoyance that needs to be taken into account during the process when it comes down to pos bashing dreads are still king the main issue with dreadnoughts bashing poss is that their long seige timers make them sitting ducks if they get hotdropped a shorter cycle time would help with that some and a buff to their total hp would give them a greater chance to hold out in a fight or get out of dodge if things go badlythat depends if we just give them a broad damage increase then yes it will affect carriers as well which deserve a hp buff anyway in my opinion but if we go with a more limited option such as giving them a damage boost agaisnt objects with over say a 1012km sig radius then you would only see the impact on supercarriers and titans titans got a huge hp bonus after dominion and only get killed by large fleets anyway so dreads doing a bit more damage to them doesnt really make a huge differenti honestly dont think them being able to take on subcaps is that big of an issue theyre the most powerful pvp ships in eve they should be able to hold their own against multiple players in different shiptypes if you buff dreads to the point where a dread fleet has a change to drop and kill a supercarrier then youre going to see them drop on subcapital targets a whole lot less the only reason they drop a 25billion isk ship on subcaps now is because they really dont have anything to fear besides other supers coming down on their headsright now supers have no fear the enemys supercarrier pilots are all watchlisted so they know when they can and cannot engage a target in their own supers if you give a much cheaper and easily fielded ship like the dreadnoughts which also have the same jump range as supers the ability to pounce on them in groups and take them down then you add a whole lot of fear and uncertainty to the equation people will be a lot less loose with their supers if they have that uncertaintyi just think its time to give carriers and dreadnoughts some love they have been around for years and havent changed much capital warfare in eve has changed with dominion and i just think dreads and carriers need to be buffed a little to help bring them into the modern age of capital warfare supercarriers will probably need to be nerfed but nerfs should never be your first option buff up the older capitals and then pepper in a couple nerfs to supers to bridge the gap and bring both sides into a better balance
dread buffreduced seige timer to 5 min in line with triageincrease damage for larger targets eg against super capitalssuper carrierremove the ability of super carriers to lock structures if you want to shoot a structure bring dreads i do own a super and find it ridiculous that my aeon out dpss a seiged dread on a control tower
ehh i dont really mind them being able to target structures ihubs and stations are a drag to tear down as it is plus fighterbombers cant hit poss which are what sov warfare is really about also i had an idea todaycapital interdictor vesselsone of the main issues brought up in this thread is the supers ability to either neut down or outright kill heavy interdictors one of only two ships in the game capable of pinning a supercarrier down the only other option then is dictor bubbles but they are only temporary and the ships that lay down more of them die if you look at them funny buffing hictors to the point where they can hang with a supercarrier just seems absurd to me itd be like trying to get a chihuahua to hang onto mike tysons ankle without being killed that line of thought lead me to this idea i honestly doubt its going to be a complete solution but i havent seen anyone else propose something like this yet and doing a little thinking outside the box never hurt anyonebasically im proposing a capitalclass interdictor vessel it would have terrible dps but its tank would be superior to a dreadnoughts and it would be able to equip a capital warp jamming module basically a bigger meaner version of the hictors infinite point i imagine it would need to have an ecm immunity either naturally or when its point is activated so that a couple falcons dont render it uselesswhat this would do is add more risk to supercarrier hotdrops which is something a lot of supers dont currently haveimagine this scenario group a decides to drop some carriers repping a posihubstation with a super or two  group b manages to pin the supers with hictors the hictors hold on for dear life until group b lights a cyno and jumps in a couple capital interdictors along with a capital killteam of carriers dreads and maybe a couple supers at this point group a has two choices either let their hotdropping supers die or escalate the situation group a escalates as does group b and what started as a small hotdrop turns into a fullon brawl between two capital fleetsbasically this would force supercarriers into more life or death situations and would lead to them actually dying it would force them to choose their targets carefully and weed out pilots who are sloppy with their supers it would add a threat to supers that they couldnt just neut out or shred in secondsof course supercarrier hotdrops would still happen since not every group could assemble a killteam quick enough to catch the superbut the threat of it would still there hictors would still have their place in subcap fleets and to get the initial tackle on a supercap but they would no longer have to die in droves to keep a super pinned down
is it me or are we seeing the same suggestions over and over and over from people who never bothered to read the thread
a lot of people like to complain too much methinks dreads shouldnt be dropping on towers without capital support ready to back them up eh however i think due to the recent supercarrier buff it would be reasonable to reduce siege cycle time to 5 minutes rather than 10 this makes it so dreads arent so much of a helpless target anymore stop wanting to hit  with the nerf bat already loledit supercarries dont need a nerf quit crying just because ncdot has more supercaps than you doesnt mean you must nerf them if you cant tackle all of them bring more dictors
yesto be fair its a long thread
thats silly supercarriers were overbuffed in dominion and youre saying that mistake shouldnt be corrected but that its set in stone and the rest of the game has to adjust to fit them inif you put some new chairs in your lounge and decide you dont like where theyre positioned do you leave the chairs in place and demolish your entire house and rebuild it so that they fit or do you correct your mistake and move the furnitureheres how pos sieges with dreads go these days1form up capfleet2count your supercarriers3count the hostile supercarriers4if you have more supercarriers its safe to send the dreads ina hp buff to carriers will vastly decrease their vulnerability against subcaps they dont need thati actually dont think titans are anywhere near as overpowered as supercarriers as i stated way back in this thread their primary weapon systems actually take up fitting slots and dont have the same versatility against tacklers and other subcaps youve responded to the overpowering of supercarriers with what is effectively a nerf to titans the supercarriers are the hull thats out of sync so fix the supercarrier dont demolish the house just to make the furniture fitthat aside youve missed the whole point of the original suggestion which is to make supercarriers less effective against subcap fleets ive no problem with supercaps killing other caps and supercaps thats the role ccp gave them in dominion the issue is their ability to destroy subcapitals including the dictors and hictors required to tackle them just as easily because of their wealth of utility slots and effectively infinite waves of drones
one of the attractive things about eve has always been the idea that there was no endgame ubermensch and that unlike say wows pvp where you have to grind up to level 80 to join in with the big boys in eve even the most experienced player can be vulnerable to relative newbies if you make dreads the antisupercap vessel of choice and tolerate supercaps being largely immune to anyone not in another capship youve removed this distinction and implemented a you must grind this much xp to compete mindset seen in other more mainstream mmos if you maintain the existing versatility of supercarriers youll still see them dropped on anything and everything because they can swat away dictors and hictors with points neuts smartbombs and endless waves of warrior iis if you reduce this ability so that a supercarrier needs support and by support i dont just mean more supercarriers to break a tackle and escape the bubbles and infinipoints you see a more wellrounded fleet and more interesting combatyou know whats even harder to watchlist and track than dreadfleets battleships and dictors they havent changed much because they are essentially pretty well balanced and were universally desirable until dominion introduced an overbuff to supercarriers so that dreads could be murdered with impunity
theyre still carriers though they should be versitile you shouldnt be able to just lob subcaps at them and have success as for hictors and dictors it kind of makes sense that theyd get demolished they are punching too high above their weightclass you cant really buff them up to the point where theyd be able to keep up with supers or theyd just end up being too overpowered in subcap fleets and you cant nerf down supers without making them totally helpless to subcapsthats why i put forward that capital interdictor idea a couple posts ago it creates a ship whos job it is to pin down supers youd still need hictors for the intitial tackle but once the capital dictors roll onto the field they would take over and you wouldnt need waves of hictors and dictors to die in droves to lock down the supercarrier give dreads a slight buff so that they can travel alongside the capital dictors to act as a killteam and a lotof the issue with supercarriers gets solved if they get pinned down by a capital dictor they have to fight their way out of it and the situation will likely escalate into a fullon capital engatement where even more supers are put at risk
supportingideally a resolution would be the option to view  fit local fittings cant see anything else working as well for me personally unless the server side saved fits got increased by a couple of orders of magnitudeoh and make fits add rigs again the manager claims to do it then totally fails
ill go for option 3 it was done before why cant we do it now
supported as now using eft and a notepad 50 fittings is not nearly enough when you can fly pretty much every subcap in game
can i have your stuff
great numbers are fantasticnow factor in overhead you either react in onsite and thus have a pos to feed and the transport time to there or you export it which is extremely time consuming timemoney pretty high number for the 90milhr assuming its right but thats only one gasand youre missing the point most of your numbers are hovering at okay iskhr prices what do you think will happen when gas is harvested supply will increase while demand does not resulting in lower prices and thus lower incomeas for boosters that market fluctuates like crazy i used to be a large part of it it has potential to be highly lucrative or an extreme waste of timeremember that barrier to entry is huge in determining the value of something the barrier to entry for mining gas effectively currently is having a cruiser or battlecruiser trained that has the cpu for 5 harvesters and a rank 1 skill trained to 5 for 5 harvesters pretty low barrier to entry
lolsalazaryou are definately harvesting the wrong gas clouds just sayingdefinately need a dedicated gas harvester
more supply will not saturate the market many of you forget that when prices go down you get more customers ive never used a single booster since i started playing eve online but id love to start any day theyre just too damn expensive and nobody cares much for a gas cloud either point is if boosters get cheaper there will be more money in the booster market this trend would continue until boosters get so cheap that everyone can have as much as they want and were nowhere near that pointi suggest something on the order of the mining barge for a gas mining ship something that will drastically increase the amount gathered heck howabout a gas strip miner mines 3 times as fast as a regular gas miner with 3 of them its like having 9 gas miners then you can also dedicate the procurer to gas mining by giving it a 50 bonus to gas mined per mining barge skill level itll mine the stuff faster than a covetor about as fast as a hulk with max skill itll have a much smaller cargohold but hey its also a cheap ship thats nice for nullsec mining and may attract very new players in search of gas and gas doesnt take up all that much space so the only ones fussing over the cargohold are probably bot minersalso with large yields via strip miners with their slow cycle times you dont have to have only cycle time modifiers and instead can use output modifiersstrip harvester i200m3 200s durationrequires gas cloud harvesting 4strip harvester ii300m3 240s durationrequires gas cloud harvesting 5 mining 5procurer yield with max skillstech i  875m3200s  4375sectech ii  13125m3240s eff 1310m3  5458seccovetor yield with max skillstech i  750m3200s  375sectech ii  1125m3240s  4688sechulk yield with max skillstech i  9375m3200s eff 930m3  465sectech ii  140625m3240s eff 1400m3  5833sechulk yield with max skills and gas harvester upgrade x2tech i  930m316562s  5615sectech ii  1400m3198744s  7044secship with 5x gas cloud harvester iis100m340s  25seca potential upgrade of 18176 gas harvested  edited for thumbs   b
booster demand isnt low because of price its low because of lack of interest which is a result of a lack of knowledge among the general populace and severe penalties the things came prenerfed prices are actually relatively fair considering what it takes to make them hint dont buy from jita find a dealeras for the guy saying youre harvesting the wrong gas feel free to make an actual contribution notice the spreadsheet above thats helpful and i conceded that some gas harvesting is profitable but i maintain that due to a low barrier to entry and a highly volatile market gas harvesting simply is not a highly profitable venture making it so you can harvest faster is not going to change that fact
im still voting for a complete top end barge rebuild and i want it t1 forget this over priced t2 crap make it a little smaller then he orca and orca like defensive system and mining rates around the same would be perfect to me
a the noctis is a tech 2 ship so saying a tech 2 version of the noctis is kinda sillyb the gas mining ship idealy should be similar to the mining barges we already have strip miner typepersonally i think your mining the wrong gas
the noctis doesnt seem to be denoted as either t1 or t2 but considering it is constructed solely from t1 minerals ie no morphite it would be considered t1i dont really see a need for a dedicated gas harvesting ship
ask people what ship they use to mine gas most will tell you a bc or bs maybe im just an elitist but a battlecruiser should be firing guns not draging fishing nets over the side for incomein a game of fancy spaceships combat ships should be the last option to go mining in well unless your name is chribba

id like to offer some insight into fixing problems more easily but most of what i might say would sound redundant and has already been said however there is one recurring problem i frequently notice in online games the producers seem to listen a lot to the talk on the forums while thats not necessarily representative of the actual playerbase to give an example of what i mean the drake stands out in its niche and does what it does particularly well those players who enjoy the drake andor have the appropriate skills to make use of it find it to be a great ship and have no reason to go to the forums to talk about it when they could be flying it but on the other hand the players who dont have the skills to fly it andor dont find it to be an enjoyable ship will swear up and down that it is overpowered they will take this issue to the forumsso in the end you hear about all of the problems here on the forums but you dont see how many players agree that its a problem versus how many disagree perhaps that means there needs to be more voting im not sure hope that helpsps my personal opinion is that the drakes low damage output makes it ideally suited for tanking and nothing else and the overuse of it in fleet warfare is due to laziness and poor planning skills but dont take my word for it be your own judgeand i will swear up and down that you cant deny that the rifter is overpowered i love flying those things they make up over 50 of my total frigate flying in retrospect id like to see more pilots of other tech 1 frigates prove me wrong
not since like 2006 no i havent had an issue with thisyou do realize you answered your own question right  o o  is that fair really forget to upgrade it happensfair enough but since youre such an uber elitist you should remember a time in eve when if you got podded in a clone that was subpar you lost all sp down to that clone level yes this included alpha clones albeit there wasnt a lot of training being done back then to begin with not like today but count your lucky stars  it could be worsehaving said that i absolutely vote no on changing the clone system whatsoever it is designed to provide a lot of functionality including punishing those who are boisterous forgetful or just plain stupid im going to go with the latter in your case as you should know better than to jump back into a fleet fight with an alpha clonetldrtho i must agree that sp tears are very tasty  thanks for sharing them
so much dumb in this thread1 npcing in a carrier in cynojammed 00 is risk free unless you are an idiot or  up your align time is considerably quicker than the minimum jump in drop probes get result warp to it time even if that werent the case if the enemy has a big enough gang to break your tank your friends also ratting in system remote reps then you should have heard about it 5 jumps earlier on intel channels2 isk inflation works the same as lp inflation  no it does not with lp inflation all those causing inflation eg mission runners suffer from it and therefore are disincentivised to mission  for that faction further due to the decrease in value of the lps this causes balance with isk inflation on the otherhand the whole of eve suffers for the sins of only the sanctum runners  the incentives dont change doing anything other than sanctums just gets even more worthless3 the guy saying to switch sanctum rewards to drops good idea but they cant be aimed at being comparable to before 100m iskhr with one account and almost no risk is not healthy for the economy that all said as a compromise id be happy to have the same level of sanctums back again but no local in 00 that would balance the riskreward a little more
i wonder if the anomaly changes would have been better received if instead of removing certain classes of spawns from certain security ranges completely the respawn rate was lowered based on system security
the difference is i do not need to do so unlike u because ure just too scared to handle any consequence whatsoeverslippery slope try againnice fail on missingin conclusion this all just boils down to 2 morons strawman crying about the same things they just make up over and over again just so they can keep their safety epic entertainment indeed and after this post theyll do exactly that once again so plz continue and show everyone how riskaverse and scared u r when u want to stay safer carebearing in your high sec alts
1 of course im assuming urist and stabs arent the same person since can flipping between two different people is something that happens all the time you know as a manner of basic piracy not laundering 2 so now when someone flips your can the items are just gone forever taken by magical customs officers who have no business mucking around in asteroid belts as it is now someone flipping your can means you can attack them and get your stuff back even if laundering was as big a problem as youve made it out to be your solution is far to hamfisted and disrupts far too much to make it worth it
1 and the rules would still be unchanged for anyone above 52 reread it again cause its not like 10s would stay in high sec to get shot at let alone can flip in the first place and even if hes stupid enough to warp in u can attack him on sightim guessing ure one of rented or danikas alts with their lack of reading comprehension and no common sense at all continuing to repeat everything because uve got nothing typical but go ahead and see how that works out for u
this time to completely reform the wardec systemif they want pvp they can move to null or low
if you dont want pvp you can move to hello kitty onlinesee now we both sound like s
well im not trying to get rid of wardecs just get rid of griefing as a profession
why are you trying to use other mmos standards for griefing in eve war decs are not griefing even constant continuous war decs of a corp are not griefing suicide gankings are not griefings in the context of eve they might be in other games but not hereto paraphrase a movie i dont think that word means what you think it means
if you want to make war harder to get into you should have proposal for making it harder to get out of tooright now i can waste 2m isk and 48 hours extremely easily the 2m isk i dont care about the 48 hours is a problem of course for the low low price of 1bn isk a year i can trade that in for 50m isk and only 24 hours wastedeither way this concept of griefing war is an absolute nonsense because immunity from war is rolled into the game design nobody can actually grief you with the war mechanic unless you allow them tothere is no reason to penalise players for trying to grief you beyond the penalties you can already push onto them using the game mechanics as they exist today in fact having to pay 48 hours is a penalty forced onto me so often i consider it griefing since you want to stop griefing lets do something about this war griefing no more corp leaving no more logging out and playing on alts no more logging out and playing tanks or league of legends instead when youre at war youre automatically logged in and set adrift at a safe spot yeah that should do itsounds ridiculous when its turned around doesnt it
nothing mentioned in this thread so far consitutes griefing
sometimes i think a corp that is being war decd or that is war decing should not be able to accept or remove any corp members till the war is renewed  or over  once a week too many times you get a 1 person corp do the war dec then woosh everyone joins that corpon the other handyou do the war deccing and then whoosh  all the miners  haulers have left the corp you just war decd till the war is overjust a thought
if a war dec is basically bribing concord to look the other way how about the defending corp can bribe concord to not do so so if the attacking corp pays the initial wardec fee the defending corp can pay concord the same amount to nullify the war the attacking corp can then pay double to reinitiate and the defending corp can pay that amount to nullify repeating until one party gives up basically give the defending corp a way to defend with their economic might could be a nice isk sink too
i like that idea nikita
actually it would be much more effective to hire a merc to address the situation rather than rely on some contrived game mechanic you know support home grown player driven activities that solve player social conflicts with out the use of the ccp hand holding
all wrecks already are ffa and its not fair if concord protects the thief and doesnt let you kill him
topic not supported tthis would render the branch of scanning in high sec nearly obsolote suddenly ninjas would certainly thank you for making them instant carebears if they hadnt to scan down their victims first thats part of the funalso mission earnings have been nerfed already by reducing its value still its part of mission income if you take the loot  you must live with the consequences dont be so and demand free loot for all thats not the game mechanics to get the loot on a silver plate game mechanic is that the loot belongs to someone else you scan it you take it you be marked as a pirate and you can be shoot wrecks made blue should be scanable very easy so they dont get wasted why should i leave wrecks in missions blue if they cant be found
bump
title says it all lottos now comprise atleast half of sell order forums they deserve their own forumits a real pain in the ass when your looking for a bpo or ship deal and youve got to sort out all the lottossooooooo lets make it happen i voted for youwhoever you arethanks
after some talks in a thread regarding supercarrier nerfs i had this idea it probably isnt going to be a complete solution but i am of the mindset that before we turn to the nerfbat we should either buff older mechanics or make new ones that could potentially make capital warfare more interesting also a little thinking outside the box never hurt anyoneso this leads me to the point oh that is such a terrible pun if you know whats coming of this threadcapital interdictor vesselsone of the main issues brought up about supers is their ability to either neut down or outright kill heavy interdictors one of only two ships in the game capable preventing a supercarrier from warping off or jumping to safety the only other option then is dictor bubbles but they are only temporary and the ships that lay down more of them die if you look at them funny buffing hictors to the point where they can hang with a supercarrier just seems absurd to me itd be like trying to get a chihuahua to hold down mike tysonwhat im proposing a capitalclass interdictor vessel it would have terrible dps but its tank would be superior to a dreadnoughts and it would be able to equip a capital warp jamming module basically a bigger meaner version of the hictors focused point i imagine it would need to have an ecm immunity either naturally or when its point is activated so that a couple falcons dont render it useless its point could even be similar to a dreads siege module hindering its mobility but boosting its defenses while providing an ecm immunitywhat this would do is add more risk to supercarrier hotdrops which is something a lot of supers dont currently haveimagine this scenario group a decides to drop some carriers repping a posihubstation with a super or two  group b manages to pin the supers with hictors the hictors hold on for dear life until group b lights a cyno and jumps in a couple capital interdictors along with a capital killteam of carriers dreads and maybe a couple supers at this point group a has two choices either let their hotdropping supers die or escalate the situation group a escalates as does group b and what started as a small hotdrop turns into a fullon brawl between two capital fleetsbasically this would force supercarriers into more life or death situations and would lead to them actually dying it would force them to choose their targets carefully and weed out pilots who are sloppy with their supers it would add a threat to supers that they couldnt just neut out or shred in seconds with their dronesof course supercarrier hotdrops would still happen since not every group could assemble a killteam quick enough to catch the superbut the threat of it would still there hictors would still have their place in subcap fleets and to get the initial tackle on a supercap but they would no longer have to die in droves to keep a super pinned downjust seems like this could add an interesting new element to capital warfare and give us a shiny new captial ship to fly it makes sense from a military point of view when a new weapon system is debuted there is always a period where it is uncontestedbut eventually a counter is always madetldr dreadsized interdictor vessel with a capital focused point can point down supers without being neuted all to hell andor being shredded in seconds by their drones
i would love a dread sized interdictor
whoever activates a tractor beam first gets the wreck pulled to himher makes ninjasalvaging a valid miniprofession again and makes it easier to salvage null fights tractoring someones wreck however gives you agro salvaging doesentbefore you whine about your lvl 4s go away more professions make it a cooler game and i wanna salvage stuff in space like in andromeda people might steal your mission objective who caresmarauders become slightly more attractive because they can gather wrecks from farther away but noctis alts are still better t2 rigs drop in price a bit just because people dont mind going into lagfests with a salvage cane pretending to pvp while really just salvaging t2t3 ships it constricts lvl 4s a bit more making the endless supply of isklp a little less intensethese are some posts i have added answering peoples questions if you have an argument about this proposal please take the time to read these explanation posts i have pulled from the thread
i would love this its always so annoying when im in a fleet with some corpies doing missions together and someone drops that i cant tractor their wrecks as the designated salvage pilot
i would only support this on abandoned wrecksotherwise it can be easily abused to grief
so tractoring someones wreck makes them red to you in this plan if they are griefing you shoot them
not sure how i feel about the tractoring  aggression thing i suppose it makes a little more sense than just prohibiting the action entirely not sure if marauders need another nerf thoughid personally just make them tractorable in low and null but the proposal as a whole is better than things as they stand now so it gets my 1
yellow wrecks should turn blue after 510 minutes of inactivity
aww poor baby need a bottle howabout training wheels on your trike or maybe one of those walker chairs so you can get around without learning howmore options to players  good paying the consequence of those actions also  good and fair so i agree with tractoring wrecks and getting aggro for it i also think the stupid popup message should stop asking you if you really want to steal from this person when youve recently stolen from them and still have aggro
no he needs his bike bottle and tv stolen
why exactly would you be hit with agro for tractoring wrecks around if nothing has been stolen it makes no sense
because dramielmwd  impossible to catch mission objective
double
yes because a pvp ship doesnt already have a huge combat advantage over a pve ship now lets grief them and tell them its fair because they can shoot the aggressoractually the baby here is you youre the one asking ccp for training wheels because youre not good enough to shoot at other pvpers instead you want ccp to spoonfeed you pve ships so you can then brag on how awesome your killboard stats are 
i would propose a slight modification in that i would have it so that you aggress if you tractor the wreck of someone outside your corp andor alliance otherwise fully supported
so bring a noctis and a logistics into the site hoover everything up whilst laughing mightily and then gtfowhilst this is exactly the kind of ed crap wed expect ccp to give the green light to not supported because its a terrible idea
i agree with mr uncatchable mission objective admitted the thing would be only going 500 ms but thats still five times faster than a bs fit for tanking l4s
you people are missing the point in eve there is something called riskreward now with this proposal you can shoot npcs collect lpbounties tractorsalvage whatever but there remains a chance that you will have someone try to reduce your income and steal some for themselves now comes the choice risk part of it you can shoot them and make them stop hell you can round up the corp and bait them but you still have the choice to do nothing you are all acting like aggression automatically means you have to shoot back it doesnt risk shoot your ninjasalvagerreward keep all your salvagerisk dont shoot your ninja salvager and remain safe from agroreward you get less isk because someone stole all your salvagei honestly dont know how to spell it out clearer than this its the same reasoning with every proposal people automatically assume that whenever riskreward is introduced into high sec that its going to force them to take the higher risk higher reward path but you can simply decline fighting and suffer the fact that someone took your wrecks pve ships dont stand a chance against a properly fit pvp ship so how about you have one of your corp mates on standby in a pvp ship for instances like this dont belong to a corp join one its a mmo for a reason dont want to join a corp dont want to pvp then you dont get the cookie salvagehighsec is the only place in eve where riskreward is barley visable for pve content 00 and lowsec all have riskreward associated with them want to rat in the best system you have to put up defense fleets want to run 1010s your going to need to run scouts and be prepared to get hotdroppedthats why you get agro so you can shoot and kill people that make your mission objective uncatchable i also think that taking mission objectives for the sole purpose of making peoples lives hard is considered griefing and is bannable correct me if im wrong
never thought i would do this but i agree with the goon
it should show your employment history  but not the dates and not the start datetoo easy to click a character and size them up too easily by the start dateif you see a 2004 player vs a 2011 player  you know who will inif you see however joe vs bob  its more even playing fieldi understand the original post and somewhat agree with it read my above suggestion
i support this it will be hilarious if this change occurs
supported for obviousness
counter proposal remove concord intervention in mission areas
not supported as an isolated change
troll please lock thread
trolling troll is trollingibtl
you do know that there has never been a csm composed primarily of highsec or pveoriented players right running a campaign based on fear and misinformation to rile up your own base is one thing but being dumb enough to buy into your own misinformation is another altogether
somewhat ot but i can state that elvenlord was all hugs and kisses with some of the devs at fanfest i can also state torfi is opposed to the csm
my big issue is that there is somebody on the csm right now who is also ccp not saying any names but i am sure any smart person could figure it out i personally think that is a conflict of interest
ccpsm
goonswarm are a bad thingcaldari are a good thingyou are a mixed one
simply put you should be able to tractor beam someone elses wreck in worm hole space nobody owns anything in whsso all wrecks should start as blue  and be free for all
and you shouldnt have to pay taxes on pi in a whbut no one is going to get either of those so not supportedif you want free loot from someone else get a few friends in frigs with mwdson another note i still cannot understand why i cant tractor anyones stuff in any space isnt ninja salvaging supposed to be a profession or something my guns are not kept from firing on that mission runner but i cant move his loot in a fast way towards me
100 agree canta

please visit your user settings to reenable imagesi hope this could help visualize what im thinking
i said before that i dont think there should be destroyer or battlecruiser sized weapons well perhaps there could be smallish medium weapons and mediumish large weapons these weapons have much heavier powergrid requirements than their smaller cousins and so wouldnt be easy to fit on a destroyer or battlecruiser instead a cruiser or battleship could fit the smaller weapons to save powergrid for its tank or to gain faster tracking if its willing to give up some dps a great example would be the stabber a cruiser that is so fast it can easily outmaneuver its own autocannons with smaller autocannons but not frigatesized it could still do decent damage and not have to slow down to hit anythingalternatively you might fit a larger weapon or two on a destroyer or battlecruiser if you have a lot of powergrid and you want to focus it on dps a good example of this might be the harbinger with several powergrid rigs and reactor control units you could fit perhaps 3 or 4 battlecruiser size weapons in addition to the regular cruiser weapons it wouldnt have jack for tank but its dps would be higher than any other battlecruiser and almost comparable to a battleshipand the weapons would count as either of the two sizes for skill bonusesnot a particularly useful option though i cant help but think about them whenever im fitting a harbinger or dogfighting in a stabber without further ado i give you the destroyersized autocannon and battlecruisersized pulse laser200mm vulcan autocannon  compare to the 200mm autocannon and the dual 180mm autocannon24mw powergrid and 14tf cpu1400m optimal and 6000m falloff022 radsec tracking41 sec duration 23x damageammo damage 75  18focused heavy pulse laser  compare to the heavy pulse laser and the dual heavy pulse laser700mw powergrid and 36tf cpu14km optimal and 5000m falloff0052 radsec trackingactivation cost 18gj56 sec duration 25x damageammo damage 15  36ps the xlarge shield extender would probably take too much powergrid to fit comfortably on a drake as they have very low powergrid for a battlecruiser but if you fit 1 xlarge instead of 2 or 3 large you get more slots for resistance but sacrifice dps cant fit hams it wouldnt make the drake more powerful but rather would push it even further into its special niche passive shield tanking 2 pilots could or can right now even use a drake to draw fire while a high power battlecruiser harbinger does most of the killing in relative safety and it wont work on sleepers especially if the harbinger had 34 focused heavy pulse lasers  theyd pop it in secondseditpps having more sizes of shield extenders prop mods or what else wont require any new skills be trained all sizes of afterburners use just one afterburner skill all sizes of shield extenders use one shield upgrades skill all sizes of energy vampires use one energy emissions skill etc etc my new proposed weapons which i dont expect to be taken seriously anyway would perhaps require their own skills and ammo or maybe theyll just use the larger skill and ammo and have reduced damage modifiers to matchppps 2x battlecruiser rails on a raven 1x destroyer ham on a thrasher full rack of battlecruiser rails on an afk tank dominix destroyer hams on a drake with xlarge shield extender  epic noob fail destroyer rails on a thorax with room for tank aka i dont know how to fit a thorax
lvl 5s are more profitable than incursions i assume you want these ceo missions in highsec thats what your getting at rightwell then you cant have them because there are already unlimited isk printing machines called lvl 4s that have no risk associated with them
well no lets make it like this the missions require you to travel to nulloh never mind im not going to win here
how about corp level mission running
i know what your talking about its just we have group pve content with massive rewards lvl 5s exploration wormholes incursions

as i do recall the goons have probably been the ones to contribute the most to this game in making it become the eve you play nowah yes a good number of occasions and conflict between the goons and ccp do fit this statement
at the risk of assuming that youre not just trolling weve already been over the many logical fallacies this sort of claim is based on youve added a few more weve got the anecdotal fallacy the biased sample fallacy and the fallacy of hasty generalization all in all theyre fairly basic populationdynamics fallacies that are quite easy to learn identify and thereby avoid these are cognitive skills that your average 12 year old can learn at least once they pass the threshold between concrete and abstract thinking so it should be a simple matter for any adult to master logical thinking along this axis and make sloppy fallacious rationalizations literally unthinkable if they actually want to that is
were going to meet and formalize our summit topics plus upvote certain proposals we view as needing official validation the fix lagtime dilation one comes to mind mains and alts are both welcome to attend if you as a csm member want to get an item addressed in the meeting post the proposal wiki link in this thread between now and the beginning of the meeting
leave them just the way they are a boring grindincursions are fun to do and should be the key but their needs to be more of them at one time in high sec areas i suggest two active incursions in all 4 empires at the same time at all times that way more carebear tears the ones who just cry and wait it out or relocate and more peeps forced to rise up to clear them out to theyll learn how to ban together fit fleet ships and learn the structure right now their are pretty much 2 main competing fleets 1aromor and 1shield and some folks clamoring to get in them since they are so well organizedout of that maybe just maybe more will be wanting to venture outside of their high sec mission hubs and be willing to add a little spice in their eve lives
hrm i have valid points i cite my claims and im telling the truth and the other guy is verifiably lying and trolling such is life i will point out the minor irony of posting to tell people to stop posting though
supported really great workout and pos really needs a rework
supported since its first proposal in 2006 still waiting for ccp to pay attention supporting again for posterity
i cant stress enough how much support this thread has from mei especially love the updated design that shows how the towers defenses can be made vulnerablealso i want these things in a pos revamp ability to base at an individual in the roles system at a specific pos ability to dock at a pos ability to moore ships at a pos as in having a physical object or tractor beam attached to the ship locking it in place and preventing it from being bumped out of the shieldcodingdesign suggestions on how to get docking at poss to workas far as docking is concerned coding can take a look at how 3rd party mods did it in freelancer basically you would run a dock request on an object or ship if the server deemed it dockable it would load you into a station environment tied to that objectshipyou could do that in eve and the only real problem from my complete lack of insight into how the code really works would be that you would need to generate the station environment and link it to that tower as far as undocking is concerned you could just have the ship appear in x radius around the tower just like how ships appear around a cyno after jumping allowing the undock to be random like that does two things prevents the necessity to have hard coded undock ports and 2 doubles as a preventative of ships autoflying out of a pos bubble after undockinghell you get something like that working ccp and you might even be able to get it working in a way that allows you to make us a mothership that is dockable in the process but the pos is more important imho
fixed it for youpleasethis is so awesomeit will make poss interesting and fun againi might even find it fun to fuel such a work of art as posted in the original thread
because hybrids fking suck at least caldari got missiles wawnna trade
take a look at the word hybrid it means a melt between to systemslets go from therewhy not let ammo deside how the weapon works i a player loads rail ammo the gun will fire as a rail if the player loads blaster ammo it will work as a blaster2 guns in one a hybridboth rail and blasters suck so much that combined they just about make a decent weapon
just nerf supercaps dont boost dreads dreads are balanced the issue is with supers they need to be nerfed sure you can boost dreads to deal with them then boost carriers to keep them balanced followed by bs bc cruisers etc or you just nerf supers and are ready with itthat is imposssible only way that used to be possible was aoe doomsday right now the ideal 500 men fleet would probably be 475 supers  25 dictors and besides bringing more of the same the only counters is thousands of nonsupers not to mention how many subcaps you would neednow with your theoretical fleet of 500 dreads lets say again 475 dreads  25 dictors the result against an equally sized bs group would be horrible for the dreads because dreads are completely useless against subcaps they are nicely balanced so also dont start ing with moros drone damage bonus that was a stupid bonus in the first place and should never come back and yes only dread i fly is a moros
i found this in another thread and it illustrates the root causes of why gallente fail at anything but ganking
my biggest problem with the pos setup is the distinct lack of usable security features it all works great until you want multiple members of multiple access levels accessing the same pos which is pretty much all we use our poses for we are a wh corpthe majority of the security problems would be solved quite simply by making an items and a ships module for the pos what i mean by this is instead of forcing everyone to use the corp hangar it would go a long way to security issues if we had a personal hangar and personal items space just like one would in a station a separate pos module that provides these services to membersthats the only part that i feel is disabling about living in a pos  you cant keep your stuff safe and when i want to keep all my shinies with me in a pos i dont want it so that anyone in corp can walk off with itthe only problem i can see is when it comes to removing items from the pos when a member who has items stored is offline that could mean that its not possible to move anything if it was possible to remove stuff from the module without the owners permission it would probably leave us back at square 1 but maybe members will just have to trust their directors and ceoedit adding thisthe other possibility would be to have a permissions system per pos module like for chat rooms or mailing lists  only the listed people are allowed to access this module
thisor a variation of thisplease anything to make poses livable inmake any or all of the folowing tabs in ship array personal tabs in hangarship array noone can acces anyone elses personal tab maybe only ceo can purge a users personal tab to save space destroying anything inside creation of infinite number of tabs with as many permissions to setup a tab per corp member or infinite tabs with passwords a new personal items and ships module as sugested by kidzukurenai  anchoring gsc inside shields special larger pos containers for this purposein short any sollution so that members can have their own personal stuff without fear of theft and the other way around solution so that a corp can have new members they dont trust with valuable corp assetsplease make poses possible to live in for a corp with more than 5 members also opening gsc and other cans from a hangar without having to switch to a indy and move it into cargo to open the thing
 this also i would like to see them able to be docked at thus providing private ship and item hangars for corporation members that use it this should utilize a system of shared storage space where the pos is upgraded to store xm3 of items and ym3 of ships security officer role would allow an individual to pull out of a persons personal ships  items hangar at that pos for cases where someone goes inactive or is taking up to much spaceand omfg please implement this part asapwe need to be able to based at a player in the roles system to a pos this would alleviate a ton of the woes of the roles setup for pos access
why dont you discus the things they sit on and push for the tech nerfyou know the thing that you expressed interest in doing pre election
well i tested out the captains quarters this past weekend on duality and they redid the entire npe you start in the station and work your way out i thought it was better than the last one if there was one thing i would want to add its that the eft and other helpful tools be added to the client along with some kind of beefed up evelopedia
first of all just fix the ui that is the main problem second put all devs respondible for npe in the rookie help chat for a week and afterwards tell them to have fun with npe for a month with threath you can always put them back in rookie help result npe is alot better within 1 week  1 monthfor example dunno if it is still like that but for a long time when of the rookie missions was mining an asteroid in a field filled with unminable asteroids without the one you needed by default on your overview and the one you couldnt mine were on your overview with no help on how to fix that obvious fix would be to make the default overview less idioticanyway here you got your listlinkage
from what i tested on duality when cq was being tested ccp is going in the right direction i do however feel it should be a necessity that the tutorials has voice over not just for cool factor i found myself getting bored and irritated at having to read every popup windowsomething like having the popup window companioned with audio add a checkbox that says disable tutorial voiceover so those who dont want to hear it and just want to read can then add a button that says repeat voiceover or something catchy and self explanatory upon hitting the next button you are automatically presented with the voiceover tutorial unless you disabled it via the checkboxmy two cents as i think it would greatly enhance the npe
as i remember it the isk grind is way too intensive at the beginning especially if you have no friends in eve i know you can sell a plex but maybe new players on trial do not want to do that just yet give new accounts a balance of 20 million isk to get things going give them a mail suggesting a few ways to spend it maybe a t1 cruiser fit for pvp and can one for pve drawn from a pool of fits give them meaningful tip on medium term skill planning battleship just sound so cool but their usefulness is a lot limited in fast moving pvp not much battle over them maybe suggest training for one of the advanced cruisers or frigates unless pve is the desire the specifics of the advice i will let you figure out you get my idea righttell new players hybrids suck d

ccp has some decent reasons for not allowing name changes but the benefits to the player community outweigh the concernssimply listing the name change in the characters employment history would solve most if not all concerns though it would require players to take extra steps to research historical data in some cases eg they would have to search market data for all names a character has held etc ccp could probably develop more comprehensive solutions but its not worth the dev timeat the very least character renaming should be an optional addon to the character transfer service for a fee the original account owner should be able to wipe the character name during the transfer process the character of course could not be played until a new name was entered
hictors are the ship whose job it is to pin down supers they were introduced at least partially to tackle otherwise invulnerable moms in lowsec
that was their original purpose yes capital warfare has changed thoughtitan doomsdays are no longer laughably weak and tankable and the former motherships have grown teeth claws and a bad attitude to matchyou cant really buff up hictors to be able to compete with that or they become overpowered in their primary role subcap fleet warfareand you cant beat supercarriers too badly over the head with the nerf bat or they return to the useless ships they used to be thats why i tried to propose a third option dont try to discourage people from flying a ship they want to fly instead give out some buffs and add some more variety to try and encourage people to fly different ships while bringing a little more balance to the equation in the process
on the one hand that can be addressed through bandwidth limitation or the existing game mechanic of can fit x of module yon the other hand revenant bpcs arent exactly falling like rain son why wouldnt a rare ship be allowed to have some perks i support the call to render scs vulnerable to all ewar adjust the ewar resistance numbers to make sense focussed warp disruption script thus gets a value of eg 10000 warp disruption strength sc gets a base warp stability of 500 you could conceivably warp disrupt it with a fleet of 100 ships or just use 1 hicset the sensor strength really high like say the 150odd it is right now and let the sc pilot determine whether they wish to use eccm or not target dampeners using resolution scripts used in conjunction with jammers will make every successful jam important to the outcome of the fighti agree with ed that we need fewer special game mechanics in order for the game to be more fluid removing ewar immunity will encourage more diverse fittings for scs
big ships are traditionally vulnerable to small ships in eve its what makes the game great as it enables a low sp character to play an important function in pvp most battleships are vulnerable to tackling frigates and inties most titans and scs were vulnerable to tackling hictors since you cant buff hictors to actually tackle supercarriers perhaps supercarriers aught to be nerfed
i dont even save fittings and i support this product andor service forcing dependency on an external server is just poor form when it comes to nonexploitable things like this
chat windowswe need better tabbing on chat windows and as much as it pains me to link a picture to the windows os this is what i mean instead of just one row of chat channel tabs we can have multiples instead of it shrinking channel names and moving stuff to a drop down list if you want it all in one big chat window this would save those of us who are in many channels a lot of hassle especially when it comes to organizing where in your ui they are all goingedit also have the order of our chat windows stick i cant stand having a different order on my chat tabs almost every time i log inthe local channelallow us to detach the members list of local from the chat window itself a big chunk of veteran players dont even bother speaking in local and only care about its use as an intel tooladditionally i would like to see data from local displayed on our neocom by means of having the colored overview symbols on it with a number next to it that designates how many people of that standing are in the system with you my vision is displaying this similar to how people report stuff in nullsec security channels3 xyz12 solar systemcurrent location information top left cornerallow this to be moved or even hidden also disconnect the waypoint information and let us move that around as well id like to see the ability to have my route spanned across the length of the top bottom or even side of my screen instead of wrapping around every 2 inchesupdate the hudthe main ships interface for our weapons health display and the buttons attached to it needs to be changed right now while we do have a moderate bit of control over it the shape and size of it is overall unappealing id like to have the ability to choose a boxshaped hud that will be easier to implement into my overall ui organizationthe overviewthis is core to how the game is played honestly i dont know how to reengineer it to be better overall however having the option to have essentially two rows of data for a target would be niceheres what im picturing instead of having one row and stretching your overview across a quarter of your screen im on 24 1920x1200 in order to be able to view the tag icon distance name type corp ticker alliance ticker velocity  transversal id like the ability to have a second row so i can have more data per target on my overview without having to stretch the overview even further than it is nowyes something like that means more scrolling when in larger engagements  but ultimately i think it would make the feel incombat a lot better to medirectional scannerlet us set the distance in au ex enter 15 to get 15 au distance instead of kilometers i know the kilometer system exercises a fantastic amount of control but it makes getting smaller pinpoint dscans a royal pain in the tuckus also make it easier to select the smaller dscan angles rigt now you can spend 510 seconds adjusting to get it to the correct dscan angle when your in the low endsthird add a checkbox that puts a circle on screen that shows the area the dscan will cover this will add a great aid not only for those of us who have been playing for years but also for new players as welloverheatingright now the status of overheating can be misleading for example when you toggle overheat it doesnt actually toggle until the next module cycle we need a way to see before that module cycles if our request went through so we dont have to button mash to make sure our request to stopstart the module overheat when through this needs to be done on a permodule level as people like me will use hotkeys to overheat each specific module manually and turn each one onoff as needed
need some drone love from ccp
support
i wish something like that were possible but ccp would never go for it and sp remimbursement is not the goal of the uninject option
this explains alot
yes a sad sad day in eve if this crap keeps up i might unsub all my accounts
this proposal is focusing on one of multiple boosts that should be given to black opsit is my belief that focusing on boosting things like lock range powergrid capacitor scan resolution and such will not make the ship class as popular and useful as people want them to be what needs to be done is increase the ships ability to support a fleet of stealth shipscurrently the only thing a black ops can do for a stealth fleet is move them around some proposals have focused on allowing jumps into high sec and increasing range while these things would make the ship more attractive i believe something else is neededthis proposal is to either allow black ops to fit special gang links or give them fleet bonuses like titans these bonuses would only affect ships with jump harmonics 2the specific boosts that would be possible are beyond the scope of an assembly hall proposal if you support black ops being able to fit specialized gang links or have boosts like titans please support this topic it will be up to ccp what kinds of boosts and how effective they aresome might be inclined to say that this would make the ship too powerful if you believe this but think the idea has potential please support the topic and mention in your post any ideas to prenerf this ability ie make it so these boosts can only be granted from the squad positionthe rest of this post will be suggestions and ideas for different types of boosts that would be possible please feel free to add your own keep in mind that the exact strength of these boosts is not mentioned and that specific boosts are not part of this proposalminmatarboost velocity and sig radiusgallenteboost all ewar strength and rangecaldariboost torpedoes range sig radius explosion velocityamarrboost capacitor recharge time drasticallyunspecifiedgeneralremovereduce cloak penaltiesreactivation delaysensor recalibration timescan resolution penaltyvelocity penaltyenhance module overload reduce damage increase effectivenessedit added line these bonuses would only affect ships with jump harmonics 2 thanks kazuo ishiguro that stipulation was in the original draft but got cut out by mistake
this idea is interesting and worth a further look some modifications may be necessary such as gaining sec in lowsec anomalies andwhat about those few gate and station rats would definitely make lowsec a more active place in good or bad ways as other posters stated
for great justice this returns to the top lets make fof missiles a great weapon system we would be proud to use and not the pathetic subhybrid joke they are now
in all honesty fof missiles need to changed to one of two typesguided they attack only enemies regardless of target lock but are significantly weaker due to this advantage change only attacks enemies stats stay samefof powered they attack any and all ships arealmost are comparable to the standard version of their size in damage change not the best option for gangfleet due to fof nature good for solo pvp can be used in missions but still not preferred i personally like the second which keeps the original nature intact friend or foe i would suggest that if the missiles are brought to full power of typical missiles which would certainly help them be useful that they have penalties like t2 ammo did to render them not as useful for mission running this could be as simple as more pgcpu needed or some other factor the point is fof was designed as a counter to ewar for missile ships ewar is primarily a pvp type of combat though there are missions that ewar can be a real pain in the butt missions such as these could benefit from fof missiles as an alternative but by and large the missiles need to be intended for solo pvp or pvp in general effectively you give missile users three types of missiles assaults short and powerful typicals long and slow and fof ewar counter
i quite like your ideas and would say that your first idea is perhaps closest to my original proposal 
we need to stop wiping the bottoms of carebears you guys suck the life out of eve except maybe wh corps and even then only 2 are non lame pos hugging fliptardsmake anomolies on overview make all frig rats scram and make 00 worth taking a risk to pve in iskwisehs and ls can fiddle accordingly
white tree is the dumbest member of the csm yet
theres absolutely no need for such baseless accusationmy main sentiment stands that youve blown up a huge bluster over something that only you seem to think is an issue worth addressing its a lot easier to leave things as they are than to implement a series of rules and checks to eliminate what seems to be a nonissue
i dont have any 5 alts pretty sure ive never even been negative sec at all on any characters youre just an idiot discarding low sec status alts is bannable since when you want to make it bannable how exactly is ccp supposed to know an alt has been discarded for this purpose how does ccp even know youve discarded said alt at all you realize accounts and characters are completely disposable riteyou propose ccp diverts resources to hunting down disposable 1day middleman alts and banning their true owners to enforce your idiotic ideas about how reds should be prevented from interacting with highsec or anyone else who isnt also red they dont even manage that for botting which is an actual breach of game rules as opposed to your pathetic emorage induced ideas lolololololololololserious question though have you ever thought anything through ever have you ever taken reality into account when considering the implementation of your ideas are complete thoughts ever formed there should be a case study
thats not what ppl who complain about low sec being a deserted wasteland say and when theyre mostly only populated by 10s theres your problem and heres the solution1 thats what everyone says about their alts2
this amazing idea has managed to gain the support of 1 person youunless you seriously thought the yes remove pirates please was serious never know but fairly sure it wasnt i think there may have been a proposal to bring back megathron skins glitching to pink which gathered more support everyone aside from you and the op who have posted in this thread im uncertain if youre the same person cant be bothered has immediately seen and announced their complete lack of support obviously everyone else must be wrong pink megathron glitches really are a vital part of eve or you need to put on your tinfoil hat to accuse me of using a legion of alts including csm members to declare my wrongful lack of support in order to protect the negative sec alts i dont have because you really are just that deludedin conclusion this all just boils down to 1 moron strawman crying about the same things they just make up over and over again just so they can get revenge on the naughty reds that made them cry epic entertainment indeed and after this post theyll do exactly that once again so plz continue and show everyone how riskaverse and scared u r when u want to stay safer carebearing by punishing the naughty reds
isnt being able to pay off concord to look the other way in high security space a contrived game mechanic also i think contrived is a very loaded word and not accurate hereas to the argument that hiring mercs encourages player driven emergent gameplay i think that is an excellent point im not sure whether that approach would be much more effective however  given that it costs 2 million isk to wardec a corporation im not sure what sort of mercs you could hire for that amount who would be able to make the attacking corp retract
maybe contrived is a loaded word but so is the bantering of the word griefing most of the posters here have no clue what that is in relation to eve there is a mechanic already in game to stop wars that fall under eves definition of griefing and by simply submitting a petition to a third party ccp that can not be bribed with game isk the result of such petition can render a judgement up to and including banning from the gamethe cost is usually very reasonable for the results you get not to mention it reinforces the actual game play that was intended in the first place players actually playing the game with the tools available to them to achieve the desired result
i like this idea
i would like to see part of the war dec fee 50 be put into a pool that the corpalliance getting deced can earn by destroying the enemy ships paid out perhaps by insurance value ie if the deced alliancecorp kills an enemy ship the insurance valuenot actual insurance just the value if it had insurance would be taken from the pool and given to the deced alliancecorp at the end of the war just something to promote pvp or give incentive for people who whould have left corp to stay and fight
agree owning a wreck because you blew up a ship never made any kind of sense restricts gameplay and is incredibly confusing for new players this change would simplify things enable new gameplay and make the game more intuitive
i like the ideaif your worried about noobs  give them ownership of their own wrecks for a character that is up to 3 months or somethingproblem solvednewbies cannot be ninjad easy  everyone else knows whats going on and is fair game
no and make looting trigger gcc
not a sucking chest wound you saywhen sov null moves back to highsec for the gank to raise isk you know tengus are in style
i think the original idea is great not so sure about the device bitunless theres a way to detect them but even then this would balance out ganking a bit and make it a more positive experience potentially for the ganked
i like 
damn good idea
this idea makes sense to me anything that balances gameplay without whipping out the nerf bat should be supportedneeds a name though we cant just call them capital interdictors well we could but that would be boring
while i like the idea of capital interdictors id have to ask whod buy one regardless of the number of supers in the game super hot drops are still relatively rare hictors have already lost out in favour of the lighter faster and more easily skilled and replaceable dictors id suggest that instead of a capital interdictor a capital warp disruption field generator fitted to the otherwise incredibly boring sov grinding dread this way the dread pilots can have a bone thrown their way at the same time provided they have the skills for said module
a special module for dreadnoughts is certainly an option although if that were to happen i think that module would need to give extra defensive bonuses or the dreads would need a hp buff even sieged dreads get chewed through fairly quickly by supers also i still think it should be a focused thing that would limit its use to only against other caps and supercaps instead of basically just making it a superheavy interdictor that can bubble up subcaps as welli figure the main advantage of a capital dictor would be its mobility you wouldnt need to move hictors and dictors into position and risk them getting caught and killed by the enemy support fleet or even just random roamers as long as you had a cyno in system it makes it much easier to punish hotdrops or small to medium capital attacks it would also be a good tool to force an engagement since once you start pointing down the caps and supercaps the other side either has to cut their losses and give up or escalate things
were already more or less playing supercaps online at this point and you want to make obsolete the only two classes of subcaps that have a role against them
no sorry but i do not see the reason for more cap ships in a cap prolific 00get more hics you only need 1 to tie it down but the more you have the harder it is to untie the trapany propper fc will know that 1 alone isnt enough theyd bring 4 to 6 or some such
this doesnt make hictors and dictors obsolete by any stretch of the imagination they would still be extremely useful to any subcapital fleet be it a roaming gang gatecamp or a support fleet for capital ships the capital warp jammer would be a focused weapon this isnt a bubble ship it would be useless in tackling subcapshics and dics would still have a role against capitals as well assuming you dont have a cyno in the system right away you will need hictors and dictors to spring the trap and hold the supers andor capital ships in place then you bring in the capital dictors to tighten the noose and a killteam of capssupercapssubcaps to make the kill the problem right now is that only two ships have any kind of ability to tackle supercaps and it is entirely possible for supers to kill these ships and weasel their way out of a sprung trap all it does is add an extra line of security and more of an incentive for supercarrier and titan pilots to be a little less reckless with their toys
this topic might be a bit controversial but in a game that really doesnt afford safety to anyone not even highsec cloaked ships are untouchable this is my proposal regular combat probes cant detect cloked ships should be a new probe t2 combat probes anyone if t2 probes are too much of a problem since we might need t2 probe launcher as well sisters launcher and sisters combat probe will do should atleast require astrometric rangefinding to v im pretty sure those of you whole like to just afk cloaked in a system camping might be opposed to this this is a simple way to counter those afkers in a system primarly in 00 where everyone is always on the lookout for neuts who might be scouting or just plain afking to keep everyone on edge we currently have some neuts around our space that are just cloaked and floating in space been around for a few days tbhif anyone has a better idea let me hear it
i think the system canner of a pos should be allowed to scan cloakable ships that way the cloak is still effective and the scanner poilot would have to be the one to leave the pos to go to the scanned out pilot that way there is a give as well as a take from cloakingeven balance
maybe use it to buff black ops at the same time have new probes and a new probe launcher for it that can only be fit to a black ops shipthat way you have to put a expensive ship at some risk to do it will increase black ops bs usealso have the probes on overviews by default so if they are being scanned down the user will see them on dscan long before the scanner can see him
its not controversialits braindead
yes this is stupid learn to read the forums before you make a new topic i dont think you can go 2 pages without seeing this topic a few times
i have done the cloaky thing marks tend to fit into 2 categories 1 pvpers who rat in pvp ships just waiting for the opportunity to engage the cloak 2 whiners who stay docked except with their station hugging bait domigroup 1 takes care of the situation themselvesgroup 2 is too soft for 00 and should stay close to concord easy targets will always be farmedasking for an easy fix cloak probe is a round about way of asking for a nerf of several ship types that demand significantly more skill than astro vas to their being untouchable a cloaked ship is harmless until it decloaks then it is very touchable
i agree that you should be able to probe down cloakys however it should be very hard it should take a lot of effort to probe down a stationary cloaked ship it should take a lot less time to probe down a ship with a cov ops cloak due to how they can go into warp so fast while still cloaked would be impossible to find them if it took a long time to probe them down also should be a seperate skill set expensive a long train and many prereqs should also need a specialized ship with specialized probesedit would also be worth some thought to make it possible to cloaky jam a system similar to cyno jam this will get rid of too many people staying cloaked in system for hours upon hours it can get quite irritating
if it aint broke dont bloody beat the damn thing to death with a stick to break it intentionallyseriously get over yourselfs you cloaky whinersits just a bloody cloak  o pit wont hurt you or make you dieits the one who refuses to put his guard up that gets ganked
so youre saying it should be very hard to find a cloaked ship unless its a ship designed to be cloaked all the time then it should be easy because they can warp cloaked how does this make any sense
it is not broken  no need to fix
u know who else is untouchable everyone of u nullbears who docks just to protect themselves from 1 harmless afk pilot if u cant handle 1 harmless afk pilot in 00 do yourself a favor and get out cause ure not entitled to 100 concordlevel blob safety especially in null sec so htfu and deal with it
the solutions to afk cloakers are simple1 go somewhere else2 stop ratting in officer fit carriers downgrade to cheap bs or even bc and fly with a group3 ignore them theyre afksimples
simpler would be for cloaks to use fuel  preferably a substance which is contraband in empire
your theory is sound on paper realistically speaking players dont just log in to be on standby waiting for someone to ninjaloot their corpmates level 4 hisec mission
tractor pulling the strongest engine shall win
so riskreward is related to workreward if you work to protect your things then your reward will be higher
no your reward wont be higher because you have someone on standby your reward will be much lowerfixed that for you shooting someone in a pve ship is beyond ed on a level that matches ccps until ccp really changes how pve works in eve it is just a horrible idea only in wormholes you can kinda do it if you feel really lucky and then your get friends idea strangely the ninja salvager doesnt need them but you do need them if you want to run a mission which pretty much halves your incomehow about do this after ccp makes pve a bit better lets start by sleeper ai for all npcs you might possibly see that they will alpha strike all ninja salvagers as a downside i dont
your not forced to engage stop acting like you are either you can bring along buddies in pvp ships and get your salvage you can try to engage a ninja salvager solo and most likely die or you can just not engage them and suffer the loss of your wrecks you have choices people need to realize that just because they cant max their income doesent mean that its a broken system effort should scale with reward dont you agree its not ccps fault pve should require certain ship types and pvp should require others if you want to have maximum reward your going to need to put in maximum effort the fact is the choice still exists and while it may not be the most profitable to just leave your wrecks its the safest people are going to have to weigh safety vs risk on their own it shouldnt be decided for them
would you like the loot moved automatically to your cargo wouldnt that be easier htfu
screw mission wrecks they are literally a dime a dozen fight between x and y on a gate  z warps to gate with alpha hardened tractor wielding salvage boat z starts tractoring all wrecks checks for valuables while salvaging  jumps out if threatenedno longer a few hundred thousand isk but potentially hundreds of millions in faction gearin short if you want to steal you can damn well arrange for your own getaway vehicleplan if you want freebies kill stuff yourself
what this is the exact thing i am trying to promote right now if theres a fight on a gate with 40 wrecks its gonna take a hell of a long time to get within 5km of each and salvageloot i honestly dont see your point salvaging is supposed to be a mini profession and this would make it a viable mini profession what is wrong with cleaning up the field after a big fight whats wrong with getting hundreds of millions in faction gear your tractoringgetting agro putting yourself and ship at risk for a pretty giant reward worst case your noctis is sitting on the ector gate you still have agro and can be shot even if you jump remember you agro entire corps by tractoring not just the individual i cant tell are you just trolling or full on ed
wtb the easy button loser
as the title suggests this would in my opinion add an extra incentive to use the auction contracts function got a triple t2 trimarked bhaalgorn which you know is worth quite a lot but unsure as to whether enough people will bid on it to meet the minimum costset a reserveim sure this has been suggested before but lets go for it in the spirit of the recent contracts changes all say aye
supporting this for great justice
whats the point of this just use the start price surely
the point is is that it adds an extra dimension and perhaps excitment to the otherwise stolid contracts system i mean sure you can just start the auction off from the reserve price  but wheres the fun in that
its actually an appeal to human nature a low start price gets people bidding once people start bidding more people will normally bid on the other hand a starting price at or close to what the object is actually worth will discourage most potential bidders who view auctions as a way to get goods for less than retail the reserve protects the seller while letting them take advantage of this little psychological idiosyncrasy of the human conditionsupported
thank you for succintly outlining my thoughts and for your support 
not supported it just amounts to wasting buyers time and attention tying up their isk because youre greedy want a fast sell set a low price the contract system doesnt need additional exploitable complications for the sole purpose of stroking fat wallets of the greedy at the expense of everyone else
how does this have anything to do with greed all that is being proposed here is to mirror the methods used by reallife auction websites and the attendent excitement and anticipation that having a closely run auction provides nothing has been mentioned about a fast sell furthermore how is this even exploitable fine as an earlier poster said you can set the reserve price now as the minimum bid how is that exploitable or even at the expense of anyone elseplease be more specific in your thoughts rather quite general
use minimal bid this is basically an attempt into deceiving bidders into locking their time and money into a bid thinking the price is lower than what you are actually willing to sell for eve does not need a feature designed purely to benefit one party by screwing another out of their time and money the contract system should be less deceptive not more
how is a reserve system screwing people out of their money if their bids dont meet the reserve their money is refunded after the auctionjust as it does now
see belowyou want deception with regard to the price at which you are willing to sell for more profits for you at the expense of everyone else to be built into the auction system use starter bid price
its hardly deception if it says in big red letters reserve not metit should surely be as plain as day
how about i make a bid at below your starter price you dont get to lock in other people isk and waste their time if youre not actually willing to sell at the price you advertise greed at its worst
wowa lot of greed condemnation in this thread suprising for eve but then again a lot of faceless alts have posted here surely an auction doesnt have an advertised fixed price that it will sell at it therefore floats depending on how many people bid with my proposal there is not a lot of real change except that the bidding will start at whatever price the seller sets and not finish until the bidding at least matches as opposed to just starting from a minimal sell price as is the case now
eve auctions take your money up front on bid with the understanding that you will get the item unless a higher bid appears this is money that you cannot use you dont get to set a fake starter price when all you want to do is lock in other peoples money in order to make your auction look more lively
for reasons already mentioned ccp wont implement this one of their goals in creating the new contract system is to cut out unnecessary exploitable parts removal of loan contracts is one such move there is already start bid price if it doesnt sell it means it cost too much and price should be lowered until it does sell blame the market
ill make this as short and sweet as i can right now mailing lists have the ability to send out a welcome mail when someone joins the list this welcome mail can be used to disseminate information that only needs to be given oncewhat i am proposing is to use this same functionality on corporate and alliance levels so leadership doesnt have to worry as much about the distribution of basic information bulletins are great and all but keeping a bunch of information that you just want someone to see when they first join is a waste of space and the bulletins can usually be used for better thingsadditionally a custom welcome mail is a lot more impressive and informative especially when it comes addressed to you and sent by your ceo or alliance executorthese welcome mails should be sent out as followscorporate level when an individual joins a corp they receive the custom welcome mailalliance level when an individual joins a corporation that is in an alliance they receive the alliance welcome mailthoughts feedback
approvedsmall but usefull change
the functionality is there if you join a mailing list so you can use the feature currently although youd need to tell your new corp  alliance members to manually join but having one autosent for new members would be a nice valueadd and potentially easy to implement since similar features already exist ingame
so that it shows up on the first post it looks way better to have the ops support on the initial post not hte second or thirdget it sorted ccp
ironically enough supporting this proposal from the second post
its generally assumed that the op supports his own proposal so there really isnt a need for it i dont oppose adding it though but this is a total nonissue and it certainly isnt worthy of csm attention
its hardly a total nonissue the issue does exist and its an annoying bug why not change it
so ops everywhere are what sitting down in front of their pcs and typing up proposals that they dont supportactually truth be told that would explain a lot about our forums ponder
lol perhaps they areperhaps they arethis proposal is really more about tying up lose ends rather than implementing a gameshattering change i know and you know that there are for more important things to fix before this gets an eyeful however as an ocdriddled leper i will not rest until the op can support his own proposal in the first post
i dont know about you guys but when i type up a new topic i do see a check box allowing me to support the proposal that im posting pretty sure the op is confused
simple really why the heck cant we contract the pi goods in customs offices to other players or to corpi could list all the multitude of benefits or i could just point out that this is an mmo and we are supposed to work together to work smarter your guys forgot to add this in and instead you have to haul to station or swap in a can in space  not feasible for alts on the same account since we cant log in at the same time
ps can you increase the size of the customs offices to 50k m3 the 25km3 only allows me to halffill or halfempty the 5x 10k m3 launchpads on my planets seems like an arbitrary limit since you can only put pi goods into the customs offices in the first place cheers
i dont think they forgot i can see where there is definitely extra work involved to incorporate customs offices into the contract systemwhen you create a contract the item is removed from your station hangar no problemwhen the contract is accepted the item is placed in that persons hangar this could easily result in the co hangar being overfilled leading to people using the contract system as a way of avoiding the co size limitationsie exploitbecause station hangars have no size restrictions the contract system will have to be modified to accommodate this special situationthat being said i would like to see this feature added
in my opinion increase the capacity of the customs offices by alot enable contracting to and from them and allow importingexporting while not in systemthis is too lazy you say its precisely how alot of other manufacturing and industry in eve works and no matter how well stocked your planet is the same amount of hauling still needs be done it simply wont be in such strict capacitylimitinduced intervals this would give pi some of the freedom enjoyed by other industries in eve which are actually capable of stockpiling materials if you have the isk to do so while still requiring your planets to be managed on a regular basis
1 for intelligent discourse and humanity but 1 for scale and consideration see my recent thread for a more reasonable but no less daunting endeavor
hello everyoneas the proud owner of an orca i cant help but scratch my head at why we cant simply re or unpackage ships into and out of our ship maintainence bays not only would it make logistics for mining ops much less of a pita itd also help out the pvp folks who might not want to have to fly or pod back to their base to round it off itd also make t3s quite a bit more viable especially for wh ops since you could restructure them inspacenow i guess there is a good balance reason we cant do any of the above yet so i think to balance it out properly there should be a capital module that allows you to all of the above  at a hefty fittings cost of course
supported just to get fights with nc fleets i have to be in a noob corp solo and in a t1 battlecruiser at the most making your age unknown makes it easier to come by fights because people may assume your a nub
only showing the persons previous corps and not the associated dates or date of birth would probably result in more fights what with people not backing out when they get into a fight with someone older than them
spies everywhere
also while this opens new avenues for griefing mission runners it effectively nerfs the profession of nonninja salvaging as fewer new players will be willing to respond to the free salvage posts expecting to get blown to hell or at least have their time wastedthis just makes game mechanics even more complicated to the detriment of new players and offers no real upside if ninjas want to turn flashly they can always just steal loot
no it wouldnt there is already a mechanic in game to surrender ownership of wrecks all the nonaggro seeking salvagers would have to do is stick to salvaging blue wrecksactually no it would simply make the aggression mechanic more consistent with the rest of the game you take something that you didnt earn the person who actually did the work creating the opportunity gets the option to assert their ownership
yes but effectively its just another twist and turn of the rules that enables hey free salvage in local to translate to dead new players lol you should have seen they werent blue wrecks noob when the dude just read on the ivy league site that salvaging was a good way to make space moneyi really see no upside to this proposed mechanic aside from more opportunity to grief new players thats pretty much the only demographic in the game im against griefing unsurprising the highsec pvp crowd is rallying for this one more sweet velator kills seriously whats the actual upside to this
you pussies wouldnt shoot anyways so why ask for it
this seems to have fair support but no input from the csm as of yet come onthis is a great idea
even if that is somehow true wheres the conflict ccp wants to make a good game that people want to play and therefore pay for csm wants ccp to make a good game that they want to play
ooooh meta trolling nifty trolling me in order to lie and claim im trolling how very edgy of course itd be trivially easy show that i was wrong ya know if i was and you werent trolling
ccp has made it clear this will replace the original hangar view if you were like me who tested cq on duality you would understand that there is no difference in time to undocking or managing resources i tested it with two clients and there was no problem as the ui stays exactly the same as well as performance so please cry more
most of us are big dumb supercap having babies so yeah we have to live with two clients as is voices representing this viewpoint will be involved in this discussion
it really depends what ccp not the players wants the l1l4 missions to be for easy isk or epic story of survival and smart fitthat decision is not easy they could make ai harder than pvp very easily with a switch and low sec pirating would be just as profitable but then what about the economy for new players in empireeven level 5 missions are practically solo  maybe two accounts same person though can be done so if youre looking for adventure you have to join a corp that does lownull sec or wormhole stuff and deal with the drama
adding sleeper style ai to missions would be a massive balancing job i would prefer it but i cant see it happening anytime soonif a mission level was done piecemeal the probable outcome would be that they get added to peoples always decline list because they would hurt iskhour or require effortgallente would scream again because it would be a drone nerf not insurmountable but still a nerf
please read the original post i will be doing a huge overhaul  update soon i do apologize for the slowness but i have been working a lot as of late
i see its already posted but ill repost and provide a link to subject request to add another old yet still relevant subjectdrone implants why arent they in game yet
making these easier to find so someone can add there support saying they want a given item back in the spot light would be nicesince something like engine trails may seem to be a back issue and a player may feel it is important and thus want to highlight it bumping these topics should be possible

definitely agree with akita t on thisthere are already plenty of things for pilots to do in new eden without adding more and more unpolished stuff thoroughly clean the foundations first before making additions that can always come along laterps whatever happened to the serpentissyndicateblood raider pirate epic arcs that were supposed to come out yet another example of this problem
with respect havent we heard this already about 100 times and as anything changed decisions come from the top ceo and the board if they wont change the rest wont just seems to me eve is someones personal projectill do what i want when i want cos its my game sort of thing

current balance issues from my point of view hybrids they are just sad gallente ships pretty much likewise especially eos capital balance supercarriers are op dreads are crap archon is also too good compared to other carriers active tanking is rather marginal outside pve rig penalties completely unbalanced drone balance amarr lightmediumheavy drones are total crap their sentries are fine though black ops and eaf could use some boosting angel ships some nerfing frigatecruiserbattlecruiser tier system is outdated it just leaves most ship hulls unused augoror anyone claws locking range could use some boosting oneiros could use some love all other logistics have a niche oneiros doesnt really the new faction cruisers are rather unbalanced compare navy augoror with navy exequror damps could use some looking at was the original way of resolving them too calculationintensive currently the higher the bonus is the more effective additional bonuses are which means that on nonabsolutelymaxed hullsskillsrigs they are way underwhelming they used to be that the higher the original effectiveness the less the additional bonuses mattered
tracking disruptor its a joke now the optimal script is only usefull against amarr  make the bonus on optimal and falloffthe tracking script dont works on medium autocannon to much trackingtry to use the sentinel with 2 tracking disruptor againt a huricanne with 425 machariel is clearly overpower like dramielhybrid need loveto much tracking with the large autocannon and medium range ammo  better than medium pulse laser 
someone here is a bit of a pessimist guess who
rails and blasters need a buff dont think anyone is arguing too hard with you
amar assault frigs and destroyers need help as they can not perform many given roles ina fleetsmall gangsolo fightthey are tackle and need to be able to fit a tackle mod and a propulsion mod to catch things a single mid slot is simply fail in a pvp shipthe amar destroyer does not do enough dmg or magically tank better than its co horts to offset this glaring lack if it did 2x the damage of a thrasher then maybe it would have some sort of argument for not being able to tackle but as it isit simply does nto perform any functionthe same could be said of the retruibution the lack of a mid slot so hampers these ships as to render them useless even straight up giving them an extra slot would not overpower them some changes are needed
armor tanks speed penalties are much to highshield tankers are faster and more mobile to such a degree armor tanking is very much out of a flavor reduce the penalty on armour plates
nighthawk needs some extreme attention since this has been already discussed and approved by some previous csm i will just link it
this would be a huge mistake at those numbers a 5 man crew in a couple hours would back the station up for a couple days would be best to drop that down to around say 30minutes enough to be use full but not have a small alliance backing it up for weeksi could live with that i didnt really think the timeframe on the 10 hours through to be honest because i was more interested in illustrating that you dont get the refining done instantly
scammers will always scam spies will spy and thieves will be thieveswhich is why i am in favour of this proposal wouldnt change much apart from maybe not seeing so many ed names in local
add me to the list of people wanting resizeable fonts its pointless to be able offset your shipwindows when dual screening if the font size makes you have to put all windows center screen to be able to read them
didnt bother reading all the pages but ccp stated already that they have something in the works when its coming out though i dont know still my thumb of support
yeahUFFFD
this link from 0244 to 0255 should apply to small ships vs super capitals the only way to make that a reality without over buffing the small ships and screwing up their balance vs other nonsuper capitals is for it to be impossible for super capitals to be able to lock onto noncapital shipsi am not advocating that this change should be the only one but it is definitely a right stepalso rip porkins
yes you should or if that doesnt work they should be hard countered by another ship like dreads but then you would pretty much need to remove fighter bombers that or make them fire aoe weapons against subcaps which tbh could be quite interestingbut ships needs to be balanced on a per ship base not per isk otherwise there is never a reason not to bring a supercap since they are just the best per pilot
dreadnoughts are well balanced because they have a specific role they have to commit to a fight and cant just teleport out when things go bad and because theyre very vulnerable to subcapitals and hence require a support fleet supercarriers have none of these attribute they dont have a specific role they dont need to commit to a fight and theyre not exactly vulnerable to subcapitals all three of these need changingproposing new ships as a supercapital counter is absurd  the counter should be subcapitals so to make them vulnerable to subcapitals supercarriers should be able to launch fbs only  not fighters or drones  with fbs tweaked so that theyre close to useless against bs and smaller and are easier to kill defining supercarriers role as anticapitals only supercarriers should not be immune to normal disruptorsscramblers and the otherewar immunity might go too the 15 min disappearwithaggrouponlogoff timer should be increased to an hour for supercapitalsmaking them commit to a fight is trickier requiring some sort of siege mode to be active to be able to control fbs is a possibility it wouldnt prevent movement only warping or jumping they could still receive rr short cycle time maybe as short as 23 mins so they could gtfo semiquickly but not immediately fbs would return automatically upon deactivation this might have problems with lag though
battleships are only really vulnerable to them if they are stupid and go out alone large smartbombs kill most frigs in one or two vollies and if they dont the battleships drones tear them apart frigates are usually just initial tackle and are only expected to hold onto the bs until bigger ships with more tank can get there to tighten the noose and make sure the bs has no chance of escapechange battleships to supercarriers and large smartbombs to neuts and you have the same situation hictors can hold a super down but they die in droves to do it only difference between the battleship and supercarrier examples is that with a supercarrier you have no larger type of tackling ship to come in and tighten the noose theres always the risk that the super will burn down all of the hictors and slip out of the trapthats only really talking about one super too this issue gets exponetially worse the more supers there are i mean to hold down a 4man supercarrier fleet youd need over 20 hictors to have any chance of catching them all and youre probably going to lose a lot of them in the processand then on top of those hictors you need to assemble ships to actually do the dps to kill 4 supers thats why hit and run attacks with supers are so hard to punish now unless you know beforehand or the super pilot does something stupid its hard to organize a proper defense in timewith a dedicated capital interdictor vessel you have less pilots forced to fly sacrificial hictors it would let more people get into combat ships to help get dps on the supers and actually kill them it would also lead to more supercarrier deaths since they cant just burn down a capital dictor in a few seconds and run away
you forget that the one thing sc do best is killing capital ships damn fastso you will need to have one hell of a tank on those capital dictorselse they will just become like dreads dinnertime 
pretty much yeah i figured they would either be t2 dreadnoughts imagine a phoenix with the onyxs color scheme d  or their own ship class but yeah theyd need a heavy tank to not die horribly like a dreadnoughtto kind of balance the huge tank theyd basically be useless against subcaps their warp jammer would be a focused weapon instead of a bubble maybe only let them equip two capital guns they wouldnt be siege capable though so the damage would be terrible or no guns at all they arent there for their damage their one job to be a huge weight to tie around a capital or supercaps neck
i strongly suggest you guys read the entire thread yes it is long but it is well worth it
agreed sc need a nerf or every ship in eveneed a buff make it happend

in fact i am way to lazy to write up all my ideas for improving the ui so i will just say thisit needs some spicing up and it needs it really really badyes i am advocating here for a new look this is not win95 in space it is the freaking future so make it cool and futuristic looking and give us the ability to customize customize customizesince ccp wont let us modify the ui ourselves like that other mmo maybe it just would be possible for them to allow us to skin itthe ui is really crappy so i am pretty much in favour with everything which will improve it but my biggest gripe with it actually is that i just cant stand looking at it

i was going to refrain from posting in this thread despite how much it amuses me but this quote is something i needed to comment oneve online is primarily sold online even in the united states ive searched for a boxed copy of eve every time ive been at a store that sells pc games ive done this every time ive been in these stores since i started playing eve back in march 2007 ive only come across an eve box twice once at a gamestop where the employees didnt even know wtf it was and once at frys the other day where only a single copy of the game was on the shelfan ao rating would only stop instore im pretty sure the majority of players in eve came to be through purchasing the game directly online through the eve online website as is proof by the multitude of  sites you cant dictate that an ao video game cant get sold on a website its companies like walmart that ban a product because of ratings not the government the government only requires ratings so people know what they are getting into when distributing the material to their children with that said i had no idea what futanari was until i read this thread and then enjoyed the 7 pages of laughter from the very obvious trolls on that note i wont actually provide my real opinion because i know ccp wont ever touch something taboo its the exact same reason they stopped allowing us to show cleavage in our character portraits and only reenabled that feature after they got bashed by the player base in these threads im for sexuality but i dont think ccp will implement it on this scale i do however require minmatar zerog sex chambers be implemented
heck yeah and make it so that my character can be a ladyboy tooe me being a guy having a female character kinda does that already but we def need the ability to have all kinds of twisted futuristic pervertsthere are probably amarr slaverhoundfurrys out therewhile youre at it add some fetish masks to character creation
well i think this would be awesome i can imagine seeing blackops squads being added to standard fleets that wold be fun and interesting
just needs two adjustments to be great1 give them a large ammo bay and allow refitting at them ie low m3 maintenance array2 extended bridgejump range
why not make them the only ships able to activate a jump bridge they can use them to bridge in fleets with them still allow use of the covert cyno for them too though would boost their usefulness and nerf jump bridges at the same time do something like they are immobile for 10 minutes if they activate a bridge or something your proposal is trying to make them into another command ship which is not their intention they are used to covertly move fleets a good reason why they should be able to use bridges but no other ship
so you support this proposal if so please edit your post and tick the support this topic box keep in mind that this proposal is just one of the multiple changes i want to be made i want feedback on this specific component of the changes

lol nothing but a we need more targets whine threadespecially as your kb needs some serious lovingas all you seem to be killing is pods and noob shipspathetic if you aint good enough to fight in low sec get out dont change something just cos you want easier targetslets get more carebears ratting up their sec status in low sec so we have more easier targets in the beltsseriouslyno
this is one of those ideas that i havent even read before and agree with nice one mashie
you should require at least some piloting skills to kill a falcon instead of pressing one buttonnot supported ofc
this has bloody nothing to do with falcons you muppet  if youd read the op you wouldve seen that the issue is about fof missiles targeting crap like lcos now back under your bridge
i am going to have to agree with you 100mhr per account is bad but barely anyone farms that much looking at my old corp wallet with a 15 tax only myself and 1 other person pulled in over 20mil per tick the vast majority were below 1210mil per tick i was in a machariel and the other was in a super it takes a lot to reach that 100mhr number skill wise and initial investment wise anyway i think that while having the relative safety of jammed 00 you still dont have concord watching your back which is always going to make it more risky than highsec not to mention awoxers and spais if you dont think ratting ships are lost check out evekill its litered with them sure they may be idiots but the fact still stands that they are not safe im not saying kill the anom nerf i am saying nerf everything so that riskreward means something again most notably lvl 4s make them extremely reliant on lp reduce bounties a great deal and maybe add more salvage also dont offer them in highsec anymore imo lvl 4s and 5s should only be offered in lowsec commence saying how bad of an idea that is and how millions of people are going to quit eve but lets face it they wont they will just switch to lvl 3s or join a lowsec pvppve corp the ones that do leave never had much stake in the game anyway because making mountains of imaginary mony and not investing it into fun and tear extraction is pointless this isnt forcing anyone to lowsec its simply encouraging them by returning riskreward to eve you can still run lvl 3s in highsec and be safe just you wont make as much
brilliant absolutely compelling and well thought out
my trolldetector just blew up
thats because unlike some ppl i dont log onto alts to support a thread like the pink megathron one ure welcome to disagreeits why u do so that matters which is nothing more than this is stupid cause i said so so im gonna troll troll and troll some more x 90011 point out exactly where im strawmanning unless ure too stupid to even know what it even means and r just talking out of your ass once again2 keep in mind that i suicide gank their hulks while theyre hiding from a fight on their 10 main so how does the 2 in bold even go together oh wait they dont nice failbut plz continue id really love to hear some more
i would just like to thank everyone involved for substantially improving the end of my working day with this glorious thread
ywand the tinfoil hat route i knew it
well i was going to point out this method of bypassing this proposal but its already been done the issue with arbitrary game mechanics is that they are far too easily exploitable and the mmo rule of exploits is that if it can be exploited it will be exploitedat best it will be bypassed using some means such as the disposable alts above at worst it will be used to grief empire playersplayers as human beings find a way around things as an example a friend of mine lost a deadspace fit pve rattlesnake to pirates thing is that those pirates had a 50 security status and were able to gank him after an attempted ransom in highsec without concord interventionthey did it by joining his empire based mission running corp and corp members can freely attack and destroy each others ships according to current rules this is a good thing for pvp training of new members in affordable ships admittedly there were some slack recruitment practices thorough background checks recommended even if you have nothing to steal but it illustrates that people will find a way around the rules if there is one the more rules you add the more youre restricting and even exposing the legitimate high securitynew and learning playersand because i can pick and chose which of these proposals i respond to i have the luxury of being able to address why i think something is a bad idea i do however reflect the yeah no sentiment
still no one has given a decent definition of what a griefer war is
take jita and surrounding systems for example there is no lowsec 5 jumps from it but there are many free manufacturing slots in the area if i want to buy for example t1 modules in bulk to use them in t2 production i will set up a buy order that covers 5 jumps with a minimum quantity of 50 to 100 t1 modules depending on the module i dont even want to undock a freighter for 1 or 2 modules per station since i dont really care which modules will i get because i have t2 bpcs for all ordered modules but different modules require different t1 versions ill set up buy orders for all of them using margin trading skill to cover all possible orders as soon as the isk gets depleted and orders start to bounce i will have all t1 modules that i needthe problem is not direct profitability you can just buy random numbers of t1 modules and work from there but time by using margin trading skill i always get the maximum amount of items for the minimum amount of time which enables me to be competitive on the market and make profit fasterjust because there are people who were too lazy to get familiar with descriptions of only 13 trade skills but are willing to throw billions on the market anyway doesnt mean that all of us playing this game dont know what we are doing of course there are some people who profit from mt scams but they are only profiting on those who forget the 1 rule of eve if its too good to be true its probably a scambtw its like saying that corporation recruitment should be banned because there are some corporations that will just take all your stuff and gank you
my thought on the matter is if you are being a legitimate trader other than mass amounts of minerals  what reason would you have to place a minimum quantity on a buy order for something like gunsi could see making an exception for minerals and ores but allowing someone to post a buy order with minimum quantities on stuff like guns and other multimillion or even hundred million isk mods and ships is just asking for the exploit of thishell admittedly if i didnt have the guns in my cargohold from a stockpile i would have fallen for that scam why because theres not a way to make sure it can be fulfilled other than having the required quantity and trying
can you please read just one post above yours thanks
dude 5 bucks and a week training for each character till margin trading level 4 is but a small price to pay for unlimited iskin fact people would even get around that 5 bucks buy using a fraction of the illgotten isk to purchase a plexseriously people think this through under no circumstances whatsoever should margin trading be able to get a character into the negative
this want
have you noticed that when the chronicles slacked off so did any plot or story in the news feed anyone thats been playing since the release of incursion has missed out on one of the best parts of eve online the back story of course it is interesting to hear about player interaction i like the rest of you always enjoy reading about massive scams massive scams that back fire x number of super carriers and titans killed in y system with z number of players involved but there is no feeling to those subjects i laugh when i hear about some poor fool getting ganked in his officer fit kronos but something about reading houses of the holy that really turns my stomach and makes one think about what other darkness could possibly lurk on those planets that we fly past everyday so many wonderful stories left to go untold anyone who doubts me has not read the end of the world series or methods of torture  the gallentehelp me a old book worm out csmsamuelk
whats the use of a self destruct nuke if you get alpha from 10 artillery battleships seriously tho while this idea has some theoretical potential when it comes to ganker tears its pretty much pointless and probably a waste of dev time
i am a firm believer in this tactic id even go a sterp further and have some very obvious way in iconography or visual that shows your hauling something that could backfire on a gank all i hear from gankers is carebears need to learn risk vs reward even though they are the worst transgressors picking on harmless carebears and blowing up some of the most defenseless ships in eve for some of the highest rewards if that isnt a riskreward loophole or exploit i dont know what isi myself am trying to engage the community to maybe work halfway between carebears and gankers in my own recent thread
green brackets for assisting yes
supportedalso this just kidding of course
swapping between alts is painfull and the log out option is no diffrent from the exit function other than it restarts evethe log out button should drop you to your character page this would be a great and should be simple to do
seems this topic touches a nerve with some i wonder who anyway im a 00 pilot im not flying a faction hulk and satation huggin either there is absolutely nothing one measly bomb can do to any of my ships yeah if the ship decloaks then hes dead but i want to pod his a just as well when hes cloaked just for the fact that hes not scouting for a fleet or anything for that matter hes just been in the system for over 4 days just there 247 really if youre going to hover cloaked there waiting for an easy kill then you need to htfu you can camp a gate we im fine with that but just being a dumbass hovering in space cloaked should make you a target like anyone elsejust yesterday while i was grabbing some fuel for my pos this lame brain bomber pilot launches a bomb at my macks he knows he cant insta pop them because hes done the same thing before like any other sane person here i like my cloak ive done scouting and blew thru systems as well with it but i have not sat in a system aimlessly doing nothing but waiting for days to find the squishy target to get an insta pop our system is busy we dont stop for a cloaky neut we mine run plex etc but he doesnt go for those ships cause he cant insta pop so yeah i wouldnt mind having a way to scan down any dumba that decides to sit in a system for days on end dont assume everyone posting is some carebear or noob that wants concord saving their asses i personally dont want ccp saving anyone and specially those that stay cloaked in a system for days on endok thats out of the way let the flaming continue
now thats an idea maybe cloaky ships should just have a fuel bay for the cloak to work have a dedicated fuel bay for it for example if the fuel bay is full then the cloak should work for the sake of keeping this simple for 2hrs fine you wanna fly around undetected fine but if you sit in a system afk expect to decloak in 2 hrsjust a thought
sick dude try making a meaningful post
not supportedpants on head ed proposal is pants on head ed also quite obvious giant ninja salvager buff
you people are so dumb its not and obvious giant ninja salvager buff it literally is a giant ninja salvager buff that was never hidden maybe offering some reasons why it would be bad would help to sway people in your direction rafia calling my proposal pants on the head ed doesent do much for your argument
supported for the simple reason that it is pantsonheaded that you cant tractor any wreck or any can for that matterdoesnt make sense that a wreck is somehow magically glued into space because someone else shot down the npcdont care about ninja salvagers vs carebears though so dont you people try to drag me into that argument
ive already pointed out why it is a bad idea furb killer also recently pointed out why it is a bad ideai have already told you how this change would break the game in heavy favor for the ninja salvagers and your response was so youre not interested in balance youre interested in breaking the game to your favor
you clearly have not done much pew or youd know that wreck belongs to the person who lost it ex i kill you wreck belongs to you tractoring said wreck with your scheme would give salvager aggro to the side that is probably losing as they are shedding ships  going unnoticed to actual threat  free stuff  make your own damn wrecksthat is unless you want it to give gcc  now that i could enjoy on a daily basis
i see the pros and cons of the plan i would be in favor of this as long as they added agro for actually just salvaging the yellow wrecks
1  tractoring a wreck would make you red to the ownerthis would fix wh space ninja salvaging as well
i was speaking to someone else in that quote your post brought up a valid argument it can be used for the sole purpose of grief but that doesnt mean that we should make all ships noclip and dissalow bumping or make it so that people cant enter your mission on the basis that they might grief you its the same as looting wrecks there is still technically an owner but no magic space glue holding it in place
pretty self explanatory why the need to rescan down signatures youve already found this is for cosmic signatures only ship signatures can remain variable
why cant you bookmark what you find
i would like to see more use of dreadnoughts and carriers  capital ship pve it would be nice to have that sort of optiongame venue available for a even more diverse pve gameplayperhaps missions that would require 15 players in capital ships or other combat sites similari think it would add a new angle of gameplay for those who like pveperhaps there can be a new high security space region where a mass incursion is taking place that requires capital ship use to interdict the incursion
its called go to an 00 incursionseriously is this supposed to be a joke
pve players dont like excessive risks though since those hurt their iskhour they arent going to be willing to go into nullsec or lowsec to run missions in a capital ship theyll just keep running them in their marauders and factionfit bss carriers and dreadnoughts are pvp vessels some people run sanctums in carriers but thats hardly their primary fuction if you want to spend 2 billion isk on a mission boat just buy a marauder
shoulda waited a week to see the flames in fd before you threw all this oil soaked wood in the fires of the assembly hallwow thats my daily allowance of metaphor all gone see what you just did
youve never done a c6 wormhole site have you
lulz someone with no idea how sov null or incursions workits not just some people if you run sanctums in anything other than a 15001850 dps ratting carrier youre doing it wrong and are doing your alliance a disservice by hogging sanctums thus denying them to those that can blitz competently at any given moment there are far more carriers shooting rats than triaging pvp is not their primary function as for dreads theyre not used in either pvp or pve those days
enjoy your awoxing
i dont think it is necessary but here are some thoughts anyway both for and againsthaving a reserve may be considered comparable to margin trading in the scams it may enableisnt the bidding increment based on the start price having a low start price but high reserve would allow smaller increasesshould the isk only be taken from the bidder if it exceeds the reserve this seems a bit clunky and would push towards the reserve amount being visible on the contract
thank you for your reasoned and thoughtful insights even if you didnt support the proposal i can only wish that everyone who posted here was as thoughtful as you
there is nothing thoughtful about economic pvp eve does not need some convoluted scheme added to a contract system that works just fine as is for the benefit of seller at the expense of buyer literallyyou the seller want to get more isk by taking advantage of this scheme if your idea works someone will have to pay more isk your gain is their loss
sounds to me that all you want to do is to protect the buyer at the sellers expense
id be wildly in favor if their offices would be made available  their stuff can go into storage
in favour to a pointyou have to remember alot of corps are holding corps of alliances that are waiting to be resurrected  or have history that dont want to be endedif you close the corp you kill the alliancei think perhaps ccp send a automated message asking if the corp should be closed if no response the rinse repeat up to 3 times still no response then remove
this is a solution in search of a problem not supported
so we have assembly hall  to bring items to csm attentionand we have features and ideasseems to me its just the same thingwe have just random and not very important items being posted in assembly hallpersonally assembly hall should be about serious issues only not random can i change the font size or whateverwith all these non non serious requests you might as well just get rid of fai
isnt fai for developing ideas before they come in here
not sure m8 but it defo isnt working like thatseems fai is completely bi passed
fi is very useful for developing a fledgling idea to something worthy of actually implementing if you have a simple ideachange that you want to be seen by devs and altered youre propably also better off just posting it in fi devs have admitted of reading that section and given reasons why they avoid commenting on the ideas so just because they wont post there often doesnt mean no one is reading themassembly hall is more for gaging the level of support some idea has and trying to get priority for your ideas although its used to present ideas that people think are ready to be considered for implementation so the two do overlap and i dont see anything wrong with that but still have unique roles they fill that cant all be reduced to just one or the other
i have a nasty habit of salvaging after almost every mission so i tend to acquire a large amount of goods so what i propose is to implement a way to mass sell your items in station all i am looking for is a system like the one where you can select multiple items with a check in the box when you create a contract once you have selected all the items you sell and all that bulk disappears and you get one fat payout instead of a sore clicky finger and to get around that whole nobody at this station wants your crap thing just have the system skip those items like it does now if it is damaged or needs repackaging
yeah i know the feature is there already and i in fact love it and use it for its exact purpose i however dont think you should say to a new member by the way join this mailing list to get your welcome mail with all the information youll need to be successful in our group id like to be able to include the information in the initial welcome mail when joining the corpalliance so you dont have to rely on recruiters remembering to distribute the information manually to every single member which as many people in the large groups in eve know information can easily be forgotten to be mentioneda corporate and alliance level custom welcome mail would solve this issue allowing the basic information to be shared quickly easily and uniformly through all new recruits
while you are at this might as well add motd for corp and alliance channels
i like
agreedthere is absolutely no reason why we cant custom tailor a welcome message for incoming members just like it does when it informs an ceo when someone leavessrsly its neededyou have my thumb sir
improvement to userfriendlinessnever gonna happen
i have some idea and proposal for eve already sorry about my english its not my first language  taxe  make the possibility to put some corporate taxe on all transaction  standing import  export xml standing for corporation or alliance  sov and anomaly signature increase the number of signature with the player presence  drone region  make bounty on stop ore loot  some npc  region will become true 00  moon mining  rewamp  artillery  ew  ship fitting  blaster  supercarrier  titan  invention  covetortaxe now the income from corporation or alliance come from bounty moon donation or internal taxe but its very difficult for ceo to have a good politics about taxebut its really difficult to have a good repartition about taxe my idea about that its to have the possibility to put a taxe on market transactionsstanding import  export xml the new system of standing is a nightmare if you would like to make some nrds that would be great if now we have the possibility to import and export by xml the standing corporation or alliancesov and anomaly the main idea will be to make some difference between system where they are nobody and system with a lot of player the main idea will be activity in the systemactivity in the system low activitynumber of signature and anomaly will be decreaselost of sovereigntystructure will be less harder to destroy tcu ihubsbu time onlining shorter medium activitysame then nowhigh activitynumber of signature increase and anomalythe structure will be more harder to destroy tcu ihubsbu time onlining longerif you have a station agent began to come insidewhy make that first now a lot of system are completly empty and its to easy for big alliance to keep them its to easy with money more difficult with activity to keep 2 ou 3 areathe upgrade of signature will be on number of npc destroy  good idea for bots if you make that with activity its more difficult for bots to make money less activity  less signature or lost sovif they are nobody in the system that will be more easy to capture themdrone regionstop ore loot and make bountysome npc  region will become true 00other ring gw will becomme true 00moon miningput new signature with the possibility to mine moon rawmake the moon mining dynamic and good repartition of the raw in eveartillerythey need some adjustement the ammunition bonus on the artillery is good but not on autocannon now there are to much tracking with autocannon  some large auto cannon have the same tracking then medium pulse laser remove the bonus on autocannon but keep then on arty ewrole play will be caldari against gallente and amarr against minmatarrthe ew amarr is completly stupid now tracking disruptor doesnt work on minmatar with new ammunition change the script reduce optimale to reduce falloff  reduce the optimal is good when you fight amarr now the best amarr ew is against amarr   neutralizer and tracking disruptorship fittingnow more and more ship of all race put arty or autocannon that have no sensblasterincrease the optimal 2 and falloff  2now its impossible to use them in pvp or really difficult
supercarrierremove the possibility to put capital remote when you launch your fighter bomber you are automatically in siege mode for 5 minutes decrease by 30 the hp of this shipdecrease the capa regeneration by 30 for titan and supercarrieragro timer 15m to 30 minutes before deloginventionbase when you have success 4 to 0  if ccp dont would like remove the bpo t2 in the game perhaps decrease the impact of this bpocovetorprerequis one skill from 5 to 4 now the difference between the covetor and the hulk is three days 
and im pretty sure that you dont know what youre talking about try making a new topic in assembly hall ok now select the check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on checkbox before you post the op got that now press post topic do you see your support to your own topicno im not confused
well so far i have seen a lot of people reply to this post that have no clue about wh logisticsthen there were a few with good ideas that i can tell live in wh spacefor all of you thinking i was talking about turning wh space into the typical normal sov system of null sec new eden you just dont have a clue we would be happy with the suggestions of a few to just fix pos mechanics all we wanted in a station should be able to be done in a pos repackage chewing down scrap metals building more pos mods etc to those that whine about being able to mine moons in wh space you need to stop and think about it a bit those mins would not be able to be mined with zero risk every second you spend in wh space you are at risk please get a clue before you reply to a post there is no way in hell to keep 50 large death stars fed in a wh in closing thanks to those that had ideas to add or work off mine or others to the angry null sec dwellers i understand your ed that ccp nerff the hell out of null with the true sec stuff not my fault and direct your anger to the ones that deserve it not flame because your edfly safe everyone
welcome to eve may your stay here be fruitful
as much as i hate the look of pos the management side has to be sorted before the aesthetic
hi rek well be addressing this directly soon in the form of a proposal for consideration
ive always thought that the sec levels of systems should fluctuate over time based upon the number of npc kills in that system more npc kills  true sec increasing less npc kills  true sec decreasingonly problems are the lines between high low and null sec im cool with allowing systems to flip between highlow and lownull but there are some important implications that would have to be considered systems like jita that have no npc concord response in player sov systems etc
i have an idea that is sort of like yours truesec can fluctuate but the static sec status of a system remains static motsu for instance could remain a 09 system its just that it would be 95 usually in comparison to one of those addedin tutorial systems ie henebene couster clacille usually staying at a 86 or around there
odd because i just listened to the fireside chat that was really the mittens show and barely any of those topics were discussed at all interesting that you now propose those topics will be discussed with ccp at your next summit i might go so far as to believe you might say hey weve got a lot of requests from the player base but it is more likely to consist of wholly onesided inaccuracies in favor of nullsec alliances
im only hostile when the csm says one thing but does another flames everyone who ever came before them as ed and acts like the only important changes to the game are ones the entire nullsec community has been wanting discussed with ccp but so far everything ive read and heard has but one primary focus making nullsec better than it already is in contrast to the rest of new eden  prove me wrong and ill stfu 
juggernaut class capital shipclass tech ii dreadnaughtchaosin greek cosmology chaos was a primordial state of matter from which the cosmos and the other gods emerged for hesiod and the early greek olympian myth 8th century bc chaos was the vast and dark void from which nyx emergedthe empires seeing an increased usage of capital ships more specifically super carriers which slice threw other capital ships have commissioned a beast of a ship called the juggernaut the juggernaut lives up to its name featuring the remote repair killing capital neutralizer and nosforatu and enough hitpoints to effectively tank a doomsday device the empires have also achieved a new level in excellence in their new siege drives and jump drives the siege drive utilizes enhanced tech recently retrieved from expeditions into worm hole space that effectively cuts in half the siege modules activation time furthermore a new beefier jump drive has been installed in the juggernaut that lets it activate its jump drive with less capacitor but all this new gear comes at a price and the engineers thought best that the sensor department could be cut in half resulting in a lowered sensor strength for all juggernautsdeveloper duvolle labsduvolle labs manufactures sturdy ships with a good mix of offensive and defensive capabilities since the company is one of new edens foremost manufacturers of particle blasters its ships tend to favor turrets and thus have somewhat higher power output than normalhull morosrole bonusship only needs 60 cap to jumpsiege moduel duration reduced 50 and consumption amount reduced 50can use capital nuets and noscan fit tech ii siege modueltech ii siege mod is the same as the regular siege mod but provides a bonus to range and effectiveness for capital nos and nuets think of oppisite to carrier in triagedreadnaught ship bonus5 to cap hybrid turret damage per lev20 to drone hpdamage per levjuggernaut ship bonus5 to cap hybrid turret damage per lev10 to armor amount per levsensor strength 22 magnometric7 low slots5 mid slots6 high slots 4 gun 2 utilitythe ship would have enough ehp to atleast tank 1 ddd  maybe two if he goes all crazy with officer gear the idea for the ship is a beefier dreadthis one does more damage has better tankcan use a capital nuet to make carrier rr a nightmareplus the siege mod only lasts 5 min so you can get out in a hurry with a lower cap level if you have to bail
a few things i think should be done1 scs need a better defined role currently they are logi super dreads and even tacklers that needs to end i would like to see them returned to their original logistics role thus i think fbs should be deleted from the game scs given their triage mod back and more appropriate bonuses to go with that they were too weak originally so im definitely not suggesting they fully revert to what they were but they should never have been made dps ships instead they should be much tankier carriers both ehp and active tank and rr better2 dramiel needs a nerf its not just a little bit faster than the second fastest ship its a lot faster the dram can be the fastest but id limit that to 100200ms faster not 2kms faster it also needs a dps nerf removing the drone bay would do this effectively3 bos need added range 6ly with max skills would be good reduced fuel usage for covert jump portal and a rethinking of ship bonuses and base stats either they are combat ships or they arent the stats and bonuses must match currently the redeemer has combat ship bonuses but its tank is so nerfed to hell compared to the t1 armageddon that its foolish to go anywhere near a fight with it and its considered the best of them for direct combat4 the cruor lacks the powergrid to fit both neuts and guns the value of small neuts without a range bonus is also highly questionable as if that wasnt enough every other faction frigate has more midlow slots than it its slow with poor agility poor tank low dps and largely ineffective ew5 the afk empires need to end this largely revolves around moon goo with fixed moon resources in well documented places it is absolutely impossible for any new entity to get their hands on these highly sought after resources it also ensures a fixed supply and that those who already have these moons never have to worry about running them dry and having to find new ones moons either need to have varying resources based on mining practices or moon mining needs to be eliminated with those resources going to belts or exploration sites6 there is too much emphasis on blob warfare bringing more should have drawbacks whether it be los issues stacking penalties on dps added aoe damage or any of a number of other possibilities i dont care what but something must be done7 any ship with 1 midslot is broken8 legions covert ops subsystem is broken9 tengus ecm subsystems are broken10 proteuss drone subsystem is broken11 blasters need a buff i suggest an across the board buff of 25 to falloff and a 10 increase in raw damage short ranged but deadly should be their role right now they are just short ranged12 dreads umm lol if scs get sent back to their original super sized triage carrier role then reduce siege cycle time and fuel usage by 12 if scs are kept as dps ships dreads need to have their damagetank without a siege mod increased to what it is with this change would include the deletion of the siege mod from game
ok so here is the ideathere are planets in eve some have people living on themsome have crazy artefacts on themsogive systems in 00 that have good true sec bonuses to the system specifically for industrylikethere is a large population of workers on planet 3 due to this reprocessing ratios and moon processing rates are more efficientorthere is an ancient artefact on planet 2 this is a remnant of one of the original gigantic colony ships that came threw the wormhole scientists in the system have been developing ways to reverse engineer its technology and as a result all capital ships in system are built at an increased ratethere could be all kinds of bonuses that would encourage alliances to set up shop in null secplus this would make certain systems really desirable and create more conflict for control over that space as a result
pos permissions are pretty unworkable if more than one player is using the same pos as a basetheft is a huge problem from poses lacking some manner of keeping track of the items in the hangarst3 pilots cannot refit fully at posesshieldtanked ships have to wait a long time when attempting to sortie from a posedit also tearing down a pos tends to run into bugs regarding ammunition getting stuck inside the guns making the tower impossible to recover without gm input
i have 10 different rifter fits that i use currently if you dont believe me check my battleclinic page50 total is obviously not enough

drone ui improvementsspecifically the ability to hotkey the launch of a specific subset of the drones in a ships bay we can already separate drones into groups but still must navigate a dropdown menu to use these groupsspecifically the ability to determine the damage status of drones that are inside the ships bayspecficially the ability to add drone functions launchattackrecover as clickable buttons on the hud like all the other weaponsystemsspecifically the removal of those silly mine and mine repeatedly dropdown commands in favor of having mining drones recognize the engage target hotkey when the target in question is an asteroid and mine repeatedly by default
if that could be fixed i would buy a case of beer for each dev responsible this is possibly one of the most annoying ui problems right now
ill keep this fairly short as the title mostly explains the issue currently the api can track ingame market transactions and has as such given rise to programs such as evehq eve commander and a million others to allow budding tycoons to track their sales from outside the gamenot so with contracts ccp isnt it time that contracts traders like us were given the same opportunity make contracts data viewable through the apithanks for your supportcomments
supporting for great justice
agreed
how about some level of pi feedback while were at it too might be a bit tricky to format but should be possible
what is bad about my idea
came expecting a long rant about how mean people are mean left pleasantly surprised finally a good idea to boost lowsecedit to addhilariously poorly thought out rebuttal there why would a carebear need to rat up sec status this proposal only affects highsec gankers and the people who already live in lowsec and judging by all the supports here the latter group largely agrees with this proposal pity the poor highsec gankers  they may suffer a day of risk in their eve life
prolly bout 30m sp was only minnie cruiser 5 but still hurt like hell couldnt do anything but stationspin my vagabond for a while and thats no fun theyre fugly buggerssigh cant win
hahahah lookit you reachin up the ladder like a champ i could dance around you like a cherub and be all like ratatatatat and then maybe be like hyoooooo and youd be in the ownzone fast as lightning you dont even know you dont even know how high do you even need to make these badpostsanyway this thread was sort of helpful sort of thanks for your input duders ill take what i can out of this and report back
bumpi approve of this ideawhile not nearly as experienced as other pilots in this thread i have been engaging dramiels recently with fits specifically designed to beat them even then the only hope is that the other pilot doesnt know how to properly fly the ship a good pilot just disengages if he starts to losefalloff bonus  a tracking bonus  superior speed is the main issue in my opinion echoing some of the other comments in this threadnerf at least some of these and dramiels would have a weakness that can be exploited
thats too bad u cant carebear in 100 safety but then again high sec isnt supposed to be safe is it1 2 so u missed the point as well u can still pirate all u want and your example included pirates that took the time and effort to rat up their sec which theyll still be able to do what they want to under these changes
doing it without the skill is a legitimate scam using the skill its an unbeatable scam that functions based on game mechanics there is no click vs click player contest the game just removes the order because their is no isk that makes it an exploit though it be the result of legal game mechanics the problem is most people have no idea they are up against a game mechanic until they train the skill and fail to have the isk balance required for a buy order resulting in its cancellation until that happens or you consider a dozen possibilities after getting scammed you dont really know people reading this thread might understand it of course though ive noticed a few seem to have completely missed the point and reason behind the threads postingto clarify not for you shandir as its obvious you already know the function of the scam1 perfectly legit trader who will never be identified due to orders being impossible to fill resulting in no transactions transfers all his isk to an alt or to his corp wallet and puts up a 100 margin trading buy order for useless item 1 perhaps even multiple times useless item in this case is nearly nonexistant on market with perhaps a few sell orders from same trader at same isk value plus a bit as the buy order buy order is very high and unrealistic for this item2 trader transfers majority of useless item 1 in bulk to useless biomassable alt along with a few items of moderate value that are in extremely low demand such as t2 small drone rigs or capital construction components trader then uses useless alt to create an item exchange contract in the fashion of a firesale for somewhat less than half or more the sale value of useless item 1 to his useless buy order for approximately the same number of useless item 1 items contract is posted to jita local3 trader may at this point enter second useless alt and spam jita local with comments about how the contract issuer is losing isk and may even argue with himself for effect using the first useless alt4 the buyer some poor guy in local who may realize its a scam he most likely does if he has the isk to cover it but doesnt realize hes not up against someones twitch reflexes or a bunch of guys in voice chat running the scam he is most unaware and set full up against the wall of an unknown game mechanic unbeatable and fully in favor of even an afk or offline scammer 5 buyer probably aware of the scam and thinking he can beat it sets up his menus windows and boxes so he can clickclickclick and sell those useless items as fast as possible then he waits gives it a few minutes maybe even five to ten before preparing himself to duel the unseen adversary then proceeds to do the inevitable which spells out certain doom for him he accepts the contract the buyer in this case could in fact wait ten days to fill the buy order or he could fill it within less than a second of accepting the contract he is relying on an opponent having human responses giving in to inattention or just being to slow yet he is up against an adversary which suffers from none of these deficits and for whom time is not a factor there can only be one answer and that is a resounding no impossible the isk is not there but he didnt know that it is not in the rules or really mentioned anywhere shame
give us some kind of npc shipping company and were good to go otherwise setting minimum qty on items makes sure you dont need to fly to 60 different stations in 20 different systems to pick up one 75mm gatling in each of itoh and while were at it make transporting ships industrials transporters freighters and jump freighters invulnerable to other players in high sec except if at war because until the goods arrive at their destinations the tradersindustrialists take the risk of the loss and no one will compensate themas you might have guessed already not supportededitspelling 
dont mess with a legit skill the amount of stupid ideas in this thread is overwhelmingif someone is dumb enough to get scammed on one thing they are stupid to get scammed on any number of things the problem is stupid playersfailing all else if you want to make isk never deal in anything weird basic commonitys are what people buy and sell a lot off minerals pos fuels and planet materials failing this dont try to make isk from good deals when you are too stupid to avoid scams so something simpler like missioning or mining and selling all refined materials at market hubs npcs dont scam try making isk with them
support remove it unless its fixedmy problem with margin trading is not the existence of the scam itself but a lesser known borderline exploit thats associated with it that pretty much breaks the skills functionality so margin trading is supposed to allow you to reduce the amount of money you have stuck in escrow by a certain amount right  say you only put 56 in escrow for an order at level 2well the issue is that for any level of the skill what you can do is sell to your own orders on an alt and so remove all your remaining money from the escrow so youre left with an order backed by nothing and with the money you took out you can make another order and so on forever minus transaction fees you can force the game to lend you effectively unlimited creditim pretty sure thats not what the skill was supposed to do if its not clear what i mean is suppose you create an order with 24 escrow you sell that much worth of stuff to the order from your alt now your alt has the escrow money and your main has the items you give the items to the alt again and the money to the main set up a new order repeat as many times as you likehow is it connected to the scam  well obviously that allows scammers to create many more scam orders than they would if they were all actually backed by even 24 and it makes sure nobody can sell to the order even at a much lower price that might fall within the escrow amount
i have this as a proposal
agreed eve seems to be losing its colour the entire narrative consists of sov grind here and sov grind there ramp up the chronicles and enrich the game for all of us
you missed the dev blog and the big announcement that they were going on hiatus didnt you
lots of other ideas going around some good some bad sorry to start a new thread but this is such a simple fix i didnt want i smothered by the other ideas on the board atmfix is simple1 turn the button into a warp disruption tower  points any ships on grid with infini point warp disruptor neuts and webs any ship farther than 100km from button locks ships into plex until it is captured by one side or another  does not affect pods upon arriving on grid all ships are placed 12km from the button in a random direction timers only run if at least one ship is within 5km of the buttonadd to this the other ideas of2 broadcastshow plexes with running timers on mapfacwar pageand the controversial3 delete the faction rats from the plexes  instead perhaps make defensive plexers immune to warp disruption from tower neuts and web still apply if distance100kmand finally and more controversially something i think would be interesting4 limit entry to max 5 per side in plex at any time ie pirates and neutral rr can camp the gates but not enter plex and either team is capped at max 5 ships in plex at once if ships are destroyed they can be reinforced in plex by allies waiting at the gate opposing forces both waiting at the same gate may have issues to settle before they can help in the plex either this or a simple hard cap limit of 5 per plex no reinforcingmajor unrestricted plexes have no gate so are not subject to this discussflame edit updated
interesting but i have concerns what about pods if youre in a plex do you automatically get pod killed if you lose cause that would suck id never visit a plex again if that were the case it also poses a problem for the defender the defender is always at a disadvantage ship wise since the attacker can take a look at whats there via dscanner and then decide what ships are best to attack with the inability to warp out would make these plexs complete death traps for the defenderanother problem is that some of the best fights ive had in plexs were against random neutrals trying to gank me not the opposing militia this is especially true in the minor plexs where youll get random high sec guys and solo pirates just roaming around looking for frigate fights ive always been all to happy to give them to them in the minor plexs because i know their falcon alt cant come in and screw up the funas you can imagine i cant really support any part of your proposal on the surface they do seem like good ideas ill admit but with a little more thought and experience i think theyd make things a whole lot worse i have been in the amarrminmatar militia for the past year and a half though i recently left it out of boredom
you have been waging the plex war for how longthere are tons of threads on this topic most recent from a known fw participant is fw the discussioni suggest you read up on the quite literally hundreds of threads on the topic as few of us trench rats have the stamina to keep shooting down near identical ideas every week 
pods will not be warp disrupted so you can leave as your ship is destroyeddefenders have the disadvantage of being scannable before engagement but they also have the advantage of setting up at their chosen range from warp inand yes ive read hundreds of posts on fw revamping ive been part of fw since the first day and im quite happy to add this post to the end of whatever thread is currenti just think all the different ideas can get lost so i started a specific thread for a specific idea ie warp disrupting buttons because it struck me as an interesting proposition and i havent seen it mentioned beforefeel free to use brain to assess the idea if it needs shooting down then do so i believe thats what forums are for 
all that would lead to is the birth of the plexwatching alt and the new ever so exploity plexfilling trial account alts players who arent metagaming in this way would plex even less than they currently do because eve players are absolutely terrified of losing their ships
logic of this idea is so wrong that it makes me cryccp has already made this game almost fool proof what we need least here is more safety networks for pvp gameloot is already as bad as it is there is no need making it even worse if you can always just push i decline your pvp button in eve it becomes pretty boring and fast just like lets say wowi can see wow mechanics coming into eve pretty fast though just think about spacepriests
this idea is really simple but should help alleviate the huge massive blobfest that is coalitionsmove regions farther apart subcaps will be unaffected and regular capitals cannot span whole regions in a single jump anymore this would make it a giant pain in the ass to move capitalsbut would make the universe much larger in a sense this kind of supports the theory that alliances should find it easy to flex their might within their own regions but moving to other regions should be somewhat harder you can still move to the region next to you with relative ease but moving any farther than that becomes exponentially harderno ships are nerfed and no roles adversely affected jump bridges would be very useful in the same regionbut loose their value as you try to travel from region to region roaming is still fun jfs become a larger pain in the ass but still very useful its not a fixall solution there will always be blobs but hopefully if this were to occur smaller alliances would feel a bit farther away from the large alliances that would just steamroll them usually
identify all margin trading orders in market window highlight with yellow instead of green and tag with mt to identify as a margin trading order everybody wins
why on earth would you do this the only people this really helps are people too moronic to spot scams
just about everybody used margin trading lots legit things be flagged green or whatever colordont trade in stupid weird commonties or things you dont use petition ccp to add that to the tutorial along with scammers and avoiding jita local chat
or just play sensibly
after you train up margin trading you always use it theres no option not to use it hench i really dont think this will help much
considering this is an alternative to removing it entirely you might want to think a little before you answer with such obvious disdain currently margin trading allows players to post an unbeatable scam due to it being available as a false buy order placer on the market most players are unaware that characters cannot actually receive negative isk balances as a result of using margin trading this results in the obvious assumption they are up against a human rather than a game mechanic which will result in even unknowing seasoned players taking a risk with an obvious scam personally i had to fall to this scam 3 times before i broke it down and figured out how it worked and that the culprit was the margin trading skill the first time was when i was less than 6 months into the game and the second two were just recently after more than two years of playing i have never fallen for any other scam in eve online not even spies or scammers stealing from a corp i have run so why did i fall for thisthe answer is simple because i was not aware that the scam was supported by a game mechanic involving 1 skill out of 388 to choose from sure anyone who delves deeply into trading might know of it but most players are unlikely to have ever ventured accross it this makes it possibly the best scam out there and also the most easily perpetrated without consequence by highlighting the margin tradng orders yellow you make players who might otherwise be subject to this scam think now why is the order highlighted yellow without actually affecting the way the margin trading skills works this is a winwin scenario for all but the scammers and even for them its not bound to keep people from taking the chance at some point people fall for scams in jita everyday a lot of them far less legitimate looking than this one why do i say legitimate looking not because nobody can figure out its a scam but because it looks like a beatable scam and we all know people would love to take the scammers for their isk once in awhile just for being what they are parasitesi lost 38 billion to margin trading scams in two contracts just recently if its that easy its too easy
in my understanding of mmos logout never takes you back to character select as a security measureit should not completely close the client however

yes this is serious hear me out first the null sec sov mechanics have always been terribly boring in the old days it was pos spam setting it up fueling it and obviously killing it and putting up your own was tedious at best the current system only magnifies it by requiring huge fleets to repeatedly blast glorified rocks for hours on end no one likes it so why do we have it i propose removing the entire sov mechanic in favor a simpler and more dynamic systemrather than any sort of formal sov you gain it by simply controlling the space much like tracts of low sec have very clear owners despite the owners name not being displayed anywhere on the map or the top left of the screen its your space because you said so and you have the firepower to back it upso what about system upgrades and pos structures that require sov not a damn thing changes they stay in game just as they are except that sov is no longer required to anchor and online them yes that means i could fly into nc space drop a tower and cyno jam any system i damn well please this opens the possibility of multiple parties cyno jamming a single system obviously said pos would be vaporized overnight but i could do it if i really wanted to and i think thats a good mechanici would keep the current restrictions as well however such as those modules being forbidden in npc null as well as low sec outposts would become nothing more than destructible objects much like a pos i would make them even more pos like too by allowing the owners to add defenses to them they would have restricted pg and cpu just like any other pos they are just much much bigger if for whatever reason ccp is unable to make them destructible then just have them go vulnerable once all defenses are destroyed and the outpost itself hits structure damage at which point it could be claimed by a new entity it would need to be repaired however it wouldnt instantly go to 100 health again
everyone with sov enjoys the benefits from sov everyone dealing with sov dislikes the mechanics of sovi do hope the op is a troll because this is a terribad idea
yeah im sure the current csm will be all over this
i think your idea needs to be thought out sov costs a fairly major isk sink in the eve economy disappear overnight how will this alter the eve economyupgrades at ihubs can anyone install them into the ihub can multiple ihubs be installed in the same system which one is active do alliancescorps maintain control of an ihub after its anchored who pays for the upkeep costs associated with upgraded ihubs people can suddenly install jbs and cynojamms in any system without ascertaining a certain sovstrategic index while i agree the sov system needs some work i think your idea is offthecuff and illadvised people like bbbiiigggg battles thats why they are working on time dilation thats why they have tcus and stations and ihubs with reinforcement timers at the same time sov should about much more than gathering 500 people to a system for an alarm clock battle it should depend more on a sustained activitypresence within the system unfortunately this latter suggestion is whats lacking from the current sov conquest mechanics

obviously many thousands of players enjoy black screen on loading gridsov structures suck they need rid of the structures and allow a system that rewards the people that remain present in the system to hold the system ill champion a system based on pvp kills although i can tolerate one that has mixed metrics of pvppve
tldrallow players to create their own missions that would be added to the cue of agent missions that are given out to other playerslong versionfor a long time now players have been able to create mini missions with the contract system however this is only for hauling stuff it was also mentioned at the fanfest before last that in incarna it would be possible to set up similar minimissions in bars and such this proposal goes beyond that to allow players to create full combat missionscurrently devs can create missions via some back office process if this proposal were implemented that process would be automated if it is not already and placed behind a simple interface for the player to order a mission an exampleplayer decides to create a mission she locates a faction she has enough standing with if one can get a lvl 4 mission one can create one and talks to an agent who can create missions the agent asks some questions or gives a form to fill out with the following basic informationamount of isk to spend hiring shipscrews etc this isk will become the bounty on the piratesnumber and type of ships this could be a pool of points set by the amount of isk so if you wanted to have a lvl 4 mission with nothing but frigates in it you could performance issues aside or this could be automated to automatically chose a listing of ship types that match the amount of isk you put inlocation of mission this could be a listing of the various enemies of the faction you are hiring for instance minmatar factions would let you put missions in amarr and caldari space or maybe angel spacemission text if you want your fleet to say anything to the capsuleer taking them on optional and could be a multiple choice to avoid issues with profanityonce those choices are made the mission is added to the list of missions for the enemy faction that was chosen if the mission is completed by a pilot for one of those factions then they get the isk put into the mission however if a mission is declined or failed the player who created the mission gets the isk back plus some extra maybe 10 percent to show that the mission was successful for himoptional ideas includehaving missions expire after a set time if they do not get put into rotationif a particular player character orders a lot of missions against a particular faction that faction could place a bounty or somehow make that player known as a supporter of the enemy factionlater expansion to include setting up mining operations or bases as seen in some missions where even if the mission is completed if the player completing it did not destroy the structure the player who created it will still get some isk or other reward back or she could elect to pour more isk into it to keep it going possibly this could be a new source for bpcs of faction gear or something elseprosmixes up missionscreates an isk sink with some chance for reward low chance for gaming system only way to make money would be to put a mission in some region and then camp the entire region to make sure no one ran that missioncould be used in all areas of spaceconsunknown levels of programming neededsubmitted for the consideration of the community
why should we do for free what we pay ccp to do
except for that little read huge difference in not having to worry about being put in hull with one volley because one can just jump out most wrecks can be reached from jump range  perhaps you would like tractoring to add a pvp aggression timer as well somehow i doubt it as that would mean it no longer caters to the risk averse
nothing is stopping you from from poping them on the other side
ill make myself more clearevery signature has a unique id which changes after dt each day all i propose is the id remains the same for the signature over its lifetime you still have to find the sig and bmk it just means the next day when theres a new sig that u know wats new instead of having to drop probes to cancel your bmked sigs becuase their id has changed
lets see here nullsec nullsec nullsec oh nullsec more nullsec dont know dck about empire nullsec nullsec nullseci see csm6 has continued to focus on things that will make the game fun for them and gingerly stepped over all the things that the player base has supported for yearsas for ccp using csm6 as a marketing ploy for pushing time dilation as a massively player supported initiative which csm6 has made their primary focus well at least someone has made mittens and gang their  kudos ccpnow having said all that anyone else still concerned that the only things being represented by csm6 are things that will benefit nullsec citizens more than anyone elsei mean seriously more farms in null the billions of isk and fleet of titans you jackoffs build from the bots you run getting to be too little for you oh wait  or is it the slam you are all taking from sreegs putting the cork on the kettle bahaha more farms in null yeah thats the problem with eve not enough isk being fielded to bot running alliances wtfcapsuper cap balancing let me guess you dont like the subcap nerf right you think you really ought to be able to sit in a 10 empire space with some kind of uber god mode type ship and just fck everybody in the ss right that would be uber fun wouldnt it ffsship iteration or how to make subcap ships more like cap ships for our nullsec battles about the only thing that would trickle down to empireso mittens gets to yap and yap and yap and yap about frankly some of the most inane topics and how he plans to improve csmccp relations bahahahaha yer funny and push macro topics to ccp because developers dont like to be told about the small stuff wow you are so fcking far off from the truth it isnt even funny developers are all about the details but you wouldnt know that would you mittens youve made your claim to fame in a mmorpg hahahaanyway this is just more dribble from the nullsec alliances who feel they should pretty much all have gm powers and own everything and everybody else in the game if any of them had any real interest in the evolution of the game theyd be pushing for iteration on things that matter to everybody not just the sht that pains them in nullsec and would give them even more advantage than they already havenope still not impressed with csm6 my votes didnt go to mittens to begin with  they went to someone i actually thought might be able to communicate with ccp though that person is on the csm ive not heard one gd word from them since not in forums not in the fireside chat  nowhere i guess mittens was busy slurping down a bunch of hard ons to keep everyone else at bay an entire group of sell outs screw you goons and all you other useless and clueless twits on the csm your efforts will be laudable and wholly unimplemented same as csm5 csm4 etc youre nothing more than a marketing and mouth piece for ccp so just get over yourselves macro topics hahaha i believe when we developers meet people like you in real life we label you either fcking lazy or clueless in csm6s case ill go with clueless
yes lots of people are in all these threadsnotably none of them seems to have won election
too obvious 2101 for effort 1 for at least pretending to have listened to the talk
lol spoken like a nullsec alt it pains you folks when someone intelligent enough to read between the lines and see what the csm is really all about sez something doesnt it lol
as an industrialistmanufacturerminer etc i would like some help in competing with the older established players many aspects of the game have been nerfed to slow down the generation of isk i can inderstand and even accept this as ccp is a business like many others and needs to show a profit what i cant understand though is why t2 bpos have never been changed in any of the patches to give them limited runs and then expire this would then give all players the same opportunity to sell t2 items i propose that ccp either nerfs these bpos makes them available to all or allows the research of copies
what an original fresh issue we should discuss this in this new thread since there are no other places to do this
did i detect sarcasm sry but i couldnt find a relevant thread would you be so kind as to link one please if that was the case
sec status change of system will in no way affect how fun a mission is only the rewards from the agentid like to see fewer ships overall in missions but deadlier and also if ships spawn have them warp in instead of appearing from thin airbeltrats can do this why not missionratsmore escortmissions and the like where we have to defend a ship from destruction or some structure maybe even introduce group play into it say if npcs come in from multiple directions and we cant cover all directions fast enough bring purpose to missions instead of the only purpose being getting out aliveyou could have defend station attack station type of gameplay mixed up with npcs trying to get you etc etcmake groupplay rewarding right now when you mission with someone the reward is even lower to promote groupplay the reward has to go the other way around i understand that is a problem especially with consideration to alts and the fact that missions get easier introduce a dynamic control check the ships on grid depending on shipclass and how many have certain npcs spawn in addition to those who are already therea frig on grid spawn npc frigsa cruiser on grid spawn more cruisersobviosly the frig on grid should get the aggro from the frig spawn etcthis way everyone on the team gets a challenge something to do that is fitted to themone way to deal with increased rewards read bounties is to make bounty rewards scale1 additional ship on grid 10 more isk from bounties increase it by 10 for every additional ship to a certain limit lets say 6 ships after that no increase and if npcs are deadlier bringing alts in shuttles mining ships etc should make them think otherwise basically make the missions so hostile that this easy exploitation is out of the question if you dont shoot at a ship you dont count so no cloakies either

considering the reality of a frigate colliding at velocity with a subcap like an orca or a freighter would result in the fiery death of all occupants of the frigate and the frigate itself without much damage to the subcap this is at least a step in the right direction
tbh realistically it would probally result in the fiery death of all involved a frigate traveling at 2000 ms is carrying alot more energytomass then even the most powerful of modern guns with alot more mass a frigate impacting at that speed many tons of steeletc would be more then capable of immense amounts of destruction and even in planetary terms would be able to remove a large cityim such a nerd 
its a distinct possibility frigates arent exactly small craft like fighter jets and even one of those could cause significant damage to a battleship if it struck it possibly even sink ityes i support this thread too keep em coming csm i might even have something to say on the subject it is a large area though and i cant say as i have come to any solid resolutions regarding it that i would post here just yet
id like to be able to add much more to a pos then currently and the cpu and power grid would just follow in fuel usedalso labs suck since i have to click threw each one to find the lowest qued slot make them just one long list that can made longer or shorter based on how many upgrades the unit has
no its not you alone log in and out changes in status who made changes  when inventory control inventory limits for those who have to store shuttles by the ing dozens inventory management the list is endlesspos gunners get a drop down availiable turrets to control
while i agree with your first point i dont feel the same about the second the only thing that would make the corp security potential better is if station containers could actually be locked in a hangar rather than pulled from corp hangar to players repassworded looted and returnedback to the oppositioning pos structures is absolute crap zooming out zooming in changing view from ship to pos back to ship after moving a little back to pos so you can move your ship to a better vantage point back to ship so you can see the fn structure bluntly it sucks the alternative just dropping the modules any old where then anchoring them in a long were talking hours and hours over days dull repetative process guy i quoted his idea is good if we have to have anchoring onlining timers and such could be built into a new ui too with plenty of other improvementswaiting 2 minutes to do a repetition of what i mentioned above and again another few minutes after that or even six that will drive a man absolutely mad and make him lose all reason doing it for hours on hours on hours will make him want to hunt down and killtorture whoever made him do it in a bad way jk but sorta notand people wonder why pvp is so popular among the nullsec crowd and wormholers lowsec peoplesthey just want to kill something any time they have anything to do with pos maintanence its really really bad please fix it
its trauma my last experience with setting up a pos was testing moon mining on sisi i never got to the testing stagemodules all have distances at which they can be from another based on the size of their model and bounding box this sucksevery time you get a new pos modules that has to work with other pos modules you have to experiment and find out which models to place first so you can have everything within the right distance to allow for reactions and all the rest a moon harvester cannot be placed first to allow the placement of a silo or complex reactor incidently i found out the silo can be placed anywhere possibly even the other side of the pos somebody obviously tried to alleviate the pain at some point by just making it completely freeroaming in that one instanceno matter which way you set up a pos with all its structures there are at least ten people who will want it changed with exception to the guns why the guns because you cant bounce off them on warp in and they dont generally get in your way flying about the posguns is kind of a catch all for defensive modules in this case with exception to shield hardenersammo how i hate putting ammunition in all the guns freaking unbelievable how much of a drag this is in practice you get an industrial with an mwd or ab and bookmark all the turret points for warp in then bounce off moons to save time it still takes forever and you have do double and triple check the turrets to see if you missed one with the industrials agility youre still drifting like a log in a lake ideally you have a covert ops transport for this to make things even easier try it in a badger iipos modules and guns take space lots of it no easy fix for that oneonlining and offlining defenses and reactorsalternative structures like it isnt bad enough the first time now every time a threat becomes viable you have to offline assembly arrays and research labs to online what is really only half of a reasonable defense for the pos you cant have both its either labs reactors and other similar facilities or defensive modules to give your pos a half decent combat advantagethis is why reinforcement timers existyes it takes forever to kill a pos but once the guns are gone who caresthere is so much wrong with these things fuel storage and requirements pg and cpu limitations structure placement ammunition etcspeaking of ammunition placing guns and defensive modules outside the shields you cant be so far away and yet you cant be so close i think the margin for effective placement is between 56 km from the shields more or less and you get a message that you cant place themodule there then you have to wait for the delay timer to continue with what you were doinglast but not least size how exactly do you fit a moros in a ship maintanence array anyhow stations are bad enough but these things are almost smaller than a tengu
honestly fuel pellets are imo another waste of my already limited time fuel for a pos should be a backup only incase your anchorable solar collector unit gets destroyed i mean really were in space usually in close proximity to a sun is there a reason for not utilizing that other than another fing isk sinkthat and what the others above me have said about existing problems other than fuel and also if i want a deathstar station i should be able to get a focused fire cpu module for it for extra iskiesmore grid and cpu and fix the pw for shields to be optional utilized if wanted but defaults to positive standing set by the owner corp to allow access it really is a system with a lot of potential if it could be worked on

er yes thanks i thinkif the other three supercarriers were nerfed down to the level of the hel thered probably be much less of a problem
the real problem is the sov based in massive hp structures easy to deploy and timers all they do necessary blobs of the supercapitals to make war in a reasonable time of gameyou can nerf sc the only efficient solution against titans blobs but the real solution is a new sov system based in a solar occupation for players that really live 00 perhaps a new pi with sov effects and not for nomads players in supercaps
id just like to point out that dreadnaughts can effectively take down sov structures as well dreads can easily put out 67k dps which is not too far behind a supercarrier why dont dominion sov structures have shields like pos simply adding a shield to online ihubs and tcus and sbus would make dreadnoughts a necessary part of sovereigntyvocal players wanted a way for relatively small groups to be able to significantly pose a threat to large alliances they got their answer with supercarriers of course they were thinking of having a gang of 20 hacs instead but lets face it there is a fundamental reason why 100 cruisers is better than 20 cruisers that will not changethe greatest problem with supercarriers lies most in that they can complete nearly all warfare objectives in the game thats a greater problem than being overpowered because of having too much capacitor or too large of a drone bay or too many slots if ccp wishes to fulfill the desires of the roving band style players to disrupt alliances and simultaneously eliminate the ubiquitous nature of supercarriers then they should consider putting forcefields on sovereignty structures
well these are more or less the same thing two of the reasons that supercarriers are able to carry out nearly any objective is because they have an abundance of utility slots and a primary weapon system drones which effectively never runs out and can nearinstantly switch between types as battlefield circumstances develop every other shiptype in the game needs to make decisions at the fitting screen and are punished if they decide incorrectly supercarriers just shrug activate the correct utility module from their omnifit and pop out a different type of drone cloud
you really cares on scUFFFDdrones in a fleetbattle its imposible try to deploy waves of drones in massive engangements youUFFFDll be very lucky if you can deploy fbs and make regulars attacks in a laggystyle scfight in real fights if you are not in a sc youUFFFDll be worried about your targeting time with multiples ecm burts than a wave off dronesi insist change sovmecs and nobody cares abouts sc fbs sbus and all that expensive toys
in their great wisdom of nerfdom again ccp has once again screwed up an otherwise great feature now for me its pencil and paper if i want to save fittings in a notebookcome on ccp enough of these screwups of yours
problem with blackops is that they were made fleetops ships instead of blackopsbringing 20 guys along doesnt sound like very much a black opgive blob gots their own fleetops ship class and make one real blackops ship class and we can start working out a balance there
so you want a solopwnmobile perhaps you should write up a proposal on thatwhy shouldnt ccp make the black ops a fleet ops ship as you call it
id suggest restricting the fleet bonuses to ships capable of using black ops portals  that way theres a greatly reduced risk of people replacing titans or command ships with black ops it would also allow the bonuses to be stronger and possibly tailored more specifically to the needs of black ops fleets
opyou screwed up and got burned stop whining and suckitupthe only change needs to be to your focus and organization
1 i would disagree that it would only put in real consequences of being 10 by limiting their time in low sec i can forsee many more effects that this proposal would have mostly exploits to grief the unsuspecting2 no i got the point and my example was about game mechanics being bypassed people are far more intelligent than the rules and system in the game and they will find a way around them the pirates will find a way around isk transfers so it wont have any real effect on them but it will still provide means to grief for the underhanded bastards that are so prevalent in evething is the pirates who are 10 are open and honest about being pirates and accept the consequences of their actions getting the low sec status whereas empire griefers very much arent which is evidenced by the dodging of game rules and consequences what this proposal would do is hinder those honest pirates and will in no way effect those who bypass the system anyway why bother those who take the consequences of being pirates more than those who do the crimes but dodge the time
1 name one such way that i havent already addressed yet because unless u got one that point is invalid2 see 1 and even if they do they would have to put in even more time and effort in circumventing the rules than ratting the sec back up which goes back to limiting their time in low sec giving others a better chance to roam and survive there or they can pvp in 00 im sure your alliance would like more fights 3 how r empire griefers even griefing and yet 10s r honest how do they dodge game rules while 10s dont dont know how u even came up with that because the consequence is the time and if thats dodged then theres no consequences at all derp
im sorry but this thread is well good and dead whatever anyone says here its been pointed out a dozen times that there are ways around it lets move on
despite my earlier comments regarding this thread i do believe the idea itself has meritheres whyit adds more depth to the game eve is about player interaction and actions having consequencesno a market order shouldnt affect a players ecurity status based on who buys or sells as a result of it this doesnt mean direct trades and donations shouldnt impact security status they do in real lifedont believe me police officers take note of who is dealing with who and who people make aquaintance with communities notice who you involve yourself with and judge you as a result of it everything you do has a consequence no matter what your motives might bethis idea is perfectly legitimate and makes sense there is no reason it should be discarded so easily given csms position it likely will be but ill argue it all the sameheres a big problem with eve altsalts really actually suck because they allow players to do things that they normally would have to do with their main and suffer consequence or be recognized forscammingcorp theftgankingtrollingpropagandapiratingspyingetcwhen you can do it all yourself without ever losing face what need have you of othersim not saying alts should be removed from the game they serve their purpose after all and not a single mmo save astro empires if that qualifies that i can think of doesnt have them other mmos generally dont suffer so badly from the inclusion of them howeverreally is taking a security hit for dealing with disreputable sorts even your own alts so bad its this kind of pathetic chicanery that makes eve suck in a lot of ways pirates scammers gankers and the rest all argue against anything that might make griefing or scamming result in any kind of consequence for them even the slightest of things like a hit to their security statuswhat do we get trolls flamers and the sort making stupid comments in threads like this that suggest the game should include anything that acts in opposition of them or their actionsbankrolling alts is completely irrelevent as far as im concerned the idea is to have consequencehow about rewardset up a system of floating rewards to players who maintain positive security status individuals who do not resort to piracy or assisting piracy or what would be considered illegal activities should get a secuity increase every downtime this should have meaning in the gamei fully support that high security status players should be able to attack and destroy ships of low security status players in highsec without concord response and with no penalty to their security status no gate or station gun response in high or low they are elevated individualsand why notplayers who transport contraband by concord standards rather than faction that should be scanned by any concord agent should receive a security status penalty they should not be concorded but should receive a concord imposed fine as well this can even affect individuals in lowsec 03 and higherhigh security status players should also be able to receive and use a customs module available from concord and scan vessels for contraband in even 00what fun content eve needs to stop being so onesided
holy crap a reasonable viewpoint you mean there could possibly be a better way to go about things then tons of random rules which are easily bypassed gaspfaintsand excuse me sir but did you call me a troll i was being serious kindamostly i cant help it that obvious bad ideas are so fun
this thread is full of halfbaked moldy tripe
lets say this passes the disincentive to mission is now somewhat higher vs the incentives some missioners give up some move to more remote areas to mission overall ninja looting still becomes more of a time sink and less profitable remember when the parasites become too numerous the host dies and if the parasites have no escape route they die as well
1 add ice belts too wormhole as grav site not a static one 2 add moon mining at a lesser value maybe not maybe 50per hour cycle or something involved in t3 modules or new t3 ships3 a way to share all scanned out site with corp or fleet4 please add some random stuff to wormhole in the fact of way of sansha in wormhole or something like that would be nicethese are my request plain and simple give us wormhole people some love we play the game too

thanks for being patient i know u go through this a lotagreed however there are other problems with plexes beyond their strategic placement and frequencythe fact that they can be run by wcs frigs is a joke and as much as they create interesting pockets of space they dont actually generate pvp encounters they are excellent filters for ship size althogh the filter is broken coz pirate frigs are counted as t1 but they dont actually act as magnets for pvp1 alt will be used everwhere instead of just somewhere the few actual people in play will all be nano dramiels as they can leave grid in 40s ok so also add a neut and webbing function that activates on any ships that get farther than 100km from the button the only option once you enter a plex is to run it down to zero to turn the towerbutton off if theres a five activation limit on the entry gate for each side then sending an alt into a plex to start the timer running will use up a slotthe channel broadcast can be made more like a page ie systems with current incursions page and broadcast can be fixed to only happen once the timer is running ie when someone enters plex and is locked in rather than when plex is revealed2 same as caerins idea and same fundamental flaw channel will become flooded as a single ship opens all plexes seen up to 28 in one system within secondsmoving it to separate channel will work for a few days until people wanting a fight close it permanently due to open plex  carebear that runs 95 of timeagreed broadcast to militia channel is rubbish ideabetter would be firstly to restrict the number of possible systems to frontline as suggested but also as mentioned above have a page showing contested systems with any plexs with timers running displayed clearly3 awesome frigates used can be purely speed fit and what ship are meant to fight can be all tankspank  dont even need a point  hmmmmmrats are in general fine just needs to be equalized so that 2 factions are not hilariously easy to avoid and their ewar is nerfedremovedfair enough as i said its a controversial idea and worth its own thread it seemed like an easy way of balancing it for now was simply to remove them but if you have ideas for balancing them im happy4 penalizing people for creating gangs in an mmo is neither here nor there will likely result in minmax dogma taking over and faction ships becoming the actual norm rather than just very frequentfaction ships should not be classified as t1 yes very truebut thats a seperate issuethe issue is whether or not to have the entry gate limit access to only fw participants and then only 5 from each sidei think there is real scope for sport in this idea and i know that some folks are gonna scream instance n im all like yeah so wot its a laugh innit d
making plexes guaranteed death traps auto webscamneut as you now propose to solve the alt problem would not make plexing more appealingedit to add further your solution does not even address the problem why would i not just make a bunch of trial account alts and have them sit in various plexes waiting for victims to show up so i can drop them with my faction frig and friendsif you are trying to design a system you need to think about how people will break that system especially with eveyour system is in addition to its other faults extremely breakable it is breakable to such an extent that not metagaming with trial account alts would become an untenable playstyle

i thought i should bring it to the stellar councils attention that parents who share their accounts with their young teens are been accused of using macros and being banned the way they figure it is if you play for too long it seems gm mehendri banned two of our households accounts for use of a macro which just is not true at all our houshold has 3 accounts in which two need to be monitored by adults so when the kids are asleep the adults play when the kids are awake and home from school they play up until nine then the adults take over that is not a macro that is a family playing eve not some shonky chinese isk farmer we are an australian family living in queensland besides one of the adults in our house is very very sick with chronic liver disease and has to stay in bed week after week and playing eve is all hes done since he started going down hill we would ask the stellar council to petition on our behalf since we will not be playing eve in our household anymore and i will be telling other parents how we got accused of cheating and threatened by other players with violence and greif weve decided its an aweful game and we have deleted the clients from our computers best of luck with it everyone
this is totally the right place for thisyou were probably banned for building walls in unauthorised places
enthralling parable amigo
even if this were the right place for this i can hardly agree that parents should be running an eve client 237 for them and their children in any case id have a hard time believing it as im sure would anybody at ccpwhy ask for a petition on your behalf and say you are quitting anyway this makes it even less believableanyway assuming you were really telling the truth whats to say your kids werent actually using macros and besides that and maybe you are actually making this all up whats to say you dont use macros you dont have to be an rmt to do thatyou want a petition prove your case mail ccp support some pictures of your family and home and tell them what happenedcheers
im looking forward to cq somewhat but not as a game changer however i dread that cq may be a game changer in causing problems with game play unintentionally a post in the general threads may get buried and unread by ccp but with the csm speaking and reiterating the need for quality we might see more of a response questions in my mind about cqs possible hangs include coding questions issues of lack of polish because this needs to meet deadline etc ultimately its a ceodecision maker thing which reverberates down the chains of command if the ceo deems quality to be important enough to allow deadlines to be reset if the product needs more testing then quality becomes more important to the organizationcsm has put forth the commitment to excellence in the past and i dont think its outdated
socut down on interregion conflict and promote bigger coalitions by stagnating the ability to invadebrilliant
dont forget making logistics hell
logistics should be hell though delete jump bridges and jump freighters i say that as one who personally owns a jump freighter i agree this proposal would result in further stagnation
why if logistics is hell there wont be anyone in 00 and that is bad
by stagnating the ability to invade far away regions you promote smaller coalitions by stagnating the ability to invade so regardless if far away or close by so unlike this proposal you promote smaller coalitionsso i dont see how this would promote bigger coalitions in any waypro tip anything that makes invading easier means you got a load more people wanting to invade you means you need more friends to defend since in eve sov warfare is simply bring as many as possible which means larger coalitions
you also stagnate the fun what is wrong with people having friends
you dont understand how 00 works at all do you
personally i had to fall to this scam 3 times before i broke it down and figured out how it workedfool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
oh yeah trolling how original
not that half the comments posted in this thread already havent been trolling anywayi started this most recent of my ventures moving to jita doing a bit of trading and mostly dropping out of game except for skill training with about 10 billion isk in my wallet currently that number is at 26 billion isk or so with 7 billion isk in market orders selling in their own time its a bit slow a new alliance which cost me about a billion isk to create an additional 500 million i sent to the individual who set it up for me and bumped my corp details and standings at my discretionanother 12 billion is invested in increasing my personal standings with the help of sozaitsca now strictly tsca which ended up with dnleviathan disbanding corp and absconding with a huge amount of isk in another scam despite which i am still contracted with tsca and not out the isk i also dropped another 150 million isk to the mission runner who had done my caldari standings to that point for sozai and may continue to do socount about a billion and a half or more in assets i dumped into the market having held previously and that puts me at somewhere around 115 billion isk with about 285 billion of that having been spent already on what may be considered legitimate purchases and donations as stated aboveall this despite having lost 38 billion isk to margin trading scamsits already been proven that an individual with an iq less than 70 can effectively perpetrate a scam and even an einstein can fall for onedont think for a moment that this bothers me or that your trolling will have any real lasting effect
you do know that once you train the skill to at least l1 you are unable to not use it dont you all orders of people that have the skill trained will have to be turned yellowalso people who tend to have more orders will have it trainedso you basically want to turn the majority of orders yellowhows that going to help anybody 
yeah i know that but am not really concerned about iteveryone will know that the orders are done with margin trading and almost everyone will be aware that a legitimate buy order is a legitimate buy order it really isnt hard to figure out an order isnt a scam whether it can be covered or notthis will also mean that after a short time players will cease to notice an order is yellow or green except in passing which will result in players falling for that scam anyway the difference is however it will prompt players to ask particularly new players and they may be forewarned as a resultand if that scam does pop up again for large quantities of isk with a green order maybe well get to take something from them i should know better than to think theyll take that risk though and i should have known better scammers dont put themselves in a position where they can actually lose anything not when they dont have to
the server doesnt like it
i think that security status system is not very effective to force the consequences for outlaws i was actualy thinking about becoming a pirate but that makes nearly no difference of being criminal or civil personproposal make security drops for attacking ships more dramatic and dependable on the systems security for example attacking a player in 10 space will drop your status to 5 attacking player in 01 system wil drop it only by 05 or so this will reflect the improved ability of concord to recognize criminals in the systems with better police coverage also will protect the player from wannabe suicide gankers sucurity status below 5 cannot be repaired by ratting i suggest criminals should pay fines to concord to redeem their crimes and take their sec status up over the 5 limit  players with 5 or lower sec status cannot buysell stuff in the high secexamplei will commit a suicide gank in the 10 system that will make me a criminal droping my sec status to 5 i will move to lowsec and spend some time pirating droping my sec status to 7 now i have decided to be a good guy again i have to pay fines to concord to get my sec status above 5 and then start running missions and ratting to rise it to 0edit posted on alt
first off why what are you hoping to achieve with thisnow what happens when someone has sell orders in highsec and hits 5 how much isk are you thinking there are plenty of ways to protect yourself from suicide ganks why is this one needed
this is not meant to protect against sucide ganking it is a way to make the game more challenging for the criminals security status affects nothing what people realy care about
want to try that again
punish the naughty reds punish moar nonconsensual pvp is evil must punish with abitrary mechanicsyou were thinking about becoming a pirate the obvious next step is moar punish 4 teh naughty reds rite adds game depth noadds increased functionalityfeature noremovesfixes something that needed it noadds needless complications for no functional purpose yesdo it no
then that means hes not afk so whats the problem why does it matter if hes not part of a fleet this is a sandbox not playdates online and since he cant kill u but u can kill him whats the problem ure the one getting worked up over nothing if ccp is saving them then by your logic ccp is also saving all of u because both r within game mechanics and yet u want to whine about it even though u clearly stated that it doesnt affect u at all so yes u r a carebear and a noob that wants concordlevel protection in 00 and so u expect that from your blob which goes back to htfutroll quote removed zymurgist
i support a probe that allows for probing cloaked ships on one condition local chat is put in delayed mode from all systems yes that includes high sec
you got yourself a deal here sir
who are you kiddingany combat ship can practically instapop most any cloaker thats why theyre cloakersnot supported
attach current isk sinks to upkeep costs of ihubs and yes anyone can put them up all of them are active at the same time but obviously only the best of them is used in determining a systems effective upgrades so no they wouldnt stack it also means you can cyno jam any system and throw a jump bridge up in any system and frankly thats the point null sec has always been painfully static because defense is too easy your control of a system should be based on your ability to actually defend it not artificially by stationary objects you anchor in space that do nothing but soak up ammo and place silly restrictions on what you can do with the systemi of course dont expect this to happen too many people like their ratting bots and manual anomaly farming which is made possible by a lack of serious conflict in null sec but that doesnt mean it isnt a good idea
this idea is bad and you should feel bad
hmm there seem to be a lot of games doing this now my argument is simple however whats to stop everybody from creating a plethora of combat missions with a good payout and flooding all available agents with them completely skewing the agentmission type that is what everyone will do or at least the ones interested in doing it will whats the point anyway there are plenty of missions out there though you might find running them ten to twelve times boring if you were me reality mission runners do the same missions consecutively without turning them in day by day until its turn them in or lose the standings and reward for them they get farmed whether they be angel extravaganza or another like mission your idea just means people will make somewhat different missions that produce the same rewards as missions like that heck the designer will even have the advantage of knowing everything about the mission what purpose besides another way to make isk and more missions that generate that revenue rather than the missions you dont like being in queuesorry cant really support this
obviously ccp would check missions before inserting it into the game all other mmos that implement player created missions do this why should eve be any differentits a common feature in mmos those days tested and proven to be both cheap and effective in many other games the risk factor that comes with innovations isnt there because its nothing new eve should keep up with the times theres no reason to get left behind supported you mean ccp will create new missions if players dont sure coming soon
what people might forget is that the csm has no real power if ccp says no its no and their is not a damm thing anybody can do about it beside leaving the game ofc
why are mummy and daddy arguing
