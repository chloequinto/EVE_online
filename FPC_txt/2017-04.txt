         so i've got a question, when
         did the narrative in regards to
         "earning a plex" change?back
         when i got started, i asked the
         very same question, and the
         answers i got where inevitably
         "it is possible to do, but it isn't
         easy, it will likely be a year or
         more before you have the skill
         and experience to do it in any
         reliable fashion. don't focus on
         that for now, just enjoy the
         game, learn to play, and before
         you know it you will be
         there"well i didn't take that
         advice, i was determined to
         plex my way to glory, and so i
         mined, and i missioned, and i
         built, and was so risk averse
         that the mere thought of low-
         sec made me feel sick. and i
         never did get that plex, and it
         burned me out, time and time
         again i would try, and time and
         again i failed.until eventually i
         did take the advice, and i
         started playing the game for
         the joy of the game, and i
         learned to stop fearing low-
         sec, and null-sec, and i started
         exploring wormholes, and
         having more fun than i ever did
         before, and yes i kept doing
         industry because i actually
         enjoyed it, and low and behold
         3 years on (with some large
         breaks in between) i looked at
         my wallet and saw i had
         enough to spare for a plex...
         but by then i didn't care
         anymore, i was more than
         happy to keep up my sub and
         use that isk for more fun
         activities.now, 7 years in, i
         have 8 characters plexed, and
         my main which i still keep on a
         subscription. and am enjoying
         the game more than ever, but
         the narrative seems to have
         changed. now when new
         players ask "how can i plex my
         account" they get bombarded
         with suggestions and ideas, far
         more than any new player
         could even make sense of.
         and the vast majority of those
         ideas, are frankly not feasible
         for someone brand new to the
         game.its not a matter of sp,
         but of player experience that
         makes most of the isk making
         methods effective, and if the
         newbros keep chasing that isk,
         they will never learn to love the
         game the way we have, which
         means they will just burn out
         and never gain that
         experience.maybe the solution
         is for us to go back to the way
         things where before, maybe
         we need to be a little bit less
         helpful, and more hands off,
         tell them to just enjoy the
         game and have fun with it for
         what it is, and worry about that
         fiddly isk and plex buisness
         later. with alpha accounts its
         even easier to do that than
         ever since real world finances
         aren't even as big a concern
         anymore.eve is about the
4/1/2017 journey, not the destination.
           as a rather new player myself,
           i'd argue that the downpour of
           support from veterans is what
           got me hooked on this game.
           it's been fun chatting with
           people about their
           experiences, reading blogs,
           and applying bits and pieces of
           what i see to my own game. i
           **** up a lot, and i've found
           some advice to be garbage the
           hard way, but i feel like i'm
           getting better at the game and
           enjoying it while i do. players
           obsessed with isk and plex will
           have a tough time regardless
           of how much support others
           give them, as you've pointed
           out - it's the players looking for
           a good time who you provide
           the most value to.i wouldn't
           give up on being a helpful
           bittervet just yet.
4/1/2017
         there is a difference in terms
         of support from veterans vs.
         ccp, imo. the former is
         interaction with another player,
         the latter is not. interaction
         between players is good in that
         it is likely what keeps players
         in the game.the plex narrative
         is largely bravo sierra in that
         no new player is going to
         buying a plex with isk (without
         at least selling a plex or two
         first--i.e. he could do that and
         then try to play in the plex
         market). appealing to "think of
         the new player" is a common
         basis for a plea for some
         change to the game some
         player wants....usually to their
4/1/2017 benefit.
         exactly, when i started, yeah
         there where people out there
         plexing their accounts, and
         even then it was a selling point
         that it was something you
         could do.but it was always
         promoted as something further
         down the road, almost end
         game content as it where. it
         was never promoted as
         something realistic for new
         players to work towards. but
         thats exactly what i see
         happening now, and sure,
         some people manage to
         accomplish it, but for most its
         just raising false expectations,
         which is bad for player
4/1/2017 retention in the long run.

          hi,i do like the new p scan
          system. there has been some
          good improvements to it.
          however there are some things
          that bothers me:1. when
          selecting a line in the
          signature window, the selected
          sig is highlighted. however all
          the other sigs still stays on the
          map making it difficult to find
          the one you want to scan in a
          short amount of time. would it
          be an idea to let the only sig
          you have selected be the only
          one visible on the map?2.
          when dragging the probes
          around the arial menu pops up
          all the time. this is incredibly
          annoying. would it be possible
          to make a switch to turn arial
          menu in solar system map on
          and off?3. ill make no fuzz
          about the new scanning
          sounds. i can live with that.
4/10/2017cricri amatin
          this topic was mentioned 6
          years ago. but nothing was
4/10/2017ever done.
          a massive thank you to
          everyone who voted for me, i
          truly appreciate it, and am
          sure that i will be able to do
          everyone proud during csm
          12. stay tuned for updates on
          exactly what will be happening
          on the communication front, as
          i'm looking to broach with other
          newly elected members to get
          their views on the matter and
          align ourselves in a proper
4/10/2017coordinated strategy.
          the problem is not
          overcrowding, the problem is
          that there is no enough sand
          in high sec to build
          sandcastles from in the
          sandbox. so people are forced
          to take their shovels and
          buckets and venture in to
          lowsec to get more sand
          where they actually end up not
          only not getting sand but
          losing their shovels buckets
          and carts along with the fun
          and excitement of the prospect
          pushed back to no sand
          highsec.yes i have. and every
          time it ends up with a fight.
          every time. as a newbie it
          always ended up with me
          dying. and for what? i mean
          there is not even a valid
          reason here. just a couple of
          days back some of my friends
          went to low sec, they were
         ganged within 5 minutes of
         being there. when asked why,
         the answer was "because its
         fun" their assailant being
         someone with hundreds of
         millions of sp, thousands of
         kills mainly just in that very
         system, my assessment is,
         that system is claimed by that
         person who spends their days
         not harvesting it or using its
         sand to build something but
         waiting for unsuspected
         newbies to come for that sand
         in order to just kill them in cold
         blood just like that because he
         can..and he finds that fun.
         killing ventures and frigates
         and mining barges with full t2
         and above ships and
         equipment. i analysed that
         persons victims etc, it was all
         just weaker targets.i am sorry
         but that is an awful waste of
         sand. how many players
         probably quit because of that
         very person who in reality may
         even be making enough from
         all the kills to be buying plex
         and not even actually giving
         any revenue to the game.
         funny how dystopias work both
         ways ;)i have teh right to give
         feedback as a player.
         ultimately, i will pack up and go
         to a better game that fits my
         idea of fun, but while i am
         here, i will give feedback. i am
         not expecting that this
         feedback will be listened to or
         that something will be done to
         address any concerns my
         friends and i may have with
         the fun of the game. however, i
         have been playing mmorpg';s
         for more time than eve itself
         exists and i do like to
         contribute with my feedback to
         the ongoing evolution and
         development of the games i
         play. i am not expecting that
         you agree with me. but do not
         think that your points are more
         valid than mine. you are but
         another player on equal
         standing as me. you are not
         better, you are just different
         with different likes and
         preferences.i find many people
         challenging me with this kind
         of approach "who are you to
         suggest such a thing", so
         arrogant and self-centered it is
         amazing. but i am not here to
         point fingers at any one
         person. i just share what i think
         is union in the game and what
         others and i think would make
         the game more fun from our
         perspective. and i think i have
         the right to do so as a player
         on equal footing as anyone
         else playing eve. the game's
         universe maybe a dystopia,
         but reality is not. and unless
         you come over and start
         paying for my omega accounts
         you cannot tell me to shut up
4/13/2017or tell me that it is hubris for
         me to has
         there   express   my feedback.
                      not been   many
          counter points worth replying
          to because the counter points
make assumptions and
provide false premises. my
suggestion for expanding high
sec is not about having more
space. i expressed in many
replies. it is about accessibility
to more content. the game is
boring in high sec, and those
who do not wish to engage in
pvp or be pked dont have
much choice really for more
fun.expanding highsec to
include more lower systems
will give access to people in
empire space to more content.
and i am talking about a total
experience here not just pve.i
do not wish to push people out
of their fun, if that is what you
think. this is not my type, i am
not a dystopian type player, a
criminal or a scoundrel. you
can keep all that to yourself if it
gives you fun.i am the
cooperative type of player, the
builder the organizer and
honorable type. you will not
see me attacking an
unsuspecting newbie, or
miner, explorer etc in low sec
nulsec or wh space. i find that
behavior cowardly and criminal
in nature. i will fight for two
reasons, in self defense or for
the defense of someone else.
soi would attack the coward
ganker and the criminal. i like
to pvp but also for a good
reason, not mindless slaughter
and certainly not for bragging
and all that bull i see on
youtube etc. we should be
applauding people who
courageously defended the
miner from the ganker. and the
place is full of videos of
gankers patting themselves for
having killed a victim who had
no chance to fight back in the
first place thinking that they
just accomplished something
great. it is dumbfounding to
watch... i best most are wow
rejects..who came here to
"gank" and brag about it...
*rolls eyes*..anyways.having
said that. yes i am very open
to consider alternative to make
the experience in high sec
richer than it is. and while i
may have a hard time
justifying lowsec, since i find it
is filled up with cowards,
criminals and scoundrels in
game, i have to consider these
people also as players and as
such i am not better than them
either and they have the right
to their fun too.if lowsec is
your fun by all means keep it.
but then if high sec becomes
richer in terms of game
experience do not come
complaining that no more
victims come to low sec to be
ganked. right? i would expect
you would have no issue with
high sec having same access
to mineral resources and
missions and opportunities as
low sec, the only difference
being security coverage.you
         are claiming the right to exist
         within what you consider fun.
         but in that case you must at
         least recognize also the same
         right of others even if their
         view of what is fun is different
         than yours. does that sound
         sensible and fair?i understand
         this as expressed above. so
         the alternate approach is to
         leave lowsec untouched and
         make high sec much better in
         such a way so that it doe snot
         feel constrained and limited
         and boring. see, many people
         in low sec say that they do not
         like to play the game in nulsec,
         because large alliances and
         fleet stuff is not their thing, but
         then go and demand that high
         sec players should not have
         rights to fun and should
         adhere to the established
         order..their order in reality.and
         that is unfair, don't you think?
         you do not like it when i
         suggest that you should be
         pushed to nullsec, because
         you do not like to adhere to
         that established order. now
         you probably understand how
         high sec players may feel too
         in turn, when low sec come
         and start spewing about, "live
         with it", "it is a dystopia", "no
         safety" ", deal" etc,..from my
         perspective here it looks like
         low sec players are demanding
         from high sec players to deal
         with it, but then are crying
         themselves when expected to
         deal with it in turn. it cannot
         work like that.and this is what
         ccp needs to finally realise. the
         game attracts many kinds of
         players, it has to offer a niche
         of many different kinds of play
         styles which are not affected
         directly by the others, but
         remain open and are not
         insular as to permit players to
         jump from one another as they
         evolve or their preferences
         and likes change within
         eve.the days where you force
         everyone in to one way of
         playing should come to an
4/13/2017end.
          there is plenty of sand in
          highsec. there are vast
          swathes of space that are
          empty and full of resources for
          you to mold into whatever it is
          you want to build. the sand in
          lowsec is essentially the same,
          with some looser rules on who
          can smash each others'
          sandcastles. why should you
          get to take their near identical
          sand, and kick them out of the
          sandbox just because you
          don't like such rough
          sandcastle play?what you are
          looking for is new types of
          sand, or perhaps more toys
          that work in your section of the
          sandbox. and it looks like you
          are getting it with an empire-
          focussed expansion that is
          coming our way next winter.
          will it make you happy? i have
          my doubts but ccp has
pledged to give the players
what some of them say they
want. at least though, they are
not doing it by wholesale
demolition of large sections of
the game like you asked for.
please tell me how many quit -
i'd love to see your numbers.
because, about 10% of the
player activity takes place in
lowsec. that is thousands,
actually tens of thousands of
players who pay their
subscription each month so
they can build, fight, and
gather stuff in lowsec. there is
your hubris again. how do you
have the right to tell these
fellow paying customers that
what they like is a "waste of
sand"? i get it, it isn't your
thing but you have to be so
blindingly self-centred to think
what you like is what everyone
else is looking for in their
video game. of course you can
give your feedback, but i am
equally allowed to give mine
and call you out for what you
are: someone who is trying to
gut the competitive aspects of
the game that brought and
keep me here and transform it
into something else they want
it to be. what you are doing is
equivalent to walking into a
restaurant or say tennis club
that has been operating for 15
years and telling them they are
doing it wrong. it's one thing to
suggest that they add a
particular dish to the menu or
repaint the clubhouse, while it
is something completely
different to demand that the
chef stop cooking meat dishes
because you don't like the
smell, or for the tennis club to
demolish a third of their tennis
courts and put in bowling
alleys because you actually
prefer bowling over tennis. one
is giving feedback and ideas
for added value to the place,
while the other is asking for
fundamental changes that
negatively impact the current
customers/members. but yes,
feel free to tell ccp their long-
lived and profitable sandbox
mmo is doing it wrong as is
your right. however, don't be
surprised to be ignored just
like a decade-and-a-half of
similar agitators who have
begged, pleaded, argued,
threatened, and yelled in these
forums trying unsuccessfully to
get ccp to throw out their
vision of a full-time pvp
sandbox game and virtual
universe and turn it into
something else. further, don't
think you won't also draw the
ire of the players who do love
this game as it is and who
don't appreciate selfish players
asking for the current game
play to be removed, because
you will draw ire and will
continue to do so until you
figure out that eve isn't going
         to change for you and move
         on to another game that is
         more compatible for what you
4/13/2017are looking for.
         eve is a sandbox game unlike
         wow which you reference
         earlier. as such it is totally
         valid to play the
         <U+FFFD>criminal and
         scoundrel<U+FFFD>. and
         calling players cowards makes
         you an ass, btw, if not an
         *******. these are completely
         acceptable and intended by
         ccp. further, the greater
         danger of ls is due in part
         because ls has better
         resources than ns. granted
         you can just go and obtain
         those resources solo,
         you<U+FFFD>ll need effort
         and teamwork to take
         advantage of what ls has to
         offer.yes, i would have an
         issue. you should not have
         access to those kinds of
         resources with the current
         levels of protection you enjoy
         in hs. it would have an
         unbalancing effect on the
         game imo. you seem to be
         unaware that the economy is a
         significant means by which
         players interact. yes it is pretty
         anonymous, but that is a
         feature not a bug. do you
         know who built those t2 strip
         miners? do you know who ran
         the moon mining operation
         that provided the moon goo
         used in the the t2
         components? do you know
         who did the pi work that went
         into the fuel blocks? i am
         going to guess that for most if
         not all of those the answer is,
         <U+FFFD>no.<U+FFFD> the
         eve economy is a ginormous
         mass of player interacting with
         each other providing each
         other with what they want and
         need to play the game. letting
         a section of the game
         suddenly become more
         productive without a
         commensurate increase in the
         risk would mean that people
         would flock there to enjoy the
         greater rewards and lowered
         risks.you want those
         things<U+FFFD>.ls is
         thataway =>no, you have this
         one wrong. you are free to do
         what you want and hopefully
         that is what you consider fun.
         however you do not have the
         right to avoid player-on-player
         interaction. nobody has that.
         you can try to avoid player-on-
         player interaction if you want,
         but you cannot avoid it by
         intervention of ccp. if you do
         not like this, there<U+FFFD>s
         the door.hs does not need to
         be buffed. if you want to get
         more out life in hs figure out
         how to do that. that is your job.
         figure out how to bring in pilots
         to your corporation/alliance,
         figure out how to make playing
         with these players more
         rewarding and interesting. do
         not go to ccp and say,
         <U+FFFD>i want to stay in the
         safest part of the game, have
         access to resources and isk
         making opportunities like the
         more contested parts of the
         game, oh and make it fun too.
         <U+FFFD> go read about this
         being a sandbox game. that
         last bit,
         <U+FFFD>fun<U+FFFD>, that
         is up to you.as for fun, see the
         above about player-on-player
         interaction, nobody is saying
         you don<U+FFFD>t have the
         right to try and have fun in the
         game, just that you cannot
         shield yourself from what other
         players may want to do to you.
         most of us find this creates an
         interesting, challenging and
         dynamic game environment
         where we can compete with
         others and also cooperate.and
         no it is not unfair if somebody
         says, <U+FFFD>it is a
         dystopia, no safety, live with it,
         etc.<U+FFFD> that is what it
         means to play in a sandbox
         game. deal with what? ccp
         intervention on your behalf?
         yeah, that<U+FFFD>s just
         wrong. see if a player comes
         along and <U+FFFD>ruins the
         game<U+FFFD> you have the
         option to <U+FFFD>ruin
         his<U+FFFD>. but with ccp
4/14/2017that option is gone.
          this is a joke right? there more
          sand in hs than anywhere else
          in the game if by that you
          mean various resources. you
          can buy just about anything in
          game in hs, except for
          perhaps collector<U+FFFD>s
          items. since all the major trade
          hubs are in hs and every ns
          alliance needs those hubs to
          sell the resources they
          acquired but do not need and
          buy those resource they do
          need. go have a look at the
          economic reports ccp quant
          puts out. huge amounts of stuff
          moves in and out of the forge
          alone. i did a back of the
          envelope calculation and the rl
          value for one month was $33
          million (yes, $33 million real
          u.s. dollars). do there is no
          need to take your shovels
          anywhere, imo. you just need
          to find a way to get enough isk
          to purchase what you
          need<U+FFFD>.and there are
          plenty of ways to make isk in
          hs.and there are ways to take
          advantage of ls without dying
          every single time. i routinely
          do invention in ls because the
          manufacturing costs are lower
          in ls stations. you just have
          figure out how to minimize
          your risk. one way to do that is
          group up.then you are doing
          something wrong. i used to do
          pi in ls, never had an issue. i
          do invention in ls, i lost one
          ship out in dozens of trips (not
          counting cyno ships). heck
          even my cyno ships are rarely
          attacked.and your friends who
         went to ls...did they have voice
         comms? were they in fleet?
         did they have a scout in a
         ceptor or a cloaky? did their
         ship types make sense or
         were they kitchen sinking it?
         and please sp is not nearly the
         factor that many make it out. i
         have over 147 million sp, but
         when i<U+FFFD>m in a
         thorax all my sp for large guns
         of all racial types are useless.
         my sp for both minmatar and
         gallente dreads are useless,
         the sp for gallente and amarr
         carriers...useless. the sp for
         hacs, recons, ceptors, dictors,
         and bombers are all
         useless.this is wrong on a
         number of fronts. if the people
         <U+FFFD>claiming<U+FFFD>
         that ls system are using it as
         they see fit that is not a waste
         of sand...it is what was fully
         intended by the game
         developers. it is up to you to
         go in there and take it from
         them or negotiate access. as
         for plex you are absolutely and
         totally wrong. every plex in
         game has gotten there by
         somebody giving ccp money.
         more money than a
         subscription. so if a ls player is
         making enough isk to plex his
         account ccp is not only getting
         their revenue, but more than a
         subscription. and you do know
         that ccp<U+FFFD>s own
         analysis has shown that
         combat tends to be good for
         new player retention right?
         okay, but i can also comment
         on your
         feedback<U+FFFD>.like you
         don<U+FFFD>t understand
         the nature of the game. that
         you think you have a right to
         play the game and avoid
         player-on-player interaction
         when it suits you. that game is
         not eve. never has been and
         hopefully never will be. if i
         accept the consequences of
         flying up to your ship and
         shooting you in the
         face...working as the
         developers have intended.
         either get used to that or as
         you indicated go find a game
         that is more suited to how you
4/14/2017want to play.
         my suggestion: optional chat
         beeps, like turning on/off blink
         for chat, a small, morse code-
         like 'dit' sound when a
         message appears in chat
         optional sound effect when
         someone enters local - i
         realise this may actually be
         game changing in some way,
         however my justifications are
         below. my justifications:my
         situation is quite unique, since
         i am visually impaired (blind in
         left eye, severely impaired
         right eye). i get by with my own
         accessibility features and
         adjustments i make, however, i
         can only see a portion of the
         screen at any given time, for
         example, when i look at the
hud (health etc) that is all i can
see, or looking at hte
overview, i can only see x
amount of lines of the overview
due to using a magnification
program that blows up a
portion of the screen to
fullscreen.because of this, i
miss the following:- duel
invites, fleet invites,
conversation invites - i often
have to ask my fc to invite me
several time sbefore i can
reach the fleet invite window in
time before the timeout.- i miss
chat, although chat isn't
entirely crucial to the game,
fleet chat is, and it would be
useful to hear when a
message appears - i realise
that many players would hate
the game beeping all over hte
place, so i suggested it so that
you can turn it on/off like you
can right-click a chat tab and
turn blink on/off - and have it
off by default - can you
imagine jita, so i empathise
with others why this would be
incredibly annoying.there are
other ui elements that could
benefit from a small
notification sound, but these 2
in particular are of particular
interest to mje.as i mentioend
before, i get by with my
accessibility products, if i could
somehow script the ui with my
accessibility product, then i
wouldn't be here, however
games just don't work well with
accesibility products and can't
be scripted like other programs
- and please don't confuse an
accessibility script with a
mod/bot script. it is completely
different. how an accessibility
script works is by the mangifier
or other program 'scanning'
the screen like obs/xsplit does
to record and doesn't actually
interact witht eh game itself,
and when a certain portion of
the screen is
activated/moved/other means
of detection, then the
accessibility product would
zoom in there or make a
sound or something - so it
actually has no actual code
injection or anything to interact
with the game itself.although i
promote accessibility, i am not
one of those that ask the
impossible, i wouldn't ask ccp
to make an api to work with
accessibility software, though if
they did, i'd be one of the first
to liaise with them to make it
fair and not give dissabled
players any kind of advantage
over 'normal players'. if you
understand how a headmouse
works, you understand what i
mean by scripting accessibility
software to detect changes. it
works similarly to a light gun
back on the old consoles -
except purely in software.i look
forward to seeing what people
think of this suggestion, as i'm
sure some players wouldn't
         mind this feature despite being
         able to see the whole screen.
         (normally, i use the 3rd party
         warp audio volume to let me
         know if anybody has warped
         in, however this is bound to
         grid, and not by local entirely,
         so although this is useful, it's
4/15/2017not a full view)
         good day! every time i choose
         clothes or shoes for your
         character, ask the same
         question: when will the
         helmet? ... i've seen some,
         well, avatars are terrible ))) yes
         , i understand, you failed to
         have cosmetic surgery as
         necessary ))). i myself suffered
         for a long time, what
         happened, what happened
         ...support the idea of bringing
         a variety of helmets, half
         closed, closed and not only
         ...give the helmet to
4/18/2017capsuleers!
         ok, i know this subject has
         arisen countless times before
         and that alone should
         emphasize that this is a
         problem to the game. i notice
         that the habit of "cloaky
         camping" is one of the biggest
         s i have encountered. case in
         point is the system rnf-yh. this
         was formerly a very active
         ratting system. consequently
         there were frequent roaming
         gangs attracted to the area
         and we had many enjoyable
         fights. since one cloaky
         camper has moved in, the
         system has essentially
         become deserted and the
         volume of available content
         has sharply decreased on a
         day to day level. now i have no
         issues with the actual campers
         provided they are actually
         active (hell, i sometimes cloaky
         camp too). but in many cases
         it is obvious the individual logs
         on first thing in the morning
         and then goes to work or
         whatever, leaving his account
         running afk. this just sucks. it
         only serves to deny content to
         others and detracts from
         gameplay in every way.i will
         highlight here that my own
         corp has lost players to other
         games directly due to this
         practice. while it might be easy
         to just say "htfu, this is eve" do
         we really need that attitude
         when we are already facing
         declining subscribers?
         therefore i would suggest a
         simple fix in that cloaks are
         altered to cycle like many other
         modules, but say a 30 minute
         cycle time, and then must be
         reactivated manually with no
         autocycle function available
         but can be deactivated
         manually and instantly to drop
         cloak. this will still allow
         camping but ensures the
         camper is actually present!
         otherwise his ship will decloak
         allowing him to be scanned
         down. a simple solution that
         will serve to create content as
         opposed to destroying it.just a
4/26/2017thought.cheersulf
         yes, yes we do. i know it
         seems like it would be a good
         idea for ccp to make you safer,
         and your ratting/mining more
         lucrative, and thus you richer,
         but it is the exact opposite of
         what makes eve an interesting
         and worthwhile game. if
         everyone is safe and only
         subject to consensual pvp, and
         has more resources than they
         can use due to 100% safe
         resource generation in nullsec,
         then not only does ship-loss
         not matter, anything you do
         has no meaning. it's not even
         a competitive game at that
         point, but just a exercise
         gathering useless stuff. there
         would be no meaningful
         content to be had, nor would
         the game be very interesting if
         everyone can fly and lose the
            most expensive ships without
            a second thought. it would be
            like the strangely lifeless
            version of eve you find on the
            test server - it's still eve but
            without perma-loss and assets
            with value, it is just a pretty,
            but not very compelling
            experience. cloaky camping is
            the only counter to the 100%
            safety afforded by local. i'll
            agree it can pretty frustrating,
            but without it you can always
            warp to safety before a hostile
            can get on grid to interact with
            you. nullsec is suppose to be
            the most rewarding, yet most
            dangerous space there is, but
            when local serves as such a
            powerful source of safety, it is
            pretty hard to say that it is
            succeeding at that with a
            straight face. cloaky camping
            is literally the only risk to your
            income generation, and with
            the current record levels of isk
            flooding into the game from
            nullsec bounties, the last thing
            we need to do is remove that
            only risk for operating in
            nullsec.i hope the long-term
            plan is still to release
            observatory arrays and nerf
            local and allow that free intel to
            be clawed back a bit with
            some vulnerable
            infrastructure. then, i think it
            would possible to add a direct
            counter to cloaky camping
            while still keeping some risk in
            nullsec. until then though, i see
            little chance of ccp deciding
            that nullsec needs to be even
            safer by nerfing cloaky
            camping, and even if they did
            it wouldn't be by hamstringing
            the usefulness of cloaking
            devices which are central to
            much other gameplay,
            especially in wormholes. there
            are counters to aggressors
            that don't involve fleeing to a
            station or safe spot every time
            a non-blue enters local.
            perhaps you should consider
            getting your corp to invest
            some time in them instead of
            watching all your corpmates
            drift off to other games
            because you are all too scared
            to put anything at risk and
            succumb to a self-induced and
            terminal case of boredom.if
            anything, new eden is suffering
            from a lack of conflict drivers
            and a glut of resources. we
            need to be more at risk to each
            other and resources more
            scarce if there are to be
            reasons to fight with each
            other and use all these tools of
            war we keep accumulating
            month after month. we
            definitely do not need more
            safety anywhere, but
            especially not in highsec and
            nullsec both of which are too
            safe for the amount of
            resources they generate by
            far.

         i<U+FFFD>m not here to
         request a buff to low sec
         mining, or provide suggestions
         to fix them. i<U+FFFD>m just
         stating some of the current
         issues i see with lowsec
         mining, at least before they
         add the new moon mining
         refineries (which may or may
         not help).issues:mining in low
         sec isn<U+FFFD>t as
         dangerous as most people
         think. as long as you stay
         aligned (higgs anchor rigs
         help!) and warp out whenever
         a neutral or red enters belt you
         will be pretty untouchable
         unless the enemy ships have
         fast locking.ores are also on
         paper more valuable than high
         sec ores. so why
         isn<U+FFFD>t it profitable?
         well compared to highsec and
         nullsec mining, you are likely to
         be off grid more often when
         mining in low sec. you will be
         warping from belts a lot more
         often from enemy players than
         in high sec (occasional
         ganker) or null sec (occasional
         reds in system, plus you also
         have intel channels).so the
         reason why mining in lowsec
         isn<U+FFFD>t profitable is
         because the the isk per time in
         belt isn<U+FFFD>t good
         enough than the
         alternatives.the market
         isn<U+FFFD>t great for
         buying ores from miners
         (because no one is mining)
         and hauling in and out of
         lowsec isn<U+FFFD>t worth
         the risk (better to mine the
         ores in an anomaly
         elsewhere).no reason to
         protect miners (because not
         profitable enough, and miners
         not unlike other eve players
         are selfish and probably
         won<U+FFFD>t share the
         gained profit of more valuable
         ores). players can do more
         valuable and fun activities than
         babysitting miners.hopefully
         this will be considered when
         the csm works on stuff
         involving mining and industry
         in lowsec.tl;dr points: time
         spent in belt isn't worth it local
         market incentive not there no
         reason to protect miners [my
4/26/2017suggestion]
            teckos pech , i agree with the
            other points, howeveri think
            you can not conclude from
            winning your first pvp
            encounter towards low sec
            experience.entering the wrong
            low sec system you get a fight.
            on others you can stay all
            days and not have one issue
            for days.it realy depends. there
            is so much to learn about how
            to work in low sec that it is
            intimidating for a lot of
            people.especially because
            these things are not obvious.
            and you can not take your
            experience for granted.you
            have to stay allert in low
            sec.best is to learn from
            experienced people. the
            current information out there
            do not teach how to behave in
            low sec. to learn this you need
            to invest and loose some
            ships.low sec is in my opinion
            after wormholes the most
            dangerous space. then follows
            0.0 and high sec.on 0.0 space
            a system can be more secure
            then high sec, or less secure.
            so i also disagree with the risk
            2 reward balancing in this.
            however 0.0 security is work
            while the security in high sec
            is for free.however keep in
            mind that security in eve is
            always a dynamical thing. and
            not to be taken granted.so fly
            save!aischa

         i was referring to ccp's
         analysis of players less than
         15 days of age who were
         ganked in hs. the end results
         were that those who were
         ganked stayed the longest,
         those killed legally (war dec,
         dual, etc.) stayed almost as
         long and those who were
         never killed in their first 15
         days stayed the least amount
         of time.i'm not saying gank all
         the newbies, but that shielding
         them from it won't help with
         retaining players. here is he
4/30/2017presentation.
         i know the presentation.
         again.look at what was looked
         at:players 15 days
         old.probably new player and
         not alts.focus was ganking.
         <1% was gangked15% was
         killed leagalythe rest was not
         killed at all.i'd say you can not
         generalize this research.in
         general what you can say is
         that harasment is not a
         problem in eve.you can not
         say that pvp is not an issue for
         new players. i men that in the
         sense of knowledge. i
         personally assume that a lot of
         people (look carebears) have
         issues with combat.i do not
         mean this negative, more
         constructive.there is a huge
         difference between getting
         ganked, getting into a high sec
         war and travell through low
         sec.and this is imho something
         were your example does not
         match what you want to say.all
4/30/2017the bestaischa
         really, it is interesting you left
         out the conclusions about
         player retention. those who
         engaged in combat in their
         first 15 days stayed the
         longest.eve is a boring game
         really. what makes it
         interesting is the player-on-
4/30/2017player interaction.
         1) if it is "very obvious" that
         they are just logging in then
         going to work, then why
         should it disrupt anything?
         they are at work after all.2)
         your suggestion has been
         made hundreds of times
         before, and its just as bad now
         as the first hundred times its
         been made.3) there is a
         dedicated thread to post your
         cloaky camping whines... i
4/30/2017mean suggestions.
         you already have a helmet, it
         just happens to be a full body
         one. fly through a gate camp
4/30/2017to see it.
