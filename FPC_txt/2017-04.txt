         so ive got a question when
         did the narrative in regards to
         earning a plex changeback
         when i got started i asked the
         very same question and the
         answers i got where inevitably
         it is possible to do but it isnt
         easy it will likely be a year or
         more before you have the skill
         and experience to do it in any
         reliable fashion dont focus on
         that for now just enjoy the
         game learn to play and before
         you know it you will be
         therewell i didnt take that
         advice i was determined to
         plex my way to glory and so i
         mined and i missioned and i
         built and was so risk averse
         that the mere thought of low
         sec made me feel sick and i
         never did get that plex and it
         burned me out time and time
         again i would try and time and
         again i faileduntil eventually i
         did take the advice and i
         started playing the game for
         the joy of the game and i
         learned to stop fearing low
         sec and nullsec and i started
         exploring wormholes and
         having more fun than i ever did
         before and yes i kept doing
         industry because i actually
         enjoyed it and low and behold
         3 years on with some large
         breaks in between i looked at
         my wallet and saw i had
         enough to spare for a plex
         but by then i didnt care
         anymore i was more than
         happy to keep up my sub and
         use that isk for more fun
         activitiesnow 7 years in i
         have 8 characters plexed and
         my main which i still keep on a
         subscription and am enjoying
         the game more than ever but
         the narrative seems to have
         changed now when new
         players ask how can i plex my
         account they get bombarded
         with suggestions and ideas far
         more than any new player
         could even make sense of
         and the vast majority of those
         ideas are frankly not feasible
         for someone brand new to the
         gameits not a matter of sp
         but of player experience that
         makes most of the isk making
         methods effective and if the
         newbros keep chasing that isk
         they will never learn to love the
         game the way we have which
         means they will just burn out
         and never gain that
         experiencemaybe the solution
         is for us to go back to the way
         things where before maybe
         we need to be a little bit less
         helpful and more hands off
         tell them to just enjoy the
         game and have fun with it for
         what it is and worry about that
         fiddly isk and plex buisness
         later with alpha accounts its
         even easier to do that than
         ever since real world finances
         arent even as big a concern
         anymoreeve is about the
412017 journey not the destination
           as a rather new player myself
           id argue that the downpour of
           support from veterans is what
           got me hooked on this game
           its been fun chatting with
           people about their
           experiences reading blogs
           and applying bits and pieces of
           what i see to my own game i
            up a lot and ive found
           some advice to be garbage the
           hard way but i feel like im
           getting better at the game and
           enjoying it while i do players
           obsessed with isk and plex will
           have a tough time regardless
           of how much support others
           give them as youve pointed
           out  its the players looking for
           a good time who you provide
           the most value toi wouldnt
           give up on being a helpful
           bittervet just yet
412017
         there is a difference in terms
         of support from veterans vs
         ccp imo the former is
         interaction with another player
         the latter is not interaction
         between players is good in that
         it is likely what keeps players
         in the gamethe plex narrative
         is largely bravo sierra in that
         no new player is going to
         buying a plex with isk without
         at least selling a plex or two
         firstie he could do that and
         then try to play in the plex
         market appealing to think of
         the new player is a common
         basis for a plea for some
         change to the game some
         player wantsusually to their
412017 benefit
         exactly when i started yeah
         there where people out there
         plexing their accounts and
         even then it was a selling point
         that it was something you
         could dobut it was always
         promoted as something further
         down the road almost end
         game content as it where it
         was never promoted as
         something realistic for new
         players to work towards but
         thats exactly what i see
         happening now and sure
         some people manage to
         accomplish it but for most its
         just raising false expectations
         which is bad for player
412017 retention in the long run

          hii do like the new p scan
          system there has been some
          good improvements to it
          however there are some things
          that bothers me1 when
          selecting a line in the
          signature window the selected
          sig is highlighted however all
          the other sigs still stays on the
          map making it difficult to find
          the one you want to scan in a
          short amount of time would it
          be an idea to let the only sig
          you have selected be the only
          one visible on the map2
          when dragging the probes
          around the arial menu pops up
          all the time this is incredibly
          annoying would it be possible
          to make a switch to turn arial
          menu in solar system map on
          and off3 ill make no fuzz
          about the new scanning
          sounds i can live with that
4102017cricri amatin
          this topic was mentioned 6
          years ago but nothing was
4102017ever done
          a massive thank you to
          everyone who voted for me i
          truly appreciate it and am
          sure that i will be able to do
          everyone proud during csm
          12 stay tuned for updates on
          exactly what will be happening
          on the communication front as
          im looking to broach with other
          newly elected members to get
          their views on the matter and
          align ourselves in a proper
4102017coordinated strategy
          the problem is not
          overcrowding the problem is
          that there is no enough sand
          in high sec to build
          sandcastles from in the
          sandbox so people are forced
          to take their shovels and
          buckets and venture in to
          lowsec to get more sand
          where they actually end up not
          only not getting sand but
          losing their shovels buckets
          and carts along with the fun
          and excitement of the prospect
          pushed back to no sand
          highsecyes i have and every
          time it ends up with a fight
          every time as a newbie it
          always ended up with me
          dying and for what i mean
          there is not even a valid
          reason here just a couple of
          days back some of my friends
          went to low sec they were
         ganged within 5 minutes of
         being there when asked why
         the answer was because its
         fun their assailant being
         someone with hundreds of
         millions of sp thousands of
         kills mainly just in that very
         system my assessment is
         that system is claimed by that
         person who spends their days
         not harvesting it or using its
         sand to build something but
         waiting for unsuspected
         newbies to come for that sand
         in order to just kill them in cold
         blood just like that because he
         canand he finds that fun
         killing ventures and frigates
         and mining barges with full t2
         and above ships and
         equipment i analysed that
         persons victims etc it was all
         just weaker targetsi am sorry
         but that is an awful waste of
         sand how many players
         probably quit because of that
         very person who in reality may
         even be making enough from
         all the kills to be buying plex
         and not even actually giving
         any revenue to the game
         funny how dystopias work both
         ways i have teh right to give
         feedback as a player
         ultimately i will pack up and go
         to a better game that fits my
         idea of fun but while i am
         here i will give feedback i am
         not expecting that this
         feedback will be listened to or
         that something will be done to
         address any concerns my
         friends and i may have with
         the fun of the game however i
         have been playing mmorpgs
         for more time than eve itself
         exists and i do like to
         contribute with my feedback to
         the ongoing evolution and
         development of the games i
         play i am not expecting that
         you agree with me but do not
         think that your points are more
         valid than mine you are but
         another player on equal
         standing as me you are not
         better you are just different
         with different likes and
         preferencesi find many people
         challenging me with this kind
         of approach who are you to
         suggest such a thing so
         arrogant and selfcentered it is
         amazing but i am not here to
         point fingers at any one
         person i just share what i think
         is union in the game and what
         others and i think would make
         the game more fun from our
         perspective and i think i have
         the right to do so as a player
         on equal footing as anyone
         else playing eve the games
         universe maybe a dystopia
         but reality is not and unless
         you come over and start
         paying for my omega accounts
         you cannot tell me to shut up
4132017or tell me that it is hubris for
         me to has
         there   express   my feedback
                      not been   many
          counter points worth replying
          to because the counter points
make assumptions and
provide false premises my
suggestion for expanding high
sec is not about having more
space i expressed in many
replies it is about accessibility
to more content the game is
boring in high sec and those
who do not wish to engage in
pvp or be pked dont have
much choice really for more
funexpanding highsec to
include more lower systems
will give access to people in
empire space to more content
and i am talking about a total
experience here not just pvei
do not wish to push people out
of their fun if that is what you
think this is not my type i am
not a dystopian type player a
criminal or a scoundrel you
can keep all that to yourself if it
gives you funi am the
cooperative type of player the
builder the organizer and
honorable type you will not
see me attacking an
unsuspecting newbie or
miner explorer etc in low sec
nulsec or wh space i find that
behavior cowardly and criminal
in nature i will fight for two
reasons in self defense or for
the defense of someone else
soi would attack the coward
ganker and the criminal i like
to pvp but also for a good
reason not mindless slaughter
and certainly not for bragging
and all that bull i see on
youtube etc we should be
applauding people who
courageously defended the
miner from the ganker and the
place is full of videos of
gankers patting themselves for
having killed a victim who had
no chance to fight back in the
first place thinking that they
just accomplished something
great it is dumbfounding to
watch i best most are wow
rejectswho came here to
gank and brag about it
rolls eyesanywayshaving
said that yes i am very open
to consider alternative to make
the experience in high sec
richer than it is and while i
may have a hard time
justifying lowsec since i find it
is filled up with cowards
criminals and scoundrels in
game i have to consider these
people also as players and as
such i am not better than them
either and they have the right
to their fun tooif lowsec is
your fun by all means keep it
but then if high sec becomes
richer in terms of game
experience do not come
complaining that no more
victims come to low sec to be
ganked right i would expect
you would have no issue with
high sec having same access
to mineral resources and
missions and opportunities as
low sec the only difference
being security coverageyou
         are claiming the right to exist
         within what you consider fun
         but in that case you must at
         least recognize also the same
         right of others even if their
         view of what is fun is different
         than yours does that sound
         sensible and fairi understand
         this as expressed above so
         the alternate approach is to
         leave lowsec untouched and
         make high sec much better in
         such a way so that it doe snot
         feel constrained and limited
         and boring see many people
         in low sec say that they do not
         like to play the game in nulsec
         because large alliances and
         fleet stuff is not their thing but
         then go and demand that high
         sec players should not have
         rights to fun and should
         adhere to the established
         ordertheir order in realityand
         that is unfair dont you think
         you do not like it when i
         suggest that you should be
         pushed to nullsec because
         you do not like to adhere to
         that established order now
         you probably understand how
         high sec players may feel too
         in turn when low sec come
         and start spewing about live
         with it it is a dystopia no
         safety  deal etcfrom my
         perspective here it looks like
         low sec players are demanding
         from high sec players to deal
         with it but then are crying
         themselves when expected to
         deal with it in turn it cannot
         work like thatand this is what
         ccp needs to finally realise the
         game attracts many kinds of
         players it has to offer a niche
         of many different kinds of play
         styles which are not affected
         directly by the others but
         remain open and are not
         insular as to permit players to
         jump from one another as they
         evolve or their preferences
         and likes change within
         evethe days where you force
         everyone in to one way of
         playing should come to an
4132017end
          there is plenty of sand in
          highsec there are vast
          swathes of space that are
          empty and full of resources for
          you to mold into whatever it is
          you want to build the sand in
          lowsec is essentially the same
          with some looser rules on who
          can smash each others
          sandcastles why should you
          get to take their near identical
          sand and kick them out of the
          sandbox just because you
          dont like such rough
          sandcastle playwhat you are
          looking for is new types of
          sand or perhaps more toys
          that work in your section of the
          sandbox and it looks like you
          are getting it with an empire
          focussed expansion that is
          coming our way next winter
          will it make you happy i have
          my doubts but ccp has
pledged to give the players
what some of them say they
want at least though they are
not doing it by wholesale
demolition of large sections of
the game like you asked for
please tell me how many quit 
id love to see your numbers
because about 10 of the
player activity takes place in
lowsec that is thousands
actually tens of thousands of
players who pay their
subscription each month so
they can build fight and
gather stuff in lowsec there is
your hubris again how do you
have the right to tell these
fellow paying customers that
what they like is a waste of
sand i get it it isnt your
thing but you have to be so
blindingly selfcentred to think
what you like is what everyone
else is looking for in their
video game of course you can
give your feedback but i am
equally allowed to give mine
and call you out for what you
are someone who is trying to
gut the competitive aspects of
the game that brought and
keep me here and transform it
into something else they want
it to be what you are doing is
equivalent to walking into a
restaurant or say tennis club
that has been operating for 15
years and telling them they are
doing it wrong its one thing to
suggest that they add a
particular dish to the menu or
repaint the clubhouse while it
is something completely
different to demand that the
chef stop cooking meat dishes
because you dont like the
smell or for the tennis club to
demolish a third of their tennis
courts and put in bowling
alleys because you actually
prefer bowling over tennis one
is giving feedback and ideas
for added value to the place
while the other is asking for
fundamental changes that
negatively impact the current
customersmembers but yes
feel free to tell ccp their long
lived and profitable sandbox
mmo is doing it wrong as is
your right however dont be
surprised to be ignored just
like a decadeandahalf of
similar agitators who have
begged pleaded argued
threatened and yelled in these
forums trying unsuccessfully to
get ccp to throw out their
vision of a fulltime pvp
sandbox game and virtual
universe and turn it into
something else further dont
think you wont also draw the
ire of the players who do love
this game as it is and who
dont appreciate selfish players
asking for the current game
play to be removed because
you will draw ire and will
continue to do so until you
figure out that eve isnt going
         to change for you and move
         on to another game that is
         more compatible for what you
4132017are looking for
         eve is a sandbox game unlike
         wow which you reference
         earlier as such it is totally
         valid to play the
         UFFFDcriminal and
         scoundrelUFFFD and
         calling players cowards makes
         you an ass btw if not an
          these are completely
         acceptable and intended by
         ccp further the greater
         danger of ls is due in part
         because ls has better
         resources than ns granted
         you can just go and obtain
         those resources solo
         youUFFFDll need effort
         and teamwork to take
         advantage of what ls has to
         offeryes i would have an
         issue you should not have
         access to those kinds of
         resources with the current
         levels of protection you enjoy
         in hs it would have an
         unbalancing effect on the
         game imo you seem to be
         unaware that the economy is a
         significant means by which
         players interact yes it is pretty
         anonymous but that is a
         feature not a bug do you
         know who built those t2 strip
         miners do you know who ran
         the moon mining operation
         that provided the moon goo
         used in the the t2
         components do you know
         who did the pi work that went
         into the fuel blocks i am
         going to guess that for most if
         not all of those the answer is
         UFFFDnoUFFFD the
         eve economy is a ginormous
         mass of player interacting with
         each other providing each
         other with what they want and
         need to play the game letting
         a section of the game
         suddenly become more
         productive without a
         commensurate increase in the
         risk would mean that people
         would flock there to enjoy the
         greater rewards and lowered
         risksyou want those
         thingsUFFFDls is
         thataway no you have this
         one wrong you are free to do
         what you want and hopefully
         that is what you consider fun
         however you do not have the
         right to avoid playeronplayer
         interaction nobody has that
         you can try to avoid playeron
         player interaction if you want
         but you cannot avoid it by
         intervention of ccp if you do
         not like this thereUFFFDs
         the doorhs does not need to
         be buffed if you want to get
         more out life in hs figure out
         how to do that that is your job
         figure out how to bring in pilots
         to your corporationalliance
         figure out how to make playing
         with these players more
         rewarding and interesting do
         not go to ccp and say
         UFFFDi want to stay in the
         safest part of the game have
         access to resources and isk
         making opportunities like the
         more contested parts of the
         game oh and make it fun too
         UFFFD go read about this
         being a sandbox game that
         last bit
         UFFFDfunUFFFD that
         is up to youas for fun see the
         above about playeronplayer
         interaction nobody is saying
         you donUFFFDt have the
         right to try and have fun in the
         game just that you cannot
         shield yourself from what other
         players may want to do to you
         most of us find this creates an
         interesting challenging and
         dynamic game environment
         where we can compete with
         others and also cooperateand
         no it is not unfair if somebody
         says UFFFDit is a
         dystopia no safety live with it
         etcUFFFD that is what it
         means to play in a sandbox
         game deal with what ccp
         intervention on your behalf
         yeah thatUFFFDs just
         wrong see if a player comes
         along and UFFFDruins the
         gameUFFFD you have the
         option to UFFFDruin
         hisUFFFD but with ccp
4142017that option is gone
          this is a joke right there more
          sand in hs than anywhere else
          in the game if by that you
          mean various resources you
          can buy just about anything in
          game in hs except for
          perhaps collectorUFFFDs
          items since all the major trade
          hubs are in hs and every ns
          alliance needs those hubs to
          sell the resources they
          acquired but do not need and
          buy those resource they do
          need go have a look at the
          economic reports ccp quant
          puts out huge amounts of stuff
          moves in and out of the forge
          alone i did a back of the
          envelope calculation and the rl
          value for one month was 33
          million yes 33 million real
          us dollars do there is no
          need to take your shovels
          anywhere imo you just need
          to find a way to get enough isk
          to purchase what you
          needUFFFDand there are
          plenty of ways to make isk in
          hsand there are ways to take
          advantage of ls without dying
          every single time i routinely
          do invention in ls because the
          manufacturing costs are lower
          in ls stations you just have
          figure out how to minimize
          your risk one way to do that is
          group upthen you are doing
          something wrong i used to do
          pi in ls never had an issue i
          do invention in ls i lost one
          ship out in dozens of trips not
          counting cyno ships heck
          even my cyno ships are rarely
          attackedand your friends who
         went to lsdid they have voice
         comms were they in fleet
         did they have a scout in a
         ceptor or a cloaky did their
         ship types make sense or
         were they kitchen sinking it
         and please sp is not nearly the
         factor that many make it out i
         have over 147 million sp but
         when iUFFFDm in a
         thorax all my sp for large guns
         of all racial types are useless
         my sp for both minmatar and
         gallente dreads are useless
         the sp for gallente and amarr
         carriersuseless the sp for
         hacs recons ceptors dictors
         and bombers are all
         uselessthis is wrong on a
         number of fronts if the people
         UFFFDclaimingUFFFD
         that ls system are using it as
         they see fit that is not a waste
         of sandit is what was fully
         intended by the game
         developers it is up to you to
         go in there and take it from
         them or negotiate access as
         for plex you are absolutely and
         totally wrong every plex in
         game has gotten there by
         somebody giving ccp money
         more money than a
         subscription so if a ls player is
         making enough isk to plex his
         account ccp is not only getting
         their revenue but more than a
         subscription and you do know
         that ccpUFFFDs own
         analysis has shown that
         combat tends to be good for
         new player retention right
         okay but i can also comment
         on your
         feedbackUFFFDlike you
         donUFFFDt understand
         the nature of the game that
         you think you have a right to
         play the game and avoid
         playeronplayer interaction
         when it suits you that game is
         not eve never has been and
         hopefully never will be if i
         accept the consequences of
         flying up to your ship and
         shooting you in the
         faceworking as the
         developers have intended
         either get used to that or as
         you indicated go find a game
         that is more suited to how you
4142017want to play
         my suggestion optional chat
         beeps like turning onoff blink
         for chat a small morse code
         like dit sound when a
         message appears in chat
         optional sound effect when
         someone enters local  i
         realise this may actually be
         game changing in some way
         however my justifications are
         below my justificationsmy
         situation is quite unique since
         i am visually impaired blind in
         left eye severely impaired
         right eye i get by with my own
         accessibility features and
         adjustments i make however i
         can only see a portion of the
         screen at any given time for
         example when i look at the
hud health etc that is all i can
see or looking at hte
overview i can only see x
amount of lines of the overview
due to using a magnification
program that blows up a
portion of the screen to
fullscreenbecause of this i
miss the following duel
invites fleet invites
conversation invites  i often
have to ask my fc to invite me
several time sbefore i can
reach the fleet invite window in
time before the timeout i miss
chat although chat isnt
entirely crucial to the game
fleet chat is and it would be
useful to hear when a
message appears  i realise
that many players would hate
the game beeping all over hte
place so i suggested it so that
you can turn it onoff like you
can rightclick a chat tab and
turn blink onoff  and have it
off by default  can you
imagine jita so i empathise
with others why this would be
incredibly annoyingthere are
other ui elements that could
benefit from a small
notification sound but these 2
in particular are of particular
interest to mjeas i mentioend
before i get by with my
accessibility products if i could
somehow script the ui with my
accessibility product then i
wouldnt be here however
games just dont work well with
accesibility products and cant
be scripted like other programs
 and please dont confuse an
accessibility script with a
modbot script it is completely
different how an accessibility
script works is by the mangifier
or other program scanning
the screen like obsxsplit does
to record and doesnt actually
interact witht eh game itself
and when a certain portion of
the screen is
activatedmovedother means
of detection then the
accessibility product would
zoom in there or make a
sound or something  so it
actually has no actual code
injection or anything to interact
with the game itselfalthough i
promote accessibility i am not
one of those that ask the
impossible i wouldnt ask ccp
to make an api to work with
accessibility software though if
they did id be one of the first
to liaise with them to make it
fair and not give dissabled
players any kind of advantage
over normal players if you
understand how a headmouse
works you understand what i
mean by scripting accessibility
software to detect changes it
works similarly to a light gun
back on the old consoles 
except purely in softwarei look
forward to seeing what people
think of this suggestion as im
sure some players wouldnt
         mind this feature despite being
         able to see the whole screen
         normally i use the 3rd party
         warp audio volume to let me
         know if anybody has warped
         in however this is bound to
         grid and not by local entirely
         so although this is useful its
4152017not a full view
         good day every time i choose
         clothes or shoes for your
         character ask the same
         question when will the
         helmet  ive seen some
         well avatars are terrible  yes
          i understand you failed to
         have cosmetic surgery as
         necessary  i myself suffered
         for a long time what
         happened what happened
         support the idea of bringing
         a variety of helmets half
         closed closed and not only
         give the helmet to
4182017capsuleers
         ok i know this subject has
         arisen countless times before
         and that alone should
         emphasize that this is a
         problem to the game i notice
         that the habit of cloaky
         camping is one of the biggest
         s i have encountered case in
         point is the system rnfyh this
         was formerly a very active
         ratting system consequently
         there were frequent roaming
         gangs attracted to the area
         and we had many enjoyable
         fights since one cloaky
         camper has moved in the
         system has essentially
         become deserted and the
         volume of available content
         has sharply decreased on a
         day to day level now i have no
         issues with the actual campers
         provided they are actually
         active hell i sometimes cloaky
         camp too but in many cases
         it is obvious the individual logs
         on first thing in the morning
         and then goes to work or
         whatever leaving his account
         running afk this just sucks it
         only serves to deny content to
         others and detracts from
         gameplay in every wayi will
         highlight here that my own
         corp has lost players to other
         games directly due to this
         practice while it might be easy
         to just say htfu this is eve do
         we really need that attitude
         when we are already facing
         declining subscribers
         therefore i would suggest a
         simple fix in that cloaks are
         altered to cycle like many other
         modules but say a 30 minute
         cycle time and then must be
         reactivated manually with no
         autocycle function available
         but can be deactivated
         manually and instantly to drop
         cloak this will still allow
         camping but ensures the
         camper is actually present
         otherwise his ship will decloak
         allowing him to be scanned
         down a simple solution that
         will serve to create content as
         opposed to destroying itjust a
4262017thoughtcheersulf
         yes yes we do i know it
         seems like it would be a good
         idea for ccp to make you safer
         and your rattingmining more
         lucrative and thus you richer
         but it is the exact opposite of
         what makes eve an interesting
         and worthwhile game if
         everyone is safe and only
         subject to consensual pvp and
         has more resources than they
         can use due to 100 safe
         resource generation in nullsec
         then not only does shiploss
         not matter anything you do
         has no meaning its not even
         a competitive game at that
         point but just a exercise
         gathering useless stuff there
         would be no meaningful
         content to be had nor would
         the game be very interesting if
         everyone can fly and lose the
            most expensive ships without
            a second thought it would be
            like the strangely lifeless
            version of eve you find on the
            test server  its still eve but
            without permaloss and assets
            with value it is just a pretty
            but not very compelling
            experience cloaky camping is
            the only counter to the 100
            safety afforded by local ill
            agree it can pretty frustrating
            but without it you can always
            warp to safety before a hostile
            can get on grid to interact with
            you nullsec is suppose to be
            the most rewarding yet most
            dangerous space there is but
            when local serves as such a
            powerful source of safety it is
            pretty hard to say that it is
            succeeding at that with a
            straight face cloaky camping
            is literally the only risk to your
            income generation and with
            the current record levels of isk
            flooding into the game from
            nullsec bounties the last thing
            we need to do is remove that
            only risk for operating in
            nullseci hope the longterm
            plan is still to release
            observatory arrays and nerf
            local and allow that free intel to
            be clawed back a bit with
            some vulnerable
            infrastructure then i think it
            would possible to add a direct
            counter to cloaky camping
            while still keeping some risk in
            nullsec until then though i see
            little chance of ccp deciding
            that nullsec needs to be even
            safer by nerfing cloaky
            camping and even if they did
            it wouldnt be by hamstringing
            the usefulness of cloaking
            devices which are central to
            much other gameplay
            especially in wormholes there
            are counters to aggressors
            that dont involve fleeing to a
            station or safe spot every time
            a nonblue enters local
            perhaps you should consider
            getting your corp to invest
            some time in them instead of
            watching all your corpmates
            drift off to other games
            because you are all too scared
            to put anything at risk and
            succumb to a selfinduced and
            terminal case of boredomif
            anything new eden is suffering
            from a lack of conflict drivers
            and a glut of resources we
            need to be more at risk to each
            other and resources more
            scarce if there are to be
            reasons to fight with each
            other and use all these tools of
            war we keep accumulating
            month after month we
            definitely do not need more
            safety anywhere but
            especially not in highsec and
            nullsec both of which are too
            safe for the amount of
            resources they generate by
            far

         iUFFFDm not here to
         request a buff to low sec
         mining or provide suggestions
         to fix them iUFFFDm just
         stating some of the current
         issues i see with lowsec
         mining at least before they
         add the new moon mining
         refineries which may or may
         not helpissuesmining in low
         sec isnUFFFDt as
         dangerous as most people
         think as long as you stay
         aligned higgs anchor rigs
         help and warp out whenever
         a neutral or red enters belt you
         will be pretty untouchable
         unless the enemy ships have
         fast lockingores are also on
         paper more valuable than high
         sec ores so why
         isnUFFFDt it profitable
         well compared to highsec and
         nullsec mining you are likely to
         be off grid more often when
         mining in low sec you will be
         warping from belts a lot more
         often from enemy players than
         in high sec occasional
         ganker or null sec occasional
         reds in system plus you also
         have intel channelsso the
         reason why mining in lowsec
         isnUFFFDt profitable is
         because the the isk per time in
         belt isnUFFFDt good
         enough than the
         alternativesthe market
         isnUFFFDt great for
         buying ores from miners
         because no one is mining
         and hauling in and out of
         lowsec isnUFFFDt worth
         the risk better to mine the
         ores in an anomaly
         elsewhereno reason to
         protect miners because not
         profitable enough and miners
         not unlike other eve players
         are selfish and probably
         wonUFFFDt share the
         gained profit of more valuable
         ores players can do more
         valuable and fun activities than
         babysitting minershopefully
         this will be considered when
         the csm works on stuff
         involving mining and industry
         in lowsectldr points time
         spent in belt isnt worth it local
         market incentive not there no
         reason to protect miners my
4262017suggestion
            teckos pech  i agree with the
            other points howeveri think
            you can not conclude from
            winning your first pvp
            encounter towards low sec
            experienceentering the wrong
            low sec system you get a fight
            on others you can stay all
            days and not have one issue
            for daysit realy depends there
            is so much to learn about how
            to work in low sec that it is
            intimidating for a lot of
            peopleespecially because
            these things are not obvious
            and you can not take your
            experience for grantedyou
            have to stay allert in low
            secbest is to learn from
            experienced people the
            current information out there
            do not teach how to behave in
            low sec to learn this you need
            to invest and loose some
            shipslow sec is in my opinion
            after wormholes the most
            dangerous space then follows
            00 and high secon 00 space
            a system can be more secure
            then high sec or less secure
            so i also disagree with the risk
            2 reward balancing in this
            however 00 security is work
            while the security in high sec
            is for freehowever keep in
            mind that security in eve is
            always a dynamical thing and
            not to be taken grantedso fly

         i was referring to ccps
         analysis of players less than
         15 days of age who were
         ganked in hs the end results
         were that those who were
         ganked stayed the longest
         those killed legally war dec
         dual etc stayed almost as
         long and those who were
         never killed in their first 15
         days stayed the least amount
         of timeim not saying gank all
         the newbies but that shielding
         them from it wont help with
         retaining players here is he
4302017presentation
         i know the presentation
         againlook at what was looked
         atplayers 15 days
         oldprobably new player and
         not altsfocus was ganking
         1 was gangked15 was
         killed leagalythe rest was not
         killed at allid say you can not
         generalize this researchin
         general what you can say is
         that harasment is not a
         problem in eveyou can not
         say that pvp is not an issue for
         new players i men that in the
         sense of knowledge i
         personally assume that a lot of
         people look carebears have
         issues with combati do not
         mean this negative more
         constructivethere is a huge
         difference between getting
         ganked getting into a high sec
         war and travell through low
         secand this is imho something
         were your example does not
         match what you want to sayall
4302017the bestaischa
         really it is interesting you left
         out the conclusions about
         player retention those who
         engaged in combat in their
         first 15 days stayed the
         longesteve is a boring game
         really what makes it
         interesting is the playeron
4302017player interaction
         1 if it is very obvious that
         they are just logging in then
         going to work then why
         should it disrupt anything
         they are at work after all2
         your suggestion has been
         made hundreds of times
         before and its just as bad now
         as the first hundred times its
         been made3 there is a
         dedicated thread to post your
         cloaky camping whines i
4302017mean suggestions
         you already have a helmet it
         just happens to be a full body
         one fly through a gate camp
