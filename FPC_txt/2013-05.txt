with the new expansion being about exploration how about some serious increases to the jump range of the rorqual it is after all supposed to be the ship that makes industrial gameplay possible in the nether reaches of nonempire space limit it to its current jump range in low sec but double its range when jumping into or around in null sec some additional fuel consumption penalty for longer jumps should been implemented and a larger fuel bay should be a module rorqual pilots could add
an industrial supercap is an interesting idea but i can already forsee a few balancing issues with trying to find a role for it that the rorqual or jump freighter dont already fulfill granted not being able to dock is a pretty damn good balancing tool so maybe that could be a big part of itto be honest i dont know enough about the modern day use of rorquals and orcas to comment on whether there is a need for a industrial super cap or not
the main difference between the suggested ship and the rorqual would be real assembly lines the ship is not meant to transport or compress but to serve as a mobile production facility real nomadic lifestyle for industrialists resupply right on the frontlines  that kind of crap
if you add ice to wspace you come very very close to making it entirely self sufficient youll have people closing up the wormholes behind them
if you can explain to me how bitcoins work in a reasonable manner without linking me anything to read because screw that then i will bring this up at the summit
my 2 cents and i have yet to fly one and probably never will change the whole system and implement something likedamage according to sizethe whole rockpaper  scissor thing must alaways apply  no best weapon there is  everything needs a counterbutthe way it is now it is entirely possbible to bring down the largest ships in the game titans if you can only muster enough riftersthis of course is an exaggeration and nobody would do it but how come that a rifter can even put a dent into a battleship imagine shooting at an m1 abrahams tank with a 22 pistol  you could have a million 22 pistols and still couldnt to jack to that tankbut can the tanks main weapon ever hit a few soldiers running aroun it wielding this 22 pistol with its main gun  thats what you need bigger guns for same with titans in order to be able to hit titans you need caps and supercaps anything else will just not work but a cap and supercap should have a very tough time targeting close enough subcapsthe battleships are in a very interesting position here because they could potentially have enopugh firepower to be a threat but are also big enough to be targeted when they are not close enough to get under the gunsi am getting carried away againdamage according to sizevulnerability according to sizemight fix it by using this concept you will never be able to destroy the opponents supercaps unless you commit your own to do itor are able to get enough battleships in close enough but of course there comes the own support fleet you get the idea
the idea has some merits but to make the like of a frigate unable to effectively harm a super is misguided even the smallest ships can do serious damage to an inattentive warship just ask the uss cole but at the same time even a swarm of these types of attacks should not be easy work of a super as for the idea of mustering enought rifters never say never there are groups out there that would do it and have the resources to do it just to show that it can be done one of the very first titans died to a frigswarm
well the example of the us cole does not actually work in this context as a small boat full of highgrade exlosives is not actually small calibre imagine the crew of that boat using machine rifles instead of those explosives then you get the example straight theres nothing a soldier can do to a warship except when he uses large enough artilleryand only because it can be done i the game killing a supercap with frigs doesnt necesarily mean it is the best way and the greatest mechanic i made another example in some other thread a long time ago imagine an army of goblins attacking a gigantig dragon no way they could even hurt that thing now htorw in the knight with the magic sword and the mage and priest and all that rock paper scissor but still impossible without that sword of dragon slaying true
really all they need to do is buff torps range considering that they just buffed cruise missiles and have mentioned that they are going to buff torps im sure this is what will happen though to be honest the new cruise missiles are so good i dont see why anyone would even need to use torps anymore
you missed delayed damage for missiles in fact the advantage of great is only really applicable for pve missiles are pretty good in closerange small fleet action outside of this they are rubbish in pvp you cannot attack the primary due to delayed damage there is no guarantee that the target will still be there when your missiles arrive wasted dps therefore the notion that the op range of missiles is clearly incorrect outside of a pve environmentalso all turreted weapons have the ability to hit for goodgreat damage to small targets at range something that large missiles will never achieve although i suspect that radeoff for this is you cant really get under launchers the same way you can with turrets
you had some decent words that i liked then i read this and realized you actually have no clue about weapons systems
hii think i would be fine if all rats gain omni resistances like sleeper or sanshas in incursions i feel its a little bit unfair that missiles and projectiles are the best weapons to deal with rats cause they can deal any damage type instead of laserhybrids if im flying my paladin its even a pain to deal with angel guristas or serpentisjust a idea discus
i dont actually know the exact resistance values of each rat type i like the idea of an optimal damage type as long as its not overwhelmingly optimal on most ships imo a straight omniresist npc rat is actually a bad thing all ships have resistance holes and learning to expoit that or take it into consideration is very relevant to pvp
just in general im going to say the problem these days with balancing the weapons is that their are already too many weapons so yea i dont see this being very viable but some of those ideas were interesting with having the damage occur at the end of the cycle though as an fc let me tell you i would hate having to target call for those things 
the problem with paint jobs is not cost dev time or even the fear of pretty pink penises  penii  the problem is loading thousands of custom textures to every single client when you land on grid with other peopleif you have 1000 rifters on grid then the client loads the one rifter model 1000 times but it is from the local storage on the client side so no lag other than your hard diskif you have 1000 different rifter models then the server has to fetch them from each client and send them back out this will kill people with laggy connections and the server will suffer as welli do support custom color schemes via the base  trim  decal model where you have the same basic texture but can alter the colors on the rbg level or decals that can be applied sending the rbg values is a minor data addition  think a 4 line txt file  and the decals can be stored client side for fast load timesthis way we get some level of customization with minor server load and shifting the heavy lifting to the render engine heck even make it an option in the graphics menu if you want to see custom details or not

i think it would be interesting for al belts to be scanned down but with the new changes coming to the ship scanner i wonder how that would benefit anything i feel like it would be the combination of all the things that would make this a great change the massive grid the competition of roids between competing corporations the on grid boosting only possibly the aoe soundwave suggested for boosters and so on just in high sec alone this would be a great addition to some mondane gameplay that exists being that most of the decent ore in null and wh are already single massive belts
yep absolutely right also if all belts were scan down belts they would change position every time they are either cleared or despawn this would prevent bot mining also it would force mining corps to move around system to system when they have to wait 4 hours for the next belt to spawn another thought is the rats in belts could be more aggressive high sec is frigates low sec is destroyers and cruisers maybe a battle cruiser null is battleships combat sites in high sec have up to cruisers low sec has up to battleships i could been wrong been a while null has up to capital ships why not put up to cruisers in high sec and progressively get harder all the way down to null could you imagine having to deal with a npc super cap fleet in an scanned down asteroid belt that would be awesomethough it does bring to mine the whole fact that people that usually mine dont want to deal with that sort of thing they just want to warp in with their mining boat mine and warp out i think there was a presentation about that at fanfest for the people that do archeology etc anyway i liked how belts were in wh a while back warp in clear it of the sleeper and it was clear until the belt or gas pocket despawned i feel that that would be a good trade off have no more then say 5 belts in a system and 5 quick respawning combat sites for people that want to rat grindoh one more thing that just kind of popped in my head regarding industrial manufacturing why not have everything made from components like t2 capital ships and t3 would make everything more interesting also would make the market even more complex which is what eve is all about complexity depth and fun
what if rather than having mutiple belts they had one massive belt in each solar system the belt would span across many grids all the way around the solar system like a asteroid belt in real solar system a single belt that contains both ore and ice there could be only certain warp in points that the ship scanner would give you but you could follow the belt arc off grid to kinda make your own hidden mining areas it would be like still having the hidden belts but they are just sections of the large system wide belt maybe even make it so the father you get from the standard warp ins the better quality ores you get
that was what ccp soundwave had mentioned in the fanfest stream i created this thread originally off of that idea i am hoping that it gains enough attention from both miners and pvprs alike i think it would open a new era into eve
ccp has allowed the sale of timecodes for isk for as long as ive been playing the game plex themselves are a somewhat newer august 2008 i think innovation to streamline the process and bring it entirely ingamefrankly look at it this way it makes the kills you get all the sweeter if you imagine it cost them real money i dont really see what your problem is here
this theyre an incredibly smart solution to a number of problems and ive never seen any argument against them that didnt revolve around some kind of weird puritytest notion that removing them wouldnt instantly result in a massive rmt boom
just fyi ive already told him this and even showed him that there was a gtc trade forum on the eveo website before plex were introduced despite this he maintained that gtc trading wasnt permitted by ccphes not someone to be persuaded out of his ideas by little things like facts evidence or reason

something needs to be done with the rorqual if they are doing all these changes to ice and expect that 20 of the ice is not going to be mined in highsecafter the patch the hulk will roughly mine 200 blocks of ice an hour with max skills and an implant the rorqual can only compress roughly 320 blocks of ice and hour this is the stupidest thing ever15 hulk to one rorqual for compression of ice i ccp was trying to make this a group activity for mining in 00 but do you really expect a corporation of 32 exhumer pilots to mine for 1 hour and then all 32 jump into a rorqual and compress for 1 hourthe rorqual need a few things done make the compression rate of ice equal to the mining rate of a hulk then make the rorqual be able to support something more then 15 hulks like each rorqual should be able to support 10 hulksif you decrese the compression time by a little by giving rorqual a compression bonus per level and increase the number of slots to 1011 for compression on the rorqual either by flat number of slots or again a rorqual bonus per level then it would make that much more sense honestly the tractor beam scanner and drone bonuses are total lame in my opionion and we could lose those to make up for the bounses i suggested aboveplease do it so it can come out with this patch and not like 6 months later

i am not against it but i would really like to know how often people hit the wall for 13k bookmarksthe subfolders idea to sort is nice as i have had a bomber set for hed and it gets messy with perches from all angles on multiple gates and stationsi think the people to ask about the max limit would be null pvp alliance coalitions as they have the largest territories to keep mapped and bookmarkedand it is worth askingm
how about a bookmark that destroys itself
come to think of it being able to set selfexpiring bookmarks wouldnt be a half bad idea if you had enough control over it as it would save us wormies a bit of work having to go in and manually throw out stale bookmarks
as a corporation that is looking to wormholes being able to mine ice inside would make enough difference to try it outright now there are a lot of factors that make wormhole attractive less population more iskhr and more of a home feelingproblem 1 is that to stay setup you need a source for fuel  blocks or mats  while the pi stuff is trivial wit the right planets the ice will forever be a bottleneck you need to buy it or hope your static goes somewhere with icei know after the expansion change that if ever highsec ice belt was cleaned it would only make 80 of the fuel neededapply this to wspace have only enough ice spawn to run a small tower on each moon in the system if you want to run a large tower then you need to reduce the total number of stations you have set up static links to systems with 15 moons will be come very desirable it will also drive conflict when someone wants to steal your ice supply  all you have to do is out mine the hosts ice and after a while you can sell it back to them for a pretty penny or go into siege mode and do your best to prevent them getting ice products at all for a whileand for some reason sleepers really like ice it should be annoying to mine ice with them around

i have it on good authority that this is not exactly true while the devs are happier with faction warfare in its current form they are not happy in general with it because its systemically isolated relative to other parts of of the game  thats more or less what they have saidthey are done with big changes for right now but they are making tweaks here or there in the background

that is not a bad idea but if they just fix the compression problem and perhaps enlarge the ore hold and factory slots some i think your issues would be resolved indirectly
eve is a sandbox one sand box one server one universe letting people make their own pocket universe and shut everyone else out is everything eve is not player interaction is everything in eve and creating areas that allow you to shut yourself off from the rest of the universe removes what makes eve unique
i most definitely support this as your suggestion involves simply placing civilian grade mods on the ships they would still be far less effective than a properly fit frig so its unlikely to cause any balance issues or to make t1 frigs less relevantthis will also do wonders to get rid of the i dun haz anything to fly excuse when it comes time for roams or ops  well maybe not since i personally funded a free rifter program in my old corp and still rarely got any takers on them however for those who actually do want to jump into the fights this idea could be a boon

im personally very happy with the work ccps balance team has put in and would first like to thank them for their hard work for their candid and open communication with the playerbase and for representing ccp in a generally excellent manner now as for your complaints about grossly and irresponsibly forcing their opinions into the game about their smartass remarks and about your implicatations they are being disrespectful omg wtf is wrong with you the remarks you quoted are completely and totally acceptable grow some thicker skin already as none of the examples you linked above are rude inappropriate or disrespectful you either need to come up with some better examples or apologize for your negligent and unqualified slander in short stop being a piece of  throwing around bullshit accusations to gather attention
1 bullshit as explained very thoroughly the 5 resists are simply obnoxiously potent go take a course in basic algebra and then maybe youll understand why the change is a good thing as for the because of alpha fleet doctrines alpha fleets exist because of the limitless scaleability of remote reps which are even more effective on ships with resistance bonuses again if you go take a basic algebra course you might understand how these are linked and the balancing difficulties the devs deal with 2 most snipers use range to tank bitching about your inability to fit a tank and snipe is dumb how about you focus on something a little more relevant rather than complaining cause you dont get the best of all worlds 3 i think the new armaggedon is badass and fully support the changes it will certainly add a new flavor to fleet doctrines which will improve the overall game tell me would you whine and  this much when your wife loses 100 kgs changes careers and starts a new hobby or do you adapt to the changes and enjoy the new experiences 45 and they are reducing the base pg and cap consumption of many lasers if this isnt enough then go explain why but realize many ships arent designed to permarun guns and tank and    thats part of the pros and cons of each weapon system

hello i am cross trained eve pilot and have flown gallente minmatar and amarr ships also during my past i have witnessed fights in low sec wh and null i do not have any experience from caldari ships but i have spoken to several pilots that have not trolled about it there are several issues that cause the races be seriously in balance where i feel that amarr and caldari are in the weak endpvpfirst of all pvp as many of online games eve is also an rockpaperscissor game you defeat others mostly by right choice of fitting ship selection and dealt damage type as flexibility goes minmatars gain possibility to cross fit shield or amor tank ability to deal wide variety of damage types with good tracking they also have best alpha that mixed with the flexing damage type is quite deadly they also have most speed that helps you gain on your enemy or run or evade damage gallente do they have bit of everything drones for versatile damage quite ok speeds nice active tank ability to cross fit tank types as well their gun system causes thermalkinetic that makes quite nice damage in most situations caldaries and bit of mixed bunch that have lot of potential drake was quite long jack of all trades but there has been and still are problems with different ship sizes but in general they are stuck to shields predictable damage resistance in most hull to kineticthermal damage even missile are able to deal all kinetic is mostly used last we have amarr who are slowest predictable damage type predictable tank cap hog ships that barely have mids to fit properly anymore nice lasers are so unpopular tat people actively fit projectile guns to amarr boatsthere are several other aspect too to this one of the is ewar immunities as most of you know shield tank can regenerate over time without any cap input this combined to cap free weapon system such as projectiles or missiles can make ship completely neut  vampire immune included to this missile system is immune to td gallentes can become cap immune too with particular hulls like vexor or myrmiddon by fitting a shield tank with drones amarr are the only raise that is vulnerable for all existing ewars and the fitting is so tightly computed that mostly ever there is no chance to fit anything extrabecause cap is so high vulnerability that you have to stick your ship with cap mods  rigs that help with cap consumptionpvepve has same issues with the ships as we have in pvp minny ships can do most npc types with ease where gallente caldari and amarr have difficulties amarr and caldari ships have difficulties flying cross tank fleets where minmatar and gallente are probably always able to fit a roleso in short every race minmatars jack of all trades you can make the ships work almost to anything gallente wanna be jack of all trades quite happy being how they are caldari a mess simply fact that caldari is the only race that uses turrets  missiles  drones make their weapon system training time long missiles are nice but travel time makes damage sluggish slow ships predictable damage vulnerabilities amarr are like cheese holes every where everyone wants to bite them slow ships that native damage type is emthermal which is very often most resisted damage type in pvp since armor is favored over shield predictable damage vulnerbilities ewar sponge give me i suck all of them cap intensive fitting that does not leave much space for flexible fittingissues and homogenizationmost eve players think homogenization is something where every ship and weapon type becomes same this could be one way but i hope we can figure out more flexible ways to bring the weapon systems and tank types into balances i have pondered these issues quite much due since every ship that i have flown been dear to meweapon systemsbiggest issues with weapon systems are versatile damage types travel  damage apply delay cap use projectiles are instant damage applied in versatile damage without cap use none other weapon system shares these 2 powerful traits hybrid and lasers being able to deal instant damage that is roughly split to 2 resistance types and consume cap where drones and missiles can deal all damage types both in t1 and t2 variety but travel time of both systems are yet rather horrid both being completely cap freein my personal experience lasers ability to be ammo free is more of a burden than favor t1 ammos do not damage they are worth nothing the high price of this cap intensivity is not worth this facttanksthere are some issues between shield and armor tanks both of them have their advantages there is not huge problem in between these tanks but i raise points hopefully other people can agree with me passive tanking signature radius and scanning speed of shield fit ship shield tank ships are more easy to ehp  damage fit due to damage mods do not share slot with tank modules passive regen of shield tank makes lot of confusion since when people compare shield and armor tank together they do not consider reinforced shield buffer regen which has and will continue cause flame also passive regen helps you to survive in systems where you are flying in limited fleet with buffer tank you will eventually die as armor fit ship if you do not pay to repair or get someone to repair you up where shield simply regenerates over timei believe signature radius difference is unfair for shield fit ships i hope that there would not have to be difference in this between tank typesshield fit ship can easily fit several damage mods and shield modules where armor has bit more flexibility for mids  ewar first giving shield fit ship unfair advantage in pve 2nd giving armor fit ship unfair advantage in pvp continued 
suggestions for possible solutionsweapon versatile damagewe could balance lasers and hybrids by giving them slight resistance penetration introducing new module that would give resistance penetration this resistance penetration should not make lasers or hybrids the superior weapon system but help them out against high resistance tanks i think this would be great idea since everyone know amarrs from lasers and this would make lasers viable weapon system in comparison of other weapon systems of course this would have to be adjusted so that damage of these systems were closer to the projectile and missile and drone damage systems meaning that base damage of the system should be downscaled slightlydamage apply delaywhen we look at damage application it is divided into several attributes at the time being to fire on a ship one first needs to lock on a target then fire  travel as we want to keep systems separate and unique i would consider several approaches to this issue give missile and drone ships increased scan resolution  ability to lock faster it will help these damage systems to start firing faster also give them slight advantage of initiating ewar let missile ship start firing in the space and on acquiring a lock let the missiles travel to target drones already have several different ways to improve light and medium drone can travel very fast but heavies are very sluggish to increase use of heavies we could consider if there could be a mod that micro jumped heavies to target remember that heavies are really sluggish so even if they would get to target in instant they would still have to stay on the target as well this module could be op but just consider it heavies are nice system but rarely used cap consumption  ewar immunitythis is an serious issue it causes several crippling problems what comes to amarr fitting and also gives some weapon systems awful advantage of being cap  ewar immune to balance the weapon systems these steps need to be taken every weapon system has to take cap or if not take cap they have to yet disable if your cap runs out perhaps it could be done that if your cap was completely out of power your weapon systems were forced to reboot and they could not come online until 10 of cap was regened this would take care of completele ewar immunity but still give projectile and launcher edge but without being completely immune amarr lasers and gallente hybrids i know that the gun energy consumption hinders both races both races have had or will have rof bonus introduced to their hulls that also increases cap consumption of guns by 5 first where we should start is that all rof modified modules and effect should be balanced in either module itself or hull that has the rof bonus for example heat sinks and magnetic field stabilizers have been to long without cap reduction we need them there making cap battary modules less expensive to fit cap batteries take very much ship resources in comparison to other modules amarr and gallente ships need these things the most due to their vulnerability to cap neut ewar yet often you can fit just one due to fit requirements i do not feel these modules are overpowered and ships should be able to fit more than 1 of them making cap injector more viable form of cap replenish same as battery pwg  cpu reqs should be adjusted ships should be able to carry more charges than for several minutes of brawl weapon tracking distruption immunitywhat i can say missiles please implement the td there already this has been under debate for very long make it happen it does not help amarr at all when about 30 of ship fits can easily become immune  i could understand resistant but not immune  to both of their ewarpassive regento balance out shields and armor in roams armor tank needs passive ability to regen armor its unfair that armor fit ships have to pay for repairs when shield fit ships can gain instant shield buffer with quick dockundock my suggestion is either modules to mid slot that can make armor to regenerate passively or simply ability for armor to regen if you are not in fight  taking damage if the regen was out of combat it could be simply explain with maintenance of the ships or repair bots also then armor could be also renewed just by dockundockshield signaturei simply think this unfair way you fit your ship should not increase the speed you can be scanned i hope we could balance this out somehowmodule imbalances between tanksthis is probably as ccp has intended but i wish there was smaller gap between the tanks in fitting damagebufferewar i do not have simple solution but hopefully someone could find a wayamarr ships are suffering very badly many people including me think that the new armageddon is not real amarr ship it does address some issues but funnily its amarr ewar hull that is amongst the most resisted  immunity and that cap neuting being as it most efficient form against other amarr hulls i do not say its a bad hull its just that many players disagree for amarr becoming 2ndary drone race now old typhoon was very much like the new geddon is it got changed due to long training time now we have the same disaster on amarr its like devs decided to give both missiles and drones to it that it could avoid all existing problems we have with lasers please consider the ship balances that amarr ships are more usable in

i also support this the noobship should not overshadow the other frigates but it shouldnt be as overshadowed itself as it is right now the updates given to them definitely helped but they can be improved upon one noobship shouldnt be able to steamroll say a t1 fit rifter but two should definitely take one on with mild success several noobships should be able to cause havok unlike they do right nowthis would make the game very accessible for newer players stats shouldnt necessarily change with skill similar to how its done now but will make a noob valuable in a fight as opposed to not having anyone
while they are at it can ships having missile velocity bonus have the same bonus applied to target painters got a huge gap between my tp range and the 250km achievable with cruise missiles
jesus christ its like im actually on pol1 from me  if a company as widely known as ccp starts accepting buttcoins my returns will get even bigger
imagine when fleets are clushed in battleexplosions effects lags time dialation etcbut from a strategy view its not so practical because you just want to see ship type its guns and capabilities so what i propose we need a battle mod where the is no 3d rendered models where we can see just scematicobjects bc bs hacs recons t3 etc just simple stylish simplified black models with no effects and more tactical information grid points groups fc signs etc good thing if your pc cant handle large fight you can switch to this mod and voila good perfomance  simple view of thingsgood example is defcon or supreme commander when you up your map at top of the screenthis is nowits a messsyou cannot se no cruisers hacks recons bs inters etcsomething like this but its 2 dimensional game supremecannot find normal 3d tactical huds for space battle gamesyeah and why eve cant be smth like this 
jonas i do not fly caldari but i do have flown ham legion and the range they have do not seems too long to be honest in comparison to heavy missiles hams are crappy but missile legion then again is crappy p torps already suffer from explosive radius
i dunno i can kind of dig it because as someone who uses minmatar and angel ships for pve its frustrating being at a disadvatnage when shooting serp and gurista rats at the same time the differences between the npc pirate types means something and id kinda hate seeing them be all homogenized
lasers get infinite ammo and instant damage its not all one wayhowever i agree that rats shouldnt be so predictable  even if theyre not omnitank they should have more variation and the same goes for their damage types as well
thats the same old homogenizing implemented a different way  the variations even out into omni unless there is no reload timer and you change ammo on every rat the end result is the sameand ammo or instant dmg is lol all guns have instant dmg ammo is only an issue for cheapskates laser  high effective dps  high projection at expense of cap
you realize that if the tank type varies then projectiles and missiles make superior weapons because flexible damage type this would make amarr in worse standing than they already arerats should be more interesting and every rat type should be doable without mega frustration on every ship type imhoalso damage type that rats deal should not be as predictable hopefully so that pvers could use omni tank in low sec making it more difficult for gankers to gain upper hand
how do lasers work in pvp
15038 pm tei lin you know what i need15042 pm tei lin a way to import fittings from the igb15054 pm tei lin like right click eft fitting import15055 pm tei lin done15056 pm nikomo i think you can do that15057 pm nikomo sort of15102 pm nikomo no wait cant15113 pm nikomo i think the best you can do is push some stupid xml files into a random directory or something15132 pm tei lin yeah right now i need to import to pyfaeftevehq and then export to xml15136 pm tei lin then import from that xml in to eve15201 pm tei lin i guess we can skip a step and post the xmls next to the eft text on the wiki15214 pm tei lin but thats still not as neat as right click importmaybe in this right click menu herein general an easier way to move fits from discussion areas in to the game would be amazing im super lazy
that could all happen in the same window too color coded or something orange is for the first setting blue for the second green for the third or however you configured it it almost got me thinking about the new systemwide scanner theyre launching and how it could all be tied to that kind of like a real anapg68  we could have track while scan mode where it sweeps in a given area and updates direction as it sees the object in question range while scan where it is pointed in a small area with varying range settings to try to determine an objects range etc all this could happen automatically too as long as youre running the scannerit could appear that this would give an unfair advantage to pilots but keep in mind that the scanner has a handicap  it has a timer on it that prevents it from rescanning for a short amount of time while that time is very small its enough to render it useless for actual real time usage this would just serve the purpose of automating the scannereither idea would be wonderful to be completely honest i think this one would be more realistic but either way works
thank you ruze  nantwig mutbrecht
op really nice stuff great job overview needs more loveee
i like the idea maybe rounding it abit too you will have the proposed ships who can fill at max skills 3 macherials  some small stuff get a somewhat useable tank would like normal freighters with better tank too and no jump capabilities and then there is another line of those ships which can only fit 1 and a half mach but use jump drives
op hauling ship hulls is indeed a task that could have dedicated hull would love also if the existing industry ships could gain some kind of bonus to pack ships to smaller space perhapsanyway bump nice idea
 andracin its really good thing that i do agree with you however i also see concern of the original poster of ships growing in treesi am torn apart i do see that plexer pilots upkeep the prices of the hulls and waste them yet i hope there was less
1i use multiple accounts but manual and i like this idea because of one example i have seen also i cant remember the namehe used isboxer or something similar to run an incursion vg fleet alone with 7 nightmares and 2 or 3 basis he may not be astime eff
rather nicely putotherwise one must assume that the op also would like to ban multiple monitors multiple pcs kvms if they still make them and even rdp perhaps
op good post its nice that other consider this issue as wellif these accounts are single person owned i am sure this guy does not pay for play but pays for plexes this would be really good change and would help with several op issues and false statist
such would give single player too much influence over market price of ice one player could easily  the market with their effort making it poor experience for those that actually mine the ice in fair manner
1 makes sensealso would like to see the compression module for pos but that would obsolete rorqual somewhat perhaps rorqual could anchored so that it could beused without piloting it also cost of it lowered that it was not as big pirate  pos bash evok
i like what you are thinking but by making the rorqual itself a pos item will still not solve the problemthe pos module will only be able to do 1 job at a time and probably at a slowernormal rate of compression with a limited number of them anchored at pos because of cpupower that a pos hasto not make the rorqual obsolete you would give the rorqual more slots to manufacture and give it a compression reduction time big enough to make it better then pos module by far also rorqual will not be obsolete anyways cause pilots will always use it to give mining bonuses
hii just read your thread and i mostly can not agree with it ok amarr cap issues and fixed damage types nice recomandations engergy weapon crystal changes atleast it works with physics are correct but i still have to test the changes coming this summer otherwise i too dont like that t1 ammo is indestructible else lasers are great weapon systems because i can easily increase my range with just swapping crystals and still hit the target gallente use knives when amarr can use knives and guns plus using short range ammo deal a great deal of damagethe next point is you want tracking disruptors to affect missiles ffs no we have defender missiles to counter missiles also ccp needs to get them up to date and working properly posted my idea in ideas for new modules 13th post from the topok now to armageddon not being a real amarr bs just think of whom they are mostly fighting sanshablood both cap hungry ship designs ok minmatar not so why not design some ships to make it easier to fight those fiendsso why not the minmatar issue now you say they can be completly cap independent thats bull and u know it yeah they still can use their weapons when they run out of cap but they cant use ewar hardeners neuts active reps and prop mods and have by nature a weak tank because they prefer to be the fastestmy next point would be the sig issue with shields you mentioned ccp designed it that way to give a penalty to counter the passive shield recharge is what i believe that means without the sig increase u get harder to hit and less damage applied to you means ccp needs to find another way to balance that should they reduce the hp boosted then on extenders or how should the rigs get penalized then by the way of passive regen for armor pls dont if its such an issue ccp should just increase the plate hp boninow we go to caldari the idea how they want to fight is completly acceptable to me also i would greatly reduce their drone bay and drone bandwith max 1 set of light drones  max 1 set in reserve i would give the missile bonus to all types of missiles not only kinetic also pure shield tanked race is fine with mefinally overall i wouldnt say that armor is better in pvp because you cant fit ewar more easily in armor ships just as example coercer only has 2 mids many armor ships have only 3 or 4 mids which u need mostly already for prop mod point and cap
hi jeanne i read through your post and it seems you did not read my post correctlykethry avenger suggestion for energy crystal seems one possible solution simply by changing the division of the damage types could already help a lot its good solution something that should be considered by the devs i will attach it to the original postdefender missiles is quite obsolete suggestion since ccp is about to remove launcher slots from the the bs hulls also many smaller ship hulls never had launcher slots also as they are currently implemented they do not function enough viably and what comes to td and all ewar no ship or fit should gain complete immunity to any ewar this leaves the ewars out of balance and tds need to affect missilesi do not mean tds should be able to screw whole missile system how they do turrets but td should affect missile guidingamarr wont ever be balance in other ship hulls as long as they are the only ships that are more or less forced to be ewar vulnerable not immune to any this is not helped that amarr ships rely so heavily on cap it simply makes the vulnerabilities worse due you are forced to fit mods to even keep your guns and rep running you may use passive hardeners to gain ehp and simple buffer for tank damage this would leave ewar and mwdab your only cap requiring skills so your ship can still fly and fire even your cap is out yes you get increased damage due to loss of speed if your propulsion boost is not running but the fact is that minnies evade damage due to the speed if your ship base speed is high enough and you get into close range you wont probably need the increased speed only thing that has to stick is tackle and even with cap neut on you you should be able to keep it running if you have not screwed ship natural cap regeni spoke not about increased damage on the shield but the fact that if you fit your ship with shield modules you increase your ships signature radius that makes you easier to scan with probes you are easier to be gankedwhat comes to passive regen if you read it through well you see that i do not suggest similar regen for armor as shields have yes it could be done by mid slot modules since they would then take out cap regen ability but honestly i do not like this idea either as i suggested secondly armor could repair over time out of combat this would not fiddle with current tanks should be easy to implement and balance armor tanking also so that buffer tanking would also come possible for armor you simply would need time after fight to recovergiving missile damage bonus to all damage types would make caldari god race but it could be adjusted so that kinetic damage bonus could be brought down and adding launcherthis would make caldari less bound to kinetic but still make superior kinetic damagehere we come to the exact problem coercer is an amarr hull and destroyer included to that amarr hulls cannot fit crap thats the problem this the same on minmatar or gallente ships and you will be amazed even minmatars are active tank ships they do better in pvp armor fit that amarr even amarr is the armor tank race
that with td you should have read my post in the thread for ideas for new modules its how i would fight missiles and i listed racial weapon systems there which would fit those bills including the current defender missile but ok maybe i should make that its own thread so that it could be discussed fully another idea i have still to give deep thought would be decoy drones which should be a midslot item and screw targeting decoy will be attacked percentage chance and if hit destroyed so need to be relaunched if u implement td to screw missiles up i think you will op that system alot in that i just meant that the geddon will become a drone neut boat and could be fitted into the storyline so that id had been developed to fight sansha and blood raider and i also think that amarr are especially weak against neuts and td is equal between all gun systems i just dont think that amarr are flawed in that aspectok thats valid also i see very rarely a minmatar shield without invul but you are right i forgot armor in that aspect i may point something out so cap independent weaponsystems normaly have the lowest dps also high alpha which is making it in some cases worse in other better but i think it balances it somewhatso im running out of characters no quotations anymore my idea is to give lower boni not 10 back to 5 but let themchoose their missile types efficiently why should one missile be better than another if i fire them with the same specs and penalize the hulls another way to your thinking on sig radius penalties ok but drake already has a smaller sig radius unfitted compared to the brutix also i dont have the number how bad it effects the sig radius u still have to penalize them another way which way do u wantand lastly you are correct that some amarr ships are fatally flawed in slot layout in my opinion im also more of a buffer tanker in pvp tbh and thats where amarr is pretty good if u want to active tank ships thats gallente and last the passive armor regen i still dont like it its just a flavour but shield regens because your power plant regenerate the energy armor is physically damaged and needs to be effected actively to work
so you do not think then that ecm is not overpowered it affects every race ships there is no absolute immunity for it i believe please prove me wrong if i am it also affects remote reps and damage applicationso you do not think then that dampening is not overpowered its affects every race ships and there is no absolute immunity for it i believe please prove me wrong if i am it also affects remote reps and damage application very much compared to ecmso you do not think then that web scramble tp are not overpowered they affect every ship jada jada jada after this all consider again what i said also defender missiles nor decoy drones are not ewar types they are countermeasure ideas that should not mixed into ewar balancesi red some post over the forums and by judging your comments you fly caldari each of comment you have replied has hint that caldari ships need buffs did you ever fly anything bigger than frigate or cruiser for amarr i am curiouswhat comes about cap free weapon systems having bad alpha is also narrow sighted arties are cap free weapon system and due to slow rof of arties they have superior alpha included to versatile damage type that is just op yes your case applies to missiles and drones but not projectiles if you red my original post i actually support the idea to buff targeting speed for missile ship that would make the damage application faster i am bit uneasy about considering dropping rof of missiles and buffing the damage more than odyssey already does it could easily turn missiles into op weapon system since they are also versatile damage the suggestion of prefire missiles to space to lock on the locked target could already make it so that when the first wave would hit it could depending on weapon system and travel speed of ships make it so that it could be possible for 23 waves of missiles hit that could already make it severely op as alpha weaponi simply rose my own sincere concern of module fitting affecting the speed of how fast ship may be scanned out of space i would hope that armor and shield ships could be in balance in this no matter what you would fit into your ship perhaps replace signature radius with mass or similar when it came to scanning shipamarr are seriously flawed caldari also have some type of design mistakes hindering them but amarr are far behind both of them need to be brought same level with minmatar and gallente so eve can be more enjoyable game for everyone
just to make sure i fly amarr gallente caldari and soon minmatar bs also more in the carebearing compartment with some pirate excursions i personally think the pve wise caldari wins hands down pvp only through ecm also it got nerfed and i hate tracking disruption if i would have a say remove it completly and replace it with decoy drones or whatever because tracking disruption isnt a mod which makes sense in my opinion and yes decoy drones are counter measures which copy your ship signatures so that it reduces damage basically whats td doing right now just a weaker and working on multiple aggressors by the way i hate the way ecm works to it should be another way to make your ship alot harder to hit sensor damps maybe ok cant say how much but i dont think amarr are basically flawed they have some issues like the slot layout of some ships my fav ships are amarr harbinger and baddon maybe cap consuption is an issue on hulls after summer have to test that but the biggest issue is the ammunition and to the alpha like i said in some cases its great in others it sucks if u get under the tracking of artis they will never ever hit u and every ac fit i tried on cruisers battlecruiser loses to pulse and blasters
i do not like ecm td neut and dampening in the order i list them ecm is easy to counter yes but its one of the most awful form of ewar because it really gets everyone td is awful too i think both could be turned down just a little in terms of strength even i do not like the ewars i am not against any of the ewars they are suppose to be strong and disabling what is the problem is that the racial ewars are not in balance that has to changeso first you claim they are not flawed but in the same breath you do admit that several aspects of amarr asre simply flawed what comes to alpha or laser damage application itself resistance piercing should help with the damage application but not make the weapon system op depending on how it would be implemented of course and on what strengthsartillery is sniping weapon system same as beams or rail guns simply their alpha is unmatched because the slow rof and versatile damage type sniping weapon systems are planned to under track when you get to certain range
i think we are talking at cross purposes there i say that with removing all cap boni from the hulls it could get flawed i also dont think that the hulls are right now not basically flawed with exception of the 2 midslot hulls i think and thats what i said in my first post is that the crystals the ammunition is flawed the ranges work as intented but you should have 2 to 3 damage distributions available at each range thats why i linked the recomandation my idea of ecm is just that it doesnt jamm the targeted ship but works in a way that makes u lose the lock of enemy ships sensor damps i would like them to be more like chaff which disturbs the enemy sensors like ecm does just on a fleet wide basis and instead of tracking disruptors something like decoy drones they will only autolaunch when your ship or fleet members on watchlist lost their drones but thats just my thinking i think ewar needs a bad overhaul but i dont think that amarr is especially strong or weak in that regard and i also dont want to get everything the same way
after playing in sisi and flying t1 cruisers osprey and scythe i popped both of the hulls in level v mission scythe could speed tank about 75 of the level v fleet with rather sucky fit i could have pushed more into speed when i had desired that actually the npcs were only barely able to kill it but when i brought similar fit osprey it took about 10s to pop even only 2 bses and 1 gun was left scythe took 25390 damage before popping up osprey took 6036i have notified ccp fozzie in the t1 polish pass threadafter comparing values between the hulls i noticed that all t1 logistics have differences in speed and signature quite severe differences i consider this very bad because small ship hulls barely have any ehp and speed tanking gives scythe and other minmatar small ships too big advantage problem is that scythe has the smallest signature and best speed in fact scythe has almost 20 more speed than the other t1 logistic boats and smallest signaturethis is very flawed when minmatar cruiser can tank a fleet and in comparison caldari ship almost insta pops i am afraid that whole cruiser balance has been in vain if this is the case with other hulls as well
retracted because i am an idiot
op in current eve we have too many titans that dd weapons could work as this way it would ruin null sec play and make lot of players quit the game because they were killed in unfair aoe hitshowever it was not very long time ago when nikk narrel sugges
i too think torpedos need a buff in range or if not there in applied damage but i think u guys missing a real problem with all missiles their range is fixed so to reach the maximum range both ships have to be stationary if the targeted ship movesaway the range will melt down so basically u should take max range 10 to 25 as safety margin to get the actual range which would translate for torps if they have a theoretical range of 16km to a practical 14km maybe even lower now compare blasters u apply some damage at optimal  2 times the falloffim totally against td affecting missile hitting probabilities but i want a working variant of defender missiles posted something to that here 13th post on that site and maybe add something like decoys to the system which reduce the hit probability on the main hull but thats just a thought i had right now
hi jeanneas you probably know ccp is removing launchers from most of bs hulls and smaller hulls mostly dont ahve any missile slots except some minny hulls defenders is there for not viable way nor it should not be compared to ewar because this is about ewar balances i explained this to you in my thread for homogenization of the ships and systemsfor the ewars truly be in balance no one should be completely immune to them yes they should affect some ships  systems less but no one should be immuneewar balancing requires that td affects the misslessimple as that
i flown missions alot and tested the new ai too i was a drone user i nearly never use them now i kill frigs first because they scramb and web which is annoying when u fly low tank high dps and u rly have to get out but the problem is not the ai its thedrones overall worst mission i was watching my hob ii like a hawk and still lost 13 of them
their base damage is high than other weapon systems but it does not really even out well in my honest opinioni just wrote a thread that takes in account lasers single damage type also goes through different issues with laser weapon system hoping for the betterracial systems balancing and homogenization
laser is fine and any buff to laser will make weapon system as a whole more unbalanced as hybridmissile lags behind whatever armor tank and amar speed issues should be fixed separately
i read you thread and while i find it well written i disagree with the goal of homogenization i dont want every choice to be viable because if every choice is viable then there isnt a choiceplayers should have the rightability to choice the wrong weapon system or ship for the goal it laser dont work well against rat type a dont make that choice choose something else
did you read the thread i do not think you did homogenization doesnt mean every thing has to be the same there are attributes that can bring different things to balance without breaking the existing conceptsyou should give it a look
all i can ask is you to read the thread
bump to the original post lowsec is in dire need of balancing riskeffort to rewardlow sec would need major facelift now its too much risk and effort for the money you can makepersonally i would like to see less gate camps perhaps in return of this we could get bubbles to low sec since bubbles can be avoided yes they can be frigging horrid but still can be avoided i see gate camps big down fall of low sec because some gates are camped 247 and it can take forever to find right hole to pass through also low sec host quie big alliances and corps that control their part of low sec like it was their own low sec is not designed to be owned this should be prohibited and made more difficult if alliances and corporations want to own space they need to go to null period
i actually hope that ccp would come over the issues with missile systems and make caldari more into missiles right now its not possible because it would gimp the whole raceideas about balancing and homogenization of the races without making us all the same you can find in my thread racial systems balancing and homogenization
it would be nice to be able t skip the naff tracks again sorry ccp but not every track you paid jon hallur for was goldensuppose i will just have to start listening to ambiant stations on shoutcast
just like the gms and devs have one i would love to have a tag that would link to csm posts in a given thread you guys are fun to argue with make it happen thanks in advance draqone
no sir ive never even been up in a plane beforemake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
it would really help 
help whom
since this thread is technically about realismi dont see why not if thats how you floatso be itplease keep in mind that the spirit of this idea is not for perversion nudity or pornographic content of any kind simply looking for realism here
there is no reason at all that isboxer or any program like it should be allowed if macros are not allowed you may say that macros are different from isboxer but you would be wrong the only difference is that one allows you to be afk entirely while the other allows you to be afk from all but one account the only reason ccp wont do anything about isboxer is because a guy running 100 accounts even though all 100 accounts are paid for by isk buying plex it will be lost revenue
isboxer isnt a macroing programhope this helps
i dont think you understand how large the ice market is well both worry together when he starts hitting 1000 mackinawsfeel free to explain how isboxer is a botting tool well wait
if you seriously need it explained to you then it isnt worth the time
translation i dont have an argument because i dont really understand what isboxer actually does so heres a dismissive comment in which i pretend my point is selfevident and that you would have to be a fool not to see it yourself
nothing says sensible and well thought out idea like capitalizing half the post and demanding everyone cp it over and over again
forward this post to 30 people and ccp fozzie will send you shirtless pics
to actually be constructive all the numbers for compression rate youve all been throwing out are still pretty terrible its not a joke like the current rate but thats still alot of risk time and effort going into compressing ice down into something thats slightly less m3 than the worthwhile components of the refined productan ice belt in 00 is currently 5450000m3 and is worth roughly 1947880000 iskcompressed we get 545000m3 i think cba to checkrefined its 1689000m3 consisting of the following183750m3 isotopes  869750000 isk nitrogen prices arent exact351750m3 stront  44555000 isk646000m3 ozone  855950000 isk507500m3 heavy water  177625000 iskyoure most likely not going to manage to sell this in 00 cue some dumb pub chiming in about how he can mine all day in his mackinaw in syndicate and manage to sell it all youre going to lose money moving that stront so just throw it in a hangar and forget about it heavy water can be exported for a small profit but id rather not spend hours screwing with jf for tens of millions of iskso what 00 ice mongoloids are left with is 829750m3 worth about 172b per beltnow compare that to spending countless hours compressing  in a rorqual to end up with 545000m3 worth 194b per belteven if a rorqual can keep up with 10 hulks why would you want to bother leaving exposed capital ships all over the place youre better off mining out an anom refining it dumping the stront and water into a warehouse container and then finding a nice grav site to mine somewhere
1 stats should be holds the same  ability to grab ore ice from any bay  finish any bay300 increase in slots  someone suggested 6  1 per level perfect time  i think there should be a 5 reduction per level for manufacturing time related to prod
we need to go to kspace to sell our blue loots to sell t3 and to buy t2  faction  deadspace ship or moduleswe also can do t1 production in wspace we can build our moros or archon out of our gravimetric sites yet very few do it we still buy them in lsice mining wouldnt make wspace selfsufficient it would just be one more activity to do with le logistics drawbackeven if it was using the same mechanics than in kspace where it will respawn in the same limited set of systems it would make some system more valuable it would be something new to fight for
its just funny when people think wh dwellers would like to be isolatedadding ice belts would just remove redicilous hauling to make our towers stay onlineas mentioned in previous posts we need to visit hs all the timeice mining would give more action in whs with removal of grav sites people will mine less in whsso no more juicy targets give us ice and this will change less hassle with fuel blocks more time for pvp
to csm the post was my reply to the new nerf ccp fozzie is attemping to invoke i believe the chage would affect smallersolo groups of players more so then affect any supercap battle as fozzie has proclaimedwhy nerf the ships borne resists if the problem is in xxxl fleets i mean you could have just removed the 1 from the amor warfare link  passive defence and the siege warfare link  shield harmonizing modules you know the ones you ommited from your extended calculations these mods are generally used in larger fleets the buff the overpowered resist bonus these mods also get 100 per level buff when seigearmored warfare specialist is trained when skilled up a pilot can give and extra 125 to resist to his own fleet membersthat wasnt in your calculations nor the fact that a slight in the nerf in the defense of a ship is in fact only really affecting the smaller groups of players and the pve community where that 1 drop is infact a 20 pontetial loss from to a newer player but can be cut to roughly in half for fleeting playersthe best solution to this issue would be to leave the stats as is a nerf the seigearmored warfare specialist to 50 or the 1 base from the warfare links this way mega fleets can try a different tactic and the smaller gangs or solo pilots can still do there thing you dont have to buff anything and the masses dont have to be envolved in you mgl doctrinesps im forwarding this to the csms
because large fleets certainly dont ever use ships with resist bonuses
the idea is actually to buff ships with the active rep bonus in solosmall gang pvp by nerfing the resist bonus
that would only make sense if they nerfed every other bonus beside active rep bonus or of course they could just buff the active rep bonus if that is what they wanted to accomplish but instead they picked one single bonus and nerfed it so which of the ships with the bonus are so overpoweredhere are the ships that one would use in small gangs that have it  merlin punisher moa maller drake prophecy rokh abbadon are all these ships so overpowered they need a nerf i really havent done any battleship pvp lately but imo the others are either fine or could use a buff make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i fly many of the smaller hulls with resistance bonuses i have lot of love for abaddon but yet i would hope that ccp would remove such resistance bonuses since they give pretty much op for larger ships that are not capable avoiding damage with speedi also would like that smaller ship would have more even out speed and sig and ehp since right now minnies have really good evasion tank so that makes their smaller hulls really good standing against other race hullsso please no more res bonus and make the evasion tank similar for all the races so bigger and smaller ships can be in better balance
nerfing the little guy  ccp wants you in blobs where the fleet bonuses drowns out the ship nerf and makes it a nonnerf dont want to be nerfed join the blob
orcas cant help you by calling out roids when you are fleeted but mining in another belt so i vote yes to this one
1 anyway its done i want my range out to 30k would help with fleet placement in anomsyes i know i can tab from scanner to overview but overview will not indicate rocks being mined ok well i could just lookbut you know
they get it exactly but want fatty kill mails thats all
the idea is a simple oneit has many issues that would need ot be adressed and loopholes covered however i belive that the general playerbase of null is screaming out for some changes to be made with sov mechanics you will find few in favor of sov mechanics of today many people agree that the pos spamming it replaced at least provided more actual fightsmy ideahave sov be effected by activity x number of active pilots in space increases sov y per hour you could have other factors play into sov also possitive sov gains for enermy kills and negative gains for allied deaths one of the biggest plusses to this is an extention of the exisiting sov mechanics for upgrades at the corperate level sov will need to be used to hold italliances beaten back to their home system would never be forced off the map entirely by larger alliance blocks due to concentraion of players while larger alliances will have to work harder to maintain their spacewhat do you thinkclearly not a full drafted idea i wanted eves input pchun tzu
wowtheres some flawed logic for youi cant say that i can think of a single asset in the real world that makes a soldier on the ground kill more efficiently or resist attack more efficientlyyou are comparing fleet boosters to longbow archersyou know what this just isnt worth my timedo away with off grid fleet boosters anybody with a brain will understand why
why is there so much hostility towards bitcoins ive mined a couple hundred  as it is now and id love to spend them on eveyou dont even have to touch them you can just partner with an exchange and the bitcoins are instantly exchanged into  and the payer has to take whatever the current exchange rate is theres literally no reason not to do this theres zero risk to eveccp and zero impact on the economyseriously go look up services like vpns that accept bitcoins they never even touch them
op very good post  however i would not put fingers on few ccp employees ccp has also people responsible to look over the community in anyway i think ccp is to blame as a whole the critisism again ccp is justified they neglected player input also th
i see it still simply that they wanted to move the old typhoon problem to amarr it got removed from one race now it has to be bestowed to other its very sad amarr needs flexibility but this is ridiculous you put missile slots and drones on that boat both being 2ndary weapon system for amarr and now if you want to fly geddon you need both changes made to geddon was very short sighted yes its good ship its simply not amarr what needs changing is how lasers work in overall not that we get complete weapon system screw over lasers are most  weapon system in game and people fit projectiles guns to amarr ships that have laser bonuses that is screwed balance out laser now please
smaller minmatar ships are op due to this some minny ships have about 20 more speed in comparison to other ships that already means that 1 they can catch up anyone 2 they can run if they are not tackled 3 that 20 speed adds lot to speed tank on its ownyou add smaller signature to that 20 speed and you get evasion gods that are hard to scan more difficult to hit minmatars should have more signature radius in comparison to compensate all that what they get from the 20 speedgizznitt i do not agree with everything with kenshin said but she has a point ccp employees have over looked the threads and the comments there are some changes that do bother the community at least those flying those racial ships her concern is valid and i am glad someone speak out you have proved that you are unable to take her feedback and instead of giving building critisism you troll that makes you less in my eyeswhen you are happy with the changes and the continous winmatar online you do not have to bring it on everyone else
while i heartily approve of adding more and more intuitive information to the existing tactical overlay what youre talking about is a completely new gameand while i loved playing it in its day this is not sfbst
if you dont understand the significance of this proposal you can use google and research it chances are it doesnt concern you directly otherwise youd already know whom it is supposed to help
yeah people could use google or you could actually make a decent proposal with reasoning you know the normal way of trying to get attention and support for your idea
if you cant provide a valid reason why it should happen and expect us to do the leg work of figuring out why youve failed the first hurdle of crafting a good proposal
as i have absolutely no idea why you or anyone else would find this appealing i am going to give my standard kids just asked me a random question that requires a yes or no answer responseno go clean your room
nah its obvious you jita tycoons fear any competition from new areas gallente either you know exactly why this proposal is here without explanation or you have no credibility on the subject to begin with and thus unqualified
its obvious you misunderstand the point of a proposal you dont take an idea to a corporate chair meeting and say do this if you dont know why then you arent worthy sorry that just doesnt fly without a valid reasoning behind your proposal it loses all credibility and thus will be ignored by anybody that would be able to effect such a changecongrats on your failure of a proposal
at best i can figure out from the lack of content in this thread youre whinging on about having to make 4 high sec jumps through 8 and 9 systems instead of just oneall i can say to that is please biomass your character
i must admit i would like to see some change but what that change is i cannot say i currently live in a class 5 wormhole and the biggest issue with living there the 3 hour timer is exhausting and imo over zealous i feel like the reduced minerals for a quick refine would be fair but both seems to hinder the aspect of the game now that wormholes are occupied space wormholes where never intended to be occupied according to ccp so i would like to see some changes possibly for wormholes only like the cap hanger array change that is coming
this doesnt make any sense youre saying the person is at the keyboard  that theyre somehow afk aswell
you claimed isboxer is a botting tool when it isnt you were asked to explain your theory  refused because isboxer isnt a botting tool
you have to be at the keyboard to do anything with isboxer thus its not a bot program botting is when you go to sleep and your accounts still mine ice try that with isboxer i will enjoy seeing your kill mails in the new orders front page
this would be a great idea if you could balance it out being able to fly a super indy ship is an awesome idea keep it like the other supers where it cant dock and people would be able to live out in those non station low secs or live in null sec areas where your not allowed to dock and mine up the ore as long as we have enough build slots and some research slots i think this would be one hell of a ship to fly also omg the tears when this thing dies
just give us ice living in a wormhole hauling ice in with mass restrictions is painful hell we would settle for crappy high sec ice if we had to just give us the stuff we need for fuel also no wormhole is ever locked down dont believe me go watch a clarion call you can find any hole you want
this would be really nice feature and gives us more clear view that csm and ccp were actually going through the feedback
this is to improve the risk vs reward mechanic that defines the soul of this game at present in faction warfare loyalty point farmers have it all too easy by stacking their lowslots with warp core stabilizers and get to make their money too easily i propose that bubbles formed by interdictor ships are allowed in lowsec for the purpose of capturing these farmers mobile warp disruption bubbles need not be implemented in lowsec
this is not the waywarp core stabilized lp farmers frustrate us all well probably not each other be creative to catch them or just ignore them theyre not really any worse than the cloaky lp farmers or the lp farmers who watch their directional scanner and then just move really fast to stay out of engagement rangea better way would be to roll back the timer when theyre not in range at twice the rate it runs down or something
 no bubbles are the reason i stay out of nullsec
leave it to a fellow player to take it to the lowest level how often do you pay to see thati mine
okay so you lead with some uhyknow im sry i realized it wasnt worth my timegood luck yer gonna need it
just weighing in to say that i am glad newer players are capable of challenging me i dont want to play a game where i get to walk all over a gang of players who have only been playing for 3 months simply because i can fly bigger badder ships if they manage to catch and engage me with the right ships they should win expensive toys should not make you invincibleand if thats the best example you have of a smartass comment showing a lack of respect you dont really have a case he was using a little bit of sarcastic humor to defuse the argument i think hes been very good for eve and will continue to make improvements until such time as he nerfs something i really love and then ill want him fired you see humor ill never want him fired  thats ridiculousi dont have a problem with any of the other issues you raised im part of the community please stop complaining in my name because im happy
1 give us our damn jukebox you mean spirited goons
quotecaesar ixxall good theater film and gaming experiences rely on an audiencesparticipants ability to suspend disbelief by removing the jukebox feature and making me go into the real world to manipulate my ambient sound while playing you have substantially diminished my ability to suspend disbelief as a result i enjoy the game less and you as a company provide less value this
bring back the music of our own control please i know that old phrase eve has sound
botting is not only when you are afk botting is when you use any automated process
and isboxer isnt automated move along
yes it is you move along
it doesnt automate a thing let me guess you havent actually used itotherwise you would understand how this differs from bottlingyou either dont understand what multiboxing is dont understand what botting is or fail to understand what both are and how tremendously different they are from each other
this is very true however that still does not mean the rorqual will not be even more broken after oddessy you are forgetting one major fact in your plan however how are you suspose to get the 54 million m3 from your ice belt to a refinery 3 jumps away to refine it your plan work fine if there is a refinery in an icebelt system but lets face it not very many system in nullsec have station in an ice belt systemso you can now see that the fixing of the rorquals compression is very needed and or make a pos module for compression if they do not want to fix the rorqualthanks for your input
build a refineryoranchor a pos with a shitload of chas to dump ice intohave freighters haul from ive considered this you can fit 40 chas on a large minmatar tower for a combined 60m m3 cargospaceandoranchor a pos with a jb that points to a refining systemi dont disagree that ice compression is broken my point is that its so broken that assuming ccp even wants it as a mechanic its going to need either a complete overhaul posstation compression or an absolutely massive boost to the amount of ice products that can be compressed in a rorq at any timein the meantime we can just hide the stront and heavy water in a container somewhere and consider it a writeoffe for comparison the 78m m3 large grav site compresses into roughly 50k m3 after the patch its worth roughly the same as the proposed lowtruesec ice anom at current ore and ice prices
you still need to sell the sleeper loot get resupplied and to find people to explodeso no we would nothowever it would increase mining operations in wspace and increase targets toexplodei personally enjoy making explosions dont you
if you think that wspace is isolated and that you dont interact with people then you have absolutely no clue what youre talking abouteven if you close your static you still have k162s coming in you still have errant outbounds some that go to null ls even hs like you said eve is a sandbox just because i dont like to play in your corner doesnt mean you should dictate what we put in ours
hmm i think the idea is so and so but after thinking it a bit i like the idea i lived in wh for quite sometime and regular mining and sites nor pvp doesnt really keep you busy since for pvp you kinda need a gang sites you need also hole scouts kind of if ice belts would be added to wh it would mean that people that did not have gangs could so something smaller risk also when ice was in whs it would mean that wh corps wouldnt need to transport goods so often causing that stuff would stockpile in poses so when you eventually get blow one up well just imaginei believe that in overall this would be a good change gameplay wise sure it can have effect that i cannot figure out just now anyway1 until someone proves me wrong
have the ice randomly spawn in class 4s make them worth something an no i dont live in one anymore anyway
i fully endorse this product
two small additions to the rules possibly enforced within game limits1 if a tower is onlining it should not be possible to light a cynosural field within forcefield size  3km range of the tower2 if a cynosural field is lit inside forcefield size  3km range of a tower it should not be possible to online the forcefieldlighting cynosural fields five seconds or so before the forcefield of a tower goes online is spreading like wildfire i dont see how this is not already enforced within the limits of the game since it provides options to move capital ships with near absolute safety
noratting  activity  the only way to use sovanything to do with kills is horrifically exploitablesov upgrades are already handled at a corp level just that corp is usually the executor corp of the alliancethis is completely against the design philosophy of the gameforcing people to pve the second most horrendously boring thing to do in the game after mining is the worst thing you could do to 00 and the game as a whole
activity based sov has been proposed many times please to a forum search there are many ways people use their space science  industryrattingmininglogisticsmarketstagingand more i agree that using space should be a solid part of the sov game and we all know sov in its current form is flawed im still of the opinion sov should be taken with a bang and lost with a bang but the ease at which sov is lost should probably be tied into how much a system is used this is very difficult to measure though
fix the cloaking cloaking devises are high slots  i say battleships and up should be able to run them and maintain being cap stable but cruiser and down should not be able to continue to run them without running out of cap  should not be cap stableand or  make cloaking ships able to be scanned down with a system scanner or certain scanning skillsalso my thoughts on system jammers is that if you are running a system jammer in your system  that should make all cynos covert cynos included jammable with this said  unless your in a large alliance which is still no guarantee  you as a independent corporation will not surviveive been playing eve since 2003 beta and used to be with the large alliances but grew tired of the ongoing bs politics ive gone the independent route and since have seen nothing but everything in each patch laughs upgrades go for the pirates of the game and screw the industrial side no benefits for the miners out thereoh wait they gave us and useless mining frig lmao there is no safe space  not even in 1 sec status where it is supposed to beeves pathetic sandbox approach is only good for the pirateganker i will not be wasting my money on this game anymore nor will i be having anything to do with ccp or their obvious money grab for their 10 year collectors packageyes im sure to be flamed by the wannabe pirates and gankers and yes some are really good at what they do and dont rely on cheap tactics to do it the 1 vs 1 is long gone along with any honor that went with itbut this game was to be for all types of game play and not all people want to pvp unfortunately ccp sees it differently  promises one thing but does not provide in the end surprise surprise  good luck to the remaining industrialists out in eve
use dscan minimize localits not that scary trust me stop being a wussand bo cynos were designed to go behind enemy lines and jammed systemsyouve been playing since 2003 i would like to have your stuff
thanks for proving my point
 this has been said over over and over again so far i havent heard any decent reasoning not to do it
10
no
look at all the low sec implant buyers lol not sure this is the way to get new pilots to try out nullerrr i mean low secbut hey 1 from me lol
f nullhell to the no
yeah this wont be abused
negative ghost rider the pattern is full
when its recognized as a legitimate instead of seized by the law for criminal activities then i may consider it somewhere below paypal which i dont use either because its not secure there is every risk to ccpthe player as there is no recourse of fraud outside of the bitcoin universe at least when i invest in precious medals and gems i have a tangible asset to represent my investment instead of a possible encrypted hash in a log somewhere
ccp has broken all the rules and barriers in the mmo realm bitcoin does the same to currencies and the concept of monetary independence trust in the hash because it only gets better
while the racial traits havent been balanced in the past ccp has done quite a bit to improve the balance while still maintaining flavor for example blaster tracking was improved to match their upcloseandpersonal use null was brought more inline with barrage tracking enhancers are being nerfed ship speeds have been significantly rebalanced so while the stabber might travel 30 fasters than a caracal or thorax its damage is pretty poor while your three points make holding down vagas and cynnabals very hard i dont think the proposed changes to minmatar battleships is going to make them suddenly overpowered your points are mostly moot at the bs combat tier i personally have felt like ccp reads and responds to the threads very well they may not respond to every single reply and couldntshouldnt but theyve definitely listened to feedback and responded those threads have tons of dev reply posts explaining why they made some of the changes they have noting revisions they made due to feedback noting areas that still need reworking etc how can you possibly justify your statement that ccp employees have overlooked the threads and the comments click on any of those threads and just keep clicking the blue icon under the devs name to skip from dev response to dev response there are many dev replies in those threads and i just dont understand how you can possibly justify your statement please how about you reply with exactly what ccp has overlooked rather than some broad ambiguous statement and while i definitely did not respond to kenshi in a pleasant tone i did not troll her either i gave legit feedback perhaps in a demeaning manner on almost everything she brought up now the reason i was so terse was because of this this statement frankly pissed me off it was not backed up with any relevant or incriminating posts was brutal towards ccp employees that i personally think are doing an excellent job and frankly was deceitful when replying to such overthetop slander i replied with lots of contempt mockery and scorn while still addressing the points brought up sorry if you think it was a troll perhaps my shock at the ops audacity simply got the better of me
actually i referred to t1 logistics my personal opinion is that scythe makes superior roam hull for one because of speed and sig and believe that this is in general problem with smaller minmatar hulls since speed and sig means too much for small hullswhat comes to bs i actually hope that they would not make significant differences between races to bs because bses are about ehp and damage also bad tracking so hopefully every race would be bs hull that was high in ehp also goodish in damage and also bad at tracking and bad at speed and sig but well thats already many subjects that do not really belong to this thread thank you for taking the time and making proper reply i admit that kenshi did make quite and aggressive over statement ccp rise is valued player that knows the game and to be honest those things that people blame on him are not really his making like change of geddon well he chose the bs hull it was going to happen to but if he had chosen apocalypse the rage had been the same for that i am sure i am cross trained pilot and i am not very happy of current amarr ship development nor balance odyssey will make some things better but also make things worse for amarr and that is sadhowever what comes to ccp responding you can see tons of post in the dev threads where ccp employees did reply like 12 weeks ago the threads are there people discuss there are trolling and unconstructive critisism yes that will be always the case when you deal with such games sadly but there are also sincere worries and questions ccp do not care to answer that really makes me to  off thats why i believe kenshin post is justified even though it could have been done in less severe mannerin overall i am calm but sad that with those good and nice chances in odyssey there seem to come lot of changes that i cannot easily digest what makes it worse is that ccp is not ready to speak about them and replying questions nor responding worries that sincere players have from upcoming changes so i am disappointed to ccp how they act i did already consider even deleting my accounts since i really lost hope that they could make amarr enjoyable race to play instead i am revoking my minny alts and start to play with rust buckets which is not perfect because thats not how i want to play to game however i am not as upsetanyway thank you for taking time to calm and making a good post
im gonna indulge your silly whine post but i want to be very clear beforehand that neither you or i speak for anyone other than ourselvesamarr1 abbadon needs the 5 resistancelevel bonus due to the alpha fleet doctrines not that it matter much there anyway with hundreds of ships shooting you in the face but at least it may just cause enough of a difference for logistics to save youby that logic every battleship needs a bonus to buffer tanking yet only 2 have it the abbadon has long been the premier armor buffer tank bs outperforming nearly any other in that role even at amarr bs iv 2 apocalypse is the iconic amarr laser sniping bs yet it is unable to fit nor use tachyon lasers 1400mm arty  425mm equivalents if you do manage to fit them you have to choose between firing guns or tanking or not having a tank this is unacceptableccp has stated that adjustments to beams are coming in the near future complaint dismissed3 according to the original dev blogs source in amarr bs thread link the armaggedon was not to be changed yet now it losses the cap bonus to lasers becomes a drone boat and a mini bhaalgorn there communitys disgust has been beat to death and necromancy applied with regards to thispoint a is nonsense ccp has every right to change their mind that said i agree that the poor mans bhaalgorn is a terrible idea and a massive unneeded nerf to already gimped triage carriers4 lasers cap use is prohibitive and causes many of the existing issues with amarr ships cap use is 335x the cap use of the equivalent hybrid weapon the issue is especially noticeable with regards to beam lasersyou already made this complaint in regards to the apoc redundant complaining is not needed5 laser powergrid requirements are also too draconian to allow their fitting to amarr ships that are supposed to use themagain i assume that you are either referring to beams already addressed twice or have never actually fit an amarr ship with pulse lasers as they fit just fine albeit tightly in the majority of casescaldari1 missile mechanics need work to make them viable against turrets there are numerous ideas suggested by playersbe more specific light missiles are incredibly popular in the meta and mediums were long op and overused yet have still seen widespread use post nerf cruises will be getting a pass in the near futureso what exactly is your complaint here2 the raven had no tank to begin with the proposed raven has less tank than any other bs other than the scorpioncorrect me if i am wrong but the raven is getting another midslot dismissed3 the scorpion is crap as the ecm mechanic is broken fix that before making blanket changes to that ship better yet give the caldari pilots a useful combat battleship as the only useful pvp caldari battleship is the rokhill admit that the ecm mechanic is dookie but the scorpion is hardly crap and is regularly used in the current meta of both small gang and blob warfareminmatar1 their sig radius is much to small compared to their equivalents of the other three racesmuch too small really ill add that they make sacrifices in other areas like tank and dpsgallente1 hyperion proposed is and will be completely op compared to the competitionthis remains to be seen and can be dismissed on the basis of being purely speculation2 the dominix change was nice and that is the only one i likedim glad you found something you dont feel the need to complain about
i just hope you get rid of the f11 map and change it for something more appealing the star map is a mess it could be cool if we have a kind of zoom system where you can see all the regions as land masses and you can click on one  and boom you have the region and description you have only the region actually you can also add an option to see the other region attach to it you clicked and now you can see all the constellations region you click on one constellation and boom it zoom on it and now you can see all the solar systems you click on one system and boom you see the system and you can manage all the filter for each zoom so its less messy we can keep the option in 2d or 3d3d its cool so you can easily rotate only the region or the constellation and not being confuse by all the others and please for god sake the solar system map with only line and dot can be amazing to click on each planet and see the planet system with all their moons and station landmark asteroid field etc and be able to apply the filters for each planet systemcan be awesome with the next expansion of odyssey with all the exploration revampprosyou need just 5 min when you login to check what is going on in the universe with the filteryou dont need to know what going on 3 region away when you try to see if you have actions or camping 3 system awaymore clear view better use of the universe mapgood focus of what going on in the region constellation and systemgives room around the region to put some stats without occluding and messing with the other region that you dont lookesthetic consget rid of f11can slow down the performance but we can adjust with some graphic option and filterwishrevamp solar system map change icon for sun planets moon etc able to get a central zoom on each planet system
then explain to us all how isboxer supposedly requires zero human input to function
i dont disagree with you either there are many ways to move the iceore product as you pointed above but again that are some flaws in your plan you are assuming that you are a large alliance that owns the station and systems if you are a renter you might not be able to anchor jump bridges to station systems just for ice mining alliance use them for more tactical uses sadly and i find it easier to use a large ship assembly array or two instead of the bazillion corporate hanger arrays but that still leaves rorqual 1 rorqual like 16 hours to compress all the ice just from one anomaly it mine at that rate it will never be compressed and yes refining it now is the way to go unlike before when people could mine 50k dark glitter blocks refining that was not much of an improvement honestly but by forcing miners to mine all the ice the refine m3 is a lot better as you suggestedtanks for your inputloney
wait you can dump ice into assembly arrays im not sure you can but i might throw up a csaa or two in a couple systems if ice prices stay high enough
so youre angry because you missed out on a kill i guess
perfectly legitimate use of game mechanicssorry about your missed carrier kill not really no one cares
what does that have to do with anythingyou cant light a cynosural field inside a forcefield why should this be possible
id like ccp to look at the sec status system currently only players with 5 or lower can be freely engaged depending on the nature of the highsec system my proposal is to make highsec more dangerous for players with low security status ergo raise the sec status required to safely travel through hisec with respect to being not a freeforall target by otherssec status system level1 115 092 083 074 065 05in the method described above a player with only a slightly low sec status will gain criminal status in the more secure portions of hisec a player with only 1 sec status can be freely engaged by all players in a 10 system similarly a player with 3 may be freely engaged by all players in a 07 level system pirates want pvp but also want immunity from the game when doing so nothing stops you from ganking someone functionally nothing will change for players with 5 or lower already concord does not protect it punishes the guilty by making pirates targets of opportunity to others relative to the system level theyre in i think this will give the pirates more fights as they claim they want the only problem they would conceivably have is that the fight is no longer always on their terms sec status is a small price to pay compared to the victim and his ship
most of us agree we dont like off grid boosters it now its time to offer solutions to make the change and not just say a change needs to be madethe current hold on this fix seems to be that they are having programming issues making it on grid onlya simpleish solution to require boosters to be on grid  make warfare link mods act similar to warp disruption field generators giving the warfare link a bubble range of around 250km  300km affecting friendly targets thus forcing them to be on gridplease add any ideas that you think might work that are manageable for the programmers to implement
i like to get some more realism to the eve universe and i was thinking about this please post your thoughtsin real life things get broken due to the use if you drive a car for sure you know how expensive is the maintenance of the different engines to get everything working properly and because is really important that nothing from your car breaks when you drive through the highwayso i think that could be a beautiful idea and bring some more connection between the capsuler and the ships they pilot if we take care of them you know cleaning the engines changing oil or add more pressure to the air injector and that stuffhow it will workmodules will have a new attribute called malfunction that starts with 0  with every new modulethe level of malfunction will increase in different ways depends on the module turrets and active modules will increase malfunction a value for each cycle others when the ship get some damage some electronics could be if the capacitor gets emptyinsert here a thousand examples this value accumulates and represents a chance of something getting wrong with that modulefor exampleif you activate an afterburner maybe every 100 times the malfunction rises 1  if the malfunction is high enough that module could get suddenly some random damage or get offlinedyou could reset the malfunction  to 0 in a maintenance service in every station should be cheaper than the repair quotes but must be done periodically to get sure that your ship is finesome ships should be cheaper to maintain than others obviously as bigger and complex is the ship more expensive is the maintenancethe point is to represent the randomness of the real life sometimes things get broken spontaneusly specially if we donUFFFDt take care of themcleaning the dust of the space from the engines of your shipfor low security 00 and wormholes i think that could be some facility for the poses similar to a repair one yes living in the wild side should be hard if you are living in the deep space is normal that your ship doesnt recive the maintenance enough unless you build a facility for thatsome skills could make rise the malfunction slower representing your knowledge of mechanicstell me what you think and excuse my englishexamples boost speed modules microwarp drives etcget malfunction by0001 per cycle00000001 per second at top speedrandom failure when activatedcap speed boost a random value put offlineresistance modulesget malfunction by0001 when absorbs damagerandom failure when activated fail the damage absortion put offlineturrets and missile baysget malfunction by0001 per cycle00000001 per second when overloadrandom failure when activatedno shooting fail the cycleget real damage to the module overheat put offlinerepairing lower values of malfunction are cheaper than highest lol obviously the cost of the maintenance should increase exponentially respect the value of the malfunction maybe a value above 20 is more expensive than a new module so you can sell the old one with the malfunctionmarketthis will open more market to used items cheaper ones that maybe stop working suddenly millenium falcon stylei think that could bring so many posibilities and bring more depth to the universe of eve
only question how do you propose to handle cases where people dont have ready station access stationstarved 00 deep wh space supercapitals perhaps a maintenance function on smas
doesnt sound very good idea to me however i would like to see wearing of modules in use and repair of them with similar counterparts you could use t1 modules to repair but would gain bonus from meta level this would ensure module and mineral prices would stay up also bump flow to economy wearing out in my case simply means damaging of modules like they would under overheating there could be skill to reduce the damage from use too but it should not take it completely out also there should be tax in this to drive money out of the economy

cloaking isnt broken cynos arent broken you have all the same tools available as everyone else to mitigate risks avoid ganks  so on choosing not to use them is your own fault not ccps
coming from a guy in one of the larger alliances
bs or bigger no makes no sense some counter to it skill or module maybe that idea has traction no blackops are made to get past jammers it is what they dotwice wrong miners have been given more tank and more options there are folks making billions with your useless mining frigs and nowhere is new eden is supposed to be safe that is working as intendedmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
the amount of butthurt in the ops post is off the scale jint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
the cloaking stuff has already been talked about to death and shouldnt be changed but as an industrialist i cannot refuse the bait you have left here so here goesto begin i am not a pirate i have never ganked i do not scam and rarely pvp i am a miner i build ships weapons and ammo more recently ive started getting into exploration i am not here to flame you i am here to try and show you just how flawed everything youve said is
if ad hominem is the best way for you to argue maybe you should stop posting
i live in a place where local doesnt exist and as such afk cloaking doesnt existit doesnt stop me at all in fact i like it i find myself more immersed in the game paying more attentionstop being scared
heres the solution
as there are many threads in assembly hall regarding the same topic some of them actually quite large and elaborate this thread gets a lock16 redundant and reposted threads will be locked as a courtesy to other forum users please search to see if there is a thread already open on the topic you wish to discuss if so please place your comments there instead multiple threads on the same subject clutter up the forums needlessly causing good feedback and ideas to be lost please keep discussions regarding a topic to a single thread isd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
or simply add a mechanic to wcss that fitting more than one reduces by a certain percentage the amount of energy that a ships cap can hold by you might be able to fit 2 wcss but then actually initiating a warp would take some caution all its own because now the counter to a stabbed ship in fw would be a simple neut or nosthis way a global change to fw is not necessary and now theres a risk to stabbing out a ship for farming fw that balances maybe the rewardsme zips up her flameresistant suit
then people will be back here next week complaining about cloaky ships in faction warfare complexes the problem is the almost norisk aspect of this activity at least if the timer burned back the other direction when they were away from the beacon there would be risk that you wouldnt earn any lp and sooner or later theyd either quit or start fighting and maybe team up like others do
bitcoin as a currency is essentially worthless anyone that accepts it as a valid form of currency is an idiot
if you arent okay with investing in bitcoins thats fine theyre not for everyone the idea obviously appeals to some people and i dont see why we shouldnt include more payment options theres also absolutely no risk to ccp they are paired with an exchange and they have nothing to do with the bitcoins directly ccp does not accept bitcoins they accept cash which is given to them by the exchange that accepts bitcoins

thanks for the feedbackapologies for the late reply my forum notifications dont seem to be informing me if responses to my topics are madeim aware of the current similarities between the mi and pi cc range detailed in the document with the revised 30 version this has been combined into a singular entry for civilian military and social network types the differences being the industrial networks on moons which now replace the whole moongoo processing functions served by towerswith regards to your comments about planet habitabilityits an option to revise it but we dont want to make valuable planets like storm lavas and plasmas more habitable for civilian pi since theyll become dominantly op planet types given all the dimensions of this proposaldust deployment buildingsand i dont see why starports as they are proposed cant serve as the building type to drop off dust mercs and equipment for planetary battles with eve ships in addition to the already available orbital battle barge mechanics for dust deploymentalso why youd need an office building on networks to tie in dust contracts with district  city owners when this could b e a simple piui upgrade
i said nothing about automation i said that i believe that based from ccps own eula isboxer and programs similar to it does if fact facilitate the process of multiboxing to a degree far beyond the capabilities of other normal multiboxing techniques it allows one person to make isk at an impossible rate yes one person is giving manual commands that not what i believe is the issue i believe its when that one command automatically goes to multiple many clients thats a problem ccp soundwave said it best eve is about the interactions of the players in eve people are meant to playwork together not by themselves acting as a one man navybutthanks hexer and sir marksalotcheating or not it should still be evaluated imoif a csm gm or dev can validate that old statement andor formally ammendends their eula then this issue imo is resolved this eve after all and we all want more isk
from what i understand isboxer can be used on multiple machines to run multiple accounts per machinewhat happens if someone uses another program to goof the data being sent over the network is there protection against thatcould that be automated via some packet record and playback functionis it something that all the eve clients can detectbesides that a quick look at the isboxer site has this
that gm post was made a couple of weeks before fanfest so its not an old statement

 it allows one person to make isk at an impossible rate this is not true in the slightest take however many accounts are in question and that is exactly how much isk that many accounts with that many people logged in can make infact multiboxing may decrease the amount of isk earned if you calculate in setup times relogging having to fix desyncs etc so that is a total fallacy and i have to assume you are talking out of your ss here because if you have actually used the software you wouldnt be claiming the things you are ccp has in the past both distant and recent stated this is okay which you even quoted me from so please dont try to tell me what ccp thinks without a solid quote that definitely answers a question ccp said eve is about x that answers nothing leleouch has literally stated multiboxing software is acceptable that should be enough i doubt it will be so please drone on and lets see where the big bad users of technology touched you
it has always been a mystery and different sources talk about different thingsi personally want to vote for a massive jovian invasion to high secat least for a short period of time no safe space market interruption mining slaughters sov spaces attacked by unbeatable aliens foe alliances working togetherfinally after some time jovians leaveloot left behind jovian tech bpoUFFFDs ships modules superclone facilities ability to develop augmentations without buying the stuff although that the clone dies after a period of timecome on guys give me some extra fun with the background that has already been built
they arent doing anything with the jove there is no need for anything to happen with them
id like this idea if it labelled which csm the person belonged to if the person was a member of multiple csm perhaps just listing the most recent one or having a history of this somewhere on the forum profile this way players like myself who sometimes post on the forums but do not deal much with csm members can identify if we are talking to a current member or an old csm member
given that i smell a prosub cap lobbyist with ambitions of risk free capital warfare im going to point out the followingcloaky stabbed t3s with interdiction nullifers please explain to me how this is risky travel for sub caps and why it shouldnt be fixed
your proposal smells of wahhh someone make clever use of game mechanics me no get kill
and you have no other argument at all just the assumption that i was negatively affected by it dont really expect much more from a goonie but i expected at least somethingsubcaps should be able to operate on their own easily but this is not the way capital ships are designed they are supposed to be supported but having them travel around like this poses them no risk at all no matter how big and helpless the ship it is not an intentional feature
given that were not comparing spaceships with reallife naval examples id have to point out that generations of scifi writers and tv shows disagree with your opinion on what capital ships should be
i am defining capital ships as they were designed for eve
i have not yet seen ccp say anything to that effect how do you know its not intended do you work for ccp
on the very point  big bump 1let see as the pirates either ignore or come trolling d
one other thing i should have mentioned earlier is that this change is also a buff to lowsec as now any player in 04 systems or lower may freely engage any other player so long as both players have at least 1 sec status without suffering further sec status lossesi proposed this change as a response to the ability to buy sec status with tags while tags dont drop terribly frequently they do drop often enough as it is and are mostly collected by mission runners anyway making the now more easily repaired sec status more penalising for highsec pirates seems fair and will encourage people to use those tags more often instead of stockpiling them or otherwise artificially inflating their prices
hell no

i want you to tell a pvp pilot to reship into a prober and dont say  a probing alt would work  because i have yet to meet the man who can simultaniously fight and play the scanning game additionally it is almost impossible to scan down a ship in a time line acceptable to make any kind of impact on a fightoff grid boosting should be the realm of capital ships rorquals titans super carriers etc and not for day to day pvp shipsadditionally i think it would be cool to make off grid boosters anchorable objects in solar systems with reasonable hitpoints making these structures natural small gang targets
i would really like to be able to put my corp coat of arms in my pvp shipsis this so difficult
been proposed so many times beforehowever ccp do need to sort their shiz out and do thisjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
its been proposed many times ccp has said they will eventually implement thisno further discussion requiredUFFFD
learn to use this for the love of god
currently ecm is the only mechanic that is randomized and it is loathed because of this the only reason the playerbase has not called for its outright removal is because it is so damn usefulcreating randomized events that no one has any control over wont make things more interesting rather it will just make people madthis is especially so in pvp where you often have to push your ship modules and weapons to the limit i mean this literally overheating your modules and weapons is routine the last thing you want is something beyond your ability to managemitigate tell you nope  happensrealism is nice and all but this is a case where it adding such a mechanic would just add needless problems for the sake of having problems
that would happen if you dont do a maintenanceperiodically maybe every week or somethinmg like thatthe idea is that if you do the maintenance nothing strange would happen but if you dont take care for long time maybe just maybe something bad could happenalso i really like the used items market dontt think about the numbers i just want to expose teh concept
 i like these guys  it would be virtually impossible for any person to try an operate multiple accounts in a way this software allows
in years past alts were banned as they were seen as an unfair advantage of course what happened was people got good at hiding it and so only the people who broke the rules got the rewardin years past any form of rmt was banned as it was seen as an unfair advantage of course what happened was people got good at hiding it and so only the people who broke the rules got the rewardthe solutions to both of these was to legitimise the practice legal alts and plex respectably which made it fair for everyonethe same applies here  outlaw using isboxer to do legit multiboxing and instead only the people who know how to avoid detection and i can think of 5 ways just off the top of my head will get the advantage of itor just use logic and see why its silly to ban what is essentially just clicking the same button in more than one windowedit isboxer was outlawed until someone proved they could walk right around the ruling as written by just taping the keys together on his keyboard at that point ccp got the point
e i didnt see it at first either but there you go
isboxer can and is often used with the ability to duplicate commands to different accounts turned off i use isboxer to simply organize and see different windows for my alt accounts i still have to move the mouse to different windows or make that window primary to issue any commands if i am running three accounts i have to activate f1 three times to get my accounts to do whatever f1 is while in control of that accounts screen it is because the program can be used like this that i say snip please refrain from personal attacks isd ezwal i have no problems with the people who use the program in other ways as long as that use falls within the limits ccp has set
safrrr beast branded ellen thrace khanhrhh ace uoweme vertisce soritenshi and any others i may have missedsnip please refrain from personal attacks isd ezwali would like you to define normal multiboxing techniques as i already know you cant cause it a subjective term meaning how you think it should be does not make it right so please stop wasting everyones time about stuff ccp has already put many man hours into and determined it is authorized and does not break the rulesthanksedit added some pics for those that cant comprehend what isboxer and other similar software really does it just makes things look more pretty this is and example of a triple screen setup i found with roughly 2629 accounts it seemsbefore isboxer img
ha you very right ok im done thank you again sir mixalot either way i have to go get me some
1 is boxer is utter bull its a 3rd party program that grats a rather significant advantage compared to players who do not utilize it if thats not against the eula then i dont know what is
have you used it if not then you dont know what advantages or disadvantages it provides beyond your bias and also if you read the thread you will see a post from a senior gm that clearly states its not against the eula
seeing those screenshots and seeing lot of alts online i wonder how many actual players eve actually has i usually have 2 characters open at one time myself if there are many people that keep more 10 open at the time the honest and real active player count for eve is very little what is told to us anywayanyway eve even its harsh and cold place should be even for everyone now when multibox miners  the mineral prices it takes it out from everyone else or when multibox gankers hotdrop  gate camp if ccp lets this continue it will make it even more harder for new people take steps in game and when they realize they have to pay and fly 23 characters to even have slightest chance in eve they simply quiti could perhaps still understand if you used isboxer for 3 accounts but when it comes 5 or 10 i could simply cry
although i dont like the idea of isboxer it doesnt actually allow a player to make more isk per account than anyone else each account can still make the same isk per hour as an individual accounttldr its ok
1 no ice logistics are supposed to be tedious and an issue its what makes wormholes hard to live in and keeps alot of the jokes out2 hard to haul ore to kspace what back when i lived in a c6c6 with syj i had a corpmate who always mined the gravs and always hauled it out no problem now that i live in a c5c3 he still does the same thing because he knows how to scan when he overdoes the mass
you went into a wh to live in a harsh enviroment so get on with it
we have these funny little tags on our faces or do you mean on the outer header of the threadi dont think that is needed for monitoring if i start a thread i am fairly ocd about checking to se eif anybody else had anything to say about it and i tick the little box on the interesting ones that notifies me that there have been responsesi cannot speak for the others but i am doing laps once a day through assembly speakers and the top sekrit channel to keep up to date if i didnt say anything after reading the thread it is because a it has already been said and i dont feel like being part of the echob it is a mediocre idea with no tractionc one of my fellow csm have already responded and in a fashion i agree withd the idea is bad and i hope it dies swiftly no bump for youbesides i am the same player i was a few weeks ago except for the letters on my image my opinion is not the word from on high i just have a slightly more direct line to those up there in that regard i dont think that you need to know that we have blessed a thread with our presencemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i think lowsec should continue the trend people with a sec status of 6 are free targets in 04 7 are free targets in 03 etclowsec already gives a very small penalty for aggressing i think that people with a lower sec status should be given places to go rather than being encouraged only to raise their sec status again i feel players should only be given the tools to raise it again but i think they should be encouraged to live with their choices rather than change themi like the first idea though1
my input
as a brilliant person who has potential as a future fc i believe i would set up a fleet which includes a particular combat battlecruiser doctrine and i would try to get at least 1 battlecruiser per squad to fit a gang link and fill the squad command role enemies wont be able to tell which battlecruisers have the gang linksthen we might also get a few fleet command ships with super high tank just to draw fire the fcs pilots may put gang links on if their fit leaves room but i wont require it they can take wing command positions if they have gang links but theyre mostly there to be shot at to buy timeso at which point here do the fleet bonuses stop benefiting us
i disagree the logic is not flawed the op brings up plenty of examples and rationale on how offgrid assets have directly or indirectly affected how battles play out some of these examples such as the long bow changed warfare forever it may not be the best parallel to fleet links on internet space ships but its an early example of assets affecting fights that are no where close to the actual foot solider battlesi also dont understand perceptions like this  to me it doesnt make sense that a ship that is not participating in a fight can influence the fightsatellites dont participate directly in fights and they are an asset that we use constantly to influence fights all over the globe  they link with computers and feed invaluable information and data to anywhere from smaller units to entire armies its an asset that provides incredible amounts of intelligence that can help soldiers kill more efficiently or resist attacks better and all but the most advanced countries have no chance of destroying them im sure there are plenty of rogue nations or warlords that dont like them either but they exist and they are a decisive tactical advantage that dont actually fire bullets or blow up enemies directly anyways to actually talk about ongrid boostingall these arguments for or against ongrid boosting directly affect a lot of accounts that have spent  like 78 months to max leadership not to mention a new need to train certain shipssupport modules if fleet boosters were forced into a battle situation every engagement  its not to be taken lightly and needs to be changed with great care since its a big aspect of the game and takes a long time to max and its not even an active or engaging skill set from a player perspective so youre forced to train something for months that doesnt bring much entertainment value just to be competitive links also affects mining  so ccp cannot just make a blanket change of all ships must boost on grid without scrutinizing hard data on how that would affect the economy as well as gaming experience for industrialists so while i agree something should be done about offgrid boosting and some of the abuse that comes with it a blanket change from one extreme to the other is probably not the answer and a more dynamic approach across all forms of pvepvp should be addressed in an elegant solution that is backed by hard data analysis and sound reasoning changes to offgrid boosting should not be done because of these reasons offgrid boosting is unfair nerf or i want to blow up a rorq or i just dont plain like it because it rubs me the wrong way which are pretty much the thesis of 80 of all the posts ive read so far in this threadi think that the problem with fleet boosting is that it is not interactive or engaging  and being ongrid with such a staple role makes you a big target at least with eccm or ewar you are actively playingthinking and initiating modules against another player that impacts their ability to perform sure you are a target too because no one likes to be jammed but there is a game dynamic there that makes it fun and exciting while taking a little bit of luck and skill to pull off fleet boosting is none of that and thats the real problem here it will be the only shiprole that serves no engaging purpose other than existing and fitted to not die in 5 seconds with no guarantee not fun at least with offgrid boosting you can park an alt somewhere and use a ship that is actually fun to use so a whole holistic look at how fleet boosting works needs to be done demanding ongrid boosting is a lazy remedy that does not promote or develop what could be an interesting part of the game it just makes fcs shift their primary rotation slightly
transmissions tofrom satellites can be jammed satellites are easily identifiedtracked and destroyed demilitarization of space treaties prevents this but doubt any space nation doesnt have the ability  so yes they do have a significant impact but between equal sides natorussiachina bombing 3rd world countries hardly counts as equal they will be easily and immediately neutralizedspeaking of why dont we just add an easily fitted module that jams all signals coming from offgrid  be it gang links nonassigned fightersbombers or the grossly op titan effects one can already buy gps jamming gear as a private person imagine what military umpteen thousand years in future will havewould not immediately affect carebear grinding or mining although it should be used as a way to throw grinders a curveball from time to time by having a random rat switch such a module on cry me a river people deliberately creating alts to take advantage of ccps shortsightednessignorance do not deserve any more consideration than others whose world is turned upside down changes to ecm probes dramiel  moongoo soonUFFFD etconly applicable in the current environment and with no changes made other than move them ongrid ccp has already stated that commands will be given teeth during initial tiericide announcement and with teeth comes interactivityfunmails and you can be damn sure that we will all help to make sure that they are viable when ongrid provided people are not being stupid about itkeep in mind that there is no hardset rule saying that a fleet should only have one ship with 5 links and the resulting zero tank sure ccp will have to cook up some sort of fleet automation to allow redundancy linkships to come online preferably based on a fc set priority list think watchlist but that too is part of the overall concept of ongrid links
someone give this person a job at ccp headquartersi like what im seeing in the suggestions for the overview ive always avoided trying to deal with it because its too much of a headache even to come up with solutions for it but your ideas are making my head feel better alreadyalso your avatar is amazing i came here ready to find an excuse to leave until i saw your avatar and decided i might as well start clicking linksand i have one idea instead of making a popup box to show ship summary that would take time and bandwidth you could just make a more detailed set of small icons to more accurately display all the types of ships they could all just be boxes but different colors for different categories also id like to see the distinction between the 5 size classes frigatedestroyercruiserbattlecruiserbattleship worked on destroyers and battlecruisers just look like cruisers and battleships and capital ships look the sameheres my proposal maybe someone can draw up a sketch for meindustrial ships are already a horizontal rectangle capital ships could be a vertical rectangle im not sure what to do for capital industrial shipsim listing color options here sort of off the top of my head but with red for direct combat blue for operationsewar and yellow for industryexplorationbright red tech 1 dps ships like the kestrel catalyst omen hurricane typhoon and attack battlecruisersdark red tech 2 assault assault ships heavy assault ships field command shipsmagenta tech 1 tanky combat ships like the incursus moa prophecy maelstrommaroon tech 2 tanky fleet command shipsbright violet scorpion bhaalgorn and tech 1 logistics like the navitas bantam augoror scythedark violet tech 2 logistics combat recon and black opsbright blue tech 1 ewar ships like the vigil crucifier blackbird celestisdark blue electronic attack shipsbright teal probe ships magnate heron imicus probedark teal covert ops not stealth bombersdark green blockade runnersyellow tech 1 industrials noctisyelloworange tech 1 mining bargesdark yelloworange exhumersdark redorange stealth bombers and maraudersbrown force reconstrategic cruisers greyshuttles and apotheosis whitetitans bright magentasupercarriers bright purpledreadnoughts bright redcarriers bright violetorca rorqual tech1 freighters yellowjump freighters dark yellowgnosis brownzephyr manila
every time i log into eve not having the jukebox annoys me to no end i have not gotten over it yet and i dont think i will any time soon it was one of the things that stood out about eve that made eve better than all the other games
if ccp were to ban isboxer i wonder how many hours would pass before the same people posting in this thread would be posting in a new thread asking ccp to ban multiboxing or to make it impossible to have more than one client open at a timenot many id wager
i enjoy the new bounty hunter system and all that it now enables us as players to doit allows also for new parts of the game to open up to players in the form of intel channels and a market for players to jump into such as the locates are us channel which allows players to join who are either hunting other people or making isk by lending out their services to players for a feethe proposal i have is entirely selfish of course but i also think its convenient in generalwhy is it when i call up an agent i get the automated response from my agent saying sounds good please drop by so we can formalize the mission contractif my agent can say that much to me surely with eves technology i can talk to my agent over the phone and make my requestcould i not be able to request my agents location services via a phone call as opposed to flying all over the galaxy for a 14 min convoi believe this would add more fluidity to the game play and reflect the advanced technology that eve online possesss in making a simply phone call  3rd party  location services  tjorven einherjar valkyrja  to do business please enter this channel inf 3rd party
disclaimer UFFFD 1 this idea and accompanying images was put together quickly and there is plenty of room for refinement and additions 2 the models are quick sketchup drafts and have no textures 3 the base closeup image of the planetary rings is not mine and was found by a google search i only added the ship drones and overlay 4 im posting this idea in both the features  ideas section as well as the assembly hall for more coverage and traffic please post additions and refinements in the features post and support if any in the assembly hall thank you by now im sure ccp have their own plans for this feature and several players have probably posted their own proposals but this is my take on it and an idea i feel has merit the idea and inspiration for this post comes from fishing trawlers and the feel of setting a course and following it along the rings as others also trawl alongside you casting out your net and hoping for the big score sometimes you get it sometimes you dont ring mining should be like this and different from other mining in eve this post hopefully reflects that as to resources ideally the materials recovered from ring mining would go towards stargate construction as plans shown at fanfest 2013 pointed out this goal for the next few years however the resources could be used for any production or research ccp wishes to introduce ie implants dust equipment tech 3 modules and so on to me though stargateUFFFDs make the most sense as these would not be new resources to new eden since high sec empire planets have rings but would be more along the lines of concord granting permission to capsuleers to finally mine them the empires have been able to build gates for a long time and that implies the resources do or did exist in their home systems that said lets talk ring miningstage one UFFFD surveying the ringsplanetary ring surveysecond concept so once youve found a suitable planetary body with rings youll need to survey it to find the best mining spot right clicking the planet and selecting survey will bring up the mining operation screen see above image where you can plan and locate where the most efficient spot for you is you begin with an initial scan that displays if there are any other miners currently harvesting the rings and what ores are present other miners  if these miners are ahead of your chosen course through the rings then this could impact your mining yield as they may have already harvested the richest deposits of your chosen ore however there is no way to tell what they are mining short of asking them and they could still lie these players are shown by the red dots on the planetary rings and also includes the wake of their ships as they move along their orbit around the planet a toggle is also available to show player names so you know who to contact negotiate with or threaten if you chosepresent ores UFFFD icons of all the availablediscovered ores are also shown and highlighting one will display its abundance within the rings and where those pockets are located similar to planetary interaction these scan results can be refined and narrowed down with skills and adjustable filters mineral deposit positions vary from planet to planet as dictated by the planets mass radius gravitational pull the mass of the ores and their velocity in orbitonce youve select an ore to mine you then chose a distance from the planet that will be your orbital route or path that your ship will move along until you choose to stop mining confirming this selection leads to the beginning of your operationstage two UFFFD bargemining barge now this is where ring mining differs from other mining your ship a new type of barge possibly called a trawler or harvester travels along its orbital path just above the surface of the rings a powerful and dedicated sensor system located at the front of the ship scans all material that passes below it and tags any that contain the desired ore users can adjust and customise the threshold at which rocks are tagged this is because unlike asteroids ring rocks are taken whole and processed at a refinery so it is possible to collect a large rock that contains only small amounts of the desired ore conversely it is possible to find small rocks containing an abundance of material managing and being selective about what you chose to recover is important as your ore hold is limited stage three UFFFD tag it and bring it hometagged rocks successfully scanned and tagged rocks are highlighted in space to avoid confusion and frustration only highlighted and tagged rocks can be recovered so it doesnt matter if several other rocks are between you and the target as while they are still visible the nonhighlighted cannot be clicked or selected the overlay is also visible through nontagged rocks so that they wont be impossible to see if other rocks move in front of the target a sort of xray vision holographic overlay tagged rocks can however move beyond your drone control range so skills and modules to extend this are strongly recommended if you chose to recover a rock then select it and order a drone or drones to recover it
stage four  dronesring mining drones the planetary ring miner harvester has no direct means by which to recover resources as the nature of rings is a constantly in motion sea of tumbling and overlapping rocks moving a ship of any significant size into the rings would lead to dozens of impacts to the hull and delicate sensor array so the barge is dependent upon drones for mining and resource recovery  drones travel to selected targets and using four powerful spikes spear the desired rock they then manoeuvre the rock back to the barge however the size of a rock and its mass affect the drones speed and manoeuvrability with some larger rock requiring more than one drone a skilled pilot can improve the effectiveness of their drones with increased speed thrust and certain drone skills the ring mining barge also features an ability rarely seen in ships of its size that is to field more than the maximum five drones seen on other vessels making it a task orientated small scale carrier the upper limit of this would be ten ring mining drones in total one for each level of the ships skillnotes  to defense and offence i imagine the barge to have a good defense in the form of a solid tank either shield or hull but a very limited offence something like five light drones this would be because rings dontshouldnt spawn regular rats but something more like rogue mining drones and stray rocks that threaten the barge miners can also be attacked by rival capsuleers bringing combat ships with you for mining ops in lownullw space will be a must and youll need enough to protect all your bargestrawlers at differing locations along the rings or patrol between them a well managed corpfleet could be seen using ten or more trawlers moving slowly around a planet with a small cruiser escort each and patrols of fast moving tackler and ecm frigates flying between them groups of trawlers could also share and exchange survey data so that a corpfleet member can alert you to an approaching hotspot or warn you of a limited yeild path once the barges ore hold is full or comes under attack the operation is cancelled or ended and the ship must unload its cargo to a station or pos to be refined or for partially filled holds begin a new run at the ringsso thats the bare bones of my idea be kindlink to fi postideas that link into or complement ring mining which should really be called ring harvesting im toldprospecting by gilligan zaftiglay claim to asteroid belts with mining charters by andrea griffinnew mining mechanics multi ore multi methods by abrazzar
just wondered
last i heard about it was comment by fozz that it waits for ccp veritas to concoct some sot of coding voodoo necessary to make it work
why on earth did you open this thread in ah and not general warfare or fi aye last word was that there was a problem with applying stuff to grid only as opposed to system suppose they could get around it by making grids instances in their own right but that probably creates a whole new set of issues curious as to how the aoe ddd worked back in the day that was grid based i believe even if effectively merely a giant smartbomb  can a smartbomb set off next to a grid boundary effect stuff within range but offgrid
i think selfsufficiency should be possible in wormhole space
few years back when i did tutorial there was no mention of UFFFDdouble click in spaceUFFFD manual piloting i found about it after some 23 weeks of play and from what i hear manual piloting still has no mention in current tutorialneedles to say it is outrageous that tutorial fails to teach noobs such fundamental game mechanic csm should bring this problem to ccps attention and exert pressure on them to rectify it as soon as possible
this is high on my list of things to mention when we start talking about things missing from the tutorials if we dom
thx mike
im for it it would raise the visibility of csm communications with the players
1 its a good idea
csm 7 got a lot of  for UFFFDnot communicating enoughUFFFD hawing threads with csm repossess or comments highlighted with tags could be helpful in avoiding such impressions in the future1
1i agree
my proposal is to bring back the capability of doomsday weapons to attack the entire system only the attack would be so diminished that it would only deal a few points of damage to each object and ship this would decloak everyone in the system tooit gives titan doomsday weapons another use and it provides a way to decloak ships without it being too easy to do
black ops squad starting to annoy you are they
no
i disagree with your math as much as i disagree with your logic the argument for the resist nerf is simple5 resist per level is equal to 75 hp 75 more onboard reps and 75 more incoming reps all put together since thats overpowered ccp is nerfing the resist bonus to 4 per levelif their production team was alright at math the resists would never have been put at 5 to begin with
i originally posted in features and ideas where the post was quickly lost to the general noise of afkcloaking tears and new iwin button mechanics and forgetting i should be leveraging the power of our new csm overlords insteadi am proposing a small change to how ingame menu navigation works that would have in my opinion huge user experience benefitsso i have a problem when i try and quickly navigate menus sometimes ill try and move my mouse directly towards a submenu item and in the process manage to close the menu i was aiming forlots of companies especially those with a large web presence are recognising this as a huge user experience problem and are solving it with basic mouse path predictionimagine an invisible triangle between where your mouse cursor currently is and the upper and lower bounds of the submenu you have just opened if you move your mouse within the triangle the menu the odds are youre aiming for the submenu and so it stays open and if your cursor leaves the triangle youre probably aiming somewhere else so the submenu can safely be closedamazon uses this to improve navigation on their site theres a breakdown here with some lovely graphics to demonstrate
1great idea having navigating so many submenus this would help immensely
suggesting that the scanner being on the orca is enough is like suggesting that orca is why minifreighters arent needed the ship resist bonus nerf is a bad idea warpdisrupt bubbles should be allowed in lowsec shirts with a red star on them are not commonly worn people will use extra mid slots on an ecm ship to fit shield tank goonswarm cares about highsec politics poop doesnt stink did i forget anything oh yeah1
i do minei have an orca booster with the survey scanneri have 2 hulks that i mine withi only have 1 monitori successfully use the survey scanner from the orca to tell which hulk to disengage the correct asteroid at the proper timea range increase is not needed
they are actually trying to help you as links will be ongrid soonUFFFD thus getting used to having the booster nearby is manadatory for the minmaxing rock suckerthe issue of having a list to lock from is easily solved by introducing the ability to transmit said list to fleet commanders  he orca scans and all applicable ships or those with proper box ticked automatically receive the resultdouble whammy feature can be duplicated to apply to watch lists used by logistics where squadwingfleet commander compiles list and transmitsshares to relevant parties who can then micromanage positions themselvestriple whammy feature can be made to work together with tagging andor ship scanners perhaps a buffuse for tps in there with a list populated with primaries  freed voice comms up for that much more entertaining and thus important random banter we recently got a dragndrop watchlist but the whole fleet interface could be so much more
anyone have any ideas on how to improve thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
the problem you enter the game and arent sure what to train you decide mining sounds ridiculously awesome and 25 million skill points later decide mining is boring and a waste of time so you start training pvp and really like it  never touching a mining barge or laser again but those skill points just sit there worthless and taking up space over the years as your game play experience changes and you entertain the idea of venturing into other professions more and more wasted skillpoints stack up justification for implementing this change 1 players really should be given the opportunity to correct mistakes and clean up their characters2 like the philosophy behind plex or tagsforsec the time has already been invested and skill points already earned 3 limiting to 1 reset per year or even 2 or 3 years like attribute resets prevents this from being abused4 id pay a plex now if thats not motivation sidebar this also goes handinhand with skill deletion most players have at least a few skills that they plugged into their head only to regret it later and have no way to delete them those of us with ocd that hate seeing a lot of level 01 or 2 skills mixed in with level 4s and 5s really go nuts over not being able to delete them id like this feature too
how annoying you know you should attempt to do a forum search before posting that way you could perhaps modify your idea to have some new content maybe even address the reasons why people shoot down this idea let me spell out a couple reasons why this wont fly and for the love of god do a  forum search before replying a it allows you to game the sp system i train a year of perceptionwillpower skills once a year redistribute those skillpoints to offattribute skills essentially allowing me to train at optimal pace always new players wont have this luxury but older players certainly will b in order to prevent abuse you need a skillpoint redistribution cap otherwise i can redistribute 510m sp and instantly become a professional miner or industrialist or carrier pilot or  it doesnt take a lot of skillpoints before people can instatrain into a fotm ship and allowing people to instatrain into fotm is generally a bad thing c you already got the benefits from those skills why should you get to redistribute them you started off as a miner and enjoyed it long enough to accrue 25m sp relevant to the profession so you already used them and benefited from them regardless if you use them now thats like spending money on a macbook pro and then deciding you want an android tablet after using it for 23 months why should you get to swap the macbook for an entirely different thing d what do you mean mistakes you didnt make any mistakes when training your skills you certainly didnt make 25m sp worth of mistakes when training skills just because you changed your mindprofession doesnt mean you made a mistake accept some responsibility for your choices if you go to school for mesage therapy then become a banker a couple years later you dont unlearn your mesage therapy work having skills irrelevant to your current profession is part of your characters growing pains accept it you dont get to rewrite your history because youve discovered a new direction e eve has real consequences if you lose your ship its gone the sp system is the same thing if you train some sp theyre applied htfu and deal with it tl dr no you never made any mistakes you simply changed your mind you dont get to change your mind about a purchase you made about a ship you lost about a corp you join likewise you dont get to change your mind about skillpoints
ive seen that post in features and ideas before usually coming from the same idiots who have zero understanding of both ingame and real life economics most certainly the types of people who directly correlate government taxes to a personal attack from a government official
1nice idea and a good start on it as well
im curious too  surely if they set a range to it say 30km that would remove the grid issue tech3 ships need to be put down like a rabid dog drooling everywhere in the house they are out of line ccp ytterbium nerf missile range into place where is the td missile change projectiles should use capacitor abcs should be t2 habc and nerf web strength its still too high
or one could just say if you can lock it you can boost it increase base lock range enough to make it viable think combat recon ranges  doubles as a massive boost to damps as well which should make even the permanently grumpy gallente aficionados happy  hell might even make info links desirable for the first time since failcon nerfcould spawn a reconcommand vs reconcommand subfight while vanilla fatties punch each other in the face around them
yeah this basicallyplus it would be a nice buff for people who enjoy accusing us of egotripping
pretty much what i had in mind when i suggested it i was just being sneaky and didnt include that in my op
make the regular doomsday scriptable for this require the same amount of fuel and can not be within 100k of any pos shields and can only be used once every 12 hrs per system then perhaps it could be deemed a viable option
also during that 12 hour cooldown you cannot jump out and are agressed also you cannot enter a pos and your cyno jammer is disabled
i have the solutiona high slot module that enables your drones to reciprocate the resistances that you apply to your shipeg when your thermic armour hardner is active granting 55 res bonus to your ships armour your dronesmay get a similar boostwhat say youdrone boats are for lazy gits anyhoo
use sentry drones
because they can be different each time and we might want to have the previous ones tooits simple just add the date and time to the filename or a number 1 2 3 if there is a file already
keep it bumped i do like this idea as i have been an incursion gypsy in the pastfitted or not it is hard to move hq level tools 30 jumps with any efficiencymmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i dont care that others have raised this issue before i will bring up issues i feel need addressing dont like what i bring up dont read it or spend time to reply to it sometimes the only way to bring about change is to keep pressing and this is different than resetting your attributes once a year how hint its not you have the ability to completely remap your attributes perceptionwillpoweretc once a year already it would be a total reset so yes you could instantly become a miner but youd be that miner for at least 1 year until your next reset is available so you become a miner and mineral prices crash tough luck wait a year to reset train for the pvp fotm and it gets nerfed deal with it while you wait a year to reset the viewpoint is that i earned the skillpoints i should be able to  on the rare occasion  redistribute them in the same way i redistribute attributes i buy a macbook and hate it i have 30 days to return it or i can resell it on craigslist or trade it or trash it or donate it im not stuck with itthe 25m into mining is an example ok you benefited from the invested skills but that was 5 years ago things change people change gameplay gets boring there should be a method for players to redistribute their character based on their changing tastes andor experiences and if that only happens once a year once every 2 years 3 years hardly unbalanced
supported 1ages toons of vets are worth isk self interest at work there thus the walls of whine
inb4 tippa and magyour actions have consequences this extends to your skill choicesand you should care about the points that others have brought up in the past even if you address your ideas to ccp directly they still have to be discussed and vetted by the player base the end recipients of such changes if players dont agree with your ideas or their premise then you have to convince them i agree with all of the points grizz has made as i have made them as welledit there is also no such thing as wasted skill points ships skills and specialties are still useful if you choose to use them the fact that you dont doesnt make them useless
uhg based on your response  why dont care about other peoples point of view do you only want to change the game for your own benefit regardless of balance  a total reset of skillpoints would be insane wow can i keep some unassigned in reserve to use when i want them i mean 100m sp and there are sooo many elusive ones i hardly utilize in all seriousness this is very very imbalanced the primary reason is that new players that specialize typically become extremely competitive if not better to the older player that retains a general skillset your redistribution encourages people to specialize always and this is not like attribute redistribution attribute redistribution was enabled because pilots that initially chose their attributes poorly were stuck with that decision for the entire career furthermore these attributes are chosen at the most immature moment of game play at character creation there is still consequences to training a skill as it cannot be untrained quotebut you are stuck with that macbook purchase it happened and you can resell it or return it often both at financial loss you generally cant undo it there are consequences for your decision generally financial even if you change your mind truthfully though this analogy is much more akin to buy a ship in eve online training sps is a long term decision much more akin to taking a college class or tradecertificate course you cant undo a class after you take it and you certainly cant turn physics 101 into psychology 101 after the fact just because your changing your major seriously why should there be a method for players to redistributed their character points you admitted you already benefited from them they werent trained in error they were trained to open up a type of game play you participated in and benefited from even if you dont partake in that aspect now they dont prevent you from doing something new you can always train into a new area of game play if your tastes change nothing prevents you from developing into the new area of game play they still provide you with a benefit you can still do those boring old tasks should the urge arise lets be frank you want this enabled because your impatient youve found a new area of game play and since you have a bunch of old sp that you dont utilize very much youre proposing a method to expedite your training this is not nor has it ever been a game of instatraining characters characters go through a development cycle where it takes real time to skill into different careers just because your an older character with extra sp doesnt mean you get to skip the growing pains that all new player experience when exploring a new are of game play ps you might have better luck if you suggested some reasonable consequence like you lose 25 of your skillpoints when you redistribute them this would be appropriate as it hurts new players the least and has steep enough consequences that people wont abuse the system
no it doesnt you speak like theres finite number of sp you can put into a charitll give less reason for ppl to buy vet toons causing deflation thats what its all about i can join you hypocrites but trolling you is more interesting
your splitting hairs if i train caldari frig v instead of minmatar frig v then in 2 weeks ill be able to fly a harpy instead of a jaguar what i can fly today is a result of my decisions yesterday and we cant undo those choices hence there are consequences for skill choices at the same time i can train minnie frig v so in 2 weeks i can also train the jag making the consequences primarily relevant to the here and now this is also why sp redistribution is completely unnecessary if you spent the last year making a perfect industry toon you can still turn it into a propvp toon by taking the next year and focusing on pvp skills it takes someone really impatient to expect ccp to return those sp so they can instantly become a propvp toon and pro tip you dont need super allv skillsets to be viable and competent in this game especially in regards to ship combat
ever wonder how much powerirl money is used in running those servers at ccpmakes me wonder how much of that is actually being used for active playersnot just hundreds if not thousands of players who are afk either in station or in spacesohere is my proposed solution after 15 mins of inactivity a window pops up in a random place on the screen random every time to prevent bottersa notification that says are you afk yes no or something creative to that effect where the player has to click noif the player doesnt click no a 15 min timer pops up and after that 15 minute timer expires they get logged offi bet if ccp was having any server issues due to thousands of players being afk this would not only help not totally fix with afk cloaky campers but ccp will save money because the server load would be reduced due to less power needed to run the server for x amount of afk playersmy 2 iskmyth
i wholeheartedly agree im sick of afk cloakerssadly said cloakers belong to an already well established part of the gameplay so most likely ccp wont give a dong 
here is a link to the eve economy fanfest vid or seach ccp on youtube
soloing is far higher than just 50 ppl who mostly solo but joins fleet once in a while are not counted even nullbears rank and file not officers spend most of their playtime soloing full time fleeting is mostly in higher whs and incursionsplayer created missions were successful in many other games but only because their rats are balanced eves rat balance is too badly neglected with all balancing efforts going towards pvp the popular player created missions will be these with only high bounty bses waves after wave frigs and elite cruisers dont give enough bounty for the time it takes to kill them
im not suggesting that player run mission should be more or less profitable than current missionsthe reason i like the idea is that the number of missions will increase and will stop the whole missions juggling that goes on i just like the idea of ccp doing something that would help change something that hasnt had any significant attention in the past 2 years or to put it another way more than 5 expansionswith regards rat balance this is something ccp could look at along with loot tables and bountiesplayers could et these but ccp could adjust them before putting a player mission on liveim not looking for more isk per hour i dont even mind less isk per houri just like the idea of after x amount of months of player created mission  i might get to the point where i can run mission for a full month solid and not see a single reapeted mission offered thats the goalbalance loot and bounties are always gonna be subjective to each player cause in eve 100 million is alot to someone with no time to grind at all where as 1 billion to another player may seem like nothing due to his earningsso a good mix like it is at the moment is perfectly fine just lots lots more or maybe even something more inventive but would be nice if in the future missions were given some attentioni like them the way they are but i would like them even more if they were bettermore variedsafermore riskymore random and so on and so forthedited for this an example is recently they just made changes to exploration where they removed rats in data and relic sites for the next expansion this would have been awesome for soloists but they then say in the same breath that they are changing it so that all loot spills out into space then disappears shortly after meaning its better if you go with 2 people imho its like ccp want to discourage soloing another example is that in one of the prefanfest vids on twitch tv one of the ccp guys said if people are just soloing lvl 4s all day then ccp are doing something wrong cant be bothered going through all the vids but it is therei disagree i think that even though the soloist is treated like a 2nd class citizen ingame the fact that we are still playing means you must be doing something right  but you could do it even better just acknowledge that we are there would be a start
we need more input
1 this is epic and can totally replace current mining mechanicssteel and iron guard me well or else im dead and doomed to hell
just lost 3 days of training because i forgot to upgrade my clone it was a busy night fighting all the time and i did not remember how many times i died then i did it again  after some running around through null sec i realized i was using an alpha cloneproposal  when podded there is this service that gives automated upgrade to the next clone that holds your skill points it could be based on new skills an isk price or standings
sp sink working as intended call it a tax on the stupid
heres an outline for a possible way to help improve communication and interaction with the player base  hold a biweekly roundtable on a consistent schedule ex 1st and 3rd tue of the month csm members hold a skype or some other program conversation and broadcast it live on twitchtv  create a graphic overlay that show each csm name and avatar picture next each speaker release past meetings as a podcast as well to increase audienceallows for a consistent csm update to the players and a real time qa where the community can really get to know the csmpast meetings are stored for those who miss the live event
while it currently involves neither twitchtv nor quite so ambitious a schedule we are working on plans to hold several town hall type meetings over the next year recording them certainly isnt a bad idea too
after sitting on the sidelines for years watching all the empire factions get all the fun we are still waiting to get tagged ini imagine changing the system capturing mechanics to support 3 way capturing might be somewhat complicated so a good half way measure would be to add pirate faction to the wars without letting them capture space this should be fairly trivial to implement would make fw low sec a lot more interestingthis would allow pirate faction supporters to hunt down and disrupt the efforts of whichever empire militia their pirate fw team is at war with and actually get some loyalty points for doing sofaction divisions are obviously easy as the pirate factions are divided into two blocks already the new fw teamsangel cartel  serpentisguristas blood raiders  sanshasangel cartel  serpentis faction would be at war with the gallente  minmatar block as well as the guristas blood raider and sansha factions guristas blood raider and sansha would be at war with the amarr  caldari block and of course the other pirate faction blockobviously we would prefer being able to capture systems as well but at this point wed be happy with just no longer being ignored and left out p
join a pirate corpthread
except pirate corps cant capture systems get loyalty points and get standing gains hence theres a fairly major difference
tying the pirate factions into existing faction war would both be poorly implemented in terms of mechanics as well as story and game design their agenda is entirely different from the empires and of the five  the serpentis have an invested interest in remaining in the back line the angels might as well considering they tend to primarily exist as an underworld power the remaining three groups are different end game goals for their conflicts blooders and guristas are the most understandable in their aggressive destruction of the amarrcaldari respectively sansha would require a philosophy change as official promotion of something like the militia war powers system is entirely counterproductive to their missionthis is just the conceptual issues let alone the game design evaluation that would have to occur to accommodate them appropriately at that point it is better to spend all the resources developing a unique pirate faction lowsec game system than stitching them into the existing militia frameworkedit  additionally it is entirely reasonable to sign up to an existing militia gain access to what you are proposing and still avow loyalty to your faction at that point all you truly need is to simply not capture systems as that would be the only meaningful way to forward an empires interests
im not sure i get the full gist of this idea yet when i first saw the orca i actually thought it could be used as a space caravan then realized it was meant to be a mining vesselif the concept here is to have a ship that can be used to move our stuff around a lot easier or to move house when your sov bases get taken over  would it not be simpler to retask ships we already have to new roleswe have carriers already the hull could be retasked so the skill list is no longer combat based jump capability removed combat roles removed drone bay removed etc etc and we have a ship mover such a ship would never be allowed in hisec though without major changes to ehp because if it takes the role of a freighter with a higher degree of safety it could never be ganked and everyone would be up in arms over that
im posting here because i want peoples opinions what i said is just because some people have raised problems to this issue in the past doesnt mean i shouldnt be talking about it the issue as a whole and i have 105m skillpoints im not waiting on any training im not changing professions im maxed out where i want to be but its stupid not being able to redistribute how i want to given that my toon is 7 years old and needs some cleaning up  i have alots of skills that are completely untrained that i dont want to look at anymore i fail to see how deleting those from my head is at all imbalanced back to the pointi train a pure miner and i want to switch to a capital pilot do i spend the next 2 years training for it hell no i buy a cap pilot off the character bazaar and ccps ok with that so rather than buying another toon from someone else simply give me the ability to reset my own skills on my own toon with my own name and reputation once every couple of years and attributes didnt nerf your character you could still train skills and be anything you wanted it just took a day or two extra which sounds really familiar to your it doesnt stop you from training a new profession argument  and yet they introduced the remap anyways its the same thing exactly
there is already a solution to this selfdestruct an alpha clone over  over until youve lost the desired skills
consequenceswelcome to eve
no for one very good reason eve is a game that allows you train skills afk that is the benefit of the skill training system we have all you need to do is invest time there is a very good character market within eve that can get you a character with the skill set you are looking for i have skill points on this character that are invested into cynos something that i am currently not using by your logic i should be able to trade those skills for something that i do need currently but the thing is i invested time to train them they were useful now that i dont need them im training for something else entirely however i made that choiceeve is all about choice and the consequences they bring if you cannot handle the consequences of an action then eve probably isnt the right sort of game for you
noi say this as someone with a fair amount of industrial and science skills that i will probably never use again we make choices and we have to live with them that is a large part of the appeal of evei suggest that you direct your energies and efforts towards helping to improve the new player experience particularly in relation to new toons making educated skill choices rather than trying to wreck one of the main features of the game
the first reply you got on the subject  albeit it being a tad too aggressive  had a lot of good points it would be really nice if ccp introduced a novel way to be more flexible with sps and for the record i cant think of one off the top of my head but a full sp remap is way too muchif there was something i might even remotely consider it would maybe allow a remap of some skills of equal cost and level  say swap 2 skills that are both rank 4 and both are in the same category  ie they have already the same stat requirements  for example you had sentry drone interfacing v and heavy drone operation iii to end up with sdi iii and hdo v and even for that id have a penalty like stopping training for a small period while clone gets reprogrammed at a station im not saying that one is a good idea just saying that it ought to be something not done or allowed easily the main reason for that is the entire population would immediately try and ind a way to exploit it
when you have a player doing this sort of thing with 80 accounts does it not mess with the market mechanics of plex sales after all that player isnt playing by paying with real cash he must be plexing those accounts so hes taking out 80 plexes of of the market each month that normally would be paid for by normal playersdoesnt this system raise plex prices on the market or does ccp just keep it balanced with other tricks
supply and demand is not a trick it is economics 101
ill just add my 2 scents in this conversation ive been playing games for a very long time and this is a conversation which seems to come back every few yearsi define a macro as any button or keybind which allows you do do multiples actions at once this definition is somewhat broad and it should be in the right hands macros are extremely powerful toolspropagating a command most certainly fall within the scope of this definition for me denying this is playing on words right now in quUFFFDbec we have a commission inquiring on collusion for me its the same exact thing peoples denying the obvious truth and trying to rephrase it so that they can keep going with their everyday business you can say it however you want is boxer is a form of macroingand before you go asking i do have 2 accounts it does require quite a bit more micromanagement to run even 2 accounts without using is boxer i dont think that a single player could reasonably manage more then 2 or 3 accounts without a program like is boxer beyond that macros are almost without question required
having 80 accounts under one thumb is a form of digital slavery normally those 80 people will want their cut instead of funneling it all to one playeri understand that ccp has allowed the use of isboxer because it does cater to the few players that run that many accountsi understand that money is goodi understand that this topic will never see a gm or dev post due to the volatile nature of the contentwhat i dont understand is how and  or why isboxer is not advertised by ccpheck ccp should buy isboxer and integrate it into the game client is if it so handy my gaming keyboard supports advanced macros that are very close to breaking the eula so i do not use them for fear of my account why do i have to watch my step with my hardware when i could be running 2030 accounts raking it back for only me
the one player there might be 2 or 3 now in this game with almost a hundred ice mining accounts doesnt really have an appreciable effect on the price of anything i dont think you realize the scale of the plex marketand even if he was the odyssey update is going to ruin that setup the only choice hell have is to move to 00 and mine ore along with ice
fixed that for you
fixed that for youi agree with opit isnt just null sec cloaky campers that this will effect ever try to get into jita on a crowded day 90 of jita is afkjust sayin broohbtwscooterdo you even lift bro
show me on the doll where the bad afk person touched you
can someone please explain to me how an afk cloaker actually affects you i realise that you may not want to take the risk and perform activities in system when they are there but surely you could move to a system nearby
dont you just love nerf afk cloaking threads this one has a better hook than most though in that it attempts to appeal directly to ccps accounts department
this is not a fix to afk cloakers because afk cloakers are not a problemcloaked ships are literally incapable of doing anything to anyone while cloaked afk players are literally incapable of doing anything to anyone toothey are a double nonethreatso what is the issue here mate are your bots not working because theyre programmed to run if local changes
i setup a program to take screenshots every 30 seconds and use it to monitor activity of players i have tagged in people and places and coordinate that with players going in and out of locali dont really swing either way at the moment but i do find it strange that in just about every scifi system we know of cloaks usually have massive limitations on how they can be used yet eve has none activate and just run it forever i can imagine how boring movies would be if infinite use cloaks were available to everyonethat said i would probably prefer if some minimal player interaction was needed to keep the cloak up for extended periods as long as it could not be automated
obviously you arent familiar with just how vicious the sensor and speed penalties on cloaks are or how hard recal delay hits you for that matter besides running around breaking cloaking willynilly would have some rather undesired effects on the wh metagame
for those users that do not have multiple account could you please eithera return the log off button when players hit escb create a button so players can return to the select a character screen without having to shut down and relaunch the game from scratchc create a drop down menu in the launcher so players can choose the character to log into when the exe of the game file loadswe are aware that players can manually select a log off button but the amount of time that we would need to spend searching all the various buttons to see which one isnt currently being used to select one is just a waste of time there are many players in this game who have multiple toons on the same account so why a button has never been created to allow players to switch toons more easily is something that is baffling and well overdue
three days and so few responses is this a tldr problem or do poeple really hate the idea
your idea is well thought out and those are nice pictures explaining itit gives more depth to mining but im not very convinced it actually makes it any fun its still going to be alot of obvious clicking and waiting just like the current systemmaking mining fun is the biggest challenge for ccp imo a good mining concept has some sort of minigame promotes teamplay and has some depth with different mining strategies and toolsets
tagged rocks would be their own mining mini game depending on your skills filters and chosen ore you could be seeing dozens or hundreds of results and highlighted rocks onscreen at once particularly in rings found in nullw space where resources are higher in concentration balancing which rocks to collect and which to let float away would keep a miners attention on the screen and focused on their mining ive heard people throw around the idea of using the new jettison can mechanic for hacking sites as a new mining feature but that doesnt fit the trawler feel i was looking at it would fit more of a large asteriod or comet mining feature where you blast off chunks and collect thembut if you have other ideas of how to make mining fun id love to hear them 
before undockingcheck cloneproblem solved
while not particularly old i vividly remember the first time i logged into eve the searing red and gold sunset in space combat ned with the beautiful and haunting apocrypha soundtrack most players remember the expansion they joined with purely because of things like these they gave each expansion its own character and flavourand now we have lost themi have nothing against ccp working on and improving the launcher  i just dont want to lose the music and splash art in the process
thats no doomsday its another cry baby who wants to do away with afk cloaking
i thought nerf afk cloaking season finished last month isnt it wreak the training system season now or have i got my dates mixed up
i guess the op spent so much time and thought into his idea that he missed the afk cloak nerf seasonjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i hear world of warcraft has a banal cycle of buffs and nerfs based on who complains the most you probably belong there
fixed that for you
i bring good news pirates are already in faction warfare we fight all the factions i havent met one faction warfare pilot yet that i couldnt shoot atlorewise theres no reason for concord to sanction a war waged by criminals against any faction  theyre criminalsi think i see your motivation id love to get some kind of reward for shooting pilots but i think we have to settle for enjoyment and loot drops its the price we pay to not have target selection issues
hehe i think you and gizznitt are doing a fine job tbh ill simply post the reasons why this is a bad idea from tippiain other words nodestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i agree with mag and tipno eve is a game of facing the consequences of decisions you makemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
what is this consequence that you speak ofon that subject we should have a max sp cap so that skill choices can have consequences
the consequence of poorly chosen skill queues is having sp you dont really wantthe nice thing is that unlike other mmos you are not bound to a character type you want different skills train them nowmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
fifteen to sixty minute user selectable timeout with a 60s popup location is irrelevant bots are more than capable of window ident but only in stations  people in space must be assumed active no matter whatif you want to get rid of cloakers then come up with ways for us players to hunt the bastards down not for them to be arbitrarily removed from gameexample afkc solutionspace equivalent to sonar ladar buoys launched from core probe launchers with the effect of increasing probability of scanning down a cloaked vessel without actually decloaking itshould be possible to add signature to ships under cloak just make them unprobable by default think old t3s and then increasing sig using buoys to a point where it is possible but very hard to pinpoint them  if it truly is afk then the hunting party eventually decloaks him by proximity if he is not then he is not covered by the issue and thus in need of a solution
just about everything in that op was a mythfor a solution there needs to be a problem afk player server load isnt one and neither is afk cloakingdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
all the willy nilly hereafk cloakers are not a problem because theyre afkthe problem is that its a schroedingers cloaker the cloaky may or may not be afk you never know but if you dont act like he is behind his keyboard even if het might well be afk going to the pub having a good time with his girlfriend or just sleeping you are going to lose your ship sooner rather then laterand theres the imbalance when i play eve im behind my keyboard the cloaker might as well not be behind the keyboard 90 of the time i still have to act as if he is active because i never know when he is going to be activeso even when not behind the keyboard the cloaker is effecting my gameplay directly i dont mind cloakers effecting my gameplay but please let them be behind the keyboard when they effect my gameplay just like me when im playingthen we have balance
time to bump an old thread again im pushing 9000 bookmarks safe travel in nullsec is a fair bit more complicated than warping from one gate to the next the only ship its really safe to do that in is a covert nullified t3
this is a fair request i also switch between toons on the same acct and know what you are asking fori will see what they of the infinite power have to saymmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
1with a the shiny tech in the gameagents cant send a simple text message
get rid of it ktthx
compelling argument i can really see how much effort you put into this and you are doing wonders to sway me over to your side of the issue in fact i think i will petition ccp right now to join you in your quest for the old log in screenoh wait no i wont im not stupid
i agree with dark in that this is not the way to get changes done what specifically bothers you about the new launcher how would you like to see it changedtry to keep the answer civil and specificmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
1get rid of it
i dont think we should get rid of it per se mainly because i like the idea of a master log in and all it could offer but i do think the way they have introduced it leaves a lot to be desiredthings i would like to see changed until we reach this master solutionbeing able to right click paste into the password box reducing the time it takes to check the client files every time i start the launcher up as it stands i can bypass the launcher and jump straight into the game with the launcher i go and make myself a cuppa odd considering how they are trying to rid us of timer bars its seems to forget my account name please fix this edit seems this is related to the close the eve launcher check box and is being fixed i was also going to add that when i press log in thats what i want to do not to be faced with having to press another button but they apparently have fixed this as much as i dislike aspects of the launcher i can see the need for change and hope for better account management in the future because of it but if ccp could go about the change in a better way including leaving the option in to bypass the launcher until they are within an arms reach of their goal that would be greatdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
ah that need to break whats working
you are right that blob is what we refer to as carebears of all the alliances in null sec their numbers are for nothing when it comes to the disorganized unwashed fecal tossing masses of the hi sec entitlement crowd thats your blob
1 ccp do this naow
just to add to mike the consequence of wanting to try something else is that not all the sp you have trained to this point will be useful
nicely put unlike other mmos that do have max sp cap eve sp choices have no lasting consequence
i lold at the character trading really its a requirement to keep that market alive and well i dont think game decisions need to be made based on someone wanting to ensure they get 20 billion isk when selling their toon but noobs will always be willing to buy vet toons so no the market will not die redistribution doesnt ensure cookie cutter anything everyone will make their own choices in what skills to train for based on their experiences and how they want to play the game doctrines in 00 change so fast now that youre practically expected to fly all 4 races competently with support skills to match and the math says that even a 150m sp toon who redistributes wont even come close to having hisher fighting skills maxed at 5 so attributes and implants will still matter 5 year vets will always have the advantage over 2 year vets but smart 2 year vets beat dumb 5 year noobs every time skill points mater in eve but they are not the end all be all you make them out to be most of the rest of what you said are purely grasping at straws i dont think a redistribution every few years changes any consequences hell choosing to redistribute is a consequenceyoull be stuck with the result for quite a long time
i can use the same argument for the attributes preremap having high charisma doesnt stop you from training ship skills and you still get the benefit of high charisma for leadership and social skillsattribute remaps are widely accepted and appreciated they were a good addition that goes against the eve has consequences mantra skill resets would be a good addition too
the fact that you lold show how ignorant you are at the impact of such a changehow the character was trained becomes irrelevant its now all about the sp only in other words it kills character trading are you suggesting that certain impacts with a change should simply be ignored that if you dont care they dont matter sorry but nopeople will always head to fotm and this idea promotes just that also with this i wouldnt even need to remap or worry about those 5s i simply set for perc and will and train titans for the rest of my life then simply move the sp wherever i want thus attributes no longer matter in any way whatsoever and with attributes gone the implants become meaningless too you might as well just give everyone a flat 2700 sph regardless of what they traini agree that skill points do not matter as much but thats the beauty of current system youre asking to change that to make them more important and therefore wrecking the whole system this means us old vets have it way too easy being able to change our high sp at a whim against a new guy and his far lower sp its irrelevant regarding them fixing supposed errors they made they dont have the amount of sp i do im now able to render all their choices meaningless there is no field they can now specialise in in order to competeyou suggested once per year but now seem to be back tracking to only every few catching up doesnt exist at the moment but this change introduces it simply because this change makes it about how much sp you have not where you have that sp this change would cripple new players and be a massive boon to us old onesyou have yet to show any legitimate reason for this change it doesnt solve anything it simply screws the current system as tippia also said the following which highlights why this idea isnt requiredas far as skill deletion is concerned im all for it but at the cost of the sp in that skill as well as a plex again this should be about consequencesdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
mags  tippia pretty much nailed it lets look at your reasons more closesly having skillpoints you dont currently utilize is not a problem this whole notion is flawed and frankly the cost of exploring different areas of game play is taking the time to skill into it want to build train production efficiency industry etcwant to mine train mining  exhumers etc want to explore train astronometrics  scanning skills want to pvp train skills for the shiprace you want to try tired of any of these professions train into a new one please elaborate on the problem that having access to these old professions delivers ill cut off the two most obvious replies clone costs  guess what this isnt a problem with having the sp this is an issue with the clone upgrade system try again character sheet  afraid youll be rejected from a corp because they want a 15m sp industrialist rather than a 15m sp pvper allowing corps to identify your character history based on sp chart based on kill history based on corp history is extremely important for this game in which bringing people into your corp they need to judge whether you can fly the ships they want and this involves more than simply having the sp to do so they need to judge what contributions you have previously had and they do this to see if you fit before entrusting you with corp membership which opens up some vulnerabilities to them so with those two out of the way again please elaborate on the problem that having tons and tons of skillpoints which you dont currently utilize none of these are justifications 1 you have the opportunity to correct your skillset simply by training the skills you currently want old skills do not harm you nor do they need cleaning up if you are that ocd i have no problems with allowing you to simply delete skills as long as they arent prereq skills in a tree youve trained 2 this is nothing like plex nor like tagsforsec and neither of those programs lend justification to sp redistribution 3 limiting this would help prevent abuse but if you really need to limit it to once every 13 years perhaps its not something that should be implemented also this isnt a justification 4 it would increase plex demand how nice for ccp while this is motivation it is not justification if you want to delete a skill from your head i completely dont give a  i wouldnt even require you to pay a plex for that service but i would recommend that you can only delete one skill every 48 hours as a antihack safety precaution even then imagine the havoc if someones account gets hacked an suddenly titan v is deleted
not to derail the thread but until we have two factor authentication for eve i will always vote no for skill deletion even after we have it i fail to see the necessity of spending limited developer resources on it when there are much more pressing issues in the game to be fixedon the topic of the opno you havent yet come up with a pressing reason why this is needed under the current system nor a way to do it that doesnt invoke malcanis law and if you really have to limit it to once every three years or so theres no point in it if i train mining for a year and then decide i hate it and have to wait two more years to respec those points  well hell i can be flying a titan in that amount of time so whats the  point of the respec system
 if someone hacked your account they could just biomass your toon anyways so a timer wouldnt do much use a complex password with a variety of caps numbers and special characters and your account will be safe i wouldnt mind deleting skills from my head and losing those skillpoints all together that would be progress
moot discussion itll never happenthough that probably applies to 99 of this forum sectiondohohohohohohoho
what relevance does them being at the keyboard have people should be allowed to play as and when they like plus as they are afk and not actually playing the one thats actually affecting your game play is you its your actions alone that keeps you docked or posed up no one cloaked and maybe afk can stop you docking undocking moving systems activating modules etcetcbut thats not really the issue you have here the real issue you have is with another game mechanicanswer me this while they are cloaked and maybe afk which mechanic are they using to interact with youdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
wait wait i know this oneill take the problem is local chat for 500
there are two problems related to afk cloakers but none of them are a problem with an afk cloaker problem 1 bridges in the current incarnation anyone with a bo bs or titan can bridge in a pragmatically unscoutable force directly on top of you the ability of a cloaker to almost instantly cyno in these overwhelming forces makes assessing the threat level impossible which really screws up a lot of standard options for combating hostile cloakers note bridges arent all bad but they are mostly op in their current incarnation problem 2 local chat being an omniscient intel tool since you can identify everyone in local you can instantly identify when there is a hostile in system the whole risk vs reward system is out of whack because people can and do get safe the instant local gains even an iota of risk in eve you should always operate under the premise that something wicked this way comes and afk cloaking is currently the only means to reintroduce risk back into the system this is why people afk cloak both of these are legitimate issues afk cloaking is not
i think this is a real good idea for the players that has more than one character on one account one of the options sounds nice and good after my opinion hope one of the options will get into the gamemy personal option is of them all must be b because it makes the change of character without turning off the game itself much easier instead of going back to the launcher and press the startlaunch game button again grizzly mcloren 
the personal opinion to my friend grizzly mcloren id like aswell the option b is a really good idea this should be an option in the game for sure its just awesome for the players with more characters on one account and it will be more effective game time use of players who enjoy the game and so on
the kill right system would need some improvementactually the toon who has a kill right on him receive a notification that someone ia hunting him but the corporation or the toon who receveived the right to activate it doesn tit would be nice to add a notification mail wich includes name of the target time of expiration of the kr amount of the kr an other mail would be nice to tell that the kr ha been executed by who or the kr has expiredoptionnal  to help to avoid bad situations may be adding a self set amount limit to accept kill right that and more space between numbers like  100 000 000
have you ever bothered to read the evemails the killright systems sends outi mean rly

like i said the way they introduced it leaves a lot to be desired but ccp do have a history of such things destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
it would be nice if ccp released a statement as to the purpose of the new launcher i highly doubt they just changed it because they were bored
they did it introduces single signon to eve which ccp has been dangling as an eventual feature for at least as long as ive been here the tail end of incarna theoretically it will allow them to do any number of cool things including eventually introducing master accounts so that all your current accounts are associatedin practice right now its a wobbly first step they took it knowing that theyd risk the ire of multiboxers sure enough
indeedthey could have saved themselves a fair few headaches if they had tested some more and listened more to feedbackooh its like dUFFFDjUFFFD vu destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
yes that is the idea basicly it goes like thissec status system level1 115 092 083 074 065 05lowsec systems04 or lower 1 or lowerin any lowsec system if you have 1 security status you can freely engage anyone else who has at least 1 sec status without taking a hit to your sec status5 ss people are already free targets in highsec and lowsec making them need worse sec status to be free targets in lowsec is functionally redundant
this is not about drone damagebalance threadwith the upcoming expansion and with all the ship rebalance drones have become a common main weapon it is now a good time in my opinion to review the drone skillsto start with lets take a look at the drone skills themselves going to divide them to support specialization and core skillscore drone skillsdrones scout drone operation combat drone operation heavy drone operation sentry drone interfacing fighters fighter bomberssupport drone skillsdrone durability drone navigation drone sharpshooting drone interfacingspecialization drone skillsadvanced drone interfacing amarr drone specialization caldari drone specialization gallente drone specialization minmatar drone specialization electronic warfare drone interfacing mining drone operation repair drone operation salvage drone operation the concept of drones as main weapon used to be reserved for a few selected subcapital ships and of course carriers which left a lot of players with just a few drone skills in order to be able to use selected drones tech 2 light  medium drones  ew drones mostlythats not the problem though and old players wont have any problem leveling the correctneeded drone skills however a new pilot that just started playing eve and assuming he has little guidance by friendscorpguides will find himself lost and overwhelmcomparing drones to other weapon system will make my point clear lets take as an example the hybrid weapons small blastersrails  frigatesdestroyers medium blastersrails  cruisersbattlecruisers large blastersrails  battlecruisersbattleships there is a clear line of progression and all the players will soon realize if they havent already that fitting medium neutron blasters to their megathron is a mistakebut when it comes to drones there is no line of progression well at least not a clear one that is let me demonstrate this light drones  frigatesdestroyerscruisersbattlecruisersbattleshipscarriers medium drones  frigatesdestroyerscruisersbattlecruisersbattleshipscarriers heavy drones  exactly the same as above sentry drones  exactly the same but wheres the problem everything is working as intended well yes and no at the same time i am not suggesting that we should allow drones to be fitted only to certain classes after all drones are most of the time the only defense of large ships against smaller no drone mechanics should remain as they are nowwhat i am saying is that a new player does not know which he should train first unlike conventional weapon systems the drones dont have a clear line of progression and this should be change you may argue that simplifying things in game is bad and will make it easy mode this is wrong were not changing the depth of the game or the benefits of a maxed out drone pilot but the skill tree needs to be simple and easy to understandcomplexity is good in many things the skill tree isnt one of them thoughalright alright you made your point but what are you suggesting alreadywell first of all we need a few skill name changes because most of them are very confusing sentry drone interfacing  sentry drone operation scout drone operation  drone range operation explained below repair drone operation  logistic drone operation electronic warfare drone interfacing  ew drone operation combat drone operation  split into 2 skills advanced drone interfacing  description change reasons has a similar name to drone interfacing but its identical to heavy drone operation the skill is named scout drone operation yet it gives 5000m increased range per level makes no sense the only reason im suggesting this is because in the skill description it says logistic drones not repair drones keep it simple same thing with the sentry skill wrong name also the bonus on the skill 3000m per level makes no sense to be here more about it below split into 2 skills light drone operationmedium drone operation will explain below description change say that it can only be used by carriers to a new player having more than 5 drones seems awesome but hell be dissapointed when he finds out he wasted a month of training alright time for the skill changes themselves first of all the faction drone specialization skills must be removed yes you read that right they make no sense at all and some of them are rarely if ever useful looking at amarr drone spec dont worry i dont want to remove them completely theyll just change the combat drone operation will be split into light drone operation and medium drone operation both will get a specialization skill light drone specialization and medium drone specialization each starter skill will have a 5 damage per level bonus on the corresponding drones and each specialization skill will give a 2 damage per level bonus same goes for heavy and sentry drones both will get a specialization skill that will give them a 2 bonus per level note the training times should be altered however the specialization skill must not prerequire the lighter version spec example medium drone specialization should not require light drone spec to iv unlike guns it should be like the missile specialization skills if anything
why on earth should we do that because instead of removing depth from the game it actually gives it more a drone focused pilot will have the option to specialize on the drones he wants to use specialization is very important on this game and i think this change will benefit it a lotnote fighters and fighter bombers should remain unchangedi didnt forget though that i changed the combat drone skill where did the 5000m bonus range gonew skill drone range operation 8000m per level bonus range on drones wait what 8000m where did those extra 3000m come from well they surely dont belong with the ew drones operation and i dont think itll be worth putting a specialization skill for thislast change i suggest is about the drone interfacing currently it gives 20 bonus on drone damage and mining yield 2 completely unrelated things simple change move the 20 mining yield to the mining drone skill making it a 25 mining yield per level and leaving the drone interface with just the 20 drone damage this may sound as an easy buff for mining drones cause they just got a lot better with a lot less training but im quite sure its not going to affect the market with a gazillion more minerals to summit up the drone skills should be looking like thiscore drone skills drones drone range operation light drone operation medium drone operation heavy drone operation sentry drone operation fighters fighter bombers support drone skills drone durability drone navigation drone sharpshooting drone interfacing specialization drone skills advanced drone interfacing light drone specialization medium drone specialization heavy drone specialization sentry drone specialization electronic warfare drone operation mining drone operation logistics drone operation salvage drone operation
the idea would be to have a civilian version of your said carrier so that it can enter highsec help moving fitted hulls and so those ships will be a niche filler as if i read correct your ships cant be launched from them into space they r just there for transport
ive always wanted a more realistic belt system like most solar systems we should have one or two belts that encircle the star like between mars and jupiter miners would use a scanning system maybe replace the current survey scanner to find hotspots and rich deposits warping to these spots would generate a field like mission and deadspace pockets so that servers dont need to track the position of billions of rocks but use graphical tricks like skyboxes and matt painting to give the impression that the belt stretches far beyond your ability to see they should probably remain until exhausted so that there is a competative element and so systems arent flooded with these mining spotsmain belts would contain the common ores for the region with rarer ore being spawned in anomilies possible due to collisions within these larger belts or extrasolar entities that have travelled between starsi also like the idea of playercorp owned structures and refinaries being built into hollowed out gaint asteriods the postions of which could be scanned down then sold or claimed with the use of mining contracts or charters owners could allow private or public use of their facilities with adjustable tax rates providing refining repair services storage even limited protection within a certain range would begin the process of moving mining and refining out of npc hands of course a range limit would exist between mining outposts in the same system say 4 au and publicly avaliable facilities would need to offer competative prices for their servicesprospecting by gilligan zaftiglay claim to asteroid belts with mining charters by andrea griffin
revision of belts sure let me spend five minutes brainfarting and twenty minutes typing it downgeneral lookeach system has one to three belts consisting of an entire orbital path as physics and aesthetics dictatebelts are divided into x number of gridsmajority of the belts is empty rocks out of necessity as the sheer scope would otherwise make it a mining bonanzainteractionexplorationsome grids in belts contain probeablescannable concentrations of mineralmineable ore think current belts other grids can contain exploration content as per normal mechanicsstill other grids contain asteroids the size of moonlets which must be found the old fashioned way ie cannot be probedscanned and are large enough to establish asteroid bases on moonlet bases consist of half buried pos with structures on surface otherwise same function as pos moonlet bases can mine the asteroid they are embedded in providing lower tier moon minerals mining the moonlet is temporary as it will eventually break apart from integritymassloss with room for structures gradually decreasing upon breakdown the remaining base structures are destroyed and a similarly sized moonlet appears elsewhere moonlet bases can be established by pirate factions and will function as drug labs boostergas ship yards bpcs mining operations oreminerals duh etc pirate bases do not degrade the moonlets and can be taken over once it is destroyed but they are heavily defended think incursion level defenders settled moonlets except pirate ones can be probed down difficulty depends on extent of established base with signature as pertains to probing determined by power consumption vs max power secret bases ahoy
not sure if i just didnt find the answer yet or a post hasnt been made by ccp yet but today sometime after downtime i notice that the rorqual now allow members to compress ice from any of the 3 bays my cargo fleet hanger ore hold as before it only gave you the option of my hanger to do compression from this now allows you t compress 250 block at one time instead of the previous limit of 137 though this is great and seemed to be a serverside hotfix cause i didnt recall al patch for it they still need to do something about the compression time of ice or number of manufacturing slotsccp you are doing great by fixing that simple dropdown menu can you just change the number of manufacturing slots now that just a simple number fix too make it 8 or 10 instead of the 4 or just adjust the ice compression times bye 1015 seconds that it thanksps can anyone else confirm this or am i just crazy after using the rorqual for years
i think a popup like missing cargo would work instead you get podded and the first time you undock it asks if youve checked your clone no automation you sort out the clone yourself but like every popup you can disable iti think after a while everyone would turn it off but new players to pvp might need the reminder as its not something seen in many other games eventually in would become ingrained to new players and theyd turn it off as well its not always a case of being stupid if you dont live alone or something in real life happens phone knock at door its easy to get distracted at the wrong moment

there is no way in current game mechanic to save someone from afk cloaker that gets active and opens cynoto minimize the effect of cloakersyou would need to have active fleet all the time 247you would need to fly pvp setups all the timeif cyno opens evryone would need to warp immidiately to attacked shipnothink from these three points above will happen running fleets 247 and mainly work in pvp setups is exhausting and can be done for a day but not for week the afk cloaker that becomes active risks only 30 mil while the target dies almost immidiately before even first response arrives when the response fleet arrives the attackers are on their marry way out of the system this leads to extreme exhaustion on the side of defenders while the cyno pUFFFDlot didnt need to put any efffort at alltherefore i agree with the proposition or alternatively using fuel for the cloaking module or mechanism that would allow to uncloak ship if effort is put into it
afk cloaking is not an issue wormhole space does not have local and noone is complaining about afk cloakers if you are worried about cloakers move systems or be ready to pvp at all times in other words if there would be no local you would not be worried about afk cloakers at all burn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me

love this post if overview discussion ever comes up with ccp i will make sure to use this thread burn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
oh thank you very much chitsa jason its very kind of youi dont know if all ui development teams know about these ideas but it seems that at least one of them ccp arrow does
it seems this column has become unnecessary since ccp coded the new left click radial menu
i will be back to full working condition on csm issues on june 6th if you could contact me in game then we could talk on comms about your ideas i really like them burn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
i think eve should not do everything there are plenty oog media players you can useburn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
this would just give advantage to veteran players over new players nayburn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
bad idea the only people i could potentially accept getting something close to that are genuine newbies who made an honest misstake in what they trained because they didnt know better and the amount of time invested would be so low it would not matter anywayin short  no
it would not take long at all but i am also pretty sure it would make some people stop some of their account i cant really see people using 20 account at the same time without any softwaretool to help out 40 clicks to have all 20 ships fire thier gun if the target was already locked madness
invalid argument you cannot jump into a worm and popping cynos is one of the principal functions as well as threat posed by cloakers  ie the lack of local has nothing to do with it
bops veshta with a local window the problem isnt jumpdrives or cynos its local no amount of pontificating about afk cloakers is going to do anything about local being a source of easy intel about kspace systems

i dont like this the ice changes stimulate nullsec alliances to be more selfsufficient for ice products and work together with ice miners if you improve compression youre just going to get 1 large group of ice miners for each of the isotopes exporting 95 of their ice to jita while most alliances continue to get most of their ice products from jita
i have asked ccp for update on thatburn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
the jove are not a war mongering people they keep to thair space and contact with them is limited to a select few spys and the likeif the jove invaded empire space then there would be no one left in thair wake they are far in advance of any of the empire factions thair frigates alone can halt fleets of caps the vindicator best dps platform in wider circulation at current has the comparative fire power of a water pistol compared to the jovian eidelonto interrupt eves market the jovians would most likly just dd jita 44 and any other large or minor hub station there would be no coming back from that just think how much rl money would be lost to the ether if the jove destroyed jita 44 i bet its in the 100s of 1000sthe capsuleer and dust bunnies are super clones game wist custom implants would be cool but that is a compleatly different matter all together
wormhole space should not be self sufficient any space in that matter should be tied to others in some manner we do not want to have closed gate communities in eveburn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
even if ice was put in to wh space it still wouldnt be self sufficent youd still have to buy your mods unless you fancy using t1 mods still have to buy t2 ships youd also have to buy your pos mods as these cant be made in wh spaceyou also have to come out to sell your tags although that techincally wouldnt be affecting you being self sufficientyoud also have to hope the ice was the right sort for your own towerso please chista before you make sweeping comments atleast make sure they are correct yes they potentially would be more self sufficent but they wouldnt by any means be closed gatei dont even know if it would be good or bad if they showed up on d scan it would be pretty risky mining them very easy to find and catch people in them i could also see people using bomber alts to just camp themputting them in c4 space might attually help make them useful although id still rather they just had 2 statics
optional pop up would be great in my mind ive been playing this game for quite a while and i still forget to upgrade my clone from time to time burn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
its one of the two sp drains in eve and the other one only apply to sub skills it should not be made ineffective think of it as ccp extending the game for you beittervets
are you trolling i cant tellccp dont need to extend the game no one has learnt and maxed every skill and i doubt if someone ever did theyd clap their hands and say right ive beaten eve it especially doesnt work on vets because the longer you play the more invested you arebut a new player losing their first month of sp beyond the default 900k clone to their first attempt at pvp a gank or gatecamp might decide to leave the game so as a business strategy it doesnt work especially since the older the player the more likely they play using plexthe only other game i can think of that had a similar mechanic is lineage ii and even there it was used as an exploit to drop down to lower levels rather than a punishment for dying its a hold over from a time where mmos needed to keep people playing through grind and to continue paying a subscription as an industry id like to think weve moved on
youre trying to change eve into something thats not eve medical clones are meant to do what they do if youre whinning its an indication theyre working as intended they dont need to be sugarcoated so that they fail their intended purposetldrhtfu
thats a yes on the trolling thenan optional dialogue warning would change eve into something its not your eve is easily broken thenim not whinning since ive never had this happen to me im pointing out something minor that could help people particularly new players enjoy eve more
1 agreed
1 many reasons for it burn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
my ego needs constant massage 1
if you die to this particular breed of t3 the you are doing it wrongi agree with the op this is whylet me first state that i do not actively hunt capital ships any cap kills i have been on are down to the pilots stupidity not me or my friends laying elaborate tarpsusing this mechnic to shield the transport of capssupersjfs not in my personal belief a use the ccp envisioned but the eve player base being what it is found and started abusing iti personally think that ccp need to tweek the cyno and jump mechanics to include spatial drift of the lighting beacon namely thisfor every 10 km off the initial lighting possistion of the becon the host hull is the jumping hull has a possible jump deviation of 10000km could possible be reduced with adding a bonus to one of the current jump skillsfailing that it should not be possible to light a cyno within the projected range of a poss force field if the pos is online without its force field up if its offline or onlining still in the countdown the cyno can be lit withing the force fields projected rangehowever once the tower is online any ships jumping to said cyno will load grid at the force fields projected range limit wether it is active or not
and again cloaking works as intended

why is it a bad thing that you someone who chose to live in nullsec has to be on guard whenever someone is in localyoure acting as if its unfair that you cant pve in perfect safety in bloody nullsecall the stuff you said applies just as well to wormholer players  and know what we do we do act like as if there is the possibility of hostiles appearing in system at any second we dont cry about it being unfair because were not silly we chose to live in this area we deal with the constant threat inherent with the type of play we sought outif you dont want to deal with that constant threat theres highsec
you cant light a cyno and jump in forces but a k162 can open with zero notice and a fleet can slip in without any notice or warning i say these are comparable situations except theres less tears from wormholesas for cynos in particular the entire reason cynos are used for hot drops is  want to take a guess  local local gives immediate infallible information about fleet size and location which makes it hard to hunt prey hot dropping is specifically used to get around thatit all comes back to local
here are my problems with your suggestionthe first is the false pretense that this has anything to do with server performance the actual server cycles chewed up by people afk in space is likely negligible the people afk in stations even more so your argument comes across as a cheap attempt to appeal to authority and it does not give you the appearance of impartiality for your own sake dont use itthe second issue is that your suggestion is inelegant and ineffectual for one it doesnt cover the intrusion it serves to very passive miners or haulers if it bases itself on ship action a player can just park in a safe spot and start flying if it bases itself on mouse action a macro can be written to move the mouse if it bases itself on player actions a macro can be made to click the screen every so often and if you want to counter that you start getting into macro detection software which is prone to false positives and ends up consuming a load of client resourcesnotice how i havent even brought into brought into question the legitimacy or otherwise of afk cloaking yet this is just a criticism of your idea even if we assume every supposition you pose is correctafk cloaking has nothing to do with afk and everything to do with the cloaking its not an issue with people afking its a fundamental issue with the way stealth is implemented in evebadlycloaking is phenomenally stupid everybody in the system knows youre there but they cant touch you im a huge stealth fan in most every genre it appears this is not good stealth this is an invulnerability shield combined with a first strike bonus it is an approximation of the effects of stealth rather than an attempt to emulate its process ive been over this many times beforeitd take a long rant for me to properly communicate the issues with eves stealth but the approximate fix is as such it should be possible for you to watch people without them knowing that youre there but if they do know youre there they should be able to flush you outcontemplate this then write up a new proposal
two points whbearning and nullbearing are entirely different animals in a wh the rats deal omni damage and are potent enough that anyone dropping in needs to cope with their firepower too in a c4c6 wh you generally run sites as a group activity often with logistics this makes attacking you much more difficult in a wh while a k162 may pop up at any time most of the whs that access your space are fairly controllable holes are often closed prior to pve activities which means your aggressors either already need to be in system prior to the start of your pve operations or be very lucky to find a new wh to you nullbears on the other hand  thanks to in game tools its very easy to identify and travel to any system that is regularly used for pve  thanks to local its very easy to identify when hostiles are about no hostiles  100 safe which shouldnt be the modis operandi  hotdrop mechanics allow an enemy to essentially drop any size force directly on top of a target  10 seconds for a fleet to enter the battle this is much much different than having a force enter system and warp to a fleet to gank them  30s for a fleet to enter battle  pve generally doesnt pay as well although it pays far more consistently for as long as anyone wants to pve now im certainly not advocating for a tool to hunt afk cloakers im just pointing out your comparison between nullbearing and wormbearing doesnt really hold water i already elaborated earlier the two major problems in nullsec surrounding afk cloakers are the hotdrop mechanics and the omniscient local intel tool neither of which are issues in whs because neither exists in whs
a cloaker is afkyou move one system over and you can feel safe againa cloaker is not afkthere is no problem whatsoeverare you really bringing the servers into this argument you know that a player that is pretty much afk drains almost no resources
would definitely make for some badass fights and more frequent fights at that
the answer is the same as it has been for a while unfortunately its a performance issue that will be solved when a very large and currently ongoing behind the scenes code refactoring project is completed sometime in the futurea bunch of you are going to to respond to this with some variation of why not do  wouldnt that work and ill go ahead and preemptively let you know that the answer to is our code cant do that with acceptable performance right now but will be able to in the futureso it will happen but as always i cannot give an eta

lets just biomass everyone thatll make things interestingoh wait ccp isnt interested in financial suicide to create lol for you
you didnt notice that the jovians arent even mentioned in the new odyssey trailer did youseems like the hint that they have finally succumbed together with them being unimportant enough to bother mentioning in the trailer says that ccp plans to deemphasize thembesides sleeper tech and ye olde earth tech is more advanced than jovian tech
t3 technology is inferior to all known jovian hull configurationssleeper tech has been known about and studied for years even before apocriphathe empires know enough about sleeper to have implemented their components in to some ship modules found in the minmatar cosmos constellation i think this would imply that sleepers or the race that created them once had a foot hold in a part of the eve cluster its was down to the discovery of larger quantity of sleeper components that the empires was able to integrate sleeper tech in to new hull designs and that is still in the experimental stage of development they still have not found a way to ensure the safety and integrity of any pod pilots cognitive functionality after being forcefully removed from the parent hull it is suspected that the empires was only able to get as far as they did with this new tech because of jove interventionthe jove have been around long enough to have a acute understanding of the 4 empires and their splinter factions they are assumed to be as old if not older that the ancient empires of the takmahlyan jungtalocan a talocan bs makes an appearance in a c5 radarmag site i think make of that what you willthe only tech currently in eve that is superior to any known jove tech is terran and the jove aggressively seek out and aquire these relics
the jovians as a race are dying literally and even when they werent an invasion wasnt their style why invade nowwhat youve suggested is a universe wide incursion which already began with sansha getting their hands on a suspected abandoned jovian station thats as close as youll get to your idea which seems game breaking unbalanced and unfeasableyoud have more success pitching it as an existing faction other than jove or entirely new faction the awakened infomorph may well be hinting toward that now
at the moment c4s are basically a no mansland no one uses them can we give them 2 static to make them more useful
a mans life in the hole is not meant to be easy
op has some good pointslowsec missions need a good hike in lp payouts at least say about 2030k per mission l5s currently pay arounf 3050k lp per missionexploration ls specifically radar sites need need to drop small quantitys of bottle neck comps serpentis is internal bulkheads currently only found in null sec null sec drop rates would also increase to compensate
personally i think that the game should dynamically balance the rewards from all types of pve content if lots of people are missioning in highsec the game should increase the reward from missioning in low and null if lots of people are ratting one type of rat the game should decrease their bounties and boost those of other typesits always seemed strange to me that pve exists in a sort of vacuum where the actions of other players have reduced effects compared to more market driven methods of making isk if nothing else the rewards from missioning for one corp should be reduced if there are lots of people missioning for that specific corp even if the relative profitability is kept constant between high and low sec space
you seem to be talking out of your ass with these figures but ill concede that level 5s currently are pretty  you get  missions youll be making less than highsec level 4s at times im looking at you rogue drones and angel cartel right now theres no real reason to do level 5s over just sitting in fw plexes since theyll make you more money and you can do them with a stabbed  cloaky t1 frigate compared to the minimum triple box requirements of most level 5s if you want to clear them in any reasonable timeframenever mind the  fact that theres an actual limit to the amount of lp i can score per mission seriously 97k for what could be up to 45 minutes of hard work have you seen this  lp store maybe i should just join the minmatar fw and sit in a triple stabbed cloaky breacher in the plentiful med plexes here
admitadly the last time i wan a l5 was over 2 expansions ago and my lp payout for the mission was 42k lp took me ages to compleat i was more getting at the fact that there is a big gap between current l4 pl payouts and l5s sticking low sec l4s somewhere inbetween thoe 2 figures mite be more inticing to mission runners after all if 1020 missions in low sec can get you the lp for that faction bs bpc you want then i would say that the risk to reward ratio is becoming more ballanced
2 statics for c4s would be more useful indeed having ice in wspace does not make 100 self sufficient i do agree but it makes it more self sufficient than it is i would rather have more unique resources in wspace than the ones which are already in kspace also you are in no holes nice did not see that coming burn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
if it means that the system fails to drain sp from you then yes
there is already a civilian point its funny to pont some one with it then suceed in killing them when asking them y the did not try to warp they reply with you had me pointed now the big reveal inform them of the mod you used and its one flaw it has a warp disruption strength of 0 enter the face palm p
manual piloting is a skill not a mechanicsaying that a tool tip in one of the combat missions would be a simple fix to your niggle instead of adding a tutorial just for it
1 i like this idea too
100k bounty on anyone issuei feel that there is an issue with the current game mechanics regarding the current game mechanics statethe minimum isk amount for placing a bounty is increased from 5k to 100k also bounties can now be placed on anyone weUFFFDre removing the 1 security standing requirement currently in the thisbounties have no effect on who can be attacked legally where does not matter with the above as it isthis allows players to camp out in npc corp and help channels and place bounties on anyone for any or no reason at all one of my favorite parts about this game has been how it strives to be real eve is real and in the real world you cant just place a bounty on any law abiding citizen whenever you feel like itbounties for me used to be one of the simplest way other than an active scam in progress to spot a player who may be less than honest or a tad bit shady the current mechanics make bounties a pathetic joke where half the universe is flying around with a 100k bounty on them their usefullness has been nearly negated for highsec players while adding a way for station dwellers to grief and it is targeted at players who are new npc corp or just those who dare to speak in an open channel not primarily a person who has wronged you or anotheradditionally this is detracting from the meanining of the wanted status that used to be a badge of accomplishment for player piratessimple fixplayer must have criminal andor suspect flag to be bountied if they have a positive security statusadvanced fixin addition to the simple fix suggested the minimum bounty amount could be based on the characters security status higher security status  higher min bounty and the player must be activley flagged as comitting an illegal actmy primary concern is for individual pilots especially the new players final thought regarding corporation  alliance level bounties in addition to the bounty a kill right from a member might be good idea to include in the costaddition after getting some feedback ingame players primary concern with this is not being able to bounty scammers as much as we all love to hate them technically a scam is not an aggressive act and no one made you click accept most nonpirate scammer use toons anways and are easily spottedreddit
the differences you mention do exist but personally i think at a higher more general level theyre relatively analogous they both boil down to an enemy force appearing in your system without prior warning due to no local  k162s and cynos respectively and without much time to react as for the pve being different ie it being a group activity with much hardier shipslogistics in wormholes vs solo in null  that only really applies to the higher levels people often do solo the lower classes in weak pve specific fits but even they arent moaning about stuffreally it strikes me as more of a difference in attitude far too many people think they should be able to dedicate their ships fittings and playstyle entirely to pve in null and not have to make any trade offs to deal with the nasty men who hunt them wormholers either are willing to make that tradeoff without making threads begging for fixes or are just crazy enough to not care in the first place
do you girls honestly believe that removal of local is the endall of solutionscomparisons with worm space fail because normal conditions are so different from kspace probes are permanently in space access can be controlled 99 and any potential threat can be neutralized using what amounts to generic fits security in worm space is a nonissue if you are sufficiently organized the only threat comes from running into someone who has even better organization andor will as the guys who went in and logged off until enough force was in system to do the job  there is no comparison to ordinary null spacedont get me wrong i too want local control to be in the hands of whomever controls a given space or in the very least to be a delayed sort of thing  where we differ is that i do not buy into the idea that it is allimportant i see it as smaller albeit integral part of itno one wants to have to spam scan and the potential benefits of kspace will never be enough it would break the game to justify the kind of vigilance needed for survival in wormsso  removedelay local  but do a number on localaccess as a whole at the same time redo the scanner to function more like a passive radar than an active split ship detection from all other forms if necessary add colour coding iff to scanner and probe results make jump bridges into harnessed wormholes think stargates with aperture control and free access to anyone even hostile allow for a modicum of control over established fullsized stargates such as temporary closure or aperture control for instance etcsidenote as perfect an intel tool local is it is easily equalled or surpassed by that of a covert cloak user why is it that a cloaked ship can use active scanners with impunity why can transmissions tofrom probes not be traced back to the controlling shipone might not be able to do much of anything while cloaked but the power of intel and ready availability of da blob they should be huntable new probe set that amplifies emissions scanningprobing leaves a 1030s trail
local doesnt need to be removed completely it does need to be disentangled from the primary kspace intel system though id go with a recent speakers local in kspace  some other mechanic introduced to provide the intel functions that the local list performs now but with more controlgranularity based on system sec sov upgrades etal reverting to the full no local experience in wspace of course
fact is fact no matter the changes to whatever jita will always support 95 of all the products used by all in game nothing is going to change thatbut fixing the broken ice compression will help all eve pilots not just the 00 ones
some day in the future a dev sifting though the coding will find that one line and then booya heshe will yell and the world will change
ok thats all understandable but that really does not mean you cannot do anything about links right now how about going ahead with other parts of the inevitable nerf here is a list of things you could do and imo should do right away to make links less ridiculous for nowreduce the effectiveness of links by a decent portion at least 33 imo preferably more like 5060 make activating links turn on your weapons timer and preferably some sort of aggression maybe the npc kind make links not work in poss make intrediction nullifiers incompatable with links make links give you a sig bloom you can remove this again once they come on grid there is a ton of things you can do that wont break the server that would do a lot make general gameplay around links better
that isnt the correct answer the correct answer is
reducing effectiveness is something you could do in about 5 minutes and deploy tomorrow
have you ever been to null that is a huge closed gated community in fact some times they really close the gate by locking it down with smart bombsbubbles and fast locking dessys theres no reason to ever leave null except to sell your wares or gank carebears why should wormholes be any different they are 00 space why not treat them with the same privileges that null gets they get ice all the ore stations jump clones sov all we are asking for is just something that would allow wormholes to do what they are there to do live on the edge of the world in unknown space not this constant running back to high sec for fuel
its both really doubleclicking in space to get your ship to go in x direction is the mechanic figuring out how to make effective use of that is the skill  some folks never get as far as part 1 of that sadly though which is what the tutorials intended to fixps would that be a good time to introduce a turret trackingrange demo into the tutorial as well
you are making assumption that bounties are only used to catch pirates who actively go out and kill nonwar targets in highlow sec spacebounties are also used on war targets with high sec status politicalmarket enemies corp thieves people who insulted you in chat or even just to  with somebody because you dont like them there are countless ways to do bad things you cant simply tie bounties to sec statusin addition bounties arent designed to punish bad players its a system to put a price on someones head for whatever reason a player sees fit imagine playing eve as a career pirate you have some annoying antipirates waltz into your territory and in response you put a gigantic bounty on their corp and laugh as even neutral gangs passing through start to take a crack at them this is an absolutely legitimate use of the system features must cater to all players not just good playersaside from that poor suggestion your other point stands true and has been pointed out many timesi think the best fix is slow bounty reduction over time 100k per week maybe this would eventually dry up meaningless troll bounties while leaving any actually meaningful bounties virtually unchangedthe wanted sign should also have a higher isk threshold 1m or 10m or perhaps color graded from white to blood red
youre 6 months late to the party this subject has been beaten to deathbut ill be niceactually the is more real in its current incarnation than it was beforelaw abiding  good person  awoxers are mechanically speaking not breaking any rules corporatealliance traitors arent doing anything bad from a technical standpoint highsec griefer corps follow the rules and declare wars ninja looters use the aggro system to legally engage people who are running their missions in highsecone the flip sidelow security status  trollgrieferterrible personsuch a person could be an antipirate went out to lowsec for a bit of pvp and nothing more someone who was tricked into or was accidentally doing something stupidwho is good and who is bad are purely relative concepts what you consider bad others dont and vice versa who knows maybe those people who are getting 100k bounties in those channels really are making someone mad a good rl examplesome time ago a pakistani official placed a 100000 bounty on a filmmaker please he was an amateur at best over a tastelessinflamatorycontroversial filmthe filmmaker had done anything wrong from a legal standpoint all he did was create something perceived as an incredible insult to many many people the world overthe badge has changed now its bounty amounts how would this allow players who have committed legal crimes to have bounties placed on them teach them and they shall no longer be afraid
bounties put on anyone is fine they usually lose the 100k bounty when they lose a frig its how the top bounties are never collected how about we add an expiration on the bounties so they reverse back 90 to the person who set the bounty after a certain timeframe so if they want to be the most wanted they have to cause the most trouble within the last 60 days or soi mentioned this to market hub trolls that are proud of their bounty and they absolutely hated the idea
1 option to hide wanted sign for bounty below x amount2 disable bounty completely on trial noobs theres no reason for anyone to place bounty on them aside from trying to scare and grief someone who cant even read overview properly
incorrect i argue that a bounty hunter is one who pursues a criminal or fugitive for whom a reward is offered thus inferring that a bounty should be limited to criminal or fugitivesdid no one consider the mercenary corps this must be killing their businessagain hire a merc corp with that gigantic pile of isk they need to stay in business as welli think a small depletion rate is a very reasonable suggestioni really like the color grade suggestion
100 agreed but not without its issues agreed use the money to hire mercenariesagreedantipirate risk of the jobwent to low sec for pvp and nothing more id expect a bounty just for winning or scratching someones paintsomeone who was tricked into or was accidentally doing something stupid i dont support catering to stupidity
get in a ship and attack them or hire a mercenary what about the mercsgood counterpoint to simulate this real world example in game such a bounty should require being placed at ceoalliance leader level using the funds of the entity not the wallet of the characterthere are no legal crimes oxymoron 90 of the time any legal crime as you say preformed against you is 100 of the time your fault for allowing it to happen do i have to say merc corp againits hard to teach when they cant ask a question in a help channel without being bountied by a troll
well thats simply not the case according to ccp ccp specifically removed the sec status limit with retribution it wasnt an oversight it was mentioned in the dev blog announcing the feature the is a feature for all of eve to use as they see fit if a criminal wants to place a bounty on their enemys head they have every right to do sobounties are so much more than criminal hunting theyre actually a large part of the new mercenary system instead of paying mercs per kill through a 3rd party kb system its easier now to just put a corp widealliance wide bounty on who you want targeted and then pay them on a per contract basis if you want them to go above and beyond ganking workif you actually took a look at the merc ecosystem you would find that the new has been a godsend to mercenary work in large part because of the freeform nature of the sec status is far too limiting an indicator to attach to a feature as useful as the overhauled  its very useful for 00 where actions arent tied to arbitrary numbers but to reputation and cold hard lossesthe is a tool for players to do with as they see fit this is simply how ccp designs evelook if you want to only apply bounties to high sec status players thats great use the feature your way i on the other hand may want to use the feature in an entirely different way thats the beauty of evehere is the opening line from the retribution page the immortal elite of the eve universe live by a unique set of laws it is not uncommon for some to find the decisions of the law lacking in appropriate justice 
i agree with the op in that the current can and is being abused though i can see its utility when one wishes to somewhat settle the scorethe only way to make it fair and limit the abuse is to give players the ability to work off to cancel the bounty placed on themperhaps with missions or working up faction favors maybe having a higher security level could allow a player to work off bounties easier maybe bounties could be paid off to npcs or a percentage of it reduced based on security level maybe there can be a court system introduced where you can appeal the bounties place on you or turn yourself in to concord i dont knowbut to make the fair and limit abuse the player should be able to work it off lawful or criminal alike
mentioning the security status was only a secondary suggestion additionally with the new statuses concord  security status that is coming there must be a middle groundit is impossible for a single player to account for all possibilities hence this threadwould this be better nothing to do with sec statussimple fixplayer must have active criminal andor suspect flag to be bountied
or there could be a formula based on the players security level and the amount of bounties placed how often the player gets a bounty placed on them and ranking that will calculate a decay rate or expiration for example someone who gets a bounty for 100000 and manages to avoid bounties for a while could see their bounty disappear but for those that make the top ten most wanted it would take perhaps months of good behavior for their bounty to disappearthere could be any number of ways but as it is now that wanted banner seem an indelible mark that will not go away especially if the person has a low bounty on them because who is going to collect on a low bounty
a formula is an excellent idea but rather than suggesting one ill leave that for whomever our awesome ccp math guru is to formulate
i too like my bounty and do not want it to disperse
so if i join your corp and loot your corp assets and maybe awox your deadspace mission ship on the way out you shouldnt be able to bounty me
you seem to be mistaking eve with hello kitty island adventure
why is the 100k bounty on anyone an issue just because you see no merit or reason for the bounty doesnt mean it shouldnt have been placed its not your place or mine to dictate the validity or not of a placed bountybut you can and it is done but bringing real life comparisons into the argument are always set to fail best notthe wanted sign is and always has been an indicator that another player wanted someone the only change is the removal of the unrelated npc standing restriction also pilots of high standing in the old system could have wanted signs and many of my friends did just thatnpc standing have no place in a player led standings system its also irrelevant whether the game marks they are criminal or not the point about the system is that a player has deemed them wanted end ofwhen the was first released there was the inevitable rush to hand them out this rush inevitably also diedthe will evolve over time ccp have said they wish to improve upon this change but the change is welcome and i should be able to bounty anyone i want for whatever reason i wantdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
how is it being abused exactlyalso there is already a way to remove or work off the bounty but it will cost youagain this is not about npcs its a player led mechanicno decay rate you want it removed then do so but it will costdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
as far as i can see the is working pretty well the way that it was intended yes there was the initial flurry of counties and some still give them as a joke malcanis flow nelg grrr earn them off nodecay noget blown up and they slowly go away working as intended never get blown up then it is just a label of no significance to you ignore and move onmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i liked my snowball launcher
this has been answered in posts 6 7 and 8 if you allow that to happen you have only yourself to blame and once again why not use that massive pile of isk on undocking a ship and doing something about it instead of cowering in a station it makes it easier for people to not play the game and we all know that could and should have serious potential consequences ie autopilot
if you can not be bothered to read and comprehend the discussion i wont waste my time responding to your concernsthe system is currently being abused reasons are stated in the thread above
i agree that the new is by far superior to the former one and i also agree with all that you posted here except the last linewhat is the point of label that doesnt mean anything you might as well not have it at all if its being setup to be meaninglessthat said to prevent the thread from trailing off topic i must restate the concern is about bounty placement not bounty removale
im asking directly how its being abused reasons for placing a bounty that you dont agree with do not constitute abuse it merely means you dont agree with the reasonsif you felt your argument was a solid one you wouldnt have avoided the majority of my post with such a weak responsedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
how many times do i have to say the same thinglet me restate the core of the issue and rephrase ithow is it cool for a person to troll a help channel for n00bs who dont even know how to play yet and get bountied when they post a question
like i said you may not agree with the reason someone placed that bounty but that doesnt constitute abuse its merely your take on what is and isnt a good reason for said placement destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i have received a suggestion ingame regarding this issue user wishes to remain anonymous that may be a reasonable solution for everyonecontract killsi wont go into trying to specify details since id be sure to be reamed for it rather than starting a discussion about how it could donethoughts
point taken however correct me if im wrong are there not a few additional rules for the newbie systems such as being one of the only places where using legitimate game mechanics to grief players is not tolerated per ccp regulationshow is it any different posting up a help channel to target them
the difference is that a bounty placed doesnt actually do much apart from add a wanted sign and figure it doesnt mean they will diaf any time soon where as can baiting and other such things do result in loss and therefore are frowned upon in starter systemsthere was a warning from ccp when the was first introduced that stated not to target new players but that much like the rest of the early rush has since calmed to a state where they deem it not to be a problem which tbh it really isntdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
for just a moment lets assume that i would agree that the current is just finei would still argue that the wanted label needs adjustmentsuch as the white to blood red color tag suggested and minimum bounty before the player has a bounty tag shows up on the overviewalso even if unrelated to this i think contract killers for hire would be awesome
the problem with the concept of only criminals can be bountied is the case malc presented you can do dozens of nasty things in game that the game does not label you foryou could be a scammer an awoxer a troll or a csm carebearall deserving of bounties but under your proposal not able to receive them until they did something blatantbounties are for the sideline cases where concord has not slapped a naughty tag on your toe and it is left to the player populationin my opinion anywaysmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
and on the flip side you can do nothing at all and be an be labeled  the label doesnt mean anything anymore hence the idea of contracting killers for hire color coding for wanted tags and min bounty before it shows on the overview
im still waiting
support said they also have concerns about this issue but they dont do anything gms advice was post on forum to get enough sample from playerbasea possible solution cloak needs a charge what is behave like laser crystalswith a 01 damagycycle 5 sec cycle time cloaker have 5000 secs almost one and a half hour in cloakthats enough time for a hunt or an op and active player can reload the modulebut when goes afk after limited time other players has a chance to get revenge d
well well if cloaked up people in systems are affecting your game play then i have a solution for yougo into highsec then there can be hundreds or thousands of people cloaked up next to you and it wont affect you one bitthere you have your balance congratulations it didnt cost the devs one line of work if you cannot take the heat of nullsec  move outit is called nullsec for a reason that means null security  there is no safety do you think the name is a coincidence or did the devs maybe assign this name for a reason i wonder what it might be
not a direct answer but a counter question if we deal in risk and reward can you tell me the cloakers risk in return for the reward of intelligence on the opponents systems and threat pressure on any ops in the systemmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
whats the risk of running a locator agent whats the risk of looking at your star map whats the risk of having an awoxing alt or spy to score kills should there be any risk for basic inteleven better what if the cloaky wants to engage  hotdrop if someone is ratting in a system looked at by an afk cloaker why wouldnt the cloaker think its a trap maybe its bait or neut fit thats no risk
this would be interesting for lower secs perhaps this is how the rare mineral types are found and push people into lownullwh from the generic larger belts in highsec
background currently the nullsec industry situation suffers from subpar outpost services and the results of a complex t2 material supply chain this results in a large amount of materials and items being built in highsecurity space then shipped to nullsec this situation creates dependency on highsec materials and markets for a region of space that ccp intends to be selfsufficientproposal intent t2 production involves four general bottlenecks to complete bpc copying invention using datacores and data interfaces not consumed pi materials and moon materials this proposal only seeks to correct the availability of invention in nullsec thus reducing the complexity of t2 production in nullsec to only obtaining advanced moon materials this change would move towards ccps stated goal of nullsec selfsufficiency in a unique way and leave highsec largely unaffectedfacts ccps stated intent is to create conditions for nullsec to be 99 selfsufficient invention requires a racial data interface and typically two types of datacores to complete datacores are primarily provided by rd agents and the faction warfare lp store datacores can be obtained through hacking randomly assumptions ccp wants to find ways to remove passive income from datacore farming null security space will continue to have a high demand for t2 items inventors do not typically sell t2 bpcs for profit but will more likely use them for their own production datacores obtained via hacking sites will not sufficiently supply t2 invention demands highsec invention will not be adversely affected by improving other ways to invent t2 items possible courses of actionallow datacore free invention only in caldari research stations pros caldari outposts are typically the least built outposts as they offer bonuses that are largely redundant to mobile laboratories this change would provide an incentive to construct this outpost additionally this change would likely be easier to complete finally limited access to these outposts would not adversely affect t2 invention in highseccons outposts are not built quickly and incentives may not translate into more caldari outposts constructed additionally pilots without access to these outposts would not obtain this bonusadjust all outposts to allow invention and allow datacore free invention in all nullsec outpostspros access to datacore free invention more easily available to most nullsec residents  implementation would be equalcons removes incentive to this new featureallow existing mobile laboratoriespros all existing pilots would have access to new feature through existing pos modules  implementation would be equal additionally poss are subject to attack and destruction finally outposts would be unchanged and not require new construction for feature accesscons blanket type implementation that would apply to everyone without much of a tradeoff highsec and lowsec poss would need special coding to prohibit this feature add an industry upgrade to allow datacore free inventionpros industry upgrades fit into the current sov system and would require risk to ship upgrades to the system additionally it would add more variety to the sovereignty upgrade systemcons would limit access to feature by only those who have sovereignty this may be also difficult to implementadd a new pos mobile laboratory such as efficient mobile invention laboratorythis new module would have no more than 5 production lines for invention only require only a data interface and blueprint copies to complete invention jobs the power grid and cpu requirements would be on par with current laboratories this module could only be anchored in null security spacepros the additional module would require tradeoffs in module placement in the pos due to cpu and power grid requirements additionally the new module is inline with existing modules and coding structures that restrict anchoring by security status cons wormholes would have this feature as well and may negatively impact highsec invention due to their access to empire systemsrecommended course of action recommend adding a new mobile laboratory as it fits within the existing anchoring limited pos modules and supports the most access to this option within current risk mechanics however possibly combing the lab with a sovereignty upgrade to anchor the new laboratory would be required to limit the effect of wh space datacore free inventionthe overall endstate would further remove the influence of datacore income stated ccp goal and improve the ability for null security industry to become more selfsufficient stated ccp goal
well since hisec can only be 80 self sufficient after the ice belt changes coming in this ridiculous expansion id say you are already ahead of most of the rest of the universe or omg forbid you have to leave null to pick up something you need for invention got a deal for you i will farm datacores and trade you for ice product ill even deliver
as the previous poster said come the patch you will already have more than enough advantages over any other sec level you really dont need any more
the 80 is galaxy wide high sec ice amount is five times the needs of hig sec poss
facepalm why do i waste good sarcasm here nevermind rex you wouldnt get it the point i was trying to make is a big part of the changes in the upcoming expansion are targeted toward improving null sec mining while heavily dk stomping hisec miners now as usual ccps supremely flawed execution of intent will most likely end up screwing both null and hisec miners the fact remains that null sec is getting the best of this expansion and asking for more favoritism is unlikely to garner any sympathy from the other sectors where some feel they are getting shafted during this expansion also asking that an item needed for invention be exempted in one particular area of space only is just ridiculous and comparable to saying i think i should be able to make pos fuel in my wh without ice products because i dont want to go out and procure them so once again my opinion on this subject would be hell no
lol im sorry but if youre complaining that highsec miners are getting it hard from ccp we could simply point to the mining barge buffs crimewatch 20 also helps out too we could point out the mission loot  drone poo changes just because ice mining is moving to anomalies doesnt undermine the strong boons ccp has given miners these last few expansions and frankly the ice mining changes are probably a boon to ice miners that actually play rather than park an alt in a belt and come back an hour later to empty the cargo why because ice prices will go up and ice mining is no longer the pathetically easymode form of mining that enables any schlep at work to run an eve client in the background accruing ice derail my next post will attack the ops suggestions
ccp doesnt want nullsec to be 100 efficient they want highsec dependent on nullsec and nullsec dependent on highsec now there vision has not reached full fruition because its generally easier to import everything from nullsec to highsec there are many reasons for this but one of the larger reasons were the lack of low end minerals in nullsec importing minerals to build stuff was inefficient compared to simply building stuff in highsec and importing the prebuilt shipsmodules the point of this paragraph is that ccp doesnt want nullsec to be completely selfsufficient in general the 99 selfsufficient remark was when viewing materials in terms of volume the last visage i read up on suggested bulky materials should be avaiable locally  but small materials should be imported trit size 001 average used in a week 25m average needed for a month 100m amount brought in by a jf 30m  bottleneckdatacore size 1 m3 average used in a week 10k average needed for a month 40k amount brought in by a jf 300k  not a bottleneck next passive datacore farming is no longer a major source of income datacores are now primarily supplied by faction warfare lp hence why they are cheaper too if we make parts of invention completely independent of datacores you harm faction warfare lowsec not highsec and frankly i see no reason to nerf this fw income finally while i fully support a boon to nullsec production i certainly dont support it at an indestructible safe outposts if anyone wants a boon to production it should happen at a pos pos modules already have a secstatus limitation feature built into it which makes this easier to implement simply create invention labs copy labs andor advanced assembly arrays that can only be anchored in 03 sec status or lower have the invention labs give a 510 improved invention probability or maybe a straight 2 me to all invented bpcs check for balance give similar potent boons to manufacturing and copying labs but for the love of god make sure people have to put crap in the labs so its at risk there is very little at risk in an outpost
dear god this has to be a trollno you can no have more things given to you deal with it buy your datacores like everyone else null sec has way to many free things you dont need free datacores as well
if i want to sit in the corner of the sanbox digging up old cat turds by myself i should very well be able too you seem to to favor a more forced socialism type of sandbox mechanic one where the teacher slaps the cat turd out of my hand and drags me by the hair to the jungle gym and then smashes my face into the slide until i decide to play with the other kids the only use i have for player interaction in eve is blowing ppl the fk up when they get in my way my subscription money my play style that is what a sandbox is truly about oh and news flash player interaction makes eve unique rofl theres a million other mmos out there that require far more player interaction than eve and many of us here actually like the fact that there is a chance to be semisuccessful soloing eve now go back to being a douche with your friends and leave me alone with my cat turds
and this jives with ccps stated goal of making null 99 self efficient how wh ice might and we are talking extreme maybes here make 50 of all occupied whs somewhere around 60 self sufficient maybe one or two wh mega alliances could support the infrastructure required to be totally self sufficient but those guys enjoy blowing each other up way too much to seal themselves off from the rest of eve and seriously who is we you and your wig your corpor your leash holders back at ccp or is this we the imaginary consensus of the masses you csms always quote when you get 2 corp members and three forum posters to agree with the drivel you post just curious
and once you got everything you need you dont need to come out againno bad idea like friggz already explainedstrom it is easier to be selfsufficient in a wormhole than you think
turret tracking is a good idea although some might argue that it is mechanics and not a skill that needs to be learned noted for discussion thoughm
there should be a method of manual piloting more accurate and less fail than double click in space while trying to face the camera in the neighborhood of right direction implement that first before giving rookies the impression of eve as a beta game
that doesnt seem like a valid reason for the jukebox that everyone liked to have been removed and not restored
removal of existing content is not the same as asking the game to do everything  its restoration of previous abilities many were happy to see some old effects come back  do you think this change would anger a lot or simply please a portion of the communityrunning this game full screen is enjoyable to many outside of those who multiboxmutlisession their alts  and this makes it much more playable and enjoyable to those players  especially being able to quickly pause a song from fullscreen if something happens pvp wise
i dont see the problem here at all want to listen to a specific song lower the in game music sound and open up youtube or sound cloud and listen to what you want you do not really need the jukebox
my two centsi only liked 2 tracks on the jukebox when i first started playingi have had it turned off for so long i forgot it was therei dont miss it
now what you are talking about is not limits on the current but an additional form of it contract killing is different than bounty less public more focused or do i misunderstand yoummike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
you misunderstand the point of the postthe thread was started regarding the and the issue pertaining to removing the 1 requirement allowing it to be used as a trolling tooli think we are now at the point of propsing ideas cross examining them and attempting to come to a solution are we notif at all possible it would be nice to see this thread start discussing ideas regarding the issue at hand rather than trying to defend the advantages of their side or poke holes in my suggestions poking holes is fine but come on everyone at least counter with a solution please i am doing my best to be objective and reasonable about thisjust got a new clone new ship new fit and i will remain out of highsecunless for purchase or travel when convient for at least the next week or two and do whatever i want whenever i want to whomever happens to be unlucky enough to cross my path why might as well try pirating it up and see if i can get a bounty that doesnt look so sad and because i do care about the pirate side as well so its time to be one to better understand them been out of highsec since my last post where is everyoneeverything below is merly an idea not refined enough to be a suggestion at the momentyes contract kills would be an addition such an addition could allow a player to hire a merc through the contract system if it is accepted then the player is bountied and stamped with a wanted label said contract could then be held by the purchaser opened up to corp alliance or made public in a similar manner to kill rights for any player allowing the previous 1 requirement to be reinstated or the suggested bounties allowed while player is flagged while i do realize that this could be abused the same way it is much less likely being as there will be contract fees and extra steps before the bounty is actually placed on the player
so basically you want to know right away if the player that you are dealing with is a bad person and with the being changed such that crimes are relative to a person you cant do that anymore and you dont like thatawoxing scamming margin trading corp theft ninja lootingganking etcmechanically they are legal morally they arent hence legal crimeand even though those things i listed above may be wholly or partly facilitated by the victims stupidity that doesnt mean they should be denied the ability to put a price on someones head just because the victor has a good securityfaction standingthe real world example i described came out of the politicians personal wallet not the countrys and it was directed at an individual not a company or state it was simply i will pay this amount of money for this mans headanyways your restriction can just be worked around just have a throwaway alt create a corp and toss out bounties like beforelastly your cry of what about the mercsmercs still have their place but to hire one is a more serious affair and as others have explained is more focused than simply there is a general reward for anyone who destroys this guys ship
incorrect we already have the redyellow for sec status on the overview i want to not see half the universe flying around with a bounty icon and wanted tag that used to be something to be earnedhence the idea of retribution via contractcontract bounty requiring frozen corpse for full paymentmost things can be worked around if put enough effort into it and that is the idea to make it more tedious more expensive and thus more meaningful when it does happenshould a bounty not be serious i think it should
i agree to an extentwe are far from that situation even though those numbers are old the trend is obviousyou can already set up a contract kill there are players and corps that do just that you also have the kill rights system to use if it applies to your situation the problem with a system you envisage is that you again rely upon an npc standing in what would be a player driven mechanic its also a poor indicator of who is and isnt badagain this comes back to what you deem is a good reason and what isntdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
incorrect you can not currently use the contract system for doing this this is done by direct contact to a specific player corp or allianceplease read the entire thread specifically post 11 30 34 and 36 againagain incorrect it should come down the definition of a bounty and what a bounty should be used for not defedending its use as a trolling tool
where did i say you needed to use the contract system for this i merely said you can already set up a contract kill which you canive read the thread the point still stands npc standings have no part in a player led mechanic even a contract one as you suggest hence why they were removed from bountiesbut let me ask you this would concord intervene in this contract system of yours like you said sounds like far worse issues could arise than you think we have nowbut i am correct your definition of what is and what isnt a troll bounty plays no part in the placement of that bounty its simply not your place or mine to decide if its serious enoughthe only one with the rights to decide any of that is the person placing the bountydestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
is it really too much to ask that you follow the flow of discussionwhere did i say that you said thatand you obviously know that i know that and know that is not what im talking about or youre selectively reading my thread for trolling ammoplease refer to posts 6 7 8 27 30 32 and 34 to understand the flow of discussiondid you really read it please refer to post 30 and 34edit did it confuse you that i didnt specify that the contract system would be an addition to the regular and the 1 would not apply to the contracts im not a ccp dev and i am only one person why not help us out with pointcounterpoint additions to  edits of alternative ideas as oppose to trolling it upmaybe you could answer this for us and actually participate in the flow of discussionsince when is 100k anywhere near serious even for a n00b
you know what this whole dilemma in which we spend a lot of time studying and training in a certain area like mining only to do a career change and learn a whole bunch of new things and never apply our acquired skills in mining ever again reminds me of realityit makes no sense that we can just magically redistribute our study we are buying books remember and effort to learn how to say efficiently mine ice into how to operate a freighter
but from what you are saying you used those mining skills during the time it took you to skill up those 25million spsyou flew mining shipsyou reaped the rewards of rock chewingmaybe you even reprocessed ore with less wastage i forget if this is a skill or notso now you want to turn these skills which you have benefited from into a new profession instantlyseriously nojint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
because nullbears are dumb i would like to see more cloakdroppers get nailed by such bait d
well removing local will not happen as ccp just boosted the fuction of local as radar on test server with faster scrolling bind to keys instead of mouse sooo any discussion about that is pretty much overhowever every mechanics needs a balance and cloaking has no counter balance so either it should be nerfed or changed in different direction it has nothink to do with living in 00 i remember same attitude back in the day from people who used nano battleships if it works but doesnt have counter balance it doesnt mean its right
afk master hereif i want to run my game 2357 so i can sit down and play when i walk past my comp without having to load it up everytime why should that not be allowed i browse the internet and check my email in game i also leave for hours at a time while looking at my spaceship from the other room if i chose to waste my money by doing nothing at all i doubt that is hurting the servers its probably helping them actually they still get my money and im sure the load on the server is nill compared to me flying aroundanyways if you dont like them just camp out and wait for their return to the keyboard or scan down those cloaky afk people bumb their ship and open firebtw i never heard of an undamaged kleong battlecruiser or romulan warbird having a problem keeping their cloak online no scifi issue herei dont see a problem jita is a special case and im sure ccp does their best there
1  let locator agents answer you without flying to their home1  remove personal contact for mission assignments
i demand an ore titan that can fly around in high sec and blow up planets with its doomsday and mine the resulting debris
just 1 question is it or will it be possible to include such boosters on lossmailshaving direct modifications to combat capabilities that are not listed as part of the cause of a ships loss while fixing the rest of the stuff can you see about making this possible
no for all the reasons given previously

its tricky but your suggestions are weak in some areasthe single biggest problem with pve in the game is that it mostly rewards solo play better than group play and rewards doing things in safer space high enough that more dangerous places are unattractive on a costtoearnings sheetwith a penalties model of loss that distills down to dont fly what you cant afford to lose which naturally extends to havingearning more is better so you can afford moreyou need to convert risks to costs then apply the costs to earnings  this is risk assessment and a more comprehensive model shows that increasing traffic through lowsec will cost more than even doing level 2 missions out of highsec  forcing losses or removal of contentrewards wont do anything but remove accounts from the gamepvp is mostly groups bashing on smaller groups down to soloists to balance it out you need your earnings side to be more rewarding in groups operating in dangerous space so people travel in teamsas for your other suggestions  blockade runners think on this a bit no it wont work  pvp players are not morons and if you push them to change they will change how they operatei knew someone who did this they were on voice chat for their last successful run  they ran the same camp 3 times a day for 3 days and then that camp had a hic out there after the hic was added they didnt bother going back to their old stock methods  it worked much better and that ended the haulingin a discussion on the topic i asked a guy can you build me a gate camp that nobody can get through  he replied well yes but its not worth the effort  that answer is both correct and incorrect but it did beg one questionq when is it worth the efforta when too many are getting throughincrease traffic and youll increase camps increase success of the camps and the traffic stops whereas it looks a bit like a catch22 its not but that took me a bit of thinking on other ways of enablingthe only way traffic can flow is in groups large enough to actually stomp the hell out of camps by fitting and flying stuff capable of doing so and that means to reward teamwork more than you reward soloing  in dangerous space and that sure as hell is not sov lands nor incursions in highsec  reality check putting people outside their safety zones is putting them at risk and few find operating in npc low and null to be their comfort zones  buff earnings therebtw  the reason his answer was correct and incorrect yes you can build an impassable gate camp to stop a soloist from getting through you sure as hell cant build one to stop an equal or larger force from fighting through so based upon how our conversation went  he was right based upon looking at it further  not quitedesign it so that groups are needed and travel together and you eliminate a lot of valid concerns  this means group earnings in dangerous space need a buff f the soloists there
dont tell anyone but i have been doing low sec missions in a quiet area they are not useless and shockingly you have to pay attention a little bit yet they pay off just like high sec get outta that comfort zone a little bit
for the amount of players or the quality of the ships they require and the danger often involved id like them to pay a little bit more than fuckin highsec level 4s

oh please please enlighten me your greatness i am just a tarded wh dweller in a wh corp in a wh alliance for the last year and for the life of all of us we just cant seem to find the wh market hub to sell our stuffs and buy skillz books and such
why cant we mine materials from the sunsolar panels on the pos to collect fuel from the sunstarposs module for different star typesthere could be at least one ice planet in every wh system then pi could produce ice products
a sandbox gives you the freedom to do exactly that thus players should be allowed to build secluded enclaves where your only hope of infiltrating them is finding a wormhole before they do
all for thishauling ice materials are a pain in the ass c6 c5 have it easy cause they we just freighter the crap in when they have a kspace random to use takes little effort low riskthe grunts in c4 and below are stuck with having to haul that junk with orcas or itty 5s which takes a long ass timealso adding to this is that shooting haulers is way less fun than blowing up entire mining fleets i also dont see why ppl think it will further isolate wspace the corps that generate content by rolling their statics for fights will keep doing so it will just give them more potential targetsalso fix mobile refineries while you are at it 75 max refine is rediculous having to buildship in a rorqual to get around it is even worse
you think 75 in wspace is badwait until empire is nerfed and its max refine is 60
i was podded once at just over 20m sp without an updated clone you know what i learned pay attentionan automatic clone saftey is tantamount to people wanting autopilot to warp to zero your character is already immortal you should appreciate the fact that you dont get biomassed
i am also in favour of projectiles and missiles having to use cap although to a lower extent than blasters ofc i cant see how drones could be affected and considering their killable i think its fine they dont use caplasers need a lot more help with cap issues i have suggested recently a way to make heat sinks reduce cap usage and utilise oh mechanic to compensate for losing the rof that heatsinks add and too make use of oh more in generalon laser emtherm damage issue well a lot of the problems come in the form of ship hull resistances mostly t2 minmatar hulls aswell as ship resist bonuses which thankfully are getting nerfedalso on kintherm on t2 calgal shipsthese t2 resistances need to be rebalanced for instance 10 armour explosive resist on t2 minmatar ship is surely too lowso more omi resists on t2 hulls being the theme doesnt need to be level but 90 on em 10 on exp is odd just switch a little resist arounddrones need a massive overhaul i have posted on mulitple drone threads about what i think but main thing is usability and more sensible sig radius velocity and tracking along with more drone skills like falloffand definite yes on missiles on tdshams and rocket range is twice the range they should be if you look at torps and relative sized gun rangesand an increase on their explosion radius is needed 25 and 125 is the same as guns which could do with being lowered also but then gmp reduces the explosion radius even furtherconsidering frigs start at about 35 and cruisers around 100tech3 ships need to be put down like a rabid dog drooling everywhere in the house they are out of line ccp ytterbium nerf missile range into place where is the td missile change projectiles should use capacitor abcs should be t2 habc and nerf web strength its still too high
i think the creation of threads in the assembly hall in which the op isnt written at at least the 12th grade level should be banned
im not against the new launcher though i value the login screens loss to see an expansion summaried in a cinematic establishing shot of the expansions theme and with an musical theme to acompany it is making some of the player base sadno one likes to be sad paladinhunt
cant we just add a checkbox checked by default of course that says bypass login screenand those who uncheck it will get the classic login
getting sso in place is also a requirement for getting two factor authentication implemented
if most other containers have a loot all function why not the pocos as well it would make pi a little less clunky
almost any change would make pi less clunky
there certainly is something to be said for there being a high barrier to getting into pvp for new players
whenever i want a nostalgia trip i just go lookup the revelations login screen theme on youtube seriously the most epic theme everrevelations theme
