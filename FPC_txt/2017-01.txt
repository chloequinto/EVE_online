right click -> show info -> send isk/place bounty
often people who lead alliances and corporations are very busy people and this could save them valuable time and allow them pay salary / place bounty based on kill mail. kill mail can have dozens of attackers and try to place bounty for 20 people. it can be quite work. big kill mails can have more than 100 attackers...
it was also a gigantic security risk. it's not coming back. best to accept it and move on.
mikal is a great guy - i cannot think of a better representative for the pvp crowd - good luck sir!

as a miner/hauler myself, i don't see what the whining is about. to be fair, it has been well beyond a year since i played (eh, real life, you know?) but the principles are likely the same now as they have always been. hauling goods from one place to another is supposed to have some amount of risk to it. if there was no risk, the sense of immersion and realism would be gone. i could just spend all of my isk on a massive ship and expensive cargo and trade it all for more wealth in an endless and pointless cycle of monetary gain. boring.eve has crafted an experience (carefully, i might add; they've balanced and rebalanced pvp so much throughout the years!) that forces someone like me to consider that risk. i have to factor in the cost of losing my cargo and ship into what i intend to do for the day or week. i have to have to be able to take the loss and still move forward. if i can't take the loss, that's on me, not the ganker. it would be my fault that i spent all of my resources on one haul.

hello there o7my name is ragged. i'm an old faction warfare dog that enjoy the salt and tear of my enemies. i know super kerr-induced nanocoatings are been developed by giant factions and np corporations. i also know ccp has never allowed to produce skins specially for new players.as we all saw, many great out of the common skins pictures are circulating around, like the hello kity armaggedon. anyways, i would love to see ccp allowing players to create or inspire skins for a price. probably isk, aura or plexes. another option could be in game events, alliance tournaments, mega construction projects.wouldnt be amazing see some of the old great biggest corporation flying fleets with their own skins?. i in particular would like to see ushra-khan's minmatar greatest corporation use their emblemic red and grey/black. reference:
its always the little things :) <3
positive community mention in the following, also good opportunity to hear an awesome podcast from mindclash.even if you don't vote for me check these guys out great stuff.

if you checked the summit notes, you'll note this is something we brought up with ccp during our time with the art team.
i see that you also posted this thread over in features and ideas, so i will lock this one.
mikal's a pretty cool guy. a great fc. he definitely has my vote!
hello friends,i hereby announce my candidacy for csm xiii<U+FFFD>m very proud of everything that we accomplished as csm 11. not only did we have a big impact on the development of key features (the new alpha clones) but we also managed to rebuild a healthy relationship between csm and ccp. the csm 11 team was amazing and everybody was very open-minded to work together and operate as effective and efficient as possible. i want to thank all members of the csm 11 for the amazing experience i had working with you and i hope that we manage to continue our <U+FFFD><U+FFFD>gods work<U+FFFD><U+FFFD> as members of csm 12. last year i wrote an explanation of whom i am and what i stand for so i<U+FFFD>ve decided to use that again in order for people to easily know who i am. you will be able to find information in the second post in this forum thread (here). here are some interviews/videos/podcasts/presentations i did while being a csm 11 member:1. evesterdam presentation about the csm 11:
who am i?my in-game name is bobmon. i am a member of csm 11 and you might know me as the ex ceo of evenews24.comi started playing eve online in 2010 following an introduction by a couple of my friends who had their own dutch corporation. this corporation was part of an alliance that had an active war going on at the time i joined. i was a brand new player and back then you couldn't really get involved with pvp so i decided to make a new alt, fly over to the location of our enemy, and see what they were up to. after a bit of chatting, i got to know them and they asked me to join. i then began relaying intel to my friends, and so i'm very proud to say that my first task in eve online was to be a spy!from those humble beginnings, i have progressed in my eve career and experienced many aspects of gameplay including:- 0.0 nullsec warfare: i have been a part of multiple 0.0 alliances with whom i fought many battles!- fc: started in 2011 and from that point on led everything from small subcap fleets to capital fleets.- alliance leadership position: second in command & head diplomat of unclaimed. - mentor for new players: i<U+FFFD>m currently a mentor for members in pandemic horde- evenews24 ex chief editor and ceo- part of the evesterdam organisation team- player presenter: was one of the presenters for eve tv at fanfest 2015.- fanfest presenter: gave a presentation about eve media- member of the #rekkingcrew- member of csm 11 all of these aspects have taught me a lot about the game and the players who play it and i think that they will help me a lot as a potential csm member. focusi think the most important job of a csm member is to be a bridge between ccp and players. players are the ones playing, and can help ccp discover problems with eve online that need to be solved. eve online is in a state where a lot of new features are being released and so it's exciting to see what the future holds for us, the players. - communication between player and dev- nullsec / lowsec- alliance warfare and how changes affect this- don't forget about the independent players when it comes to changes- space usages / coverage- ships and their use- make sure changes are necessary and not the ''let's add a shiny ship'' tactic- make sure the devs understand players<U+FFFD> problems- how changes affect small alliances- fleet fights (think about 50 high sp chars vs. 250 newbies)- increased support for events- i would love to see an increase in support for our players who are blind, deaf etc.these are not points i will purely focus on, i will deal with whatever is necessary. however, i do think that the above points are very important for the future of eve online.do you have any points that you find important? please contact me! (details will be at the bottom)why do i want to join the csm?over my years of being active in the eve online community, i've come to the conclusion many times that i'm deeply in love with our community. this is a key reason to why i've always kept playing eve online and it has often put me in a position where i had to explain to my rl friends why i'm so passionate about the game!while being active, i've also been in a ton of game related discussions and through my work at en24, i've been in contact with a lot of different types of players, from the best fcs to the pilot who can barely fly his retriever in highsec. i<U+FFFD>ve spoken with those players a lot, and i<U+FFFD>ve learned about their ideas or concerns.this is my ultimate drive to be a csm member! i feel that sometimes changes are made to affect bigger groups of players to the detriment of the lone members. i would like to represent those individual players and make the game more beautiful for them and everybody!ways to get to know me better?1) feel free to ask me questions in this forum thread2) check out my twitter3) contact me on the tweetfleet slack!4) contact me on my email: bobmon.eve@gmail.com

bobmon is attentive and sensitive to all your needs. a v nice man to have on csmall 'tar pilots should vote this man

bobmon is sure as hell going to put the effort in to make eve better for everyone and ccp communication definitely needs improvement right now, which is what he specialises in.i want to see him in the next csm again.













one look at the title and i can already tell my vote is not going to you lol
one of the most dedicated people to this game i've ever seen. get me rag skins pl0x!hope you get in this year again!
you say you have all of this experience<U+FFFD>started in 2009, was in nc., did a lot in ns, lived in wormholes, etc. however, do you have any evidence of this experience? your corp history doesn't show it; and your killboard certainly does not show you have much experience with the game, either. you must be posting on an alt, then. but for all we know, unless you share that info, you could be someone completely different. at the very least, we don't have any evidence you are qualified in the gameplay mechanics you say you are.here is one advantage of public killboards: they allow people to see what sort of experiences you have, which is especially useful for things like running for csm. ironically, your stance against public killboards conflicts with your goal of running for the csm as well as your goals for the csm. killboards, for one, let us see the pilot's experience. one of your goals is <U+FFFD>better expose the influences of older players.<U+FFFD> except you don't do that by making certain intel less public and making it harder to validate the claims players make about themselves or who they are and making it easier to hide in-game activities. that's like saying you want to hold the government more accountable, and then proposing to remove all oversight and eithcs committees.
"through the various articles on our alliance web page, it is fairly easy to identify my alts for those looking for them. there is no reason for me to make it easier to find, though, until this applies for all players.my alts can be judged by ""elitists"" players the way they want to, i do not care. elitists player have amount of intel and resources that i do not have, i.e. we play differently.this is this difference of play-style that i represent."
"as a side note, i like this new requirement for csm xii candidates""if you control a character that is well known in the eve community, ccp may require you to run under that identity and not one of an alt or a lesser known character.""this alt is my well-known alt. like i mentioned before starting campaigning for the play-style i like best, none of my other alts were known.. in fact i did play for years without any real awareness of the larger community (i am not a ""social""), until the siphons and the ess got released, and their features made useless by the nerf of waste and api ratting for the siphons and for the ess, their design intent negated by placing them in anomalies with no risks to the defenders.these are the reasons i decided to get more involved to defend the game features that could have helped develop my prefered play-style further. i also assumed that i could not be the only lurker out there with this kind of play-style."
now here's a candidate i can get behind





i promise i just stole the phase not supporting the candidate. :) i have maybe 5% the ego trump doesedit.... after watching the inauguration 5% dropped to 1%
i'm arenthor doran and this is my favourite campaign on the citadel!who am i?i<U+FFFD>m arenthor and i<U+FFFD>ve been playing eve for just over 3 years continuously. i had previous forays into eve but fell victim to the poor npe at the time. over this time i<U+FFFD>ve explored most parts of eve from exploration, mining and ratting, to small gang, solo and blob level pvp. whilst i<U+FFFD>ve tried most things i<U+FFFD>ve recently settled on fcing and exploration mostly with a bit industry added on the side.my historycurrent: goonswarm federation <U+FFFD> after the start of the tribute war between testco and panfam i moved down the goons, in which i<U+FFFD>ve resumed my industry and exploration as well as fcing small/mid gang subcap fleets.co2 <U+FFFD> joined with corp more than joining out of choice, after drama between infensus and sort dragon our corp looked for a safe haven. they found that in co2 in which we had been a member of years previous. a good alliance however the culture of the alliance did not suit me and thus prompted my move to goons.infensus <U+FFFD> after the fall of vale during world war bee my corp at the time (blk-s) formed with quovis to forge our own alliance. we started of by living out lowsec blopsing and generally harassing test who just moved in. we then moved up to branch as part of the gotg coalition. a few months peacefully here then resulted in our sudden evacuation after drama with sort dragon. bastionfconco2blacksteel mining and manufacturing <U+FFFD> standard newbro mistake, i fell into a rut just after i started with a hs mining corp, thankfully i moved as i started to burn out and thus saved my entire eve career. in a way i have to thank these guys for making me the player i am today.so why should you vote for me?<U+FFFD> not one of the eve famous club who seem to dominate the csm elections<U+FFFD> independent <U+FFFD> my views are my own and are developed from talks with people i play with throughout various parts of the game from null to wh to lowsec. <U+FFFD> easy to contact <U+FFFD> as a member of the csm i would make it a priority to ensure i keep in contact with the rest of the player base, i regularly attend meetups in the uk such as eve_nt and i<U+FFFD>m looking to expand this to evesterdam this year. talking to players at meet ups, via in game chat and mail, via reddit or the eve forums i can see what issues are effecting you! as well as communicate our work to you.my positionshigh level over view of my campaign is to promote further development of the npe, the new tutorials are a great step in the right direction from ccp and the work of group such as horde/karma/e-uni can't be ignored either. however after the tutorial and unless you find one of theese groups and join many of them are still getting sucked into the age old highsec mining corp where they burn out after a month. continuation of feature in citadels, one point was to push for insrance in citadels however this has now been announced. continuting to work with ccp in regards to the features we want to see from citadels, not jsut ones that are missing, but to refine and tweak thoose that are already in.the age old, sov needs to be changed a compelte overhaul is not required but a change to sov such as maybe scripting entosis links to a attack and defence mode, could add a new dynamic, especially with alliances being able to activly defend each others sov or subtly take it from under them. changes to factional warfare, whilst i'ma dmitatly not an expert on this feature, i have used it before and have talked to people who take part in it, many of whom are not happy with the current mechanic. this would require further discussion with lwosec/fw groups before i make any further comments on it.any questions please feel free to add them blow or messages me in game arenthor dorancsmxii candidate
thanks, help spread the word!. the most difficult issue non-bloc/independent candidates face is to reach non-bloc players to let them know there are candidates that truly care about play-styles diversity in eve online.

i've known erika for nearly 4 years now and she's always been a valuable member of our command/logistics structure no matter where we have called home. she's been a dedicated friend and colleague and it was a blast meeting her and getting to know her better this past october at eve vegas, where she functioned a reporter of sorts, live-tweeting whatever panel she had chosen to sit in on.10/10 would vote for erika mizune.
erika mizune/djyumene, helping make eve great again!i absolutely agree that the pi stuff does need an overhaul. not an unbalance or overbalance, just an overhaul. the pi ui system sucks, decommissioning sucks, and there hasn't been anything new in years.

my name is roedyn and i am proud to announce my candidacy for csm xii.who am i?1. wrecking machine. alliance line member - assisted the alliance in the destruction of several dozen citadels in empire. uniquely aware of the challenges and shortcomings of the war declaration system from an organizational standpoint.2. wormhole resident - have lived in and day tripped c1 - c5 wormholes since the apocrypha expansion. currently living in a dual static c2 with citadels.3. trusted trader - an active participant in the scc lounge discord that houses notable market players in the game. a competitive station trader that has earned the trust of investors to support their respective community driven projects such as mike azariah for the magic school bus and j mcclain for best of us.4. the neocom writer - creator of the <U+FFFD>trade recap<U+FFFD> weekly market articles since april 2016. provided historical personal trading news and updates to investors regarding trading operations.5. faction warfare - since 2010 have consistently participated in fw game play for all militias at one point or another. currently serving in the caldari militia. active and genuine solo pvper in the warzone.why am i running for csm?i was frustrated when csm xi was announced and it was almost a mirror of the major participants of wwb. i thought to myself that this will be another year that anything outside of direct null sec play will not be discussed or have any interest due to the nature of the candidates. instead of complaining about it, i decided to run for the following year's csm.fortunately, this year's csm was very productive. the focus groups and roundtables gathered interest and was hopefully instrumental to ccp in improving the game. some of those roundtables actually addressed my previous concerns, most notably the war dec round table.all voices from all types of players do have value. i feel that i can help highlight concerns from those groups by actively seeking input, being available through more than one communication platform, and articulating my own thoughts on the matter.what is the role of the csm? how do i promote that?the csm is an active and dependable communication instrument between ccp and the player base. i will promote this function by focusing my creative energy to work with fellow csm to produce roundtables, focus groups, and articles about the process.what is my platform?i will bring value to the csm as a communicator. i will not be a candidate bound by the type of space that i play in. i am a candidate suitable to interact with ccp based on my well rounded experience. if you<U+FFFD>re looking for a candidate that will be biased towards one area of space over another, i may not be an attractive choice for you. however, i can offer the following.when solicited for suggestions by ccp, i will follow these principles.-concerning mechanics or ship balancing, be aware of the effects of scale.-address motivation. we must be able to articulate the individual<U+FFFD>s perception of value derived from an activity.-what<U+FFFD>s in it for me? there must be a measurable improvement to the experience of the individual player.teamwork - i will encourage the csm to work together on ccp driven projects to have as much subject matter experts on hand to produce quality results.objectivity - i will offer experience based and data driven recommendations even if it is to the detriment of my gameplay style.ccp / csm relationship - csm are not junior developers. ccp takes the lead and seeks input from the csm. ccp must own this - it is not appropriate to leave mechanics and ship balancing issues without timely periodic iterations. how have i worked towards my platform?i actively engaged my alliance, the market and trading community, null sec entities, and faction warfare corporations to solicit recommendations and concerns regarding their respective space and gameplay style. i will not hesitate to directly communicate with anyone or any group regarding feedback they may have about the csm process or ccp in general. war decs - more diplomatic options to resolve war decs-balance cost of war to refer to aggressor<U+FFFD>s size-add deterioration mechanic to idle citadels market community - api parity with xml and api endpoint for citadel range ordersremote stacking of inventory items-make bpcs stackable to make item limit in hangars less cumbersome to manage-make pi interface similar to industry window interface so you are able to see active pi setups, sort by yield, and connected / unconnected statusnull sec - adjust timers for citadels to reference its size. astrahus should not be able to enjoy the same timer defensibility as its larger variants once shields are down.-reduce tether range or disallow safe log immediately after jumping to a cyno when in tether rangeadjust citadel roles to be task specific. currently, the ability to fuel and man the weaponry is bound to the same role.-consider that it would take a t2 rigged sotiyo to be in parity with a fully upgraded amarr outpost. the cost difference is tremendous in this instance.-rorquals disincentivized exhumer mining. either give big boosts or mining ability, not both.faction warfare - address undock delay from citadels-citadels make geography irrelevant in the warzone. address the relationship between the warzone, npc stations, the station bonuses derived from fw, and citadels.-deliver more engaging fw missions and balance the ones that are currently available, especially the racial ewar appliedif you find value in this type of work, then i am the candidate for you.
here here!roedyn and i first crossed paths in august. he initially attracted my attention through his weekly publication of the trade recap. i read his weekly findings often and tried to mimic them myself, albeit with less success than he. when i approached roedyn about his trades i became aware of his role as an investment manager of a fund he was running. the amount he had secured and traded with was over 150 billion isk. roedyn was extremely honest with me in saying that his earnings were modest, and that he would be open in helping me find my own way as a trader. to most of you this should come as a shock. any trader worth his salt never gives up trade secrets. the tactic roedyn used, however, was not a tactic. he was legitimately trying to help me because that is what game play is all about to him. to roedyn, if you are not enjoying your aspect of the game, he wants to know why. he wants to figure that out for you and improve it. whether its day trading for me, high-sec mechanics for the minority, or sov mechanics for the masses. roedyn goes out of his way to analyze the issue, suggest solutions, and make a difference in every player's experience.
good luck, the wealth of knowledge this fine candidate carries should take him all the way.dark rising stop playing eve start living it
+1, i'd definitely vouch for this guy as a great potential csm candidate. i've known roe for probably 2-3 years now. most importantly, he has no interest in advancing his own agenda - rather, he genuinely cares about the community as a whole and does his 
i can safely say that roedyn is going to be the first choice on my ballots this voting cycle.
"hello,i am killah bee, pandemic legion fleetcommander and i am here to run for csm xii.about mebeen playing the game since 2007 or 2008 i can't remember. i do fc'ing and like to do the big stuff in 0.0.notable alliances i've been in were black legion. and nulli secunda ( r.i.p to both ). for the past ~2 years i've been a member of pandemic legion and i am very happy here.i think the current csm lacks people that lead the big wars which make 0.0 the amazing place it can be. ""timezone warfare"", nullified insta warping inties and such are issues that i rarely see adressed even though they are a big part of the problem 0.0 is in at the moment. i am dealing with things like these on day to day basis.what do i wanna look at ?- ""timezone warfare"" and content generation in 0.0- gameplay surrounding aegis sov ( ""fozzie claws"" )- subcapital balance ( faction battleships etc. )- capital balance ( leviathan etc. )- citadels and the new structures- lag & desync especially with caps involvedwhat can i offer ccp and the community ?- have been playing the game for ~9 years- a huge network of other fc's to not only represent pl but the bigger part of 0.0- a good understanding of the current meta in pvp and sov warfare on subcap and capital scale- dealing with the issues of the game on a day to day basis"
as a prior 2 term csm member i fully support this guy.i have worked with and against him on multiple things in game. he knows his **** even if he is a dirty pl member
good man
any thoughts to un**** empire war?
can confirm that killah knows what he's talking about.he would be a great addition to the council.
nope. i haven't played in highsec for like 5 years so frankly i can't talk about it.
"greetings, i am jewnior mcblazing, alt of aram kachaturian, member of the aram pleasure hub holding, a one man & alts trading corporation in null-sec regions in the north, the west and the south of new eden. i am also wielder of the key of the monocle clubhouse. since 2010, i've been in true reign, s2n, xxpizzaxx and anime master. during those years, i've funded several tournament teams & eve-related irl events.my program is still in developpement. however, i can share already some major points closely related to the work-in-progress of ccp since several updates. each week until the elections, i will update this topic following the new dev blogs with coming features.three major points: 1. new skins: i will help ccp to develop new skins for the coming years. in fact, i will work with ccp design team to change myself the color codes. my suggestions: orange & blue skins, orange & yellow skins, cyan & green skins, red & yellow skins, brown & orange skins, purple & blue skins, green & orange skins, black & yellow skins, yellow & brown skins, pink & cyan skins, purple & red skins, brown & blue skins, pink & green skins [still working on these, more coming soon]2. new berets & caps: i will help ccp to draw some new apparels. my suggestions: men and women's 'dank winter' beret (serpentis), men and women<U+FFFD>s 'elite warrior' beret (blood raiders), men and women<U+FFFD>s 'y to the olo' cap (minmatar empire), men and women's 'straight from the street' beret (guristas), men and women<U+FFFD>s 's to the wag' cap (caldari state)3. extend alpha state pilots abilities: at this point, i am convinced that ccp should reduce the gap between alpha & omega pilots. thus, i will suggest ccp devs to create a new state ""alpha premium state"" available for 2.99$ + a special edition venture & gnosis skins (only available for alpha premium state) with more ships & allowed skills than the basic free alpha state.in developpement- kugu forums reopening- walking in station- project nova skins, berets & capsupdate 22/01: cowboy skinfor 4.99$, you could buy a cowboy skin for your character, it will add: - cowboy attitude & moves- cowboy voices - cowboy logo on your ships for an extra 2.99$ each, you could also buy special edition moves, even funny ones as the ""pooping himself special edition move"" you suggested. furthermore, we could imagine in the near future, to be able to ride horses inside your headquarter for an extra 2.99euros/monthupdate 24/01:fixing the eve online store:"

that campaign will turn a cold, dour universe into a brilliant arena full of swag.that candidate's impeccable taste will help bridge the yawning gap between ccp and the gaming community at large when it comes to all things swag-related. i assume it goes without saying that this particular alt, should it be elected, will swap his business-like glasses for a monocle?you have my vote, sir.

...when you say you'll 'help' ccp, what exactly are you meaning? bear in mind the artefacts like tshirts are handled by team muppet shop. a very very small team.as for walking in stations, that's not on the cards. while i'd _love_ ccp to do something meaningful with it, it's not going to happen. they just don't have the development resource to work on it, while also working on spaceships (which is the major draw of eve)project nova has nothing to do with the csm. ccp don't talk to us about it. ditto with valkyrie. or gunjack.(and kugu was nothing to do with ccp in the first place)while i'm not saying you'd be useless for the vast majority of the time, what you've talked about here isn't the daily meat and veg of the csm.oh, and go read the announcement. specifically
his monocle is probably of the same origin as the eye of the overworld that iucounu the laughing magician tasked cugel the clever to recover. it impacts the mind and alters comprehension when worn alone.or may be he is himself the new eden's version of cugel the clever.
lol look at all those blind naysayers.you have to believe folks !loyal servent to mother amamake. @eve_tetsel
is that a threat?
no threat just rendered momentarily speechless.
i would prefer it you be permanently speechless before seeing you slander such an upstanding citizen as jewnior mcblazing so unfairlyreturn to your coding abyss, third party app demon.
what a waste of a left monocle, steve. fix your portrait already.
make eve great again, #jewnior mcblazing4csm !
o/ steve,much as i admire your site, and your csm work in general (you have been very high on my ballot ever since you started running), i feel bound to point out that the number of people who were ripped off by enjoyed a pleasurable trading experience from jewnior must be roughly equivalent to that of those whose business was handled by aram himself.you do have a point that, given his platform, the character in question would have to at the very least upgrade his eyewear.cheers,



i reacently returned to eve and trying to move my carrier from otsasai, going around tribute, and to the branch. i picked that route because of the safety, and i takes for days. jump range of the carrier is too small, its onli 7 ly. it should be brought back as it was before.
thank you so much <3 it was of course great to meet you as well, and hope you come to vegas again this year! :d
pi does need a major overhaul, yes! it really has been years since anything was really done with pi.thank you for the support! <3
if you can get minmatar lp stores to start selling republic fleet missiles, and for the 7.5% tracking bonus that the tempest currently has to be also applied to the tempest fleet issue, you'll have my vote.
i too want a pony.
i can safely say that you would be my last choice if you ran for csm.
i can safely say that i will not be running for csm anytime soon :)i actually would like the things you suggested but that's not really what i think of when i think of what the csm does.
fair enough. asking a member of the csm to try to bring this up with ccp is like a shot in the dark.
thank you very much for your response.1. concerning adjusting the fw lp store rewards, i've had discussions concerning this before but i failed to create enough traction for my arguments. basically i failed to articulate what types of items should be added or made exclusive to the fw lp stores. i appreciate your suggestion of adding republic light missiles. the minmatar racial ship lines have developed over the years to encompass more missile bonuses. it makes sense to add racial faction missiles to the lp store. should it be exclusive?2. i double checked the bonuses of the tempest and tempest fleet issue. i'm sorry but i think what you meant was the 7.5% bonus to rate of fire of the tempest. with that, i will assume that what you want to happen is for the tempest fleet issue to have this bonus as well. i don't have much experience in flying this ship. but as a trader i can tell you that there isn't much demand for this faction ship. if applying this buff will make this ship a more attractive choice to take to combat, that is definitely worth exploring and forwarding the request to ccp.the suggestions i listed in my original post was a small sampling of the suggestions that i have collected from different players. i will add your suggestion to the list and hopefully i will be able to submit these to ccp once elected. i hope i was able to address your concerns.
great response, worthy of a vote. thank you.

+1 with his history in eve, politics aside, his insight on what works and what doesn't work as conflict drivers and the mechanics that influence fleet compositions would be an invaluable resource in improving eve gameplay
+1 for sure. great guy, knows his ****. i look forward to seeing him on the csm
who wrote that post ?also +1 because all kidding aside i enjoy vince and think he could offer a lot to the community as a whole.he should win based on the quality of his soundboards alone.

hi hello, my name is dancul1001, i am a pandemic legion fleet commander, alliance tournament captain and i am here to announce that i am running for csm xii.about mei began playing in 2006 and moved to low-sec on my first day and began pvping shortly thereafter. after a few months i moved into 0.0 to learn the intricacies of pvp on the mean streets of syndicate and i<U+FFFD>ve never looked back. two years later my corp joined an alliance called sons of tangra and moved to fountain. from there i moved into pandemic legion and 8 years later here i am, still pvping, still having a blast! highlights of my eve career have included participating in multiple alliance tournament teams for pandemic legion, winning 5 gold medals and a silver medal in the process. my positions; how i would improve eve: online * entosis mechanics. i like the idea of multiple skirmishes over multiple nodes, but that<U+FFFD>s not case at the moment. * skins. we need get our skin game on point. there are some ships that have tons of skins, some that have none, and some that barely change the look. we need skin updates for the overlooked ships like pirate ships and a lot of the gallente race, and would someone please fix the rattlesnake victory skin.* tournaments. i love tournaments and we all want to see more of them. events like eve_nt is a great start but we need more.* wormholes. i want to see more wormholes, especially in 0.0. this a great feature in eve, allowing all sorts of ship/gangs to move around eve and create content wherever they end up.* server hardware. the current state of rubber-banding and lag is not acceptable.* module tiericide. let<U+FFFD>s finish what ccp started. i respect what they did with sensor boosters but there are tons of modules that haven<U+FFFD>t had this treatment. i would love to see scripts removed and replaced with a mode that can be toggled. * ship maintenance bays, my opinion is stuff like liquid ozone and drugs should be able to be loaded in the cargo of the ship that is inside a ship maintenance bay. they are both used in combat just like ammo and scripts, there is no reason why they are disallowed. * session-change timer. we need to lower if not remove this, simple as that. i will work with the ccp team to make sure they understand where our priorities are.* new player experience, it has come a long way since its infancy but we need to keep expanding on this in order to keep the new players going free to play has gotten us.* all races on all alpha characters. no new player should be penalized for choosing a random (to them, at the time) race. every new player should have the chance to contribute to every fleet.* improvements to npc null sec. increasing the value of the space outside of just moon mining in order to increase the player activity please consider me when you vote for csm xii
some good ideas and hopefully these quality of life improvements will be implemented if we have someone to push for them.on a side know i would say dancul knows almost everything there is to know about the game and i will put my faith in him representing the playerbase .
neg repping this guy, very annoying voice. do you want a guy with an annoying voice on the csm???? i think not.
cutest little dutch boy ever.
hi bobmon,is there any reason why you are the only member of csm11 re-running? i ask this since you are the only person from csm11 who has posted a candidacy.furthermore going forward, knowing what you know through the nda, how to you feel about eve for the next year, 5 years and 10 years? do you feel that we will have a more vibrant (people participating in content/new content) game and community or something else?- erlee
"do you have any.... y'know.... positions? that you might want to state? you say your views are developed yourself. what are they? why do you consider not being ""eve famous"" a benefit? it doesn't have to be a point against you but i think not being known for actually having done anything shouldn't be considered a qualification for representing hundreds of thousands of people. -1 until you tell me what you actually want to do. as it is you haven't given one single specific detail."
you make a good point there.high level over view of my campaign is to promote further development of the npe, the new tutorials are a great step in the right direction from ccp and the work of group such as horde/karma/e-uni can't be ignored either. however after the tutorial and unless you find one of theese groups and join many of them are still getting sucked into the age old highsec mining corp where they burn out after a month. continuation of feature in citadels, one point was to push for insrance in citadels however this has now been announced. continuting to work with ccp in regards to the features we want to see from citadels, not jsut ones that are missing, but to refine and tweak thoose that are already in.the age old, sov needs to be changed a compelte overhaul is not required but a change to sov such as maybe scripting entosis links to a attack and defence mode, could add a new dynamic, especially with alliances being able to activly defend each others sov or subtly take it from under them. changes to factional warfare, whilst i'ma dmitatly not an expert on this feature, i have used it before and have talked to people who take part in it, many of whom are not happy with the current mechanic. this would require further discussion with lwosec/fw groups before i make any further comments on it.
i hate to keep ripping on you but the only specific thing you said in that whole wall of text is scriptable entosis links.
moarr hats! victorian era beaver skin hat please.
that's quite arrogant and self-centred.unworthy csm.sir smashalot, i will develop my ideas about new hats & cybernetic arms soon.also, project discovery should add more special edition items as faction pants and shirts.
only if you promise to add cowboys to eve. the real kind of cowboys, not the hollywood/nashville ones, but the living in the wilderness pooping yourself to death kinds. i want to poop myself to death. in space. can you make this happen?
"greetings mkint, thanks for your precious idea. you are right and i would like to suggest ccp to add ""special character skins"" if i am elected csm.lets take an example: for 4.99$, you could buy a cowboy skin for your character, it will add: - cowboy attitude & moves- cowboy voices - cowboy logo on your ships for an extra 2.99$ each, you could also buy special edition moves, even funny ones as the ""pooping himself special edition move"" you suggested. furthermore, we could imagine in the near future, to be able to ride horses inside your headquarter for an extra 2.99euros/monththanks everyone for your precious feedbacks."
easily first
after reading all your points and mulling them over i have seen the great truth within and ive sworn my allegiance to your platform. i call on all capsuleers possessing a sound mind in a able body to do the same.
this is a great candidacy. but i have a question : will you support the creation of more types of glasses ? i know that the famed monocle is a great thing to own. would you support the creation of an exclusive, and expensive, lorgnons cosmetic item ?
#bringbackmonocoles #wearethe1%
i'm still waiting for my monocle.
i honestly cannot see you adding anything valuable.
but enough about your alliance
> pleb corp> pleb alliance> pleb armor> pleb portraitpleb everything. go back to your abyss.

erika is a class act: thoughtful, considerate, and incredibly knowledgeable with regard to industry. you have my support!
+1king in the north
vince draken is the best and most experienced player to run for csm in years. everyone should have him somewhere near the top of their ballot.i'll have him high on the test ballot for sure. good luck brother.
"thanks for all the kind words, hoping to serve you guys as csm and ""make new eden great again."""
what is your position on the ever infinitely expanding amount of citadels and ec<U+FFFD>s in empire low and null sec systems?what is your position on local building and empire trade hubs been so easy to access and buy stuff from vs how difficult it is to be able to support a small to medium alliance with everything they need in their home region without the need for places like jita/amarr i.e. do we need to force people to build everything they need in their local area (would need a few tweeks from ccp<U+FFFD>s end to make it work) and nerf how easy it is for a small alliance to seed a whole fleets worth of ships in a matter of hours just using jita and jf<U+FFFD>swhat is your position on having more group pve and less reliance solo people just been able to run anomalies solo 24h a day.what is your position on citadel<U+FFFD>s defensive capability<U+FFFD>s and how you are forced to bring n+1 type sub cap fleets to deal with them? and do you think there should be a bigger risk of assets if the defenders are unable to defend.what is your position on huge super cap blobs and the main counters been n+1 no fights or one shot dread bombs which don<U+FFFD>t really counter long-term proliferation of supercaps.
if you vote for dancul1001, you are voting for a top 1% game player in eve online.shamis orzoz once told me he wouldn't trust any one on earth with the pl team except for dancul, he said dan has ice in his veins and he really does. a vote for dancul is a vote for a dude who actually plays this game at the highest level all the time. he's got my vote.
i'll keep this simple, as i have played eve and many other online games with dancul for over 9 years now.dancul is a natural leader with an in-depth game knowledge and expertise that very few people ever manage to develop. as a person, i have found him to be level-headed and easy going but also with a competitive edge that allows him to interact successfully with poor personality types. a skill that cannot be taught.he would serve us well in any endeavor and i'll be voting for him.
dancul is one of the most knowledgeable pilots on the tournament scene and an all round good man.

most of the current csm has expressed an interest in re-running, but is waiting for the conclusion to the upcoming (jan 30th - feb 3rd) summit - and any corresponding whitepaper changes - before announcing our candidacy.
thanks for the reply jin'taan, i would still like to hear bobmon's reply, furthermore bobmon, why did you not wait for the conclusion of the summit, any corresponding whitepaper changes before announcing your candidacy like the rest of the csm?
when posting this thread, i was not aware of the agreement that we would wait with posting our threads till after the summit. dont know how i misesd it, but yeah. the judge poked me, not even 10 minutes after posting the thread and then i slapped myself :p if i would have known then i would have waited aswell.also me running for csm wont be impacted by white paper changes.
"so as a csm that is essentially campaigning on communication you have failed to listen/understand the consensus of your 13 fellow csms and went ahead anyway and posted your thread. furthermore by your own admission of ""the just poked me, not even 10 minutes after posting the thread and then i slapped myself""; at this point you could have taken your thread down / edited it to say that you had jumped the gun and would be running after the summit you continued to campaign anyway? why not just take your licks and take it down? why are you campaigning when you should be focusing on the next csm summit? this was the reason you were elected in the first place."
i understand why my fellow csm's decided to hold until after the summit, and looking back i would have done the same if i would have known this at the time. as a csm you have a lot of chat channels open at the time and it can be challenging at times to absorb everything that said everywhere, sadly i didn't see this agreement otherwise i would have followed by fellow csm members. i've thought about removing the post / editing it however i've learned from my time at evenews24 that once something is out there, there is no point of deleting it. this often creates more confusion and that's not something i want to have happen around me. i much rather admit to jumping the gun and give people the honest reason why something happend. i'm fully focused on the next summit and tbh the most time ive spent on this campaign is probably answering this question.

1) personally i get kinda sad when i see a insane amount of the cheaper citadels in systems, yes they should be accesable but i would have made them more expensive personally.2) if it would properly work then i think it could be interesting and i would not be against it (if it works properly)3) im not a big fan of the safety window, it stops gameplay and thats why i dislike it. in terms of their defence. i like that the biggest one is also very hard to kill however the other medium and large one might be a bit to strong. 4) super cap blops are in a strange place in my hearth. i kinda love them when you have a big battle however i also loved the old supprise dreadbomb counter. i think it would be fun if there were more options in the super capital world. overall i would say that just like i did within this term, im not affraid to poke people who i see as experts on these topics. their feedback is great to use when communicating with ccp. its the best way to opperate as a csm member if you ask me.
i had a dream where aram whispered to my ear stories about eternal bliss, rivers of warm camel milk, palaces of ruby and gold, and 5th midslots on vagabonds.while my eye condition doesn't allow me to wear a monocle, i still fully endorse this candidate and his platform.
not less than any other current/futur csm members tbh, but at least we will have better/more option for that tiny thumbnail picture on the forum, instead of some random shity balacing/new mechanics.loyal servent to mother amamake. @eve_tetsel
aram is not a good man.he is the best man.simple as that, you will never find a man more better or more good than aram.
you have my axe

greetings friends;i am throwing my hat into the ring for csm candidacyabout me: currently i'm most known for the videos i produce on youtube on the eveiseasy youtube channel. my best work by far i feel is the content that i produce aimed at lower sp pilots using cheap fits, such as this video here. i also stream eve online pvp regulary on my twitch.tv channel here. i mostly take part in solo pvp using frigate and destroyer hulls, and feel like i come close to perfectly understanding the solo and small gang pvp meta and scene. i also commentate and help with some behind the scenes things for some eve esports events, notably, eve-nt. and have a deep interest in eve tournament play and the eve esports scene in general, my area of expertise is most certainly everything that is small-gang pvp in this game.my killboard. i'm not linking this to prove i'm elite or to brag, i'm linking this to prove that i'm someone who undocks almost on a daily basis. as of right now i'm the top killer and top solo killer for january 2017 in a 6000 person alliance. i'm not some guy who exists just to write a lot of words on a forum, i'm someone who experiences eve daily, both its greatest and worst moments.i'm currently in goonswarm to learn more about the game from a sov holding perspective, learn daily life in a nullsec alliance and take part in pvp with bigger numbers to increase my knowledge. i consider myself to be politically neutral, and despite the [condi] ticker i hope you'll vote for me in other nullsec alliances. i've been in pandemic horde, dreddit and sniggerdly the past year, as well as shooting goonswarm almost the entirety of my eve career. i'm not a puppet for goonswarm, and i'm definitely an advocate for the 'little guy' as almost the entirety of my playstyle revolves around solo or small group play. while pvp may be my main focus and passion ingame, i've played eve for the past 10 years, i've experienced almost everything eve has to offer and go back to try things now and again. i've farmed and blitzed level 4 missions in highsec, i've ran combat sites of all classes, i've ran anomalies, i've mined, i've hauled, i have done exploration etc. by the nature of my content focusing on alpha clones and 'self-found solo pvp' i've experienced both pvp and pve from a new player and alpha perspective, at the same time, i'm a grunt and low level fc in the biggest alliance in eve. all your issues are important to me, i'm not just here to advocate my special snowflake ideas that only a mom in kentucky knows about that doctors hate for this one weird trick. why does that qualify me as a good csm candidate? i feel like i'm really good at communicating ideas in a presentable way to ccp, focusing on the problems with sensible solutions. a few examples of changes i've driven and influenced were the t3d balance changes last autumn, i was a member of the t3d group, ccp fozzie even gave me a shoutout in the thread! you can read some articles i wrote here and here. i also feel like the current command bursts and ogb removal were heavily influenced by the blog i wrote on them here.i can take your problems and present them in a way that will get them noticed by ccp. how do you contact me?reply to this thread send me an ingame mailtwitter.com/suitoniatwitch.tv/suitoniayoutube.com/eveiseasycontributer to eve is easy:

"and there we go, another solo kb warrior i'm on twitch, so i think i know what i'm doin vote for me.so fed up with those ""elect me, i'm famous"" candidates...loyal servent to mother amamake. @eve_tetsel"
suitonia has the best understanding of game mechanics of anyone i've ever seen and is an excellent pilot to boot. he's got my vote this year.
check out the positive changes i've made with my blogs, content and being on the t3d focus group. i'm not running for fame or to make myself feel more important, i'm running to increase my capacity of helping the eve community and making eve into a better game for all of us, that i have a proven track record of improving. i think that is more a player content thing rather than something ccp can expressly help with. if you want to get into pvp in nullsec i'd recommend giving my kestrel guide a once over (from page 20 i have almost everything listed there that you would want to engage and how you should engage). my youtube channel has a bunch of cool stuff that you might like (the old kestrel video that i have has a lot of stuff i go over). there are also many other great content creators on youtube and twitch that can help you out. some people who are new player focused, and are good at explaining their thought process that you might want to watch are;fintarue - this guy does alpha clone pvp and pvp in lowsec.channel ******* zarvox - dungeon tier -3/10 pvper but easy to see him roam and his thought process.thebloodraids merlin guide on youtubeiddoeve also has some great stuff!i do believe ccp could help by signal boosting these content creators, and putting out some kind of content themselves around solo pvp to generate more interest and support for players like you. the kestrel is great, and i can't wait to add the csm tag to a cringy pickup line :di did, not much recently. thanks for the support everyone else contributer to eve is easy:
could you link the guides you've written? anything selfless at all?i've watched lots of his streams and read his kestrel guide enough to try it for myself and honestly no matter what sort of npe ccp comes up with, the best quality npe is going to be players showing how they play, by example; and honestly suitonia is much, much less of an attention hoe compared to others in the genre of twitch/youtubers.we need lots more of this guy and others to step up in eve online.
well hopefully there will be a frigate focus group and he will be usefull.good luck to him for the election btw.we'll probably need a bs solo pvp expert too, can't wait zarvox to apply.loyal servent to mother amamake. @eve_tetsel
suitonia is probably the only popular twitch streamer without that attitude, and should be an example to all future streamers that would like to be successful without the use of breasts.
if you think suitonia has only contributed through videos, you'd be well and truly wrong.he has helped both the community and the devs with his knowledge, acknowledged by ccp fozzie here:
thank you so much, i really appreciate the support!
vouch
+1 his knowledge of the game and experiences will be a great thing to have on the csm
i know nothing about pvp, i mostly do indy, i know you said you are focused in pvp, but will you also be able to represent people like me, who are interested in pvp, but have no idea where to start. maybe like suggesting a career agent that actually teaches what transversal, radial, and other important parts of pvp is.i tried doing pvp fleets, but at one point it gets tiring to just press f1 and anchor. i want to know the solo pvp stuffs, cause when i try it, i fail, then i just go back to being an indy
absolutely, people like you are exactly who i want to represent. veterans dont need much of a representative as they are pretty loud as it is . its the new pilots that make eve grow and great and making sure there are plenty of avenues to teach new pilots is exactly what i will do my best to bring to the csm.
additionaly i will try to push the issue on war dec mechanics. i believe this mechanic is broken and should at minimum have a hard limit on length of declararation if not a compunding fees system where each week the price of war goes up.
couldn't have said it better.
what is your position of the 'garage-door' citadel chains and general lack of risk once associated with moving capital/supercapital ships? what suggestions would you present or suggest to alter this mechanic?
dancul how easy to you find secret hitler? also +1 for dancul being a worthwhile candidate for csm.
"laughable portrait and character name literally means "" in as.shole"" in french. embarassing candidacy."
i have been told what my name means in french. i do not speak french nor did i know what it meant when i created my character. i simply used the first three letters of my first name and the first three letters of my last name and added some numbers to look cool.
bobmon is literally the worst+1#eve_nt website; www.eve-nt.uk blog;
hi bobmon,i have one question given how different the circumstances are between you running now, and you running this time last year.so, last year, lenny helped you out and subbed a ton of accounts using iwi money for the purpose of voting for you in first place to make sure you got on the council. pretty clever, actually, and seems more or less within the election rules, so well played.out of curiosity, though, do you mind disclosing exactly how many of these accounts were subbed and used to vote for you, or alternatively what the total cost of that vote padding (either in plex or isk) was?
over 9000!no, seriously this story is false, yes i got support from lenny but this was only him telling people to vote for me as their csm caniddate, nothing more, nothing less.
thanks everyone for the support.update 24/01: fixing the eve online store:
"what is your position on shirtless avatar pictures and the possibility of having ""thug life"" tattooed on the belly ?"
aram is both the hero we deserve and the hero we need right now. this is the definition of an easy can't miss choice. my only concern is whether we truly need any other csmers for this cycle with aram on board, as it's possible they might just get in the way with their inferior contributions, taking up valuable time that aram could be using to enact more change.i think that's something that we could debate for a bit.
hello fellow eve online playersmy name is thermal damage, and this year i will be running for the csm. i have been playing eve for almost 11 years, so i feel that i have a fairly good knowledge in most aspects of the game. i have lived in high, low and nullsec doing everything from building capitals to working on diplomatic relations. i feel my best attribute would be my ability to work with, encourage, and solve problems with people, something i feel would be very useful as a member of the csm. i am also a very active member of the #tweetfleet community as you can see here.i'm a passionate advocate for the harsher side of eve online. eve has become too focused on becoming safe and overly friendly over the last few years, both in regards to game mechanics and within the community at large. i know there are a large portion of you who dislike how eve is slowly becoming some kind of safe space and i would be there to fight your corner. i am interested in working with the 'charity' mentality within our community to find some sort of resolution so that we can phase them out. they are too often used as a basis for corruption and self promotion.i am also interested in working with ccp on how they manage their interactions with the community, including their ticketing system, recommendations/complaints from players, and their forums. i mean what's the point of the forums if people rather go to r/eve? the forums should be the central hub of out of game communication. as an experienced community manager, i feel i can bring a lot to the table in this regard. ccp would also benefit from some education on how to keep real life and ingame issues separate. i see many ccp employees posting about politics and some rather polarizing social issues on their work forum accounts and twitter handles. its all rather embarrassing. only grief and negativity can come from people bringing real life 'stuff' with them past the login screen. together we can come to a solution where all eve news is centralized with impartial support from ccp.i am also interested in running a focus group to find out why 80% of eve's playerbase refuses to leave highsec. as i said in my first point, it is nice and safe, but i suspect there is more to it. i am not so arrogant that i claim to have all the answers, so i would like to work with alliance leaders and community figureheads from all areas of space to find ways in which we can pull people away from the newbie training ground that is high security space. it could be with nerfs, buffs, or new ideas altogether, i approach this with an open mind.the best way to contact me would be @thermaldamage, but you can post here or send me an eve mail. thankyou for taking the time to read this, and i hope i can count on your vote come election time.

thecla asked what my thoughts on battleships are on twitter.i think that there is a problem with the superfluous amounts of pirate battleships there are on the market, from boosts to anomaly ratting escalation chance and burner missions, driving down the value to the point where they are cheaper than the navy alternatives (making navy bs unseen outside of eve tournaments or highsec missions). this also strains t1 battleships somewhat too, as for less than a 100m extra you gain a huge power increase, which being 1/3rd of what your normally pay for a decent fit t1 bs, is usually a no brainer. starfleetcommander, a volta/triumvirate fc mused with me on teamspeak about, how, 3 years ago, triumvirate were running machariel fleets in the dr. and they lost a 200 man mach fleet, and then another a week after. this cleaned out the entirety of jita of machariels and resupplying their machariel fleet became a huge issue. he said he recently checked zkillboard, and 4x the amount of machs they lost are being lost on a monthly basis with no effect on jita.i think escalations are a good thing however, since they encourage people who usually stay in one system ratting, to venture out and run an escalation in another system. mixing up gameplay for them, and perhaps, creating content for someone else who manages to catch them outside their usual safezone. i'm not sure how to reduce pirate bs proliferation, perhaps pirate ship bpcs could be removed from escalation sites. i think navy battleships need to go through a balance pass, notably; here are some of my preliminary thoughts on the ones that most stand out to me.navy dominix - it performs worse than the regular dominix in some situations due the lack of the tracking speed and range bonus. it got the hybrid damage bonus as a harken back to the old dominix. it exists to make eft generals who haven't undocked in the past 2 years to salivate over 2k dps fits, there are better vindicator fits for this for less isk. personally i'd just add the dominix bonuses and keep the hybrid bonus. navy armageddon - just like the n.dominix, it exists for people to remember the days of the old armageddon. the navy apoc is a better laser damage platform because having tracking+optimal, with way better fitting, and secondary stats like speed and targeting is better than 15% dps, utility high and a bigger drone bay. i'd change this to the current armageddon with the extra stats from navy, +1 low, and slightly bigger drone bay. navy megathron - the vindicator is cheaper, does more dps, has a 90% web with the same tracking bonus, and the extra hp on the vindi almost makes up for the 8th low. i think if the mega got a 50% large hybrid role bonus, with 5% damage per level, and -2 turrets. it could be an interesting ship, 2 utility highs on a gallente blaster battleship would be a nice niche that seperates it a bit more from the hyperion and vindicator. typhoon fleet - the turret bonus should be swapped for something more usefultempest fleet - give it the same damage as normal tempest 5% rof to 7.5%as for battleships in general, i think they could use a lot better targeting stats (sensor strength, scan res, targeting range). i wrote this a long time ago
high quality candidacy. good looking despite pleb background.free in the mind, thug in the heart, reminds me my youth years.would follow to whatever end.
literally alpha-clone-day-one portrait, those eyes are screaming sadness and childhood suffering. embarassing candidacy.
good luck killah! i think you will do very well. just make sure if you ever retire, you retire as a fc and not a space politician. :)

"eve api devs were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think whether they should.while i'm not too fond of the fairly typical (and banal) ""grrr goons/panfam/whatever"" posting you seem to quite like, i agree that the amount of free intel from the api as well as other sources needs to be looked at. siphons were just the peak of the iceberg.third party apps have gone much further than just improving convenience and quality of life things; the free intel they provide has completely transformed the way a ""good"" player plays eve. eve has always been quite metagamey, and it's all fine and good to a certain degree, but there's such a thing as going too far."
as ceo of r1fta, we fully endorse thermal damage for emperor of csm.
i whole heartedly endorse #heatfleet get some
endorsing as well, may long he reign.
thermal damage is someone who should be on the csm. he isn't a politician, but a player's player, and that is something the community really needs. he has a very good understanding of the community, is very active in helping others and proposing new ideas, and knows many aspects of the eve universe. (even those aspects that some may or may not agree with, but are still part of what makes eve what it is) he has already been active in proposing many new ideas to improve the gaming mechanics and would be a very good asset to the community, especially as a voice for those of us who may have become discouraged watching lowsec slowly dissolve. vote for thermal damage, and make new eden great again !!!!
i really prefer explosive damage. it tends to be a weaker resist on pretty much anything people fly these days.
yes well explosive damage isn't running for csm

i have not caught up yet with the entire thread here, but i am responding to the op title.i believe the problem of retention is linked to the existence of anonymous alts allowing players to conduct griefing and hostile operations against other players, without having any drawbacks or risks connected to their asset producing pilots. this also applies to activity like cloaky camping, spying, stealing or scamming.to that end, i propose in my csm campaign to provide an economical benefit to those players willing to link their accounts publicly together, so that the griefers and gankers, spies, scammers thieves and afk campers, would suffer an economic loss from choosing to insulate their main accounts from their griefing accounts.the psychological thought that you can be griefed by someone more powerful than you without having any ways to get back at them or them not losing anything when undertaking this griefing is what imho drives retention down.

i have some questions and suggestions:1.) can you please talk with ccp if we will see any other structure released this year other than drilling platforms? if so, what is it?2.) can you please talk with ccp to see if we can have some changes to faction warfare? 3.) it would be nice if we could get bonuses for owning regions and constellations like having sovereignty in a single system.4.) i believe it would be more engaging if there were different ways to bring a system contestable in fw.for example:-hacking site that would decrease if the contestability if hack failed and intense it if hack was successful.-entosis linking nodes-combat sites that you would need to clear to increase contestability and defend to decrease it. these sites would have many npcs rather than timers to run. each of these would provide different percentage amounts towards contestability as well.
the rapid regeneration of nodes has impacted the ability for small groups to challenge ownership of null sec space. the initial design of nodes was that they did not regenerate, thus forcing the defenders into action for each nodes, and allowing the nodes to be used by griefing attackers just to trigger defender's actions with no intent from the attacker to take sov.so the fundamentals of node regeneration came from a good place, and are not in question.it has then been changed, with csm blessing, to a regeneration scheme that is independent of either how far the nodes are from the owning alliance's capital or the adm of current system.what has not been considered at all is that the rapid regeneration has a cumulative effect impacting smaller groups of attackers willing to go after sov, with a limited number of pilots. for a small group of pilots (say 3 entosis ships plus the same number of rapid response combat ships), they start entosis on the nodes and spend the required time on the first onesm, including the warm up. during that time, the *other nodes continue to regenerate*, increasing the entosis time accordingly, and making it more and more difficult for small groups to flip the required number of nodes, *even if they are unopposed*. this cumulative effect impacts small groups way more than larger groups. is the design purposefully done to prevent small groups of pilots to go after sov in null sec, and favor rental empires in null sec?if not, can the regeneration of nodes be looked at again? possible suggestions include stopping regeneration time for all nodes once a node is being attacked, or tying regeneration time to local adm, or distance from capital, or allow for node attackers to win if no defenders had done any node action after the attacker flipped a certain number of nodes unopposed.... there are many options available, *if* the design intent is to allow smaller groups to fight for sov in null sec.
"looking forward to any news of progress in the overhaul of the npc mission system. planetary interaction is a description of game mechanics, planetary industry is much better as a name for the feature. ccp, please consider adopting this alternate name.pi needs love. it is increasingly tied into production of all manner of items, from ascendency implants to citadels. all players could get started faster if the user interface helped them along with some suggested preset configurations: imagine plopping down a group of pre-linked and routed pins, that you could drag around before clicking 'submit' to set their positions. [edit: add]to help drive awareness of the csm, a set of ""csm electee archive scripts"" listing the csm electees from 1 through 10, were given to all voters in 2015. players should get a new ""archive script"" every year... even without the voting part, just to remind players via the redemption queue, the importance ccp places on the csm."

my name is toxic yaken, and i<U+FFFD>m running for csm xii as a highsec candidate.about me i currently live with old friends in nullsec as a member of the dickwad squad, part of legio de mortem and the larger phoenix federation in the south. i also maintain my highsec funtimes with an alt in fly fearless trying to help newbros and learning how to fc against wardeccers, as well as having a ganking alt for funding my activities.i<U+FFFD>ve been playing eve online for about 3 years, with the vast majority of my time spent in highsec as a scammer, pirate, ganker, and wardeccer. when i first heard of eve online i was enticed into the game by the prospect of <U+FFFD>being the villain,<U+FFFD> though i somewhat ironically ended up mining ice in highsec. i lived in a bubble for my first few months, not really talking to anyone or learning anything, until one day i was ganked by code. for afk mining. this became a major turning point for me to actually delve deeper into the game to get revenge. after being part of several disappointing corporations that promised to teach me how to pvp, i came across the belligerent undesirables blog and was taught the ways of highsec dickery. i started awoxing corporations and ganking to feed my addiction to building an ever-growing pile of loot, and friends that i made along the way also led to me joining wardec corporations, to better learn how to hunt and pvp. while i think i've softened a bit over the last few years, i still see highsec as my home. last year, i ran for csm to represent the ganking and wardeccing communities. i wanted to be honest to myself and represent the playstyles and lifestyles that i enjoy in eve online in spite of them being pretty small communities to draw support from. knowing that i would run again this year, i tried to use my spare time to experiment with different projects that i thought would provide players with opportunities to communicate their opinions. during the summer, i started doing interviews with highsec players to get a better grasp of what these players thought of different aspects of highsec gameplay and posting these conversations on a blog. while these interviews were enjoyable and helped me gain a better perspective of what players thought about the game, i didn<U+FFFD>t really like the format as means of collecting information, and many of the interviews that i started with players were never finished due to challenge of being online at the same time (my schedule wasn<U+FFFD>t amazing.) during the fall i organized a wardec roundtable for players and the csm to discuss several issues with wardecs, which turned out great and was well received by those in the csm that attended. as a follow up i also rebooted the wardec project, (originally conceived by jason quixos and tora bushido) where players are free to participate in discussions on the subject of wardecs and ways to potentially improve them on our open discord channel and ideas are recorded for future referencing and discussion. (feel free to hop on and join the conversation) communication over the course of the last few months there have been some complaints about visibility and communication of csm xi with the community. a lot of work and discussions occur behind the scenes, and seeing csm activity for oneself is a matter of knowing where to look. if you<U+FFFD>re not part someone actively following along on appropriate media or with the csm members themselves it can be kind of hard to find. the csm website doesn<U+FFFD>t even provide a good impression of the csm<U+FFFD>s activity or thoughts <U+FFFD> most of the postings are almost a year old. on top of that, every elected candidate is going to have a different opinion of what their role in the csm is supposed to be - we can look at jin<U+FFFD>taan and mr hyde as an example. jin<U+FFFD>taan has been actively organizing townhalls, slogging through chats, and trying to be at the forefront of relations with the community, while mr hyde<U+FFFD>s stance has been that he was elected as a representative of his voters and when he needed other player<U+FFFD>s opinions he would search for those he believed had a strong understanding of the subject matter. neither of these styles of representation is <U+FFFD>bad<U+FFFD>, but they may not align with the expectations of some players. if elected, my plan would be to make the csm more visible to the community by focusing on pushing out more community based discussions, including townhalls and open chats like i have for the wardec project, and working to expand promotions of these discussions for a greater participation. perspective while smaller changes may be easier to push for, i want to try and follow the realistic expectation that the direction that ccp wants to development eve may not align with my own opinions. my hope is that, if elected, i would be able to learn the path that ccp wants to follow and make suggestions that would benefit that vision. i recognize that while the staff of ccp may be willing to hear my opinions and those of the community, it is ultimately their game and their decisions. as such the following opinions on highsec are my own, and this platform shouldn<U+FFFD>t be taken as promises but rather where my mind is for these subjects.
new player experience with the ascension update we saw an influx of new and returning players and an update to the new player experience. the new introductory arc for teaching players the basics was definitely a step in the right direction, and i<U+FFFD>m hopeful that the next iterations will build well off of what they have now. what i would like to see made part of the npe is a better impression of the impact a player can have on their surroundings and universe. choices and consequences have always been a big part of eve, but the npe as is exists only to teach the fundamentals and basic ways to make isk. with only a couple of hours on average to grab new players, even having the tutorial give examples of the kind of impacts they can make on the game could be enough to keep playing. i<U+FFFD>ve also had a few newbros tell me that they thought the tutorial could stand to be longer, or alternatively offer advanced teachings that focused on educating players on more advanced mechanics like fleet ui or corporation mechanics. i also love the initiative that csm members are making for basic suggested fittings of ships for newer players trying to figure out how to fit, and the flight academy tutorial videos needing to be made more visible to new players who are already struggling hardcore with learning all the ui already. corporations social groups i have seen tons of fledgling highsec corporations that more or less exist because corporations provide the social structure that guilds, clans, and clubs offer in other mmorpgs. corporations are easy to setup and offer all the tools that the aforementioned social structures provide in other games, but these tools will sometimes be underutilized by those who don<U+FFFD>t plan to or understand how to use them. as an alternative for those who are not interested in building up their space, such as taking sovereignty or setting up structures, i think that the introduction of social groups would better suit their interests. social groups could offer all of the social benefits of a regular corporation, such as private channel, member list, titles, etc. unlike corporations they wouldn<U+FFFD>t have the ability to alter the rate of taxation, anchor large structures, take sovereignty, or engage in wars. allowing players to be able to join multiple social groups could give rise to more community based groups established in game, rather than outside of it. i know that this idea has been pitched before, but for players whoo are just getting started, don<U+FFFD>t plan on having citadels or taking sovereignty, or are trying to avoid the risks that come with being in a corporation, creating a society could become the optimal choice over a corporation. i like the idea of corporations of an investment of time and effort, so another idea i have been toying with is the idea of corporation specializations. when you start a new corporation you could be presented with a variety of options to develop your corporations benefits <U+FFFD> so for example, you could give industrial corporations choices like slightly higher mining yields, improved industrial build times/material efficiency, faster producing/better yields on planetary interaction, etc. increased rewards of loyalty points and isk could be handed out to those who specialize in empire protection operations such as missions, incursions, faction warfare, and general ratting. rather than just choosing which benefits your corporation would receive, the best way to receive these benefits would come from the members banding together to work toward their specialization. with multiple levels of proficiency goals corporations could either attempt to maximize their specialization in a small scope of skills or provide a more balanced approach across different bonuses. services i would love to see the creation of an in-game services hub where players can advertise or look for services; mercenary work, industrial contracts, hauling, intelligence work, etc. besides giving these services more visibility to the average player, it could also give newer players a better impression of the impact that they can make on the universe. let<U+FFFD>s say you and your newbro friends want to start a new industrial group that wants to create t1 frigates to cruisers <U+FFFD> sure, you could always just sell them on the market, but let<U+FFFD>s say you instead take a contract building ships for some players in faction warfare. now there is more visibility to what your work is being used for, you<U+FFFD>re communicating with other players and getting a better understanding of their universe, and you<U+FFFD>re building relationships.wars regardless of where you might fly in space, almost everyone has experienced a wardec. for a lot of players these wars were likely underwhelming, with no notable engagements, aside from some careless players getting caught visiting a trade hub. a lot of these wars are declared to ensure content for the wardeccer<U+FFFD>s corporation or alliance, rather than achieving a specific goal. to that end wars can be lackluster, as quality wars are those that are created with some sort of intent, whether it be tearing down every public citadel in perimeter or simply getting revenge on someone who wronged you. but again, these quality wars are the exception, in part because there really aren<U+FFFD>t a lot of motivations to go to war over highsec space.

if the aggressors have one advantage, it is the ability to control the length of war. over the last year i<U+FFFD>ve seen a lot of discussions regarding giving wars an objective for both sides to fulfill in order to end a war, because for a lot of players a war is essentially just keeping them from playing the game they want to play. the main idea has been focused around giving the attackers a structure or citadel module that can be destroyed for the war to end. i<U+FFFD>m personally not a huge fan of turning all wars into a kind of attack and defend like game, partially because of the potential of throwing the whole wardeccing and mercenary culture into disarray. i<U+FFFD>ve personally raised the suggestion of a system wherein players could shorten the overall length of the war by meeting preset activity thresholds tied to their corporation<U+FFFD>s specialization, as a way to fight the war without actually fighting. all in all, this is still a pretty big subject of discussion within the wardec project discord. i don<U+FFFD>t want to see every highsec corporation fold at the sight of a wardec notification. the players that tend to live in highsec usually have little recourse when faced with experienced wardeccers intent on invading their space, and even thought this is no different than being attacked in any other space, there really aren<U+FFFD>t a lot of clear options. the greatest advantage for defenders is their ability to recruit allies to their defense, but who do you hire and where do you find them? again, i would love to see the creation of an in-game services hub for players to find this support, as well as providing links to it in both the wardec notification and on the war report so that any players that at least take the time to read can have some idea of what to do next. i<U+FFFD>d also like to see an improvement to diplomatic options for wars, such as options to change the length of wardec protection from the aggressor, or allow for an exchange of assets/structures. but for the most part, being a defender means taking more precautions. the removal of watchlists last year heralded in another big change for a lot of highsec wardeccers, generally breaking down some of the smaller and more hunting focused groups in favour of larger blanket wardeccing groups to ensure consistent content. lord razpataz of devil<U+FFFD>s warrior alliance created a big thread about it on the eveo forums, and has since been actively calling for the return of watchlists or a rework to locator agents which would at least tell if a player was offline or not for a fee. though i<U+FFFD>m generally under the impression that there is little chance that ccp would ever return watchlists in any capacity, i would be happy to see locator agents have some sort of rework to better serve wardeccers.
ganking ganking is true non-consensual highsec pvp and i love it. players gank for different reasons - i gank for profit, i know groups that gank the neutral freighters of their enemies, and some even gank out of ideological beliefs. ccp clearly recognizes the need for ganking as a way to punish taking risks in highsec, but the way that they rework ganking mechanics is very hands off. it feels like they view the ganking community as wolves and the rest of the players as sheep, and as if they think the wolves are getting too out of control they will make the sheep a bit harder to eat. i<U+FFFD>d like more clarity on what ccp thinks of ganking as a whole if elected but for now i want to focus on some of the common arguments against ganking.the main complaints that i hear related to the ganking are:1. ganking has a negative impact on newer players2. ganking is a low-risk activity for the ganker3. ganking offers little opportunity for interaction the first complaint is valid to an extent. i know that my activities have made players quit, and though i don<U+FFFD>t target players by age, i have definitely blown up newbros hauling everything they own. my personal experience with being ganked proved to be a turning point for me in eve, and even ccp has pointed out that retention is higher amongst players who are blown up in their initial time playing<U+FFFD> but obviously not everyone is going to have the same reaction to losing their possessions. the second point is also valid to an extent. in classic eve tradition, gankers have min-maxed the hell out of ganking to the point where code. provides a spreadsheet for calculating the amount of damage needed to break the tank of any mining barge or exhumer based on fittings. the complaint is similar to complaining that highsec incursion runners have too low-risk for their reward - it<U+FFFD>s generally safe because they have optimized their fits and operations to ensure optimal clearing of otherwise challenging sites. killrights and a negative security statuses can be detrimental for some types of ganking or trying to enjoy other activities, but otherwise don<U+FFFD>t matter to those who live the -10.0 ganking lifestyle. you can try to change the values of hull hp, change criminal timers, change concord response times, and so on, but gankers will inevitably adapt and mix-max their way back to relative prosperity.the final point is where i think there is the best opportunity for improvements to ganking. while there is counterplay to some aspects of ganking, such as counter bumping a bumper to try to free a freighter or trying to jam ships to ensure they can<U+FFFD>t finish off their targets, it<U+FFFD>s usually not much fun. trying to disrupt a gank doesn<U+FFFD>t even feel like you<U+FFFD>re doing more than whoring on a kill most times. i would love to inevitably find a way that allows players to try and police gankers rather than the npcs to some capacity while not imposing on a gankers ability to kill someone, but in all honesty i feel like the crimewatch system needs an overhaul before we can reach that point.(edit:) i<U+FFFD>ve been toying with the idea of changing the way that concord works, that instead of nuking a criminal after eventually arriving on scene, that they would simply apply significant damage reduction to that criminal. eventually faction police would arrive and slowly tear them apart, but it could provide anti-ganking players with more ability to meaningfully interfere with ganks as it would take significantly longer to kill someone under the damage reduction. it could also lead to more freedom for gankers to use different ships than just max dps gallente blaster boats or stealth bombers. the biggest downside to this would be that i think it would make ganking more prevalent in general because well tanked, larger hulls would be able to terrorize players outside of largely populated space. my thoughts here are still a work in progress but i<U+FFFD>ve been reaching out to gankers, and soon anti-gankers for their opinions on the subject to hopefully build up some better ideas.missionsi know that this had been talked to death - missions are repetitive, and lack a lot of substance. some people enjoy them, but for a lot of players it is simply part of their grind to earn isk for other activities. it would be nice to see more variety and challenge introduced to missions with the newer drifter ai for those that enjoy running them, but what i would really like to see is challenging missions that require small groups to run. restrict the number of players that can run the mission to a certain amount and give these players that like pve something more interesting to do than just running the same missions together on easy-mode. ---thank you for taking the time to read my platform. if you have any comments, concerns, questions, etc. feel free to post in this thread or contact me:ingame: toxic yakentwitter: @toxic_yakentweetfleet slack: toxic yakenalso please consider checking out the wardec project discord!--interviews:

can't find anything about navy raven/scorp in your list, why ?loyal servent to mother amamake. @eve_tetsel
i feel like those are in better shape than the more obvious ones that are struggling more. i mostly just put down my preliminary thoughts here, i'm sure those 2 could also probably use some polish somewhere, but i'd have to look deeper into it. contributer to eve is easy:
"when you think about all of those things that are ""not working well with ships"" according to you, do you keep in mind pve usage of those ships ?loyal servent to mother amamake. @eve_tetsel"
i am vic jefferson. i have been playing this game for 4 years, and have tried almost every aspect of this game extensively except for wormholes. i believe myself to be a strong candidate for many reasons. first, no matter what particular aspect of this game captivates you the most, there is a good chance i have been there and done that as a player, and thus can both relate and understand the issues that affect you as a player. many csm positions are filled by 'empty suits' which do not play the same game you do, and are given out by large power blocs, effectively depriving you of a voice and giving it to power blocs over players, when the csm itself is supposed to be representing players. second, i am not squeamish to criticism and have no issues fully listening to players and their concerns, where playing the game as extensively as i do tends to put me in contact with many play styles and people. third, my professional career (research scientist, phd) mandates that i am able to work collaboratively with world class experts of many disciplines and from many backgrounds <U+FFFD> one is never graced with infinite time and resources, so one must be able to communicate quickly and with minimal friction to accomplish anything, where i would take a csm position with the same seriousness and professionalism as my real job. i will touch on a few key points to try and persuade you that i am no different than you <U+FFFD> a player hungry for content, whether that is clawing my way closer to industrial supremacy or perpetually roaming in search of the mythical good fight. i only want more opportunities and a better environment for those to happen in on every login, and am willing to go one step further and try to voice our player concerns to those that author the world we play in. a) interaction is the only thing that really powers this game.b) mechanics that deplete the available player content should be looked at first and foremost.c)a few smaller tournaments would grow some newer competitors and enliven this aspect of the game.d)risk and reward should be at the heart of every mechanic.e)a sample of ship balance.a) interaction is the only thing that really powers this game. what makes you and i log in? for some of us, our content is meted out to us like a rat in a skinner box - turn off dota or overwatch when you get that ping, and get in fleet to receive content in small kill-mail fortified granules. for others, we chase content, look for the adrenaline rush, try to increase our ever tenuous grasp of part of the economy, or tend to our errands of individual concern. however, most of the persistent and good reasons to log in, regardless of how you play eve, are because players are allowed to plant and nurture the seeds of content <U+FFFD> every new mechanic and revision of old mechanic should consider how much the change will enable players to interact more with other players, or increase the strength and importance of existing interactions. there have been great improvements to this area of the game recently. citadels themselves are a great example <U+FFFD> players may now own pseudo-stations in areas they previously could not and control their own markets and docking rights. the industrial arrays likewise emphasize player control with added risk <U+FFFD> with npcs out of the way, these open up avenues for player interaction. not requiring standings for jump clones and the security tag system are also recent examples, where the former gutted one of the last legitimate uses of npc standings, and the latter meant you could recover security status without having to shoot red things for hours, while also adding a tiny economy around the tags. the station advertising may seem trivial, but in addition to providing much needed immersion, it adds something that is vastly needed <U+FFFD> a community reach out in game. now, surely experienced players know there's a hundred good ways to get roped into a particular corp or alliance, or npsi group, etc, i.e. finding stuff to do in game. as of late, especially with the ghost fitting utility, eve is becoming less reliant on having a small arsenal of third party programs to even attempt to progressing, but what it could really use a revamp of its in game method of exposure to things like npsi, public roams, various activities, and corp and alliance recruitment. slowly but surely, there's more to fight over, and ccp seems to get the idea of giving the players control, now you just have to find a way to get people excited and involved with things, without excessively leaning on the community; reliance on third party software is slowly being replaced, when will community stuff follow suit?
b)mechanics that deplete the available player content should be looked at first and foremost. take high-sec incursions versus null-sec anomalies. objectively you could say they are both anachronistic dinosaurs of a bygone age in video game design, and you would be correct. however, null-sec anomalies let players plant the seeds of player content, whereas high-sec incursions just distort a delicate risk/reward ecosystem while adding nothing to the total player content available. for example, if a player is out ratting in null-sec, she or he is providing something to hunt for would be antagonists. this in turn creates a need and a job for people to defend the ratters, and this in turn can sprout into good set ups for small gang and fleet fights. conversely, a high-sec incursion runner would be at considerably less risk, spawn no chances for player interactions, and be making comparable or more isk than the nullsec ratter. this would be an example that needs addressing badly <U+FFFD> riskier activities that add to the player content pool should be vastly more profitable than ones that do not <U+FFFD> carrots not sticks need to motivate people to participate in new eden. incursions should get groups on their feet, an impetus to work together for a common goal in a more controlled environment, not sustain them indefinitely and outshine all other options. some of the latest changes have been going in this direction. the new structures definitely let people take chances at things, and put things at risk to seek bigger rewards <U+FFFD> this is fantastic, good game design for groups of all sizes. rewarding risk-taking and specialization to the point where it is worth doing is driving a lot of content. faction warfare sort of gives and takes <U+FFFD> the militias offer a ton of pick up and go content and nudge player hands toward a ton of destruction and creation. however, the reverse side of this is the sheer amount of farming that goes on via the missions and stabbed farmers, coupled with the size of the warzone and number of plexes; because the ways and means of farming lp are neither in short or in any way limited supply, nor are they actually gated with a need to even be at risk from other player activity, the optimal strategy is to avoid fighting in a warzone. sovereignty in general right now is a mixed bag <U+FFFD> by and large the same old players with the scale and organizational largess are still the big consumers of sov content. despite aegissov mechanics letting anyone take systems quickly, it still doesn't quite offer as much as it could to medium size groups, either in terms of the content or income it can grant line-members. the entry barrier to sov is very low, but there needs to be more compelling and obvious reasons to want sov in the first place. standings are probably the most obvious thing in need of revision here <U+FFFD> whether it is missions or faction warfare, or who knows what, the horrible penalties one incurs via these activities make no sense and have no place in the game currently, but are absolutely characteristic of many of the artificial entry barriers the game was previously fraught with. either that, or add a tag system similar to the security status system for repairing faction standings quickly <U+FFFD> take out the vintage mud era npc standings grind and let players be the freelancers they wish. too many players end up victimized by standings which have ceased to offer many perks, take away the penalties, or offer ways around them. c)a few smaller tournaments would grow some newer competitors and enliven this aspect of the game. now, many people brush off the at. i don't blame you. when the same groups, or derivatives of them, keep winning time and time again, and there aren't actual good ways to gradually up your game, and it is hard to build an interest. as tournaments become fewer and further between, this will only serve to prevent the sort of smooth inclines of interest and effort that could allow newer groups to to grow as competitors. at is sort of a big ticket, high entry barrier, high impact event for everyone involved, because it is the only real tournament around. it's a real simple idea <U+FFFD> more frequent smaller tournaments would really do good stuff for the game.
d)risk and reward should be at the heart of every mechanic. wardecs are probably one of the mechanics with the highest potential for generating engaging content, but largely fail to do so because of the asymmetry of it all. i.e. they could actually plant lots of great content seeds to get things rolling, but do not currently. most of the larger wardec alliances can just blanket war-dec the entire game as there are no actual consequences to this other than token isk costs, and no real risk to them due to high sec mechanics. if the wardeccers had to actually play a game of how many alliances and entities they can safely dec at once, say, by actually having ante on the table, things would be vastly more engaging. right now there's nothing for defenders to actually attack to end the war, and no actual liabilities for the attacker, so the best strategy is just to dec everyone and take the easy pickings. however, numerous people have proposed structures or citadel modules/rigs that would be required to declare and wage war in high-sec <U+FFFD> these would be a great addition to the game because they would turn wardecs into an actual game; how many and which things can i safely dec? the rest of the game has a very interesting approach to content. someone gets attacked, somewhere, for some reason. suddenly they talk to their friends for help defending<U+FFFD>.and suddenly the attackers also find allies, thus the escalation begins. before you know it, eve<U+FFFD>s twisted and byzantine alliances all work out who<U+FFFD>s side they are going to fight for over a given, initially small, conflict. this right here is the essence of eve <U+FFFD> there are social consequences beyond one episodic instance, the game fosters these like no other, and conflict is rich with many different concurrent dimensions.people could actually get involved in the war once the attacker actually has some skin in the game. now players could actually fight back <U+FFFD> fantastic, an actual risk and reward paradigm for wardeccers! i have feeling that a lot of the forced mechanics and entry barriers in early eve design reached for this philosophically <U+FFFD> opening one door comes at the cost of closing another door, like standings etc., but they failed in implementation because it punished players for just playing, not for <U+FFFD>bad<U+FFFD> decisions. there is no current way to be bad at wardeccing, because there is nothing at risk.e)a sample of ship balance blops are one of the last classes on the teircide agenda. to infer what is on ccp's mind with tii ships, one merely has to follow what they say, i.e. tii ships of all sorts represent specialization, along with the work they have already done on some of the tii ship lines. the tii cruiser line, while there could be a good deal of smoothing to make some ships more viable, does give a good philosophical paradigm. you can get more tank and raw combat prowess with the aptly named heavy assault cruiser line, or you could forgo these in favor of more finesse in the recon lines, trading raw tank and such for utility and ewar. this continues on to the tii battleships so far <U+FFFD> you can get damage, application, and tank at the cost of mobility in the marauder line, or you can trade the tank and some of the application for a very unique ability among sub-capitals <U+FFFD> a jump drive. that's all well and good on paper, but they really do leave something to be desired for the price, both isk and sp. currently, there are few good ways to use them <U+FFFD> looking for easy pick-offs with a few friends, as tackle and damage supported by triage for ganking large targets, or as an entire fleet supported by t3c logi if you have massive numbers. there are those that think giving them tii resists would be a good idea <U+FFFD> this would be a horrible idea for a few reasons. first, it violates the teiricide paradigm <U+FFFD> they aren't supposed to be progression from the t1 variant, they are supposed to be a specialization <U+FFFD> not simply just a better more expensive ship. second, this would give larger groups something that would come to be reviled <U+FFFD> a jump fatigue reduced tii battleship fleet, pushing us a little back to the pre-pheobe age, where content and power is only in the hands of the few. with a few triage pre-staged, these would come to asphyxiate any reasonable fights in very little time. what they need is specialization. if they are meant to be highly mobile platforms for quick strikes into heavily populated or defended systems, they need the tools to do so. right now the only appreciable reason to drop them, in this particular context, is to showboat honestly. why would you jump in a minimum 2b ship that starts the drop at 30% capacitor, requires at least one sensor booster to lock something in a reasonable time frame, cannot align quickly, and cannot warp while cloaked, when you could use any of the other options that do comparable damage at a faction of the cost and risk? granted i like blops, a lot. i have more isk invested in their fits than anything. this doesn't change them being bad at ambush tactics when every second counts. to make them specialists, blops need a temporary bonus upon jumping that will make them 'show time' ships, highly capable for at most 60s, such that they excel at their specialization, without offering a simply better, jump capable, battleship. it could be anything <U+FFFD> 300% scan resolution, heat damage reduction, agility, speed, application, etc. furthermore, a revised bridge mechanic, preferably configurable on the module, where you could jump your blops and it's gang, similar to the area effect of command destroyers, would make them far less clunky and more like the 'specialists' they were meant to be.
can confirm, this man has a tenacious work ethic for providing player content and illuminates mechanics that have long plagued our great game. +1

i've listened to much of mr. vince draken's voluble oratory, but i admit i'm a little confused. sure, i'm just an average person and not some intellectual, all-knowing brainiac, but it seems to me that vince and his fans are wolves in sheep's clothing who will destroy, debauch, devalue, and dehumanize a wide assortment of innocent people by next weekend. it is requisite, even in this summary sketch, to go back a few years to see how whenever i highlight the threat of high-handed terrorism in a letter such as this, vince issues a standard response. first, he denies the threat itself. then, he condemns those who describe it as flagitious, pigheaded shirkers. this is basically vince's way of fragmenting the nation into politically disharmonious units.if the past is any indication of the future, vince will once again attempt to bring this battle to a fever pitch. just because jealous cynicism exists and has for a long time, there is no reason for us to accept it from him. nobody wants him to effectuate the downfall of all that is decent and civilized, but vince insists on doing it anyway. i have reason to believe that he is about to transform our little community into a global crucible of terror and gore. i pray that i'm wrong, of course, because the outcome could be devastating. nevertheless, the indications are there that we definitely can't afford to let vince expand, augment, and intensify the size and intrusiveness of his phalanx of satanic schmegeggies. what i'm suggesting is that we convert retreat into advance. that's the key to holding vince to account for bringing ugliness and nastiness into our lives, and it's the only way that most people will ever learn that vince has recently altered the tone of his codices. they're no longer a dirge-like recitation of perpetual victimization but rather a preview of new trends in <U+FFFD>resistance<U+FFFD> propagandizing. for example, vince has been showcasing his latest techniques for obscuring unpleasant facts, facts such as that we find among narrow and uneducated minds the belief that the majority of covinous hoddypeaks are heroes, if not saints. this belief is due to a basic confusion that can be cleared up simply by stating that it's our responsibility to induce vince to perceive his errors of perception and judgment and make him realize that his helots do not accept the fact that mankind, with all of its accumulated knowledge, wonderful machines, scientific methods, and material power, still has much to fear from baleful doofuses like him. that's the first step in renewing those institutions of civil society<U+FFFD>like families, schools, churches, and civic groups<U+FFFD>that advance a clear, credible, and effective vision for dealing with our present dilemma and its most virulent manifestations, and it's the only way to tend to the casualties of his war on sanity.vince, like all semi-intelligible snollygosters, is unsympathetic. i do have to apologize for that; not all of them are unsympathetic. just kidding; yes they are. all such humor aside, i overheard one of vince's backers say, <U+FFFD>there won't be any blowback from vince's exploiting the feelings of charity and guilt that many people have over the plight of the homeless.<U+FFFD> this quotation demonstrates the power of language as it epitomizes the <U+FFFD>us/them<U+FFFD> dichotomy within hegemonic discourse. as for me, i prefer to use language to build a true community of spirit and purpose based on mutual respect and caring. i have one final message for you before ending this letter: any claim to the contrary is patently false.

sovereignty : citadels - longer anchor time in sovereignty is good, but if someone drop it outside alliance activity tz in alliance capitol, it will exit anchoring in very bad tz. making anchoring time to exit during sov owning alliance tz vulnerability could be good move. ships: rorqual, will it be fixed? i don't want jump hictor that cannot be killed for 7 minutes in the game. structures : cloning service - it is crucial. fuel usage look good, but eventually someone will forget to fuel this damn thing. can we get cloning to not use fuel blocks, but instead of it, onlining the structure could eat 50.000 blocks. shutting down a service - can we get big warning, you can disable service by miss click. npc null space: can we get some boost to living in this space. nothing was changed since 2008.

can you bring something about project discovery?
the future of the eve ip.aside from a few vr side projects for those lucky few with the headsets and the computers to play them, does ccp intend to create new experiences/games based in the eve universe for those who are not interested by eve online (the mythical project nova, opening a certain door, even new books or something)
how do you feel about the current state of the combat rorqual?
1) is there any work being done about the completely obsolete standing system towards npcs? any chance we see something done about it in relation to the new ai that is being implemented in the form of the mining operations and their defense fleets?2) any chance we can finally get rid of atributes? i know that implants are one of the main source of income from lp stores, but c'mon, they can be used to something different.3) is there some kind of roadmap regarding balancing issues?
and to add, myself and ccp logibro will also be there so some questions we might be able to grab and sort out on behalf of ccp. but the focus of the discussion will be on the csm and their thoughts.ccp guard | eve community developer | @ccp_guard
questions for the csm:1. do you know you don't do anything worthwhile?2. have you ever thought about doing something worthwhile?3. did you know that liquid ozone is not considered a charge? 4. if the csm has failed at impacting something as minor as #3, how can anyone expect you to have a positive impact on anything else in the game?regard
well, i'd like to see you guys bring up:1) alliance bookmarks - this just should be a thing. 2) the horrendously broken wardec mechanic. the eve-reddit page has a ton of great suggestions, from tieing wardecs to structures to just increasing wardec costs to reflect the inflation that has hit the game. it's no longer 250-300m for a plex, it doesn't make sense that wardec fees haven't increased as well. nothing is safe in eve, ever, but if it actually cost isk that was more than a hs mission runner makes in an hour people might consider who they want to wardec before blanket wardeccing 100 corps for kicks.who knows, might make some of the station camping wardeccers actually go looking for content.
how do you and/or ccp view highsec in comparison to other regions of space?do you think highsec could stand to benefit from more conflict drivers over the space itself?
ccp announced their intention to get rid of the attribute system a year or two ago, but it is still there, likely because they still haven't figured out what to do with learning implants and the lp market.if attributes don't get removed soon, could you try to convince ccp to at least lower the remap cooldown to 3 months or so as an easy to implement stop gap measure in the meantime?

what are some of the main changes you would propose?
i'm not really going in with a wishlist of stuff i want ccp to do because like i said in my op, that isn't how the csm works. it's a sounding board. in terms of key points i'd like to see more rollbacks from phoebe, and the entire entosis mechanic removed and replaced with something else.

update 27/01: ccp has not fully-exploited the potential of micro-transactions.today: dollars/euros on your credit card -> buy aurum on eve website -> use it to buy skins, apparel and skill extractorsdollars/euros on your credit card -> buy plex on eve website -> convert it for isk as a csm, i would ask ccp to remove those annoying steps and fully insert micro-transactions into the game. two easy steps: 1. you save your credit card once2. you can buy unlimited amout of items and iskeasy. thanks for the support.
since it's well known that ccp doesn't want our money (see the store as exemple) this is the csm member we need to empty our wallet, so ccp can spend more on vr, fps and other succesfull project in the futur.jewnior do you plan on telling ccp that they should licence the eve ip to some studios so we could have more spin off of eve everywhere ?wargaming.net: eve: world of spaceshipstelltale games: tales from the eve universettgames: lego eve onlinerovio: angrybird - deklein to delve egg chasesupercell: eve: clash of egosetc etcloyal servent to mother amamake. @eve_tetsel
if there was one thing i'd like to hear the csm discuss it would be planetary interaction which is virtually unchanged since its initial deployment and certainly has scope for improvement and added features. surely if space colonisation is the end goal then planetary interaction should be an important component
"1) pi - more like sim-planet. planetary guns to defend ground instalation, command center with fitting options, orbital ammo to support ground troops (all kind of commandos, mercs etc. finally would have use) with fighting over planetary resources. possible in the future?2) procedurally generated pve content - possible or not? 3) data sites - loot value. missed opportunity with citadels introduction. as shown with drones parts, small change can boost loot value significantly. data sites is content with little purpose to do, any chances to look at it?4) polarized weapons - what for? i had a feeling they were introduced to fight with drifters. very niche modules imo, not worth fitting. any ideas what to do with them or change them?5) standings - from one of minutes i got the feeling it won't be possible to have ""good"" standings with all empire factions. is this thing being developed further? 6) tiercide and balance - while balance is more delicate, tiercide is crucial, what is the state of it?7) revamps -> remove?8) state of boosters - are devs happy that narcotis are legal now? (i bet they do ). what was the impatc of that change? any twiks to it in the future?9) implants made by players - as stated10) new space -> jove -> confilct driver11) faction warfare and standings - i want to do some faction pvp, but i don't want to lose my standings. so i enlist for 3 weeks, fight for militia (and be a target to others empires navies) and after that period, i choose to stay or be removed from the army without standing losess. good? bad idea?12) new empire ships, new faction etc."
"can we have a statement on why chinese eve servers have superior ship skins available and tq does not. the ships are all ccps ip so i don't really think it is an ""ownership"" or ""copyright"" issue? i am assured this qurstion will be answered in stream by the_judge but i would like other csms thoughts on the quality / quantity of dank killer skins that would make me part with my moneythat are actually not available on tq.space cadet online - a wee blog about my exploits mass of wrecks - public npsi events fleet - launching 28th august"
1. why does the tempest have better bonuses than the tempest fleet issue?2. why are there no missiles in minmatar lp stores?there are good missile ships in the minmatar t1 and t2 lineup: breacher, bellicose, scythe fleet issue, cyclone, claymore, typhoon... this makes sense after all, missiles are the minmatar's secondary weapon system.similarly, hybrid weapons are the caldari's secondary weapon system.why do the caldari get access to hybrid charges in their lp store, but minmatar don't get access to missiles?i mean, even look at this: there's both a republic fleet ballistic control unit and a caldari navy ballistic control unit. so why no republic fleet missiles?main reason i'm griping, is because my standings are bad with caldari but good with minmatar. but i can't convert minmatar lp into good faction missiles. :(if a caldari pilot has terrible standings with gallente, it's no big deal because they can still buy hybrid charges from their own lp store.
any plans to make 30 day ship skin's permanent? does anyone actually buy a 30 day skin? why not make them all permanent!? thanks csm and ccp
those look like fingers belonging to someone who sits in a basement waiting for mom to bring more hotpockets. when was the last time you felled a tree with an axe ?
"i'm sorry but this is insulting for me. consider i made a very public article discussing the changes to the mining command ships and a very large portion of which made it in the final product. if you would like to bring up industry specifically i was/am in weekly and sometimes daily discussions with devs about numerous industry topics. i would also like to point out this post which specifically mentioned the csm having an impact on the engineering complexs which are about as industry as you can get. furthermore two members on the csm are literally the logistical leaders for the largest alliance in the game. i'm sorry that industry isn't getting the amount of updates to it you would like to see, but to say it's no getting ""any love"" or lacking is insulting to the current csm and their efforts."
i did that out of humor due to so many others doing it. thought it was worth a laugh, but i do see your point and thought it over and removed that part of the header.
you quite obviously do very little research before you comment, thanks for the bump to the top of the forums though. yes we have been killing alot of pos's and modules, but if you knew anything of co2 then thats kinda expected at this time. additionally, not a f1 monkey due to the fact i am usually fc during my timezone, which mean 3-4 characters logged in, 1 anchor, 1 cyno, 1 capital. alot more than f1 being pushed. click that magical button on zkill that goes to the next page and be amazed.
nah dude, sir katchaturian is 100% correct.if you wish to represent pvp, start by representing your own way out of that pit of mediocrity you call a killboard.
"as long as you don't plan to lobby csm to have whatever ""fixed"" in eve gameplay, i'm fine. making new eden even greater than it already is easy : leave ccp alone, just let it milk the cow, make the rich kids pay. the only people worth playing with will adapt, and justice for the rest"
do you have any opinion on the oppressive gender stereotypes in eve online ? my gaming experience could be far more immersive should i be able to identity myself outside of the absolutely barbaric yet usual paradigm ?
thank you for tossing your hat in the ring.the good candidates shine brighter against a contrasting backdrop, you supply it well.mmike azariah ----<U+FEFF> <U+FFFD>|(<U+30C4>)/<U+FFFD>
i tend to keep away from campaign drama, but in this case i think i'll wade into the cesspit of bad candidature. thermal, you are promoting the embodiment of exactly what is wrong with public perception with the csm. while i don't always agree with what certain eve personalities do, your behaviour towards others within this community can only be viewed as reprehensible. not only that, but you are consistently making a mockery of the very idea of the csm, be it a troll or not, a group that you claim to want to be a part of and represent. i strongly believe that people will vote with their feet and completely ignore your excuse of a candidacy, but i still wanted to make my opinion on actions like this completely clear and transparent.i'd rethink your platform and behavior if i was you.
i have removed a post under the above rule.
my thoughts exactly.
moved to player feature and ideas.
"what about integration with nova? is that shooter still in works even?

i missed the stream today. is it saved somewhere that i can watch it from?never mind, found it
last week was doing damage assessments in kansas and helped a farmer clear a couple trees.
got my vote! stay awesome and keep fighting the good fight!
how do you want to fix ecm?the idea that an action that is essentially not considered offensive should have perhaps the hardest and most binary counter in the game is ridiculous. there are many ways to make it much less game breaking.my vote is dependent on how big deal this is for you, and how you want to change it.also, what is your view on the balance of logistics and how it affects small gang/solo?
that is definitely not how i wanted it to come out. was poorly worded on my part (which i have went back to try to word it better). sorry about that. i really do appreciate you guys and what you have been doing - and everything from the current csm has been great, which has been very refreshing!what i am trying to say the most is that i would like to see more industry folks on the csm. there's been a lot of industry updates, changes, additions and now we have upcoming drilling platforms - so i feel that it would be very beneficial to have a more strong industrial minded players to the table.
i just have a few questions i wonder if you wouldn't mind answering.1. in your time with black legion, you mention you helped out with a lot of tasks. could you give some examples so we know more about your experience in eve?2. given that you are in both hard knocks and adversity., which area of space do you think needs more attention from ccp, null sec or w-space? why?3. looking at your posting history on reddit, you seem to have some experience working with crest and the apis. what do you think about ccp<U+FFFD>s move to esi and their implementation so far?4. recently you stated that eve is not a game for those looking for a good pve experience. what in your opinion makes for a good pve experience?5. you stated that most of your concerns over structures have been alleviated. what concerns do you still have?thank you
"if by ""literally"", you mean ""if you ignore spelling and grammar"", then yes, sort of. there'd just need to be an article between the ""dans"" and the ""cul"", and you know, an ""s"" added into his name.maybe if his name was ""danstoncul1001"" you could say it was ""literally"" french..."
i just have a few question i wonder if you wouldn't mind answering.1. without breaking the nda, what were the issues you concentrated on the most during your time on csm 11?2. you state that one year is not enough time for a csm member to work at maximum efficiency. why?3. what do you see as the biggest issues csm xii will have to deal with? this includes issues with the way the csm is run as well as any in-game issues.4. at the first summit, you brought up the issue of focus groups, but the minutes didn<U+FFFD>t record your position. what is your position on the use of focus groups?5. you were quite vocal in your displeasure in the changes to the eula that banned gambling organizations in eve. according to the attendance spreadsheet jin<U+FFFD>taan maintains, your live participation in meetings dropped from 74% before the changes down to 25%. was your participation affected because ccp did something you disagreed with?thank you.
i just have a few questions i wonder if you wouldn't mind answering.1. you stated that you are not one of the <U+FFFD>eve famous club.<U+FFFD> what advantages do you think you bring to the csm because you are not e-famous? 2. while in infensus, you stated you were involved in black ops. was that as an fc or just a regular fleet member? did you maintain your interest in black ops until today?3. you indicated you like exploration. do you run combat sites, or are you attracted more to hacking? also, do you think the rewards for exploration are in a good state?4. you stated you do a bit of industry on the side. as a member of goonswarm, i assume you do this in null sec. what type of industry do you do and do you use citadels?5.you started as a high sec miner and consider that occupation a rut that leads to burnout. do you just consider mining bad, or is it all of high sec?thank you.

"that's not really nice, define ""good candidates"".your twitter page is screaming sadness and childhood suffering. your opinion is irrelevant i will submit to ccp a new lgbt gameplay. still working on it tho"
"thanks for your answers ! as difficult as it might seem, with your generous help, there may be a small chance to make eve online even more awesome than it already is. ccp already got great ideas, like naming after the nicest people in eve some modules like the faction entosis modules. that precise idea might be extended to other modules, and make ccp richer. for example, special namings for other existing faction/meta modules could be auctionned by ccp, helping them to make a lot of money to buy more pizza for the devs & hamsters. you could for example imagine ""$somealliance even awesomer integrated warp core stabilizers"" or named faction snowballs launchers, etc... . you can even imagine alliances auctionning to have some modules, like existing faction strip miners named after other alliances names.for example, wouldn'y you love to see ""aram kachaturian(c) realgood expanded cargohold"" instead of ""'basic' expanded cargohold"" sold on eve markets ?"
this is a brilliant idea, with the only caveat that aram wouldn't want his name on expanded cargoholds. strip miners, maybe?in one of the recent podcasts (i think it was last week's talking in stations), pgl was saying that the csm really was a focus group, and that good csm members were the ones who actually knew their stuff when ccp devs would toss bright ideas at them out of the blue.now it is a fact that, reluctant though they might be to admit it, those who fancy themselves as the new eden trend-setters for everything swag-related actually take their cue from aram. with ccp spending so much time on non-spaceship-related stuff like skins and apparels, it is high time someone like jewnior mcblazing got his rightful place at the csm table.
izi tears from pleb
mike represents the lobbysts who made the mess that is eve today. go back to your abyss demon.
i can understand the problem, but using an elected body like the csm for that just sounds really dumb. i wouldn't expect to have my car fixed by voting for a mechanic. as a sandbox, eve is a society : in a society, elections are a process by which a society which recognizes itself divided, (that is to say crossed by contradictions of interest and which is fixed as modality), to associate in equal parts, each citizen in the expression of these contradictions, analysis of these contradictions and the deliberation of these contradictions, with a view to arriving at an arbitration.my solution seems far easier to my eyes : have ccp earn moor monnies, hire testers, get game fixed and buy pizza for hamsters & devs. i'm sure junior's approach (let's make money first, then hire nice people) could achieve such a result

"if anyone wants to see some of his bright ideas to ""help against large groups"" her you go"
you claim to be against the big guys and for the little guys, yet you argue for proposals that have significant negative impacts on solo/small groups and don't address any of the concerns at all, here:suggestion for csm inspired requirement to post on the forumcynos - it's time to talk about itvalid points have been ignored in favour of entering into bickering debate and disregard for staying on topic.why should we have any belief that you will be able to interact maturely with other csm members and with ccp staff if you can't even address issues in the forum?
there will always be valid points brought up by all sides of a discussion, and this is exactly the side i am coming from that i am defending. unless ccp tells otherwise in the updated white papers soon to be released, i see the csm as an elected lobbyists group. this means differentiated view points, coming from different experiences and play-styles, from which ccp can decide of the best course of action. i do not ignore valid points, i disagree with the validity of *your* points.i would not have put the idea of jumping bridging ship at the end of a bridge if i did not believe it served a valid purpose to clearly indicate to voters where i stand on these kind of issues. i also welcome the new rule for csm candidate and wish it would apply on forums posters in the same way too.now, you not liking my stance simply indicates that you are not going to vote for me. this is fine, i do not believe older players and members of larger groups see the issues the way i see them, not being that old in the game myself and mostly playing solo.
funnily, you also seem to disagree with the validity of all other posts that raise concerns with the proposals.there's not a single concern raised by anyone in those threads that has been acknowledged and accepted as a valid reason to change the proposals to a different position. go figure. it seems, based on the forum posts in those threads, that anyone who has a different view or idea is just not valid.not what we need in the csm for sure.
just wanted to bring attention to this.imminently after the introduction of fozzi sov me and ~10 friends decided we would see if the claims were true and if it meant small groups could take sov. this was one of the changes we imminently supported as with only a handful of guys going around entosising nodes after every troll attempted was burning us out. once we no longer had to worry about them unless there was some one actively trying to take them we were able to go back to enjoying the game.you will see this in a lot of his other posts he seems to have little to no understanding what small groups actually have to deal with and sees everything that may help a large group as some illuminati conspiracy to keep the elite in power.
to counter balance my last post i will try and be helpfulyou want to fix sov and do exactly what you are trying to here?remove sovput 'system upgrades' into new structures independent from an ihub (if you really want to make it hard to hold more systems then you are using make it fuel based and not bill based)and that's all you have to do. you own space simply because you say you do and because you live there and support the infrastructure of the system ps also go with ccps idea that moon mining becomes spawned belts from the drill platform and players need to actively mine it
i just have a few questions i wonder if you wouldn't mind answering.1. you state that we have no idea about the history of the player behind the alt, yet you are running on an alt. how do we know that all the things you are telling us about yourself are true?2. you want to give incentives to players to automatically link accounts. what type of incentives would you propose, given the ability to create an alpha account to link to an omega account to get the benefit?3. you want to have some sort of mission simulator so new players can practice missions. what do you find lacking in inception (aka the new new player experience) that warrants taking such an approach?4. you favor limiting api access. what types of information would you allow the api to access?5. players elected to the csm are expected to support changes that would improve the game, even if the change hurts their particular playstyle. you seem pretty set in your hatred of groups like goonswarm and pandemic legion. would you support changes to the game even if they helped major alliances at the expense of solo players?thank you
i believe the ability to scam, steal, cloaky camp, gank or spy in the game is an activity that is no risks and all rewards, unlike other regular activities, because the other pilots of the player undertaking these otherwise valid options do not suffer any risk to their main isk making assets. for me it breaks the concept of risk vs rewards that eve is all about and that any miner, hauler, trader, missioner or pvper have to face.i started running under an alt to separate my assets at the time from the risk of backlash in-game from opinions that i would carry that i know are not popular among power players, because my campaign is all about curtailing the influence they have on the game, and look at features more from the little guy perspective, solo players or micro-corps. power players do not want change that can trheaten their own assets, like the siphons.at the time, there was no reason for me to not use the means in the game to hide your alts that all other players benefited from, and i had to protect my assets.ccp has put a new requirement that i welcome. i am not the target, those power players that create fake decoy candidate alts to spread out the independent votes for the csm are. my best known alt is borat, and none of my other alts are well known to the community. like i said before, i am a little guy mostly playing solo.as a matter of facts, for those that were curious enough to follow my game blog, i have started to communicate about my alts there. for those that did not pick up on that already, here is a reference link that will tell you more about my main and other alts.
nobody likes a grass steve
if that was meant to be a secret do you think i would have posted it to my own twitter? kek
glad to hear it :) btw i am happy to answer any eve related questions regarding my ideas on any topic in eve. as an alliance exec down to a pvp pve fc or industry. go ahead and fire away.
so, did after all you learned, did you get your revenge on code?
no. i came to terms with my loss as i grew to better understand the game. eventually i even spent time learning to gank with lessons from a few code. folks. the option for revenge is definately there, (anyone familiar with zopiclone's theft of code. assets?) but that's not quite the revenge a lot of gank victims want.
i noticed today your campaign item about cyno inhibitors. as you may have seen, i push a different idea, but we may be sharing some common observations regarding the power of cynos. a player has posted an op on cynos on the forum here.i bleieve you have not seen it yet, as i am sure that as a csm candidate with an item on the subject of cynos, you would have already jumped in the discussion. i would certainly be glad to read about your positions in that area over there.
"hi violentdesire. i think that everyone in the game (and ccp themselves, especially since ccp rise has made jokes about when he joined ccp he was going to fix ecm) knows that ecm is a terrible mechanic with horrible game design. i'm not sure how to completely redesign and change ecm to a different mechanic, it would take a lot of work, words and probably be a jesus level feature from ccp since it's deeply ingrained into the game, and would require the rebalance of 8 caldari ships on top of everything else. some ideas that i would like to push for ecm that don't fundamentally change the ways in which ecm works requiring a complete redesign are as follows;ecm drones - change them to lockbreaker drones. i hate ecm drones i feel like they are by far the biggest offenders for the frustration offered up by getting jammed. i would like them to be changed into lockbreaker drones instead of ecm drones, so that way, they can help you run away from a fight or an encounter, but they wouldn't be ""lol i rolled a 6, i just won this fight"" that they are now for 1v1 and some small gang engagements. they have such a huge randomness delta for such little cost. although this would kill the griffin navy issue and ecm solo pvp (lol) i feel that making ecm non chance based and absolute would also go a long way to improving the gameplay surrounding ecm. i really like this idea from a long time ago, where instead of being jammed 50% of the time, you would just lose 50% of your locks etc. this would improve small gang fights involving ecm a lot."
i feel like pvp use is of the most importance to me, i personally feel like a lot of pve content should be rehashed and redesigned to be more engaging, fun and pvp like. i must admit that i often do not consider pve uses when i talk about ships, mostly because i do not engage in much pve myself and my knowledge is much more limited on that front, but if anyone has any concerns with pve usage of ships i definitely will consider those concerns into proposals and bring them up with ccp. contributer to eve is easy:
"hey there folks. i'd like to officially announce running for csm xii. i'm an industrialist at heart, and have experience in both nullsec and highsec. currently a director in 0.0 massive dynamics in test alliance.i have played eve for just under 2 years. i started in highsec, but soon found my calling in nullsec. first out in tenerifis/immensia, then out in drone space renting with a small group of like minded folks. from there i ended up with 0.0 massive dynamics in fountain, being evicted there we moved to vale of the silent with test. and now we are headed south. i run multiple toons, almost entirely focused on mining, building, and pi. i ran last year for csm xi, on an industry platform. i'm doing the same this year. industry, particularly mining is currently in a good place, though it could use some tweaks in a couple areas. however, my primary focus this year is going to be on planetary interaction, with a secondary of an additional types of battleships and/or battlecruisers.planetary interaction, well its a click fest. i feel like it could definitely be better. the ability to save ""setups"" would be amazing, or to route multiple factories at once. additionally the planets could use a balance pass, so many planets are crap and then so many are great, lets try to balance it out a bit. the ui could definitely use some improvement as well. all in all, honestly the entire pi system could use an overhaul, its needed and has been needed for some time now.now as far as a new type of battleship, i'm thinking a t3 battleship. in the last year we have seen a huge number of frigates added, along with t3d's. but yet nothing above that for subcaps. battleships and battlecruisers have the fewest choices available. why not add to that? a multirole tech 3 battleship could be amazing, perhaps you want a logistics battleship, or perhaps a battleship with extreme long range (200k) but sacrificing tank, or even a brick, 300k ehp but sacrificing damage. or perhaps add another choice to miners, with a mining subsystem. and yes i know that we have the porpoise and orca for battlecruiser/battleship equivalent, but those are still primarily boosters with the ability to mine, that is still less then that of an exhumer. but perhaps a mining battleship-sized ship that does 10-15% higher yield then a hulk. who knows, honestly its a idea in progress. but i do believe that battle cruisers and battleships could use a little fleshing out on the tech tree.at the end of the day, im not looking to only look out for the interests of any particular ""sec"" status group, i want to represent industrialists all over space, from hs, ls, ns, and wh. after all, we are all doing the same activities, the only difference is where and with whom.thank you for reading, and i hope to have your vote when the time comes.terandria"

greetings all,most people refer to me as ariel, a certain aussie colloquialism starting with <U+FFFD>c<U+FFFD> or occasionally the the little mermaid<U+FFFD>most of my eve career has not been particularly memorable. i<U+FFFD>m not in any character bio<U+FFFD>s, not jeered or applauded in any significant circles and my name has never appeared in any previous csm ballot.i have spent a little bit of time in almost every corner of eve. i've been a renter inside the russian bloc swapping rental contracts with whomever was winning the war. i<U+FFFD>ve lived in c4 and c5 wormholes, krabbing and hunting before attempting the lowsec life to go home dejected and poor. i pretended i was top dog killing pos mods in my aeon with pl and when i couldn<U+FFFD>t, sneaking off to read tmc and en24 on the dunny at work. most recently i've putting in the hard yards helping fawlty7 make tikle into a dedicated home for australians.in between all of this meandering i built evemeet with its mastermind bam stroker and proceeded to give my liver cruel and unusual punishment over a two year period with this amazing community.in fact, my only claim to fame is making the holy pilgrimage to iceland, in order to miss a solar eclipse due to alcohol poisoning.all this has taught me that the eve community is a community worth fighting for, a community that has forged lifelong friendships via a beer glass and a passion for internet spaceships.i am running to give back to a community that has given me so much over the years. i bring with me, a wide and storied experience struggling to find a home in eve as a derelict australian and a passion for the community and out of game events.what i stand for is the continuance of ccp<U+FFFD>s increased transparency and communication. greater support for eve related media, meets and events. a productive csm that stays out of the media and a separation of politics from development feedback.in game, having recently taken up the mantle of leading a corporation and assisting in the operations of an alliance, the day to day management leaves much to be desired. whilst the in game tools have come leaps and bounds from their original incarnation, much of the management falls to custom applications, most of which are closed source. while ccp's work on esi has been encouraging, more work should be done to allow these in game tools to supplement more complex custom applications.lastly, i want to fight to clean up the forums, a good jibe or troll is all well and good but continued harassment, inconsistent moderation and player self importance, has meant the forums have been a genuinely horrible place representing only a small slice of the eve population. i am always available for contact @arielrin, or surprisingly enough via evemail<3

i'm sorry did you say things like scams are no risk and all reward? how many scams have you taken part in? i don't even mean high end ones where you invest more than a year of your life. even just the small ones that may involve days of sitting around in jita local.remember isk you are not making is isk you are losing. any scam you partake in risks all the isk you could be making in the time it is taking you to pull off the scam

happy to see wormholes getting some love. it'd be nice to see improvements to c5/6 space to make life in them more attractive. i'd also like to see more love for wormholes through the npe, it was frustrating to see people warning newbros to not enter wormhole space whatsoever and discouraging exploring them. scanning ui getting some love too is great, making it less obtrusive, smoother, and attractive to older players (like myself) who favor the old ui.
que changeriez-vous au sujet du npe?
c'est une bonne question. that's a good questionexpand on the training specifcally advancing the ideas surrounding pvp, ship fitting, and war mechanics.c'est une bonne question. d<U+FFFD>veloppez la formation sp<U+FFFD>cifiquement en avan<U+FFFD>ant les id<U+FFFD>es autour du pvp, de l'armement et de la m<U+FFFD>canique de guerre.ill admit had to translate a few of those so hope it works well
i was wondering if you could answer some questions.1. when you announced your candidacy, you sent out a tweet with a graphic that read, <U+FFFD>aims to bring real combat into wars.<U+FFFD> what did you mean by that? 2. your alliance focuses on bringing alpha players into the game. how well prepared does the inception tutorial make them for flying in your alliance? what do you think ccp should add or subtract to make alphas better prepared for life after the new player experience?3. you stated that one of your aims is to get alphas involved in wormhole combat. what type of challenges does that present since alpha characters cannot fit a cloak?4. it appears you have a lot of experience in public groups like incursion fleets and spectre fleet as a fleet commander. what do you think ccp could do to make the life of someone who organizes and leads public groups easier?5. you stated in your campaign post that you are also an industrialist who runs a modest amount of towers. aside from pos, what are the most painful parts of being an industrialist that you wish ccp would take a look at?thank you

so i want to give defence a reason not only to play the game but to actually win the war. for 3 years i've been in focus groups and conversations regarding the how. so far the changes i would hope for is region based wars, nuetral logi not suspect but criminal tagged and tie the wars to objectives. offence says we will reinforce a structure within the next vulnerability timer if they fail war ends. if they succeed war continues. adding in a diplomatic window for negociating cease fire or war end ... extortion possibility... with various conditions like cant war deck again for x weeks new tutorial is... a work in progress. using polite terms. it lacks any kind of fitting advice beyond fit a scanner. things like resistances buffer vs active tanking. a small tutorial about wars and their mechanics would go a long way. didtch the auto pilot part of the training. its a bad habit to estabilish early on.... we do alot of bait and switch bait people into a fight then pile on with peiple coming from our hole or nieghbor hole. alphas of all ages can do this with ease. though cough alliance bookmarks would help...public groups need a better way to advertize their presence. not sure what this will look like but something maybe simlar to corp adds interface with filters to find the content you want.pi ... id rather cut myself than manage my pi sometimes... expecially when the heat map lies or i have to rebuild the whole setup causs the deposits are no longer in range of my setup
so thee two are connected. for instance allies cant rep each other not due to war mechs but due to crimewatch. tgis is one of many issues between the two mechanicsganking balance is fine as is. with the recent static hull resist bonus its been better for haulers and still plenty of 20b plus kills
you have my bow kind sir o7
on the face of it a balanced proposal with a good idea of the current balance, however what do you mean exactly in terms of overhauling crimewatch, where does the issue actually lie. is it the safety bar which you have an issue with, that is actually something that helps ag players in the very difficult task of anti-ganking which is not exactly fun as you quite rightly pointed out.most players see the mining barges and exhumers as reasonably well balanced because people have an option to take a yield hit to use a tanky ship such as the procurer and skiff, so in affect those people getting blown up in mining ships made choices for yield, which is fine.the issue with the code / miniluv spreadsheet approach rests entirely with freighter ganking, but the issue in that area is more to do with bumping, because they can hold the freighter there indefinitely while assembling a gank fleet, that part of it needs looking at because it is not a dash to see if they can slip through and results in stale uninteresting play. that needs sorting.with the arrival of citadels perhaps now is the time for npc stations to have penalties for the criminal security status.the war dec system is fine, but the fee for very large alliances needs to be reduced, and there has to be restrictions to prevent continuous war decs, but on the other hand i would make the war dec follow a character if he joins any player corp within the week of the war dec applying.i am not in favour of something artificial to fight over but your suggestion of an impact in reducing the war dec time based on activity is a good suggestion the removal of the watch list is a good thing in terms of hisec wars as people can operate off the beaten path. which improves things. i would support the locator agents giving on-line status as people have suggested, however with one proviso, should i have very high standings with those agents corps they also tell me that i am being checked on, everything has to have a risk.it would be good to have a player who while a ganker actually sees the balance side of things, though i would like to see a bit more meat on the bone in terms of proposals. so far i am interested in what you have put up. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp
toxic has my vote.i believe he is going to represent my concerns well.dracthe issues with crimewatch primarily revolve around logistics.i think we can all agree that neutral logi feels like getting bullshitted and no one likes it.it's directly impacted my and many others ability to get a fight because people assume +3 of local will appear in guardians as soon as they commit.for another example , you gain a suspect flag for providing logistics to someone who's war you are allied in, which is extremely unintuitive.in short it's impeding warfare where it shouldn't and needs a good looking at.
ralph, i was never sure whether they fixed it so that you could rep alliance mates which wa something that got my goat when i realised you could not, has that been fixed now, i know ccp said they would, but saying and doing is two totally different things.the neutral rr is better than it was previously, in that now they go suspect, it annoyed the hell out of me when you could not even touch them in the past which is why i never partaked of any hisec combat until that stupidity got removed. i actually suggest to people to have an out of corp wing ready to come in on the neutral rr for when they go fy. if people get off their butt and start dealing with them as they go fy then great. all you have to do is follow certain people around and you can nail them. if some people started doing that it would change the attitude a bit, perhaps i should start doing that, a target does come to mind....i agree the suspect flag for helping someone you are allied with makes no sense what so ever, that needs changing, it would also create more interesting conflict in hisec in my opinion. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp
thanks for saving me from typing out those points about crimewatch and wars ralph. i<U+FFFD>m not quite sure what you mean by safety bar, would you mind elaborating?i don<U+FFFD>t have much an issue with code./miniluv having their math already figured out, it was more just to point out how gankers have got their min-maxing down for ganking to reduce their costs and risk. as for bumping my understanding is the ccp doesn<U+FFFD>t like it in its current form but haven<U+FFFD>t made any progress in their plans to limit the amount of time someone can be bumped while out of combat. even with a change like this, it would just mean gankers would need more disposable ships to hold down a freighter with a point to reset any progress made towards safely warping out, so i don't know how ccp plan to make this work.could you elaborate on why you think this would be a good idea? most popular ganking systems have multiple public citadels that gankers could safely use <U+FFFD> i<U+FFFD>m surprised you wouldn<U+FFFD>t prefer gankers leaving npc stations where anti-ganking forces at least have some chance to intercept them.there has been a bit of discussion in the wardec project about costs for declaring wars, and i<U+FFFD>m inclined to agree with you on that point. i still think there are other issues to explore, such as some that ralph pointed out already. i also worry that giving aggressors a structure that can be destroyed to end the war would have serious repercussions on the wardeccing community as a whole. i<U+FFFD>m sure that some readers might laugh at the concept of this, so let me explain my concern. smaller wardec corporations are generally better at getting defenders to participate in highsec wars than larger ones because they come across as defeatable. when watchlists were removed last year, there was a decline in smaller sized wardeccing entities because hunting for content became more difficult for them, and forcing them to defend structures will only further push them into larger groups or out of wardeccing entirely. at that point it becomes a question of what do the bigger highsec wardeccing and mercenary groups need to do to ensure that they can continue to maintain content for their members? could it lead to them forming the biggest bluest donut possible? could that in turn lead to these larger groups monopolizing highsec wardeccing by knocking over the smaller competitions citadels? would there be fewer wars declared against larger entities and more of a shift towards targeting smaller less capable groups? would this change be more helpful for the average highsec defender or is this change more for bigger groups? i think these are just a few of the questions that need exploring on this idea alone.i<U+FFFD>m also sure some wardeccers would love your suggestion of wars following players who attempt to evade them, but no, i disagree on that point. i<U+FFFD>d rather see reworks to corporations to incentivize players to stay and defend their corporation.
to be honest i don<U+FFFD>t have a lot of meat for the subject of ganking in part because i<U+FFFD>m trying to balance what gankers think ganking should be, what anti-gankers think it should be, and what i think ccp wants it to be. i<U+FFFD>ve been toying with the idea of changing the way that concord works, that instead of nuking a criminal after eventually arriving on scene, that they would simply apply significant damage reduction to that criminal. eventually faction police would arrive and slowly tear them apart, but it could provide anti-ganking players with more ability to meaningfully interfere with ganks as it would take significantly longer to kill someone under the damage reduction. it could also lead to more freedom for gankers to use different ships than just max dps gallente blaster boats or stealth bombers. the biggest downside to this would be that i think it would make ganking more prevalent in general because well tanked, larger hulls would be able to terrorize players outside of largely populated space. my thoughts here are still a work in progress but i<U+FFFD>ve been reaching out to gankers, and soon anti-gankers for their opinions on the subject to hopefully build up some better ideas.thanks for your points; i will update the platform accordingly after work.
safety bar is where you can set your engagement parameters green full safety, you don't attack anyone unless they are suspect, if you are repping someone and they go suspect you stop that rep, suspect allows you to go suspect in such a situation and allows you to enage suspects and have a limited timer and so on. it has made people a lot more sure to do stuff n hisec.the bumping mechanic gives them total strategic control over the situation and enables them to stackup victms, instead of a rush to get on a juicy freighter to gank it, it is just hold it in place and gank at their leisure. without bumping people would take risks to sneak through and it would reward clever play like keeping an eye out for ganks before moving through choke points, it would reward clever players who had their wits about them.if you remove docking rights then it becomes a conflict point, you can as a group start to threaten citadel owners who don't block them from entering, and if they still let them then blow it up, this will create conflict. the gankers will of course put their own up and people will have additional reasons to blow them up. i know of a couple of ganker owned citadels and if people saw this as a value thing to do to make their life more difficult then it would create a new conflict driver.in reality catching gankers as they mass undock and warp to an instra undock is not easy as they use small fast ships, it is like trying to catch them as they mass jump through a gate, the lag can be an issue. many of us wan to see more reasons to have war decs and citadels used by gankers would be a good one.i disagree with a structure that you are forced to defend so we agree, catch the flag type rubbish does not sit in what to me should be a strategy game, i for one would not do it. i have suggested an oa per constellation for a watch list type system of some sort as something to create conflict but the war dec mercs were mainly camping choke points and hubs anyway,. i think raitaru's are too weak, same is true of astrahus, most hisec players have no chance against the mercs or the small corps that attack them, perhaps this will force them to band together so having it as it is no is perhaps a chicken and egg situation for more meaningful hisec entities to form. at the moment most of hisec are one man corps on full avoidance mode, taht does not work going forward and will create change.the suggestion of the war dec following was to get around people closing corps and resetting up as before, the reasons for defending their corp or even go into space require something to defend. an abstract something ion space would not work for me as i would just go play witcher 3 or skyrim or jc to stain. the ec's and citadels could do the business for this as being something to defend. the blanket war decs while silly in one sense don't bother me because they don't hunt, so as i avoid the pipes and hubs when i get a war dec by them it does not matter and the good thing is that more people are doing things in space since the watch lists went, which will get to a balance as people will start hunting again, the change to the loactor agents will push that change.you concord suggestions are interesting, because having larger ships to take benefit from this change would enable people to catch them, add that to the reduction in bumping and we get some fun conflict.thanks for the replies and thinking it through, i often get accused of being against pvp in fact i think ganking adds to the game, i want it to be more of a conflict driver as compared to a certain number of multi-boxers having a massive isk making deal from it and such stale gameplay. i will keep an eye on things but you are looking likely to get my votes. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp
awesome, i'll check it out right now!
very happy to read this....i support you 100%!!! learned lot from youo7
you will get my vote, you on the csm can only be all good
as a long time listener and new member to the eve radio staff, i'd like to say you have my complete support yumene. your dedication to the community shows at eve radio and i believe the traits that make you a good leader at er will make you a fine representative of the eve community as a whole.
i was wondering if you could answer some questions.1. you have captained the pandemic legion alliance tournament team and tournaments are very important to you. serving on the csm might take 2 or 3 hours of your time each day. how would you make time to both serve on the csm and on the pl at team?2. back in 2013, you were involved in the running of pandemic legion<U+FFFD>s rental alliance, brothers of tangra. despite the changes introduced in aegis sov, we still see groups form up rental alliances. do you think rental alliances are a good idea today? and do you think ccp needs to do anything to either help or hinder rental alliances?3. you fly a rorqual. a lot of people consider the ship overpowered. what would you recommend changing about the rorqual?4. you stated that ccp needs to expand the new player experience. what do you think needs to be added in order to make new players more capable of flying alongside pandemic horde or pandemic legion?5. i hear a lot of complaints about the spread out nature of sov fights in the aegis sov system. you like the idea of multiple skirmishes over multiple nodes. what do you think ccp can do to get more players to accept that type of fight?thank you
1) finding time for things i am involved in has never been a problem for me. if time was an issue i would put csm duties first.2) i personally think rental alliance are great. there are three factors behind this. first being they provide isk income to the rental alliance that own them. second they provide an area for people to move out to null sec. in my rental days i have seen a lot of hi-sec / low-sec players look to renting space as a way to jump start their null sec experience, whether it be mining, ratting, or pvping. third it is also great for the pvpers who like to roam and hunt for miners and ratters. 3) i love the the rorqual this is true. due i consider this ship overpowered? i would have to say yes and no. the most overpowered part of the rorqual that needs changing is 100% what people call jump hictors. i agree that being invulnerable and still tackling supers at the same time is broken.4) i believe that alphas should be able to fly every race. to me race locking them must be no fun for the alpha pilot, if they every wanna fly a different race ship they have to create a new character.5) this is a tricky one i dont really have a solution at the moment . that being said i do thing aegis sov is better than all the previous sov systems we have had before, it just needs to be improved some how.

this is a question of interpretation, i joined in 2009 and i think hisec is a lot more dangerous then it was then, also there are no safe spaces in eve, hisec is not safe, you fly a freighter with over 1bn of cargo, you fly haulers and transport ships with cargo, you fly covetors hulks, macs and retreivers and ventures and you will find out just how unsafe hisec really is.of course there is more to it, i spent the majority of my time in 0.0, your suggestion of a focus group to discuss this is a good start, but if you fill it with htfu players only then it is going to be a typical echo chamber of stupidity, where all you want to do is reduce reasons and rewards to be in hisec which will force people from the game rather than force them out of hisec. also you think that these players are monolithic, well many of us, base in hisec, but also operate in wormholes and low sec and even npc null, how do you know that they are always in hisec?i went back to basing in hisec because afk cloaky camping allied to massive drops bores me to death, i have proposed a fix in the features and ideas for this, with an afk flag using an oa structure that applies after an hour of inactivity and that flag will go with any interaction on the client, also a probe that will identify the grid of a cloaked ship, so intelligent people can hunt them. the watch list removal though a good idea removed vital intel from the prey, while the arrival of skill injectors enabled players to create clean cyno alts which again does not help, all the intel used by the prey got removed so the balance is out of kilter. there are other steps that may need to be taken, but trying something that adjusts the intel balance back would be a good start.smaller alliances get a taste of this negative 24/24 7/7 area denial and get fed up and head back to hisec, i have seen it happen, yet many of them want to be in 0.0. you can bluster about safe spaces and carebears and all that, but why should they be forced to engage in such goddam awful play by pushing them out of hisec. i suspect you will just blame it on their attitude and suggest they go to wow, when many of them would quite like to earn isk and fight roaming gangs and do sov war. blocked: teckos pech, sonya corvinus, baltec1, shae tadaruwa, wander prian, daichi yamato, jonah gravenstein, merin ryskin, linus gorp
"he has no idea about the community as a whole, due to his inability to communicate past using expletives and racist/homophobic retorts to people. looking at his twitter account will get you that far into seeing he has little care for ccp and/or eve online past trolling and complaining. this is not rumor milling it is verifiable there if you look, and he has been banned from twitter for said things.as to phasing out charities i can agree to that if they are not run by ccp like plex for good, there is to much risk that they may be abused or misused. high-sec is another monster that in your own post you bring zero ideas forward as how to fix the problem. past hoping to get with leaders to get ideas which if you dont have any of your own why should we vote for you? if you are going to run for something on platform about working with people, and yet alienating everyone around you with #heatfleet is counter to everything your post is about. you have not posted anything about your ideas or things you are going to push for in game past making it ""less safe and overly friendly"".you also attack the very people you will need to be working with in order to help change things in eve. no matter your opinion you will have to work with them, and your campaign thread attacks them making that much less likely they will look at any ideas you or people send to you for support."
not sure how i would feel voting a guy into a community position that purposefully and actively trolls and pokes fun at other members of the community. this is a guy who gladly and openly laughs at the idea of people attempting suicide, stating that he wishes they had done the world a favor and just killed themselves. hardly seems like the kind of person you would want representing the player base.whole heartily do no endorse this candidate.
