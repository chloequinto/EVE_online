"events? hell yeah."
"i got an email this morning. it was from a mmo i play a bit and it was telling me about their exciting new live in game events structure. about how the game benefits from something a bit out of the ordinary, something to draw people together, something to change the dynamic from the familiar to the new. this game was war. this email made me sad. war has live in-game events. eve doesn't. it made me die a little inside. so yes i support it. although the no flashy uberpwnage loot thing gets extra marks from me."
"first off, elohel roleplayers.second, i actually agree. ccp seems to have lost their nerve when it comes to letting players be involved in storyline events, and for those who choose to involve themselves in the backstory its a pity that they're cut off from the opportunity to take part. the lack of player-story interaction is probably understandable given past events within ccp, but if the 'prizes' are kept to a sensible level (i.e. no more giving away free motherships in an event taking place in a particular 0.0 alliances back yard), internal affairs is involved, and ccp can get a competent team to work on the events (and that means people who, amongst other things, can react to unexpected outcomes and smoothly incorporate them into the storyline) then i can only see this as being a positive suggestion.so yes, this is a goon supporting a jade post (i'm probably going to be kicked now)."
"ccp, grow a pair and bring back in-game events anyone who has ever been part of one of these event will have a hard time forgetting them.it is a shame that newer players are missing out."
"blessed off ^_^ this also ties into npc corporaiton lay-offs not to shamelessly plug."

"i have to travel a lot, sometimes to remote places. 4 more than 1ns, i was coght b real wars going on. wen i get the chance to get to a pc, the server was down. lol. or my account... so, by the order of ideas of pipls that defend ccp, during dt, no training ! during exteeeeeeeended dt's no training !! ...and wen serves frick out like last time, few days ago: no bloody training 4 anyone !!!(?)cmon!!! get real..."
"oh, by the way; wen we r not loged? should we b skilling?^^"
"if you support this idea, it looks like your friendliest candidate is garion avarr."
"i have often wondered this myself. apparently, the high-security groups (faction navies, concord, customs, etc) won't set foot there, yet we still have to 'pay' them (using charters) for nothing. signed."
"pretty sure this has something to do with 0.4 usually being right next to hi-sec."
"and?"
"you do realize all npc corps will forever be kos in my vision for the future right?but back on track, i really don't see any reason why 0.4 is any different than 0.3. **** proximity to highsec. all that does is make it a battlefield over resources if it is ever fixed. more pew pew = more fun."
"how do i get close enough to my target then, to use my blasters and my slow as hell (drone carrier nerfed, by the way) drones? i need a mwd, im already loosing tanking and cap to use it. ill end up being blown to bits, wile my caldari opponent sits relaxed spaming local selling crap, making entire eve universe an imensse jita, as im still out of range, in my pod!i need as well my implant slots and rigs for other things, like armore, that collaterals speed... nanos i only use in unfavorable zones, to avoid fights.if a cadari wants to catch me, he should be able to loose is tanking to fit webs, as im not fitting tank coz im using nanos. also, he should use their drone bay once in a wile, not only 4 mining!light scout drones r fast and thers also web drones. most of caldari ships have drone bay. use them!doing something with nanos should b something like using cpu and power greed; if u use it, less resources for guns, or even removing tham from game would b bether than cutting of everything abt speed.even bether would b creating counter mesures, like appends in nature.if a species develops a determent advantage, the other should countermeasure it. u guys create the rouls, now deal with it.sincerely, the fox become faster than the rabbit...natures reply:\"ups, lets shop of its legs\"meh, if nerfing goes, at least increase my drones engagement speed, speed bonuses of some races speed specialized and the ability to shoot down missiles!"
"the whole nano-nerf is a massive overreaction to a small problem (that ccp caused ) that could easily be solved with a few gentle tweaks.sadly, the people at ccp who have invested so much time in developing the game and working with its community seem to have moved onto ccp's new project, and the new team in control of game development do not appear to have any respect for the game, its history or its player base.i truly hope that ccp can pull something out of the bag to save this great game."
"i stands to reason that a larger ship is harder to cloak than a smaller one, but the current non cov-ops cloaks use a smallish fixed amount of cpu.if there was also a percentage of total cpu used, it would make them harder to fit, with out disadvantaging smaller ships. the balancing team would have to do the exact calculations, but between 2.5% and 10% cpu reduction for having a cloak fitted is what i think is sensible.if local gets a nerf, then so should non cov-ops cloaks."
"i think it would be a cool feature to be able to change a charakters facial expresion, like eyes, smile, position of the face, lighting, background, for free, it would be a cool game feature, allowing to show some emotion in the char picture and in the game. is this something that could be implemented. i know you can change char faces for a fee, but i just think it would be cool if it was a feature you could set up from the char selection page in game, allowing people to express themselves visualy in time of war or peace, or any other reason."
"i've often wondered about having the characters portraits become more dynamic. how about allowing changes within a certain percentage each time a new clone or clone jump occurs? the idea behind allowing only a minimal change would be to discourage people from completely changing their character pictures in one fell swoop."
"i agree with skunk.they also need to make the blockade runner have some effect that includes sparkles and hearts glittering off of it. when it does the wormhole thing it should look like a big pink shining heart that as the br disappears turns into a blinding white light, kinda like 'judgment'. so if your watching it you get that feeling like you've been shafted cause some1 pushed the i-win button."
"i think blockade runners should have 100% resists to all, be able to jump to anywere within eve(even jove space!) with no fuel or cyno needed. be able to carry 101010101030249024m3 of stuff too!/flame offthe changes put forward in the blog are going to go a long way to fixing them. they should be pretty untouchable if the changes go ahead."
"skunk troll mission: success!"
"the main problem with this idea is that people have to train for literally a couple of weeks and put upwards of 45-50m isk for a blockade runner. limiting such in indispensible service to the elite of eve with over 3m sp and 50m isk in hand will stop any new subscriptions ever, and will cause 90% of the population of hi-sec to immediately quit.please rework your proposal to work with velators."
"it's cheaper to grab a blockade runner with cloak then it is to grab a freighter (ie: fenrir/nomad).and definitely less time consuming than training jump freighters.i think its worth the risk.... i also think this topic is a joke.but oh well."
"jesus i'm glad someone else agrees with me on this. alright ccp you had a great idea when you made blockade runners able to jump to black ops cynos, but why would you give them the cov ops cloak.you are giving them the exploit of the microwarp+cloak, and now you're giving them invulnerability in a giftbasket. this is an incredibly stupid idea. can you rationalize why a ship that when well-fitted can beat a heavy interdictor camp needs the cloak that lets every recon and cov ops get through?"
"i see it was just as easy to forget the agility nerf they get. decloak them, scram them, kill them.but the low sec pirates prefer to whine they cant catch unarmed industrials."
"good idea. i'll just decloak, lock and scramble a br in the ~3 seconds it takes a properly fitted one to warp post-nerf."
"wow: 74 units in attack of the drones, 2-10-12-14 in infiltrated outpost, 4-6 in rogue drone harassement; 7 mission against 34, 122 units, an average of less than 4 units for mission. another 2 drone mission and i will be capable of building a cerberus. i am crashing the economy."
"people with too much isk and not enough fun stuff to do... who else ? there could be limitations, like, say, you need sov 3 for that option to become available, and you can have at most one \"donated\" outpost per constellation and at most 3 to 5 per region (or, even only one donated outpost per region), the npc you donate to must be on \"friendly terms\" with the resident npcs (except in the drone regions, obviously, where you could just donate to anybody) and so on and so forth."
"aka griefers"
"wasn't eve all about \"griefing\" anyway ?"
"thing is, an outpost doesn't just require isk, it also requires you to be a sovereignty-holding alliance with a serious logistical train backing you up. i can see a player burning billions for a laugh, but a whole corp or alliance? it'll only get used in cases of security breaches, by an intruder/spy looking to amputate one of their target's biggest assets. much as i think the game should make room for griefers and spies, you shouldn't hand them devastation on a silver platter."
"well, the outpost retains as a npc station pretty much all the functionality it already had, it's just that everybody can use it afterwards, not just the original owner.i wouldn't exactly call it \"devastating\", more like \"somewhat annoying\".and after it becomes a npc station, everybody else in the game gets a place to have a \"pitstop\" in that constellation/region, not just the powerblocs normally controlling that space.personally, if i would be a defending alliance about to be overrun, i would consider donating the outpost to the npcs just so i can have a \"fallback\"/\"staging area\" for retaliation, but at the same time realize it's going to do the same if the tables are turned, and there's no reversing of this process.it probably won't get used that much, but when it will be used, you can bet player influx (especially neutral player influx) will be significantly increased in the future."
"actually, if you got even a single half-decent level iv agent, it would be an outrageously profitable deal.spend 35b or so to create an outpost in some remote, easily defendable but otherwise worthless -0.17 sec system, and then rake in the sweet, tasty rewards from running pirate missions in relatively safety.an alliance would make back the cost of the outpost in a couple of days. and have a totally secure base of operations to fall back to if invaded.if this idea were implemented, we'd see outposts being created at a fantastic rate in low-truesec space. i'm almost tempted to support it as the \"cure\" for the lack of carrying capacity in 0.0 but for the fact it's simply overpowered and inflationary."
"yeah, my vote 4 it.also rigs 4 other than sentry drones.and please: dont u nerf them in the future,wen caldari starts whining again !!!(geeeeesh...)"
"supported"
"please visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"so what you're saying is to force people who might have no interest at the time into pvp where they can get griefed by the veteran players, or to create their own corp so they can wander the galaxy with nobody to talk to. sorry, i disagree.if you don't like players in npc corps, show them that your corp is better by appealing to their interests, not by forcing the rules of the game to change to suit your attitudes. i can't say this is the first thread of this type in this forum, nor the fifth, but it depresses me to hear so many people mad that some players actually like helping newer players."
"npc corp shouldn't be a perfect way to avoid pvp, consequences of your actions, etc..supported."
"not sure if this is the right answer, but npc corps is one of the biggest problems in eve and needs to change."
"how does it \"punish\" the legitimate players?"
"forcing you in a war you don't want or to form a 1 man corp is not punishment for you?ant then there is is the usual false excuse \"it will flush out macrominers\" when it will do nothing like that as they will simply create some shell corp and switch when wardecced."
"what about when it becomes an exploit the other way? it would be very easy to use this mechanic to just grief the extremely small character corporations out of eve. just war dec small and one man corps you know can't afford it. then they try to form a new corp with the time they are in an npc one. but as soon as they do, war dec them again. rinse, repeat several times and they eventually stop trying and our forced to go join another player corp that is established, which comes with responsibilities and demands they most likely do not want. or quiet eve, because who wants to play a game where your forced to play another drone in the corporate bee hive?any mechanic you introduce to eve can be exploited in one way or the other. and introducing one like this to merely satisfy the hard core pvp minded would be a grave error given the larger implications of how it could be abused to easily."
"there are a number of *casual* players who find the npc-corps a perfect fit for how they play the game. i'd have to disagree with forcing these players into a war-dec situation when they have no interest in that.if you want someone to shoot-at, get your butt to low-sec or 0.0 and start locking horns ... griefing solo characters in npc-corps with an organized gang of veteran players hardly seems like the type of fight worthy of your skills."
"npc corps arent one of the biggest problems in eve... there are alot more bigger problems. while it is somewhat of an issue it isnt as big of an issue as you proclaim.the idea proposed wouldnt help fix the macro miner problems. they would just form their own corperations... its easy enough these days and doesnt cost much at all."
"it is just flat freaking too easy to war-dec people.you got a paradox here folks.on one side you have the ability to war-dec \"at-will\" with a fee and no more than 24 hours notice.after which people can freely attack and exploit the weakness's of said victim or vice versa.should the ransom be paid and or terms met.... there's yet an another 24 hour period... and its over..... or is it?there is absolutely no way to prevent the war-deccor from war-dec'ing the corp once again....there's no penalty... there's no cool down period (longer than 24 hours which is nothing as during that period nothing stops them from attacking anyway).so this drives home the fact that players jump to npc corp's to avoid the war-dec.it's not because they don't like it... its because you force them to play a stupid game that they have no way of winning... let alone resolving within reason.contrary to popular opinion... while some of you guys are honorable enough to honor ransom's... there are corps out there that do nothing but war-dec and greif 24/7 non stop.add to that the ability to stack war-dec's... multiple odds.the war-dec fee is easy to pay off... no matter the cost (other than obvious limitations and rational there)on the other side you have people who hide and intentionally avoid in acts of cowardice.... jumping back and forth.the idea is flawed...and aimed at the wrong target. the problem is not the system... its the people who abuse it./me thumbs downcome up with a better solution... and you'll get more support.honestly the trouble starts at the root cause of what makes people do this.... the war-dec system is flawed and needs to be fixed.then you can worry about the npc exploit of jumping ship.even then... petitioning ccp for such actions typically resolves in a favorable solution i'm told.don't torture the legitimate npc players who solo it for the fun of being able to abuse the freedom of war-dec.i'm not against war-dec'ing... i'm against the exploitable nature of it."
"as i said, the optional part is allowing player corporations to 'grief' the non-player corporations. eve online is a community, with personal interactions, if you want to play solitare, thats fine, but i fail to see how logging into a multiplayer game to sit by yourself can bring about any enjoyment. also, the very idea of npc corporations not going to war seems counter to the eve back stories and how the game is progressing. while i have no wish to punish people in npc corporations who want to work by themselves, i also want to encourage people to join player corporations and help progress eve as a whole, instead of ideally sitting in jita. faction warfare has helped a little in this, allowing normally peaceful 'carebears' the opportunity to jump into a ship and start warring on another faction. this would be an extension of the faction warfare, but would bring the safety, and general nervousness of eve back. in eve's glorious past it was a terribly crushing blow to lose a battleship, with numerous people working toward the creation of one. now titans fall from the sky (example bob and their *fleet* of titans.) theres no more risk to eve and makes it very boring. this idea is to bring back that which eve has lost. if your minmatarr and want to mine, mine near rens, caldari near jita. however, if you want to mine on someone else ore (minmatar going to amarr for example) there should be some risk of an attack from the rival empire. (as a side note, this would require plag being removed from amarr/caldari states as well as pyro, if any systems exsist, being removed from minmatar and gallente.)macromining, coupled with lvl 5 missions in high sec, and the mineral resources being poured our of the drone systems, has cause the prices of minerals to drop heavily. add to this the amount of isk in circulation, and the fact that most people 'hide' in empire, eve has lost the risk that it once had, and which made the game great in my opinion. the bob titan loss is the most blatent example of the excess that has become eve, the fact anyone can lose two titans in two days should be a wake up call that eve has gone too far into excessive, and needs to be rung back in.** editted to include the effects of the macrominers"
"except your forcing people into either a permanant war dec, or a 1 man corp with no-one to talk to and the risk of war decs. forcing people to make 1 man corps to get out of fw is forcing people to fly solo, especially if they are traders with no combat skills. so your removing player interaction. yes, by forcing them to either pvp or move into 1 man corps. for traders, pvp isn't an option. yes, because we want to pvp. not because we are forced to. well you are going to make eve less safe for traders. so ?they will be uneffected because they are already in player corps, and this idea only forces people to move into themor just make a 1 man corp, and go wherever you feel like.macro miners will not be effected in any significant way from this as all they need to do if form a corp. so stop talking about them as if they justify it.remember when we had npc produced shuttles ?they were removed because people were buying them to reprocess for trit, thus providing an upper limit to trit prices. so stop making claims without providing evidenceso, despite the only change in empire being an increase in suicide ganks, you claim that it has gotten safer ?so go propose something that will actually effect them.i see that you aren't reading the posts that are opposed to you."
"also, forcing people to make 1-man corps means an increase in the number of corps. meaning more corp names get taken."
"again, there's no fun in a one man corporation, and eve has *always* been a safety in numbers game.and while yes, there is the risk of always being in a war dec'd state, thats always been the enjoyment of eve. whats the point in working on something, if theres no risk involved? i think you're obsessing on people making one man corporations. lets take for example one npc corporation. they have 1000 members. these 1000 members are all haulers/miners/'carebears' for a lack of a better word. they have two options, stay in minmattar space, where minmattar authroities will help protect them, or risk going to jita. concord has been, historically, the all reaching, and over powered protection force from outside invasion and pirates. however, there are police forces for every race. if a gallente ship flies into caldari space, the caldari navy should react. this still allows for the safety of home world systems, while still putting a risk factor on trading, especially near the border towns (0.5/0.6) that run the risk of being invaded. the navy forces of the other races obviously shouldn't be over powering, like concord, but should allow some npc assistance to the citizens of their realm.for example:i'm mining in hek, which is relatively close to caldari space. a caldari fast attack team, with a handful of frigates and a few cruisers attacks hek in an attempt to disrupt minmatar trading. while transports try to scurry as fast as they can back to docking range, the minmatar navy reacts by sending out a few npc ships to counter the attack. in this example will use 1 republic typhoon and 3 republic stabbers. if the attacking team can survive the first wave, then they're given 5 minutes or whatever to continue their attack. each successive wave of attack is met with a larger and larger force until the threat is destroyed, or they leave the system. concord reacts the same way with pirates. i've seen pirates successfully fly through .5 systems in a ship as big as a cruiser, with concord chasing them from point to point.as far as your other arguing points: macromining does cause an increase in mineral availabilty. macrominers, at least from the understanding that these forums have shown, and which ccp has reacted to based on that, are not wanted in player corporations. macrominers may adapt to making their own one man corporation. but if they do, then they're able to be killed even in the relative safety of high sec space. (one mines, one hauls) the melties from a level 5 increase the mineral availability, as well as lp pay outs. in one lvl 5 mission you can get 60k lp two missions and you almost have enough for a cnr which runs about 200mil, plus the bounties on the rats you killed, and anything named that might have dropped. suicide ganking has actually not been allowed. its been removed if anything by concords reaction time, and anyone dealing with incident is also targetted by concord. also, everyone has a freighter nowadays because the availability of isk is so rampant you'd be silly to fly in a suicide filled world, with anything less. and finally, eve is unsafe. it always should be, and there should always be a risk to everything. suicide ganking is silly, but a possibility. through your arguements we should have golden elevators that go from the far reaches of space to jita. how is that any fun? with the introduction of jump freighters we're almost to that point. here would be the benefits to this:*trading would become alot more profitable, due to the higher risk.*races would still have a 'home base' in their race's home systems where they would be secure*rens, primbeka, and whichever gallente hub is still used would come back into vogue, with traders who wish to remain safe would start to trade back into their home system instead of exporting to jita. *a lucrative market would take place with interracial trading, and the adoption of 'protection' corporations."
"and i don't want to change player corporations or bob i want to remove the flooding of low cost minerals that are allowing player corporations with an excessive amount of money to become overly powerful, while also making eve a more interactive game with risks and enjoyment, and not people just trying to make money."
"and just as a side note about the op:i'm not a warrior. i fly haulers, transports and fly hulks. i *can* also occasionally find myself in a bs but without shields. i enjoy the trade aspect of eve and would like to see it get better, but npc trading is useless, and mining is about as useless due to macrominers able to drain a belt in a day, or lvl 5 mission runners melting down items for more trit then can be found in a pile of veld. this idea was put forth with the intention to make eve more in-tune with the idea of faction warfare, and allowing it to go back to its roots of hostile corporation market wars and in space fleet battles. 0.0 is nice for that, but the vast majority of the people in eve are within empire, and don't take any risks and just get big, fat and lazy. i didn't expect there would be a lot of support for this idea, as most people don't play eve anymore for enjoyment, just the ability to trade out isk for gtc for $$$."
"short and sweet:have the option to have the pos shields activate based on a standings check box. make the password mechanism optional."
"or you could just try doing a better job of keeping the password secret, so that spies can't get hold of it."
"what's wrong with clicking on your speed bar to set your speed whilst aligned?"
"if you don't have a very precise mouse..... your not going to get the exact same speed every time.specially if your in a hurry.it's better to have a default speed... specially when dealing with fleet ops.this way the fleet will move at the exact same speeds (well as much as they can as some aren't as fast as others)i get what your saying... but there's a logical reason for it."
"noseriously nostill noeve is an mmorpg, not an rts for the fc."
"here's an idea, why not start with half-baked ideas in the right forum for them?"
"you will always only ever get back the ship and modules that were destroyed. it is imposible for them to give you back the modules that was droped due to them haveing no way to tell if they were or were not looted(they have to assume it was looted). while you may not have been able to get your wreck back to server issues you did have other ways to go about it. if you had bm's the wreck(you can warp in with ur pod and not get agro) and cancle the mission you can still warp to it and grab the wreck and loot. basicly their hands are tied."
"i recently was congratulated in my corp forum for having reached a level 5 militia rank so soon after joining fw. it felt good to have worked fairly hard to achieve that rank so quickly and to have been recognized for it, but the feeling of pride that i had soon evaporated. i began to question what good it did to have worked for that rank. i had for a while checked the ranks of all the known figures in my militia and been impressed with a few of them, but soon noticed that such feats were never taken into regard during the formation and operation of militia fleets.the questions that eventually formed in my mind were: what rewards await those who achieve the highest ranks in their militia? and more importantly, how does a militia benefit from having high ranking officers?really, the last question is what i want to deal with most. what good is it having ranks when they are not taken into consideration during militia activities? i feel that fleet game play should reflect the idea that high ranking officers should somehow inspire those in active fleets when going into battle, but i feel the role that fleet/wing/squad commanders play in fw fleets undermines such a system.so how do we make faction rank fulfill this role without undermining the fleet command system already in place? i have a suggestion.does anyone remember the old ps1 rts game \"warzone 2100?\" one of the best rts games ever, in my opinion, because of the very original focus the game had on unit customization and squad organization.anyway, one of the more useful ideas in that game was the ability of specific units to gain rank as they did more killing, which gave them individual bonuses and squad bonuses. thus, keeping high ranking units alive (no easy feat) became a useful stategy.i feel that such a system could work for fw. characters that gain rank by performing service for their militia will in turn actually benefit their militia by adding bonuses to all militia members they fly in an active fleet with.i have no suggestions as to what such bonuses should be, but higher ranks should obviously grant better bonuses, and the bonuses should not be stackable (i.e. only the one highest ranking officer in any fleet should grant their bonuses), except with fleet/wing/squad command bonuses. also, an officer's bonuses should only apply to his fleet/militia members on grid with him. thus, if the officer leaves the field, the fleet loses his bonuses (though the next highest ranking officer's bonuses would apply). this places incentive upon keeping officers alive, and upon making them primary targets, such as in real warfare.really, i've only been playing the game in depth for a few months, so i have no real suggestions as to how such a system should work in great detail. really, what i want the cosm to think about is making faction rank more important to the entire fw system. i feel that this kind of model would simultaneously give ranks a place in fw and provide a model for \"inspiration\" that officers should show their militia."
"*is luminaire general and divine commodore myself, for the record*anyway, i've already put the lack of factional warfare goals and focus on the agenda, and i think fleet bonusses for ranks are an excellent idea so i'll include this in the discussion if possible. however, according to ccp, fleet bonusses are a major cause of lag in large battles, so i don't see this happening.however i will try to push for more meaningful factional warfare mechanics as well as rewards for undertaking militia personnel."
"you sound like a dissatisfied customer and should quit.when you use words like \"strong-arm\" over a user liscense agreement- well, i just think you have some serious issues.it seems that people in this forum don't agree with you- check your vote column.the more you try to justify your point- the more you seem to have lost your mind. really, it's sickening."

"its the internet, things go wonky at times, they only way you should ever get reimbersed is if you can prove that you are loged on 23/7, which isnt going to happen.if you go by this same thinking you should only pay for the time you log on. while this is subscription option on some mmo's in asia it hasnt been popular in western places. it can also be restricting to who can play as you often need a credit card.while people will always want more than they are given companies will not want to give more than they have to."
"\"serious issues\" eh? that's quite a weighty suggestion - do you mean like some sort of grave mental illness, or perhaps some kind of history of abuse? i'm just wondering where you go from reading a view that you disagree with, that your read about in a few posts from a stranger on a forum, to speculating about grave, deep problems that the person himself might have? it seems quite a dramatic leap. the other option is of course, that you lack the skills and civility to engage in respectful discussion among adults over issues where viewpoints may differ. sitting in front of an mmmorp for hours on end pew-pewing can definitely help one's brain atrophy in this regard. and do you really find it \"sickening\"? really? let me get this straight, you read a post suggesting that consumers should get the full time of what the pay for, and it made you ill at the thought of it? i mean i get sickened too, but it's usually from something like thinking about darfur, or getting food poisoning. i don't get physically ill when i encounter people seeking redress for something. i mean you must just collapse in convulsions when standing in line and overhearing other customers at the store or at the dmv. no wonder you furtively play mmo's and post instead - you poor fragile soul!shakari - fair points and i didn't realize that in asia they already have some kind of system like this. it is true that the nature of the consumer is to want more, and for the company to always want to provide as little as they can get away with. i'm just wondering if perhaps, given outages for which we don't get time credit, compounded with the recent hike in gtc price, along with the bait-and-switch of \"power of two\" followed by ghost-train nerf shortly afterwards, ccp is recently making moves towards trying to get away with quite a lot. they make such strides pretty successfully in part because they have enough fans who scream \"eula!\" and try to ridiucule any dissent on the forums."

"dj, the flaw with your request is that eve rarely suffers unscheduled downtimes. your example that games such as wow offer reimbursement fail to mention that those same games suffer more unscheduled downtimes. so eve goes down for a hour, you want a free hour? you've seen the numbers, that hour of your time is worth so little on a individual basis it's not worth the time to try and get it back. on the other hand, if ccp were to issue a free hour to every subscriber, that amount then adds up. this is lost profit for them, and if it is great enough it will result in less money going back into the game. yep...less money going in, more problems, less people to fix it.i agree that lost time should be reimbursed in an ideal world, however i don't feel that every extra minute of downtime, or the random server crash once every other month is really worth getting worked up over. just remind yourself that ccp has staff on hand at all times to take care of the server just in case it does go down, and they get it back online as quickly as they possibly can.think of it this way. i have satellite tv, so when a bad snow storm comes around and knocks out my signal for the night, do i call up directv and tell them i want $1 back for the lost time?"
"now this i like. can we get the csm to do this for every thread that they take on?"
"not too sure about this one, but a search feature would be nice. /signed"
"why not? look at the ships page, say - would you prefer the order of capital industrial ships, battlecruisers, destroyers, heavy assault ships, etc., or the order of assault ship, battlecruiser, battleship, black ops, etc.? i know which one i find easier to navigate. and yes, this page needs a better search function."
"personally in some ways i dont care... i like killing anyway i can get it. but for the sake of faction i do agree that something has to be done to better the mechanics of it. i think it is a great learning experience for players for pvp and have seen it dwindle to nothing in the last few months. i hate to see the game go to just missioning, mining and pirate kills... i think that will bore new players and eventually give me less to kill."
"[x] the ninja salvager should not be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged.though i have lost many a wreck to the ninja salvager, i just chock it up to the cost of business. have i ever ninja salvaged someone else? nope. that all said, i would rather not see it changed for the following reason. it is salvage not loot. one of the oldest international laws in the world is the law of salvage. per the cornell university law department:salvage is the reward given to persons who voluntarily assist a ship or recover its cargo from impending or actual peril or loss. to make a valid claim of salvage, a claimant must prove: the event involved a ship and its cargo, or things committed to and lost at sea or other public, navigable waterways; the ship or its cargo have been found or rescued; the service performed by claimant must have been of benefit to the property involved in the rescue.a salvor (one who salvages) must have the intent and capacity of committing a salvage, but need not have the intention of keeping the property. the salvor need not have even given physical assistance to the rescue of the ship or property: in a recent new york case, a ship's captain's decision to keep his ship nearby in case a distressed ship needed help was considered sufficient to support a claim of salvage.yes there is a risk that someone will come in and salvage a wreck you have killed. this is eve, it is a pvp game and nothing is 100% safe."
"actually, i take this a bit further. one of my ideas was to have anybody entering the mission area (if it's a deadspace mission) to be aggroed immediately to the mission runner and his fleet. this sets up an opportunity to counter the damage before it's done, with the subsequent risk of the pve-setup ship being taken out by a pvper.for story purposes, the agent has taken control of that task (eliminating the pirate scum) from concord, and passes that right onto the mission-runner. if invaded, the mission runner does not have to fire, but can do so if he wishes without concord intervention."
"i quite agree, which is why i feel that the 'ninja salvager' should be aggro'd to the mission runner -- otherwise ninja salvaging in 100% safe."
"[x] ninja salvager should not be aggoed. who finds things in space owns them. while there is a name on a can, there is nothing on a wreck. the beachcombers have been living of wrecks in the times before spaceflight and the same are living on. the salvage materials that are coming from wrecks are an important part of the economy. to make that illegal will harm the economy for many missionrunners let rot their wrecks unused. it's a simple question of tradition. to make it illegal makes no sense for me. and to work as a ninja salvager might be not require as much skill as running level four missions in battleships but is a fair income for the poorest of the poor. for this kind of salvage needs a lot of patience. and it's working class style and a bit dirty. don't make them criminals."
"that's not true, according to zulupark. let me quote his huge answer post:so ccp is already aware about the problems.also, are battleships really supposed to be able to hit smaller ships? battleships aren't supposed to be solo pwn mobies."
"let me remind everyone what the rules are:why then am i seeing eight issues listed on the thread and only one (my live events doc) submitted to the mailing list by the deadline?because having a meeting with only one issue on it is going to be a bit absurd - i'm going to extend the deadline for documentation until 18:00 hours today saturday 1st november,after which any issue that does not come with appropriately filled out documentation submitted to the csm mailing list is getting kicked off the agenda."
"i can't tell, since i can only see 7.well, all my issues submission templates were mailed to the mailing list. they are even right here in this thread. i was delayed 3 hours due to danish trains being late all the time, but they *are* there."
"ank's issue in the post above yours makes 8.well, all my issues submission templates were mailed to the mailing list. they are even right here in this thread. i was delayed 3 hours due to danish trains being late all the time, but they *are* there.i have no documents from you. and no, links to threads in the assembly hall do not count as completed issue templates as required inputs for csm discussion."
"your post just says templated form. it doesn't say in file format. what is the difference if it's a link or clear text? it's just a get request difference. so i'm sorry(not really) that i'm not following the \"rules\", which obviously weren't in place around last meeting. last time all my issues were submitted on the forum. but you seem to have changed this.eventually people should read the submission template in context, i.e the forum thread."
"they were past the deadline, you didn't put them in an attached doc to the mailing list. you didn't tell me you intended to put the text straight into assembly hall threads.now, i'm having a busy month charlie (i guess we all are) but i'm still taking my csm duties seriously until completion. when i finish up the agenda i want to look down this mailing list and see an issue doc for each raised issue so i can check them over and be prepped for voting. i don't want to be navigating through links and multiple threads and having people submitting this stuff in a dozen different places and formats.if you want to propose that we all switch issue submission formats and all use a uniform system of pasting the text straight into threads then feel free to raise it at a meeting and lets get everyone onto the same page at least.until then, please do what i asked and respect the system we've had in place thus far that makes organizing these things possible in a timely fashion."
"yes, by 3 hours. can we move on from that already? **** happens and there have been worse cases of lateness during this term.there was a link attached to my mail to the mailing list though. i assumed you understood that because 1. i already several times just posted the submission template in a thread 2. you didn't tell me it wasn't acceptable.if i had known that it was *required* that you posted the submission template on the mailing list in a document, don't you think i would have done that? if this wasn't a case of you wanting to make members of the council look bad, you would simply have mailed me and told me i should post the issues in a .doc format. but you didn't.unacceptable, imo.i did however send the documents straight to the mailing list now. happy?"
"ah nice to see someone of interest standing other than the expected."
"i don't know much about 0.0 politics but i am quite active in faction warfare at the moment. the ideas of scagga are quite a good start, but there should be more. at the moment we have a lot of fun with it but besides the fun there is no use neither for republic nor for us besides some victory points for plexing. so, i have some ideas that might be not be new (i don't know what is said before) but maybe there is something usable among them. first there must be consequences for the sovereign of a system. that might be a docking prohibition for pilots of the enemy militia, but this is to discuss. in a war everything is about money. so losing a system means for that faction that certain production is taken away and more important the taxes can't be collected. i think to balance the taxrates of the two involved factions around the status of systems. the more systems are under control the lower the taxrate for all players of that faction while doing bizz inside the empire or the republic (amarr/minmatar) and vice versa. contesting a system should take away the income from the owner slowly for bizz is not going well under siege. to reconquer a system from the enemy could give reward to those who fight, for there should be a motivation to do this beyond victory points. i have no idea about that at the moment but will think that over. maybe the victory points can give more than standing? don't know at the moment. this might not be the best way to do it but it will work and is a more subtile way to balance the faction war. to deny docking of faction war pilots brings some problems, like the loss of material in warzone. this might be interesting for the supply chain breaks, but is of cause a drastic measure and can have sideeffects that scare too many pilots away from faction war. an other thing is contraband. i tried it a bit to smuggle small arms to amarr and am not quite shure about, if it is working at all. with systems contesting there could be a quite funny way to open these markets for people who like to deal with forbidden fruit. contested systems might be also a good way to take away all taxes and make them interesting. this as some first ideas but i'll think about it. i was very astonished when scagga contacted me and asked me about my two cents about faction war. i think there is much to do. going away from station-hugging and gatecamping and moving to a more dynamic scenario with plexing is very good. it leads to smaller encounters with much more fun and dynamic. but its also a good way to include other interest in this war than just the idealistic ones, that i follow. if this war is beginning to hurt wallets then it will be of a much higher interest for all. but there is of cause a balancing problem in this. the losing party will lose more and more systems and more and more money, weakening more and more. so what is needed is something to compensate the success. so the loser should have an easier part to contest systems than the winner. this might be done by thinning out the amount of defending vessels. this is quite logical in-world, cause the more systems have to be defended by the (npc) vessels, the thinner the fleet is stretched. like in a normal war. the bigger the territory the weaker and thinner the defending fleets.i don't know if this works but the mechanism is quite straight forward."
"i vote vuk"
"your proposed changes to 0.0 warfare would seem to favour very static engagements, and by protracting them you make engaging in offensive action harder, by virtue of longer supply/reinforcement lines mattering more in a protracted engagement where pilots have time to go and reship. this is a potential problem for a large alliance vs large alliance situation, but it is (as i see it) crippling for smaller guerilla style groups, who want to harass and disrupt rather than conquer; how can you address this potential issue?what are your thoughts on black ops battleships, the impending nano-nerf, and asymmetric combat in general?"
"very good questions. in ideal conditions defensive side should have advantage ofcourse. massive time/resources investements in defence must pay off naturaly to defending side. from the others side when it comes to guerilla warfare there is still viable ways to hurt your enemies without bringing superblob. big role in this should have black ops who needs urgent attention. tbh when they were introduced i was expecting above everything for them to be able warping cloaked. there is also place to tweak a bit force recon ships (adding pilgrim range bonus f.e.). but from the other side its unrealistic to expect that f.e. 20 men guerilla force should inflict huge damage to lets say 1k member alliance. perfect example are nano gangs harassing core systems and whining about blobs where is natural for even small alliances to gather \"blob\" in notime to counter them, while only few jumps away they can hit farmers/miners/travelers. when it comes to nanonerf i will quote one of my friends who summed it perfectlyi am totaly ok with nanoing but as mentioned it shouldnt be religion.when it comes to asymetric combat, there is no win button. i heard lotoff good ideas, some which could be implemented, and some not but if i get elected i will focus on that particular issue, simply because we need to \"ease\" new pilots entering 0.0 without being afraid that only thing they will encounter is blob. one of the simplest things which comes to my mind is adding more 0.0 entry points, few even directly from high-sec to 0.0 like torrinos to ec-p8r. atm its really hard to enter 0.0 cause most of the entry points are heavily camped 23/7.we can discuss this further ofc. and i would love more inputs from all of you, esp. people who wants to feel touch of 0.0sry on rather brief answer and typos but i am in the middle of fight alt+tabing while i am waiting to load the grid :d"
"also i would like to greet all csm candidates i met earlier tonight during eve-radio interview. sadly i didnt heard candidates who were after me, but judging by the ones i heard csm has bright future.good luck and all the best to everyone."
"what changes to the game do you want to try and effect if you get re-elected?"
"it was nice to discuss with you on eve radio this evening. i hope to talk to you tomorrow at the eve-uni discussion."
"see you there!"
"simple question, to all candidates. if you're elected with the most votes and become chair, will you step down from the position, and allow it to be filled by a vote of the whole csm? you'd of course be able to run for the position again. i've committed to stepping down as chair before the first meeting is out and allowing a vote to fill the position, and i was wondering if other candidates would be willing to publicly state that they would do the same. it seems best to get this all down before the election, rather than waiting until after and debating about it when somebody has already won."
"yes, i would step down and let a vote be taken by the csm. i also believe that we should have a clear understanding of what rules of order are being used and what duties the chair is expected to perform under them, and if the chair is allowed to take part in debate, before any election of a chair."
"it was pretty much the basis of my platform for election in the first csm - nothing has changed"
"depends if there are 5 or more goons in the council or not. i don't really want to be chairman but i'll do it if i think it's in the best interest of eve and the csm as a whole."
"assuming the goons don't conquer the universe(*shudder*), is that a yes or a no? if you place first, will you step aside and call a vote, or will you continue as chair without a csm vote?"
"i have stated i would elsewhere!it makes sense to do so. however, it might make more sense for the elected chairperson to remain until the first meeting and act as coordinator etc.i would step down and re-run though, regardless of who was elected onto the council. i trust those that run are running for the right reasons for the betterment of eve for players.arithron"
"i definitely would as i have no intention of ever being chair. also, that's a bit of a silly thing to say ankh as you're pretty much my favorite councilperson and would most likely have my vote. <3"
"the goon part was a bit of a joke, of course. been talking to avalloc this night and he doesn't seem match the stereotypes floating around at all, even though i disagree with his opinion on the eve cemetery. but hey, that's eve.i haven't actually given this much thought and haven't decided either way yet, but i think that democracy is important so i'm very likely to put it up for voting. after all, the other positions including the vice chair are voted on as well, so it would be logical to have all of them open. and it would likely result in a chair that everyone is reasonably happy with. if it cuts down on internal bickering and powergames, i'm all for it. so note that down as leaning heavily towards yes.and as i said, i'm not very eager to have this sort of job as i don't like telling people when they should shut up, who knows what positive input i might cut off that way. if i would somehow be assigned this role i'd certainly do my best and put all my effort into it to ensure unbiassed and professional conduct from my end."
"resign a chair position if it is given to me? if there was a good reason to i'd consider it. i don't see any point in spending time to elect a new chairperson (and all the potential things that can go wrong with that kind of activity) if the nominal chair is fine with (edit: and at) the job."
"new video!"
"what are your views on the nano-nerf, specifically with its impact on small roaming gang pvp? how will you try to enable (not facilitate) more guerilla action in 0.0, and how will you try to address the current mentality of more ships on-grid is better?what are your views on sovereignty and pos warfare?do you envision any changes to npc ai, such that missions (for example) have fewer ships that behave more like competent players, and as such facilitate entry into a pvp environment, by making pve and pvp more similar, and require more similar approaches, rather than the very different approaches currently seen? how would you address getting the same however many missions over and over again, with no change effected on the game world, so no sense of something greater?few questions to get you started"
"having heard your views on the impending nano-nerf, what are your views on promoting other forms of guerilla warfare such as more cloak orientated than speed orientated combat; that which black ops are meant to represent the epitome of:a) would you push for this being advanced as a middling guerilla groups tool, rather than the current solo/very small.b) what do you think about black ops bs? do they need a boost? a rethink?a related but seperate question: what are your thoughts on how to change the current mentality that more is always better, through either change to existing mechanics, or introduction of new ones?"
"got my vote matey"
"op: your posts are governed by emotional not logical reasoning, you are very young in the game, and from what you have said clearly do not understand the reason that these methods of manipulation and what you could term as abuse(of power/intelligence/friendship/trust w/e) exist in eve.either start using logical reasoning, or come back in a few years time imo."
"macros could disappear entirely, and the shortfall in minerals (while painful) would be taken up by enterprising individuals that want to make a legal isk.oh yeah, i'm still waiting for the un-nerfing of blackops bs's."
"i am a fan of eve but i think macrominers give all miners a bad name and i am a miner. i was listening to hyjink on eve radio. now i maybe crazy for saying this but to reward long term player that are at a disadvantage both by skill point starts and in my case attribute points by what i have heard. the story i had heard from a rl friend who also plays eve is that the start up attribute points jumped from 15 to 20 attribute points to spread around. so my thought would be to allow for a reward would be a 1 or 2 point attributes points per player to put into any attribute they would like. as well as let the older players who are at a kill point disadvantage the additional attribute points to helpthem out."
"npc or player should b the same thing, for reality sake.and should get flagged to their corps also!further more:in missionsif someone steps in with out being in ure gang, corp or alliance, after looting or salvaging ure wrecks, should not only b flaged, but also get kill rights !!!full supporting this"
"they said no, read the 2nd csm min's, they call this the funky pos thing or something like that ... still myself and prob jinx, and quite a few others will be lobbying the dead horse for the next few years to come."
"ccp said no to a lot of stuff that would require any real work. they should have expected some of the ideas brought forth by the players to require code and graphics rewrites. maybe someone should start a petition about ccp unwilling to fix issues requiring more than 10 min of coding.p.s. i have messed with software code before and i do know that for this to be implemented it would take months of writing, checking, rewriting, etc."
"that might be true if they didn't allready have a way to connect the pos's allready. (i understand the modular would take time and they should do it because that is how it should have been done in the first place) go do a mission or visit a complex they have control towers hooked up to all kinds of stuff. they need to have pos's connect one way or another."
"i tend to specialize in mission running so yes i have seen structures set up like this. however they are not \"connected\" in the sense that they work together to accomplish a purpose. no matter what the coding would take time to do as each array would need to be reworked with connection points, shield/armor/structure hp would need adjusting as obviously the shield is no more, etc . . ."
"you are missing the point, the connections don't have to do anything - nothing about the structure needs to change other than connecting the parts together. part of the big problem is the fact that pos's look terrible. they magically transport things across from one thing to another, they need to be connected together. these connections don't need shield/armor/structure they don't need anything but a connection from one piece to another.i would like them to make a modular pos but if they can't/won't then just make a way to connect the parts together."
"getting a look at the latest minutes and... hey, a brief mention of the problems with precision missiles, but no definate stance concerning ammunition as a whole. one little tag line... hardly any sort of constructive examination of the massive problems with the stuff.apparently the csm's just don't use the stuff (wonder why? it sucks) so they simply don't give a damn."
"so did they say when the cap ships are up for review then."
"this issue was just voted through the csm with a resounding 9-0 in favor of escalating the issue to ccp developer attention. i'd like to express my thanks to the many players who have taken the time to support this issue thread and to my fellow csm delegates who have been prepared to vote yes to the proposal to bring back live events to the eve online universe.lets get this done!"

"firstly, these are logistics ships, and are not meant to be wtfsolopwned machines. just like recons, covops, stealth bombers. remember one of the main purposes of titans? the ability to jump bridge ships across distances? well, this is black ops on a much bigger scale. titans are not solowtfpwned machines. yeah, they can dd, but catch one with his pants down (mainly after dd'ing) and thats pretty much minus 1 titan without any support. but i digress..the same points / ideas keep coming in, over and over again, so i thought i would post every point that i could find about how they could be changed. so, here they are:1) these are logistic ships mainly. hence slow targetting, low resists, jump bridge capability etc.2) there was an idea of \"star-drives\". the ability for black ops battleships being able to jump to any system (to a random distance from the star), without a cyno needed. the advantages mean you can play solo, and the disadvantages mean that you could jump randomly into a hostile gang, maybe a hostile moon, who knows? it's random. to stop this being abused, it would require 95% cap to use, and would mean the ship couldn't move (but could active modules) for x amount of minutes, meaning that you could be scanned out, but could cloak / defend yourself.3) slow targetting times. but, remember this is really a logistic ship.4) no tank. its a t2 ship, but has less than t1 resists. if this is fixed, it could make it playable.5) how about the ability to fit gang mods instead of turrets / launchers?6) the ability to fit a cocd - on a covops ship..makes sense eh?7) dedicated fuel bays. but, if we get them, won't carriers etc want them too?8) increased jump range. this needs addressing. it takes alot of fuel to jump through ships, and it's a shame it's only a little range..9) the black ops battleships need their bonuses based on their recon bonuses. (like the redeemer needing a nos / neut bonus)10) jumping into cyno-jammed systems. even if this is the one and only boost, it would give the black op a role, and i think would shut up alot of moans. this would mean the covert cyno gen would need to operate in the cyno jammed system. to get around the \"wtfpwn\" look, maybe make covert cynos visible in cyon jammed systems?11) introducing the dst as being able to use covert cynoers / can use cocd? not sure if this will solve the problems, just create more imho.12) removing black ops pilots from local. well, local looks to be getting discussed in another thread, so read there for more info.13) more pg/cpu for black op ships, allowing more flexibility in fitting (making this maybe a stepping stone towards a carrier..frontline it, logistics it etc)14) people are worried (inluding ccp) that they will replace cap ships. this won't happen, as their survivability will never be as high as a capital ship and their flexibility will never be as high as a carrier ship15) larger cargobay/drone bay instead of a seperate fuel bay, would mean having to balance what you take with you, and wouldn't make them wtfsolopwns.well, these aren't my ideas, but yours. i have also reposted something i found interesting:-bo is one of the most expensive sub capital ship in game (marauder and same faction bs can compete in price but in general they are cheaper).-bo requires more skill points then any sub capital ship in game.-bo is the most isk sink if get popped (insurance payout).-covercyno needs cynosural field theory @ lvl5 (rank 5 and no other benefit for this skill, not many ppl train this skill up to lvl5)we know ccp is looking at black ops in depth, but i for one would love to here about their plans. anyone else?"
"old post but still relevant.black ops need to be boosted for targeting range. they basically lost 20km or so from their t1 counterpart. which is unusual compared to all other t2 ships who either kept same targeting range or got better.being allowed to covert cyno in highsec shouldnt be a bad idea tbh."
"well this.not to be a bugger, but some kind of respond from a dev at some point would be nice. know that it isn't always nice to have to stick your head out where it might be flamed, but in the end; it's your job.so it would be kind of nice to hear from you on this way long overdue subjectps: personally i don't think i would ever remove my subscription if there was a good queue system so it didn't cut into my rl to manage the right skills when i am not in the mood for playing."
"anyone notice the lack of a ccp comment anywhere in there?"
"i agree that the lack of ccp involvement in this thread is dissapointing. about the skill queue, i think we defintely need a skill queie, but limit it to 2 or 3 skills in the queue and require that the skills placed in the queue are ones that are already known, this way you still require people to log in if they want to add a new skill to their skill sheet, this way the player can string together those annoying 1-6 hour skills so you can go and do real life stuff while the tedious minor skill managing is handled. also all training will be stopped if the account subscription is cancelled and the account goes inactive."
"it's on their list but that can mean anything of course :p"
"i have heard that this is being addressed in the next patch but i see no difference on sisi or am i looking in the wrong place? is it a hidden setting somewhere?"
"cloak is nerffed as it is enough over pvp issues.if u say durability for cloaking after a few hrs activity, then ok."
"can ships with cloaks cloak other ships ?"
"this is true. skills to br costs to much in time and isk to b preferable to common industrials, thats for sure.i think br r the only tec2 that have less slots than its tec1 originals...and also, no: even with cloak it arder but possible to cash.thats the beauty of eve; nothing here its invulnerable and should remain like that."

"0.0 that isnt npc have rats...so why would you spend 30billion to lose sovereignty and docking rights and such?"
"soon as the station gets built... people would be around to see it. :d as stations show up on map."
"would be nice to claim 0.0 for npc factions (in my alliance's case, the amarr empire). if that means outposts in said 0.0 systems being turned into npc stations, that's probably a price we'd be willing to pay"
"because you could get a guristas sov system and guristas rats in systems normally populated by sansha/bloods, for instance.oh, and you don't lose docking rights. quite the contrary, you keep them, and everybody else gains them too. forever from that moment on, no matter how \"the wars\" in the region unfold.as to why would you spend 30+ bil for this... hmm, i don't know. last time i checked, there were people that bought ships for two, three times that sum just because they were rare, and people lost ships worth much more than that in pvp.hey, maybe you're a budding alliance in a region without npc stations, and you're afraid (or, maybe even almost certain) the outpost you built will be overrun and you won't have the power to bring it back. or, you're the 235th alliance that conquered the ec-p8r outpost this year, and had enough of the constant to-and-fro, so you dub it \"neutral land\" just because you can. or any other number of reasons why you could, should or at least would want to do it."

"the csm just voted on this issue as the largest popular outstanding public issue for meeting 12. we recorded a vote of 9-0 in favor of advocating the return of the tournament in the greater interests of eve online and player enjoyment. its a resounding note of support from the player base and the delegates and fingers crossed we get the result we want. all the best."
"i'm affraid this just got voted down 2-7 with just me and inanna zuni in favor.the csm believes that ccps balancing department will catch this issue before it goes live, and that it is not constructive to nag them when balance changes are still being made."
"supported. blasters shouldn't become as horribly useless for pvp as missile were for a long time."
"i admire the csm's sunny optimism."
"i suppose i could relay the concerns unofficially while i'm at the fanfest, at least that would be something."
"i would find kaylee to be a shiny solution and welcome replacement for scotty i know when walking in stations is introduced i am going to find scotty and shoot him..."
"so where do you think the traders will go ? - a player corp where there is no mutual interest, risking a griefer joining to kill them all - a fw corp, meaning their trade routes are limited to one area of space. while hoping that the other militia don't track them with a spy, then jump in to gank them at a border system.or - a 1 man corp, where they are safe until they get war deced.i'd say the 1 man corp is much safer. because they enjoy it.call me when you start using traders as an example. the caldari npcs weren't strong enough to protect the caldari militia in jita from gal militia shortly after fw started. what makes you think they will protect traders any better ?a fleet which will be too small to fight off the pirates, otherwise the pirates wouldn't of come. and they only need to kill the miners, they can have an alt on that side loot for them.so lets make things easier for the pirates. though a minute should be long enough for them to kill mining barges.and this won't just be the border systems. they just move a few battleships over there in alts, then fly the pilots there in pods. then they dock up, trade the bss, then attack wherever they want to.and how will this idea stop the macro miners from forming their own 1 man corps, and then being completely unaffected ?unless they form the corp themselves.only if someone war decs each corp involved, and they don't jump ship before the dec goes live. i note that your not providing price histories of the minerals. just your personal theories, which don't account for why npcs no longer produce shuttles.go make some screen shots of the price history function."
"so ask for it to be brought back, not some badly thought out plan. pity a freighter will not hold up against someone who doesn't fear the npcs. up until this idea removes the suicide aspect so we just get ganking.i don't know why the traders enjoy trading. all i know is that they do.except that player corps would be out of the war dec, meaning the same risk as normal.players already form home bases. oursleart is already well stocked enough to make jita only worth it for some contract-only items.we already have interracial trading, and how would a protection corp work ?"
"yes. and you do it from a player corp, not a militia. i suggest you move yourself into faction warfare for a month or so and see how it restricts you. this idea won't stop that because macro miners will form their own corps. level 5s are already in low sec, meaning they are already targets for pirates. meaning no change here. one of which was a way for people to start pvp when they wanted to, not when they were forced into it. pity your ignoring that one.and that we would find willing targets, not unwilling. pity you are also missing that one.but what can we expect from someone that has never been in fw ?how would it do this ?because that is the play style they like ?in fact, what pvp have you done ?battleclinic doesn't list any killmails involving you.so your accusing a large portion of the eve player base of selling gtc's for cash without any proof ?even when gtcs are automatically applied to an account when purchased with isk ?"
"yes, those are the key point of your posts:you fail to see how people could like to do something different from what you like and want to force them to play as you like. oh, sure, it is for the good of the people you are forcing, as they for sure will appreciate your play stile. a little information for you: there is a lot of people that don't like what you like and like even less to be forced to play how you like to play and not how they like to play."
"changeing the way npc corps arent going to effect this at all. people who want to run missions will. people who want to mine will. i'll say it again, what you are proposing to fix this issue will not fix it at all. you are trying to force a way of playing on people who do not want to play that way."
"in all honesty i would love that to be the case, but the metagaming aspect of eve makes that damn near impossible."
"change your passwords every day / other day / week / month like a good cooperation that is at war."
"it only takes one e-peen, emo-raged 13 year old kid to reveal your entire alliances password and triple doomsday your battleship fleet.the password should not necessarily guarantee entry. simple as that.if you think it is actually possible in a 2000 man alliance to keep such passwords secret you have never been in a 0.0 alliance."
"i usually took advantage of the macro miners when i was in highsec, since most of them mine to jet cans and then another macro comes to pick up the ore from the can. i would usually find the macro teams and flip their cans and take their ore. macros dont usually respond if you take some of the ore (not all of it cause if the can pops the macro may know and warp off). i have also noticed that most macros have 3 things in common...1. they are in a starter corp 2. i have never seen a macro mine in a t2 barge, only the large t1 barge (forgot the name) 3. their name is usually something completely random that makes no sense i.e. kuygdjad. i could turn quite a profit hunting macros, but if i did it to an actually player and they could verify they were not a macro by holding a conversation with me, i would gladly give there ore back since i didnt want to punish/hurt the people who worked hard for their ore. i think we should just get creative since i dont think ccp will ever do anything major to limit macros being use...just my 2 cents."
"as i say every time... we don't need to implement new mechanics.we need to kick the farmers out of npc corps & remove their invulnerability.introduce a per-pilot war flag that persists on that individual (alone) no matter how many times he jumps corp. his new corp can help if he gets aggressed, but not until the attacker takes the first shot.in new-player schools put a cap on skills that can be trained at tier 3 (not rank 3), as the 'school' simply cannot afford the 'instruction services' beyond that skill tier. level 3 zero-quality agents at best. no freighters, no mining barges (of any type). no agent qualties can exceed zero.in npc corps all tier skills can be trained, but no freighters, mining barges, or pos structures can be used. agent qualities capped at zero, no other limitations.if the player is in a war-declarable corp then the door is wide open for what ever operations they want to conduct... they're just exposed to the same war possibilities as anyone else. jumping corp, however, will no longer be a free escape clause (transferring to another corp does not transfer the war-flag to that corporation, but aiding the new pilot just might... such are the risks of accepting new pilots into the corp).this will not 'stop' macros and farmers, it will only make them vulnerable to the war declaration process like everyone else."
"how about a system that provides a 15 minute agro flag between *mining* players when multiple miners are mining from the same roid? the actual chance of an agro-flag could be calculated by differences in standings between the players and the quantity/value? of the roid being mined and calculated when a roid is depleted.thoughts?"
"can we have the option to turn off dxgrab or w/e minimizes eve when we move to another program? this would stop a ;ot of the dual monitor clamor."
"best i have done is used evemon to move the game to fill up the entire second screen, so it looks like it is full screen just without the issues of using other programs at the same time. it does run slower than when in full screen though but that is a sacrifice i am more than willing to make."
"i was searching the forum for an option to do just this.i guess this thread means, its not possible yet. :("
"there is a slider which effects the opacity of the windows but overview apparently doesnt get changed.it's in esc menu-general settings-righthand side."
"that's what everybody kept telling him... but he's adamant about the policy being wrong and needing a change, so he advocates either tracking who looted the items and removing them as they'e given back to him or giving him duplicates of those items instead."
"you were lucky to get your ship reimbursed - many dont even under the circs you describeso after getting your ship back you now want the loot from your wreck, dont you think its a slap in the face to those that 'never' get their losses reimbursed to have the front to post on here about the missing mods that wasnt reimbursed?"
"there's a few people who keep posting, \"well i never got my ship back blah blah\". was this caused by a ccp error or was it your fault? if it's a ccp error, then the policy in my opinion should be changed to accomodate losses caused through that. i'm not going to get my items back, but at least this change will help others, not just myself, in future. if someones loots a wreck and then looses out, they know the risks of stealing.i've made a suggestion, it may get ignored it may not. who knows. i'm free to suggest something. i once made a suggestion about jumpcloning and losing implants, as many did. i didn't get the implants back, but they've now altered the way jumpcloning and implants works. making a suggestion sometimes works, you just have to have balls to deal with forum trolls and those who want ccp to love them."
"don't get me wrong, on one hand i too believe that reimbursements are a bit too rare, and that, for instance, the \"lag is not reimbursable\" policy is just daft, and that the canned \"logs show nothing in your favor\" response is mildly insulting... on the other hand, i would be perfectly fine with a \"no reimbursements, ever\" policy too.but this is not about approved/denied reimbursements, it's about what exactly gets reimbursed (namely, just stuff that gets listed as destroyed in the killmail).the policy itself seems more than reasonable, for reasons outlined above and not just that.however, in your particular case (and it was a somewhat unusual case), i might be inclined to agree that an exception to the policy could have been made, with a few caveats (for instance, the most vital part, the ability of the gm to verify that all other items that dropped in the can were actually in the can at the moment the can expired).still, as i have said before, you weren't really arguing about getting an exception to the policy, but a change in the policy itself (and if you weren't, you certainly are now).it all comes down to one thing then - when a reimbursement is granted, you also wish that the items that dropped in the can be returned to you.now, this creates two types of problems, depending on how exactly you handle the dropped loot recovery, especially in cases where the can was looted instead of just having expired.problem type one, the exploiters. all you'd need to do was to manage to get yourself killed with a lot of valuable modules in a situation where it would be reimburseable, then have somebody else \"neutral\" scoop up the dropped loot, while you receive back everything, including the dropped items, while somebody else has them in their posession too (creating effectively an item duplication machine). in order to combat that, you'd need to actually track who picked up the items and remove them from their posession.problem type two, unfairness to whoever did pick up the modules. assuming they were not exploiting or helping you exploit, they have every right to keep the items in question, even if your ship's destruction was caused by a reimburseable mistake. having the items taken away from their posession later on would be unwise. worse still, the items might have been already (and legally) sold to somebody else, and isk already used up. what will you do, reverse the sale and leave them with a negative isk balance ? or would you punish the buyer who bought the goods in good faith ? it simply doesn't compute.combine problem one with problem two, and you have absolutely no reasonable way out than have the exact policy we do have right now - to not reimburse dropped loot.the only change in policy i could possibly agree with would be that items dropped in the wreck whould only also be reimbursed if they were still in the wreck/can the moment the wreck/can vanishes.if that is at all possible to track with reasonable effort, that is."
"you're lucky you got the ship back at all, but dropped items are still 'alive' in the database and once the can pops they are no longer associated with the ship they were mounted to (they 'die' and cannot be recovered, just as if someone looted them).imo there should be some manner of recovering items looted, but that hampers other players in pvp situations when the server is at fault (which in 80% of issues it very clearly is, regardless of their 'faultless logs').imo if the can is not looted and the items die after it expires they should be classified as 'destroyed with the ship' and returned. if any traffic activity is associated with the item's db# then it is locked in as still 'alive' and cannot be returned."
"as stated in this thread there is an issue with the balance of sniping battleships. with anormal fitting and max skills etc you can get a range of 300+km in a rokh [which is bonussed for range after all]. but it is capped at 250km for technical reasons.with every other bs you can reach the range of 250, too. [hybrid using spike for example] as the use of the spike ammunition is the normal use for snipers and the next ammo doing more dmg then spike actually has a lot less range you cannot trade range/damage equally. that means: a rokh fitted for 250km range still has to use spike for best damage, like every other bs would have to.but every other bs has a damage bonus for their turrets. leading to following problem:the range bonus for the rokh is of no use to it, as 250km is reachable for every other battleship, too using the same ammunition. and additionally every other bs deals more damage at that range.-> rokh is a sniper but has no more range than any other battleship in sniping setup but deals less damage. i dont think that is intended. i ask the csm to bring this issue up to to ccp."
"false.also false.actually, your whole post is wrong. thanks for playing."
"while it seems your attitude is wrong, but thank you for not contributing anything to the topic.the battleships talked about where of course batleships designed for turret use. and i dont know what your problem is for example with a sniper fitting and spike ammo it is no problem to get a 250km range in a hyperion for example. which makes the rokhs range bonus in that case useless, as the hyperion still deals more damage."
"with a rokh you can still get more range with higher-dps ammo even though the range would then be lower than spike ammo. you don't always get or have to engage at max range."
"wtf??? they're all in a tizzy over... crap that doesn't have any bearing on the entire game at all???and they don't make a single mention concerning the skill system that people are far more interested in??? or any of a dozen topics that were not touched on even remotely that do have a relevant and powerful affect/effect on the game?such an utter waste of time, even ten seconds considering anything at all associated with ambulation."
"any other feedback on this?"
"cloak, shield boosters, armour reps, and other tank mods = noafterburner / micro warp drive = yes"
"all available for this function, or none at all.it sounds like a good idea for those items that turn off in warp (gang modules, which imo should not deactivate in warp). bearing in mind the long slowdown time out of warp a cloaked ship is not going to be (very) overpowered... but damnably annoying. ofc a cloaker in gang warp is hosed on the arriving end."
"i'm not sure that giving fleet bonuses would be easy to implement. but since you brought the subject up, consider a couple of alternative bonuses that higher rank could give:i've previously mentioned ideas including having rank optionally show up in the overview - a useful tool to kill the officers in a fleet first. however, for appreciable uses, i was thinking that they would play a role in revising militia agents: sending people off to cherry-pick enemy officers, bringing back their corpses to receive the reward - this would also lower the enemy pilot's rank as a consequence. this is one example.another ideas i've had included gaining access to a wider variety of equipment at the militia loyalty point store,"
"[x] the ninja salvager should be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because the mission runner owns the wrecks, and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic.i have always found it odd that the contents of a wreck are considered reason to allow combat to retain, but salvage, which is often as valuable is considered fair game. so i'd support changing the mechanic. i'd also like to see a way for me to mark something as free to take with no reprecussions. a lot of times i don't want the loot or salvage and i'd like to make it clear and safe for others to enjoy.[ ] the ninja salvager should not be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because i support ccp's current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecks.issler"

"endorsement from 1st csm vice-chairmanin terms of csm participation, i think eva's (ankhesentapemkah/ank) consistent effort to improve the communication to players and co-operation within the csm stood out amongst 1st csm members. ank did a great job as secretary, and in preparing and raising issues to the council.while i personally totally disagree with ank's platform for a carebear future of duel-universe eve, i find ank's increasingly mature attitude and consistently analytical input to non carebear related issues delivers value for eve players beyond her particular views on eve.serenity steelevice-chairman 1st csm"

"what's your rationale behind these two votes?"
"i don't think (2) warrants ccp's efforts relative to other issues, and would far prefer tools to support players in creation of their own events. if eve is to be a sandbox (which i firmly believe in) then keep it as such and support sandbox tools. ime and the history (of eve), shows that player organised events/storylines can effect significantly more players, with richer and longer lasting memory. the crucial issue here is encouraging players to do events by providing tools (although there is already a wealth of opportunity).the merging events & gatherings (ie. not 12) provides more support for player events through greater visibility to both player events and player gatherings, so hopefully increasing turn out for both + making that forum section more worthy of visiting. it's easy to get a sticky in this forum once a date and time are marked, so that isn't a counter argument."

"by the way, about money for militia. that's really a problem. while all people in eve get more or less rich by doing more or less useful things, the militia gets nothing in return. there should be some reward for the fw is nothing than a hole for money at this time. of cause you can be a battlefield jackal and steal the things from those who lost everything. but thats low to be true and i think it's not a good thing to force the warriors into this.i only fly frigs and to pay my losses stops me from doing or gaining anything, but somehow i survive. those with bigger ships bear great losses, billions of isk for nothing. and there is no way to gain money. i suggest this: contesting and decontesting systems should get a reward in pay (militia pilots that do nothing should get nothing), killing off enemy ships should get pay (not as much as rats of cause) but i don't think downing an militia ships should give reward. loot is enough. where shall the money come from? simple. make taxes like i suggested in my last posting and give the income of those taxes to the militia who is really doing the job. so: don't insert isk into the factionwar that was not there before. control it over a dynamic tax. while the winning faction warriors get less and less the losing will get more and more money for their work. another quite logical step, i think which represents the normal dynamic in society."
"just registering my support for the evil ammatar, scagga.pretty much all you have gone over so far is what i would like to see including the small scale pvp prospects and the possibilities for more tactical 0.0 environments.what are your thoughts on alliances and consolidaion of 0.0 space? like the further from a core hub the weaker the defences might become? i have felt for a while this would encourage some more tactical aspects and a different approach to taking over someone's space.also, the idea of the pillage of an outpost sounds good but maybe it could be applied to a smaller scale like inflicting actual cost damage to outposts and pos external structures. i personally would like to be able to conduct raids into the fringes of an alliance's space (if weaker through range from the core as stated above) and disrupt pos operations while inflicting a cost on repairs to external structures without needing to bring a 150+ blob to do so. light damage but over time an annoyance to the space owners or their tennants.good for those like me that have long lost interest in the resource and time drain of claiming space but have no means of doing meaningful damage to such an entity without having to resort to sov warfare mechanics. thoughts?"
"firstly - touch my pilgrim and i cut you (ingame )i agree about more entry points into 0.0, but think this will only lessen the symptoms, and not tackle the problem.i think developing mechanics that encourage smaller fleets orchestrated at a tier above current fcing (including a major revamp of the tactical overview/solar system map, perhaps making them integrated) would be if possible a good way to go, a soft solution to the blobbing 'problem'.it is not unreasonable to expect that a 20man gang could go in run through say 5 systems or so, kill a load of ratting ships, and then retreat, the current gate/bubble mechanics (and after the nerf even more so), discourage bringing in ships that do sufficient dps to effect this fast razing of the belts and moving on (here a covops cloaking blackops with a larger cargobay together with the new covops cloaking blockade runners would work brilliantly, still requiring recons to lock down and find targets).i like your vision for larger scale combat, assuming that a large group of poorly organized, poorly fit imbeciles cannot just wear down a raiding group by sheer numbers and isk, or if they can, it will take a lot of reships and isk lost (it sucks to be killed by a load of terribly fit pve ships because they just have so many you can do aught but die). how do you propose to generate/facilitate these fights along supply lines and sub battles? the easiest way for a fleet to operate is all in one place shooting one or two targets, and you would have to provide quite a significant (imo) reason, to introduce so much complexity on the command side of the fight, and not make it mind-numbingly complicated, as it could be.what changes would you like to see made to motherships and titans? what are your views on the sovereignty grind? is this an issue you would raise in the csm?what would you do, if elected, for the small roaming 0.0 pvp corp, and the pirates and lowsec denizens? your original post addresses large scale 0.0 warfare, so what about the little guy?"
"i still dont think that reworking of tactical overview or ui will significantly change/promote smaller fleets. one of the things coming to my mind is limiting fleet size on 51 people (5 wings + wing commander) making a bit harder to organize the blobs. also as i mention above boosting black ops, recons and bombers (with blockade runner change) will give people ships for guerilla warfare. but then again its not perfect solution cause black ops are very skill demanding, and i dont see possibility for lowering their requirements. another thing which can help is nerfing high end moons which will partialy decrease wish of big powerblocks for space domination, because holding lotoff space will provide them more logistic work then income. also maybe opening a new regions like drone space but connected directly to empire will give more space for new people. as i said before there is not easy solution for this, but what needs to be perfectly clear to everyone is that eve is very tough and demanding hardcore game, not casual mmorpg. ofcourse casual gamers can enjoy eve, but they will never ever taste the uniqueness of eve as war simulation.when it comes to sov mechanics, there is maybe some slight modifications that could be implemented but more as cosmetics. generaly they reward entity holding the space for current period of time which is perfectly natural for me. motherships need urgent boosting. i am nyx pilot for long time, and tbh i dont remember when is the last time i flew it in combat (\"brag mode on\" partialy because i am flying titan and 2 dreads aswell \"brag mode off\"). motherships for their price compared to carriers does not provide enough reasons to fly them. for me personaly their only major advantage comparing to regular carriers is possibility to fit remote ecm burst and boosting this module (range, rof, possibility of fitting not just one module per ship) is just one of the things.when it comes to titans they need reworking for sure. i bet that ccp never thought that there will be 50+ titans ingame. it is matter of months when one power block will be able to field 30+ titans which can totaly anihilate capital fleet. this is issue that needs to be discussed with community, especialy titan pilots and alliance leaders cause vast resources are invested into them so ccp needs to be carefull."
"well beside of whining for the bigblobs ruining 0.0 i am witness of lot of small corps sucessfully living there, not just as pets/renters but independant entities. venal region alone has dozens of poses even industrial ones without any defenses owned by small corps. also i witnessed rising of a lot of small entities from 20 man corps to 500+ man alliances in last year so its far from impossible to be sucessfull 0.0 dweller. you need dedication, you need time but as i said this is not hello kitty online! this is cruel world where only the toughest can survive.when it comes to lowsec i agree that reward/risk ratio is to low. i remember my 1st entering lowsec resulting in insta-activation of my clone . generaly what could be implemented are bit higher missions rewards (but not much higher cause it will be more profitable then 0.0 farming), redistrubtion of lowsec agents (there are many lowsec regions almost nonpopulated), concord chasing outlaws with low enough sec status (not concord wtfpwnbbq blobs, but frigate patrols who will harass outlaws around the gates, by jamming them, scrambling/webing or inflicting some moderate damage), billboard on gates leading to lowsec could be broadcasting warning messages etc.but again i am pointing that eve is not casual easy wheniamdeadiwillrespawnwithnothinglost game which you can enjoy by soloing it. find friends, join or even create your own corporation and prepare yourself to be killed......many many times."

"i'd like to think i learned at least a bit about that from the thread bane linked, yes. you're right, that is a concern. part of the solution is people i trust, of course. i have friends strewn across most of the careers in this game, so there's usually at least one i can use as a sanity-checker on any given topic. part of the solution is finding out the qualifications of the person i'm talking to. i'm going to take an avatar pilot more seriously than a kestrel pilot when it comes to doomsday changes, for example. and part of the solution is more consultation. while there may be drivel coming from the uninformed, if you talk to enough people, the uninformed will generally cancel each other out. i'd like to think i have a decent amount of common sense, and that i can separate fact from fiction most of the time. garbage posing as advice is a problem, and i won't pretend that i'm immune to it. but the plan is to not get taken in by it very often, and i think i can manage that that was the intention with the bolded/underlined bits - it gives you the ability to scan it quickly and have any follow-up information immediately at hand if one topic seems more interesting. if you want a single short list, however, here are the high points.csm internal: introduce real rules of ordertry to move csm meetings to a forum-based formatprovide better reference materials for playersuser interface:work to establish a user-modifiable uisubmit lists of desired ui upgrades to ccp with all three submissionsgameplay:make lowsec significantly more profitablelook into a method for allowing people to defend their lowsec space without sec lossadd new charisma-based skillswork for other changes if they seem to be well-considered ideas that will be good for the game"
"thanks for the kind words.i saw in another thread which three changes the candidates are pushing for most, so i figured i'd post my list:better pvp: balancing some issues, making bounty hunting a reality, and encouraging small fleet warfare over blob warfare.better pve: making mining and missions more fun, allowing small deployable stations, and giving ships more personality.better ccp pr: ccp's public relations have been very lacking, thus i'd push for more transparency and more notice before major changes to the game are implemented."
"issler dainze - csm candiadate - \"let me be your voice when you scream in space!\"first thanks to eve radio for the opportunity to talk to those that are interested about my ideas for things the csm should think about.one topic that was not discussed during my segment was one i would have liked to have addressed. the customization of ships. i think this is an idea that has been long overdue. let me explain why and then address some of the comments i've heard against the idea.first, eve should be all about being unique. we have no fixed career paths, have huge freedoms in our choices and actions yet when it comes to the look of things everything is mostly the same. systems look the same, pilots look very similar and ships are identical. not my idea of ideal. i think we should have the option to make our ships unique. this would be not only enjoyable but useful when trying to quickly see who is who in space.so some of the reasons i've heard not to allow this are:1. we would end up with \"hello kitty\" kestrels! - that is definitely not what i'm proposing. skinning to that degree would have technical as well as taste issues! i think we should think about personalizations that stay in the character intended by the artists that have developed these wonderful assets.2. it would cause lag! - you could certainly implement customizations in a way that would. but lets look at what the realities are of a \"smart\" set of things i could do to stand out from the other ships.- stripes and marking colors. we already have a minimum requirement of a shader capable gpu. these sorts of simple effects (make my stripes blue for example) can be done almost for free. a few bytes of metadata from the server to the client and you have easy changes in base colors of markings.- corporate logos - the information to render this to ships is already loaded and available. this could be done with very little perfomance impact.- alliance logos - again, this data is already loaded into the client and available to apply to the ships. - ship names - again, this information is already available to the client and could easily be applied to the ship when it is rendered.more challenging but still possibiliy interesting and worth talking about:- manufacturing corporation - imagine if when i looked at the info for a ship it included who the corporation was that built it! this is a mod i definitely would conceed would introduce new database metadata requirements. still, seems like it would be worth dicussing.- kill history - how about \"marks\" on the side of the ship that indicate the kills the ship has participated in? this again would require some additional data tracking but would add an interesting element to the experience.bottom line, i support the idea of letting pilots ships in eve become unique. i hope i get a chance to help drive that change into eve.well, that's it for now, until next time remember, \"stuffs getting better! stuffs getting better every day! \"issler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord"
"issler dainze - csm candiadate - \"let me be your voice when you scream in space!\"\"concord - the worst police in the 'verse!\"so one of the things i believe makes low sec so underutilized is the standing gate camps that seem to exist at key transit points in and out parts of low sec. i'd like to talk about some of the changes i'd propose to make low sec more popular.1. gate camps - rancer is a system that comes to mind. there has been a near permanent camp into this system ever since i started in eve. i would like to see something that would produce an gradually escalating concord response. for the first set period we'd see things as they exist now. but after some period of time we see the arrival of new concord assets to drive the campers off the gate. i'd expect something similar at the stations.2. bypass gates - i'd be interested in looking at options that would create temporary \"bridge\" gates to allow pilots have a gate that would \"jump\" a system that has a certain level of for a set period of time. again, wouldn't a police force create bypasses to allow safe passage around areas with ongoing gun battles?3. automatic bounties - if a pilot has lowered their security status via pvp in low sec it would seem to me that concord would eventually offer a reward for capture. i think this is another mechanic that would be interesting to explore.4. corp/alliance wide kill rights - if i am killed anywhere but the badlands and one of my corp/alliance members runs across the villian that did the deed they should have the same right to seek some payback as i have.5. local \"deputies\" - if i have a corporation or alliance that chhoses to operate in a low sec system i should have some manner to build \"concord\" faction in any system. once i gain a certain level of concord faction i have the ability to guard gates myself. as a \"deputy\" i can engage anyone that comes into \"my\" system that has a significant criminal history of acts in low sec. the deputies would recieve a \"bounty\" from concord for catching a know criminal.these are just quick thoughts on some of the things i think could improve low sec. in summary i think that currently low sec should not be just 0.0 with gate guns, there surely needs to be more concord presense there than is currently possible. well, that's it for now, until next time remember, \"stuffs getting better! stuffs getting better every day! \"issler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord"
"enough folks have talkied about who they are in rl. here is a link to let you know a little about me:michele's rl issler"
"miss dainze will make a great addition to the csm. she represents a large group of players who's voice hasnt been heard by ccp."
"the ford focus does not approve of your candidacy."
"what will you push for with relation to small gangs, low and nullsec?what do you think about black ops bs?what do you think about current 0.0 blob mentality and mechanics that generate it, and about pos/sovereignty warfare?"
"this begs for another question. if the player base elects you to be chairperson, are you following the will of the pilots who elected you, our your own?you see, in my opinion this is what the last council forgot. they were elected to do the will of the pilots / player base who elected them. unfortunately the last counsel started and ended in personal fighting and bickering and really did not listen to anyone except themselves, lets get it right this time. lets not forget that every change we pass along to ccp affects 100% of the players to one degree or the other. so we need to be sure that it is the majority who want the change. not just the few, who are loudest. because as it is right now, ccp is nerfing things to fix the nerfs that should have fixed the nerfs, lol. the same principle is valid for who is elected chairperson.and therefore my answer must be no, if the player base elects me and i become chairperson, then i will not step down without a very good reason or a conflict of interest / personal issues. because, there is no possible way that i could know better then the player base themselves.-rorin"
"this raises the question of what players are voting for when they cast a ballot with your name on it. i would argue that they're trying to put you on the council, not that they're trying to make you the chair. it's obviously impossible to tell what the numbers are, but my guess is that the person with the most votes is the person that the most people want to see on the council, but not necessarily the person that the most people want to see as chair. also, the chair is a fundamentally internal position - most voters don't care how you make your decisions, they care whether they get made and what they are. now, if it came down to a race between two people who wanted the top slot explicitly, and the vote was based on who would be better running the council, with the assumption that both would make it on, then i could see you standing behind \"the voters put me here\". similarly, if darius wanted the spot(i mention him by name because he's about the only one who could pull it off), and got the most votes by explicitly getting his alliance to vote for him in the top spot, a similar argument would apply. but neither of us are running with the goal or expectation of getting the most votes. if it happens that i do win the most votes, i'm pretty sure it will be because a lot of people liked my vision and not because a lot of people wanted me running the show per se. as such, i feel that i would not have a mandate to lead based purely on the votes cast by pilots, and that i would need to seek approval from the rest of the csm in order to hold the spot legitimately. if you feel differently, that's fine. my goal here is to get the positions of as many candidates as possible down explicitly, not to attack them for holding one position or the other. if a vote for you is a vote for you holding the chair if elected to it, voters can know that now and can vote accordingly. but that's where i'm coming from here."
"being qualified to be a delegate on the csm and being qualified to be a chairperson are two seperate things, and it is a grave mistake to have them decided upon by the same vote.just because ccp has set something up in a certain way does not mean that it is perfect -- isn't that part of the idea of having the csm in the first place? it applies not only to the game, but to how the csm is elected and run."
"i vote for \"rock/paper/scissors\" among the csm members after the election! :-)actually i would prefer the chair is determined by the csm as part of the initial face to face meeting of the csm. the chair will need a particular set of interpersonal skills that cannot be determined by popular vote and having the csm get a sense of each other's personal dynamics would likely produce the best choice.issler"
"got my vote as well."
"what changes to industry would you push for, and why?"
"who am i? good question, well first and foremost this is an alt i play alot :) i have been playing eve for about 3 years give or take a few months. i have lived in empire, low sec and 0.0. i do have several characterss dotted about eve and they live their own lives and are not all interconnected like most alts(e.g. hauler alt ect) most of my alts are more like main characters because i like to try different aspects of eve.why do you want to be a csm candidate? well lately there are a few things that i am not happy about and its mainly the views like this. tbfh its these kind of people that want to nerf mine and your play style, just because they don't like it. i fell for scams and i learnt from my mistakes. i think we need to go to ccp and say 'stop nerfing war decks' ' lets have a review of the insurance system' and ' lets talk about macroers in 0.0 and low sec ' and honestly a host of other things.1) lets take a look at the insurance system. instead of just nerfing empire suicide gankers to oblivion (the easy option) why not alter the insurance system so it makes it less profitable but not need a tera amount of ships to gank a freighter. why should people be allowed to transport billions worth of stuff right across empire afk with little or no risk, this need changing?2) nowhere near enough war in empire at the moment, the war dec system need denerfing to how it was (the less preferable choice) or ccp need to come up with a better system for war dec's.3) internal affairs need to be more vocal on what they are doing, what they are investigating at the moment? how many leads have they had from players ect basically just talk to us more.4) macroers, more information including how many banned and how many reported. i know its hard for ccp but there are systems in low sec that are just a joke, 0.0 also. 5) another big one is the secondary market needs some love (see market discussions forum for more info about the secondary market) with trading shares improvements this would be awesome. on this note ill include miners as this profession is also neglected, some new ninja mining ships for use in low sec maybe? not just bigger shiny ships. danger mining with suitable profits ftw!6) i thought i would just add this in here, i did actually agree with ccp's ghost training nerf as there where to many people abusing it to train characters then sell on the forums. it was a no brainer really.there are more issues im sure which will be discussed, but i would also like to take this chance to say what i like about eve so you can garner a better idea about me. i like the fact that there are lots of professions in eve, thats when i hear of someone nerfing a profession i have to take a stand. i like the fact that eve is unlike any of the other mmo wow clones out there and doesn't hold your hand all the way through the game and if youre stupid or lazy then you get owned. i like the fact there is no such thing as safe space! i like the fact we have probably the best market system than any other mmo (but lets make it better anyway). i like the fact that this game rewards team work. i like the fact that the politics in this game are so in depth compared to other mmo's. i like the fact that eve is such a harsh place that people can actually make a very decent eve living by scamming people whether it is on contracts or corp thefts (choose your friends wisely).did i mention the fact that i like eve because its so harsh? well i do, but more and more lately eve is becoming more generic like, i don't want eve to be dumbed down, do you ?if anyone wants to eve-mail me i will get back to them or you can convo me and if you have any issues that you think will coincide with my own way of thinking and should be aired if i am available i will chat to you."
"this guy seems legit. what could go wrong?"
"nothing!"
"given that you're actually starting to look like you want to run legitimately, i should probably tell you that the period of when you could apply closed on october 17th. you're not a candidate this time, so you have to wait until april to run."
"thats fine april is a only a few months away and theres lots to be done. i need to advertise get my message out there and get good team of people behind me. i think i'll need a number 2 also."
"while i disagree with completely outlawing scamming, dont you think it would be nice if the scammers would manage to get a little higher than how pathetic they are now? when i read about a mothership scam, i think the scammers are still pathetic, but i can at least agree that they did something to get their isk. in the time you used to read this post, probably 20 scam chats have been added in jita local. dont you think it would be nice if the local channel in trade hubs would contain more than scammers dragging their contracts into local chat? or at least give people the possibility to do something about those alts. but right now they will never leave the station and you cant find their main."
"jita! scam central, scam heaven, why is this ? beacuse its busy, very busy there are two reasons to go into jita for me to scam someone or to gank someone. if i need to trade legit i go elsewhere, infact i usually give all the major hubs the cold shoulder. it is the fact that it is the way it is that is probably the main issue, the jita hub is too big/busy. people go to jita for the reasonable prices and convienence (everything in one place) and sometimes there in a rush, they want it all now in one place, the problem is so do hundreds of other people so the scammer see an opportunity to cash in on that haste and quite often does well so lots of people try it on. if the trade in jita could be spread out to existing hubs and/or new hubs then there would be less spam but scamming would be more lucrative as people would be less aware as it would be less 'in thier face' like jita.i do see it from your point of view though the spam is annoying and maybe ccp should introduce more tools, better filters maybe having the ability to block more people or block corp contracts, block people in npc corps or block trial players. i'm all for giving people the tools to defend themselves from scamming or spam i just don't want ccp to hit with a big stick and break it. disposable alt's are another problem that they could look at fixing somehow as this would help aswell. i hope i have answered your question in a suitable manner."
"hmmm - my intention was to put the brakes on ccp skill/attribute point inflation on new charactera - i hadn't really thought about increasing existing players attributes or skill points. this would need some more thought, though it is an idea worth discussing.another approach might be to allow the \"trading\" of skill-sets that a person has trained but is no longer using - for example, being able to trade something like lvl-5 mining, for a skill which needs a similar number of skill points."
"first of all, they did a great job for the wage they recieved! :-) i appreciate that they stood up and tried to make a difference.that said, i think the one place that the csm has failed in a significant way is that they still have not made it clear the the pilots of eve what they believe their \"mission\" is. i think clarifying what they believe their role to be is key. i don't believe the majority of the pilots in eve have a solid idea of what the csm was striving to achieve.the next csm should make their view of their roles and the scope of their activities clear and readily available for all to see.\"let me be your voice in space when you scream!\"issler"
"honestly, i can't summarize it better than darius did, so +1 to that."
"darius provided a pretty good summary here, i think. there was a lot of unnecessary chaos and drama, but most of that was growing pains and personality conflicts i don't expect to see as much of going forward. aside from the improvements that will happen on their own, i'd like to see a lot of the internal procedures get cleaned up and formalized, and made at least semi-public so that we can avoid nonsense like this. i'd like to see a lot more planning go into long-term methods as well. the csm should sit down once in a while, talk about the bigger, longer-term issues(0.0 sov, fw issues, things of that nature), and figure out where we'd like to go and what we'd like to do with them. we saw some last term where this process was done well by a csm - deirdra and arithron's thread on bounty hunting and mercenaries is the most obvious - but we also saw times it was done very badly, like bane's threads on the roles of capital ships that could desperately have used some more consultation and thought so that they weren't just statements of general dissatisfaction. the meeting format needs a lot of work too. the current one has severe timezone issues, terrible problems with getting ever longer and discussing ever less, and a real lack of proper communication between members. part of that is on the heads of the members themselves - why do they wait to get into the meeting before they discuss an issue? they should be doing the bulk of the arguing in the forum thread for the topic before the meeting starts - as soon as the agenda is finalized, go through and comment on all of them (assuming you haven't done so previously, as i almost inevitably will have done). that'd save a lot of time on its own. ultimately, i'd like to see a publicly readable closed forum as the location for meetings, and the expectation that members will actually show up and debate/vote, unlike what happened with the last forum debate. it'd take some work, but it's the goal i think we should set. aside from that, i'd like to see better methods of passive communication with players - threads of what's been done and how, posting of minutes, things like that. csm's are generally good about actively talking to players, but a lot of players would prefer to look something up rather than pester people they don't know, and right now there aren't many good ways of doing that."
"give us your 3 target areas of concern that you will try to effect change in if you are elected as csm, and a few of the changes in those areas that you will push for."
"short and sweet,30day gtc : bring them backskill training queue: needed change!more and better missions/content for everyone.over the last few weeks i have come out of 0.0 and tried to do missions in highsec for isk.its like watching reruns on television. the poor mission runners need a buff on mission content and the amount of missions that are in the game. less is more: from my roaming in eve, i get the distinct feeling that pilots want a working game first, then eye candy and new structures. the csm needs to start thinking about what they are doing and suggesting to ccp.if the second csm gives 12 well thought out suggestions to ccp in the next 6 months it will be better then 100s of changes that were not well thought out.-rorin"
"a mailing lisis the wrong tool for the problem. i think a combination of public and private forums is the minimum solution. while i personally am fine with anyone reading my comments on a particular csm topic i know that some people will not participate in a candid manor in full public view. i think a wiki to use to track issues formally identified by the csm for action would be bonus.\"let me be your voice when you scream in space!\"issler"

"you're right.this is that document i sent to them by the way...downloadfrom what i understood yesterday, either they didn't read it or it didn't stick. we got our csm forum though but that came too late to be of much use. certainly something we should make good agreements on for next term."
"and you dont pick up loot from 1.5 k like everyone else? as the current system works their is either a small shuttle / drone running back and fourth or the modules have an improved \"beaming\" system to be able to transfer items further. not the point of the arguement here though. i sugest you read through the original forum post on this issue and you would see that the idea is alot more than simply connecting the modules together."
"i loved this idea from the moment it was first suggested way back when. only hurdle to this is the existing poses out there but the 'leave it alone and let it change over time' thing could work i guess.the biggest hurdle here is re-doing all of the models which is why ccp might balk at this change, but i'd like to see them fix some of these types of long standing issues rather than the continuous stream of new content.the problem with this sort of thing is that it's a low return 'aesthetic' issue that works well enough, but not prettily, putting it at the bottom of every development queue known to man. hopefully the csm can really push this because a lot of people would love to see it."

"earlier on in this thread someone went a bit emo about how long it takes ccp to fix pre-nerfed ship classes. i'm feeling a little less rage on the subject but i do think the guy had a point.i totally agree with ccps pre-nerfing approach, having originally came from daoc where we regularly saw that the new classes were overbalanced, i prefer ccp's approach.however when you *know* that you're introducing something new and that it's function is intentionally limited, why not have a number of optional plans ready to go based on some guess work? the whole 6 month waiting period before people can really use new ships and mods is quite a painful wait at times.back on topic, the fuel bay is going to be nice and the additional ability of jumping blockade runners through covert fields should help a lot on the logistics side of things. i still don't think that this addresses the usability of the ship in actual combat though. if black ops are the dps/tanking members of the marauding guerrilla gang then some kind of bonuses towards that role would be nice. they don't have to be solo death machines but a bit more in terms of resists and dps would encourage people to actively engage with these vessels. right now i see this as more of an alt ship rather than something my main would be flying."

"only if i can have a button which auto tackles and ganks the enemyskunk"
"this ^^. warp to 0 is not ideal. it would be better if it could be removed and a solution found for bringing back bookmarks to do this. with warp to 0, there is significantly less strategic advantage of reconnaissance of space and the \"geography\" of eve made more homogeneous."
"if the window-idea was for whatever reason not technically possible, how about the ability to launch a camera drone? the character would control the drone (perhaps in the same technical fashion as a regular launch) but if the pod was shot, no clone would need to be destroyed - only the drone would be destroyed. the camera drone would not have warp-ability.this would provide the mechanism i would like to see if anyone is camping the station.thoughts?"
"fair enough. after all the only reason for a short undock timer is so that if someone launches into a camp they would be screwed if they can't redock.and only the people undocking need to see outside. so maybe make the window only viewable during the undocking step. maybe have the window load you the outside grid so that if you hit launch, you don't have to load anything, and if you stay looking out the window for too long your moved back into the station to save server resources."
"would it help if stations worked in a similar method as gates, where you are placed outside cloaked?then again, what if there were a 10 sec or so period after using a stargate or exiting a station where one could neither target nor be targeted?just random thoughts that struck me...one thing about jumping to another gate or undocking from a station is that you appear to the world you are loading into before it loads on your pc. with my other account, i have tested the ability to target my other account as it undocks, with the other account not fully appearing to be undocked for several seconds.let's face it, the campee is more often than not, at a disadvantage to the camper(s) whether it's a gate, a station, in eve, or pvp corpse camping in some random rpg."
"ok, so i am rather new here, but hopefully this hasn't been posted too many times.basically, if you are training a skill, once it completes training you manually have to switch it. so if you aren't at your computer at that time, you have to log on (since you can't manage skills offline - which would be very nice).my suggestion would be to have skills continue to train the next level of that skill. so, you complete electronics level 3, and then you begin training level 4 automatically.maybe there is a learning skill that could be incorporated with this function. maybe each rank gives you a 20% chance to rollover to the next level of the skill, so at level 5 you would always rollover to the next level, which would be helpful for people who can't log on and waste several hours before they can get to a computer. having a skill associated would make in-game sense since it could be incorporated into the lore, etc and be a timesink of it's own. just a thought."
"i would like to support this, maybe this \"skill\" could replace the need for a skill queue, granted you wouldn't be able to queue different skills, but if a skill roles onto training the next lvl automatically, it would mean we wouldn't have to log on at odd hours just to make sure we dont waste training time"
"this idea, and ones like it, have been posted at least half a dozen times, and have already been taken to ccp. i like the idea, and i don't fault you for raising it, but it doesn't need to be passed again."
"acceptable, though i would prefer an actual queue since there are plenty of times where i don't want to train the next level right away. for instance, why should i train jury rigging 5 ?"
"maybe there could be a new set of ships, but the catch would be cross-training between factions. like a ship that would combine features of 2 races. in order to use these ships you would need to have like level 5 skills of that ship type for each race.maybe have a ship that you need skills from all 4 races. i dunno, just thinking out loud here."
"you want pirate faction ships. in game look up the rattlesnake and vindicator. i think those are two of them at least."
"eccm works fine, they dont need a bost. for instance, like 1 week ago we engage, and i was flying a domi with 2x magnetometric eccm tech ii, and i had sensor strenght something like 79. we had 2 falcons, but larger numbers of gang members, enemy had 6 falcons. we won and i never been jammed even 1 falcon tried hardly for like 7-10 minutes. the only problem with eccm is that is not suitable for ships that have limited mid slots or have shield tank."
"i vote that ccp no longer reimburse players for any reason. it's obviously causing too many problems in the \"well he got his stuff and i didn't\" category. as well as the \"i lost mah stuff giv it bak naough!\" category.stop reimbursements, everybody gets equal treatment. no more argueing about who's fault, what the logs show, or the nitty gritty details of the surrounding circumstances!"
"i agree, come on ccp, acknowledge this. local must go, not everywhere, just in 0.0 space. 0.1 to +1.0 should still sustain a \"live\" state as this is (semi)governed space."
"tempest at 250km = nope, not even with tremor.apoc at 250km = nope, not even with aurora.raven at 250km = oh yeah, easily, and no loss of dps. you just have to wait half an hour to hit the target.assuming these ships are not using remote assistance.the rokh is the only bs designed to engage at such extreme ranges, despite its moderate dps while sniping. the apoc is a strong second. unfortunately the apoc's lack of mids limits its ability to lock at & engage at such ranges, requiring remote assistance. the tempest is straining to beat 200km unless it dedicates all of its mids to tracking comps & sensor boosters making it pretty useless for hitting anything, even at 250km, with any transversal at all while using (nerfed to crap) t2 ammo. spike also has pointless stacknig nerfs that gimps its effectiveness at any range.only the raven can effectively both lock from and shoot from 250km or more, without any loss of dps, using t1 ammo. the balance there is the time to target.thus, even with rof and damage bonuses, the other bs able to engage at the rokh's range class don't do any greater damage (due to poor tracking, time-to-target, ect)."
"that's right, the rokh is a terrible horrible sniper and it needs to be brought up to the glorious level of sniping excellence that is the tempest and the maelstrom and the like. hear hear!i don't even know why i bother reading these boards..."
"there's plenty of risk in salvaging. ultimately, we're the ones taking uninsurable, untanked t2 frigates into level 4 deadspaces, often with faction fittings (sisters scan probe launchers, for example). if one of those goes pop (and it happens more often than you'd think; recon 3, anyone?), it's a bigger hit than losing a fully-insured t2-fit battleship. of course, the immense amusement offered by the ninja lifestyle more than offsets the hazard.similarly, if ccp didn't want us to invade other people's deadspaces, they'd give us a way to scan out wrecks. at present, the only way to find them is to scan for a mission runner's battleship or salvage vessel."
"i support being able to scan out wrecks."
"well that's just mean spirited."
"firstly, i think a lot of the blame for this can be planted squarely at the feet of the players themselves. i think that asking for programmatic solutions for every problem has started to lead us down a very dangerous path where the \"sandbox\" is no longer as without form as it used to be. i think a lot of the problem i've had with some of the solutions presented in the name of \"fostering small gang engagements\" is that they'd only serve to further minimize what i loved in this game when i found it which is the high degree of freedom.so when i think about the question of what's wrong today i try to avoid specific mechanics that would force smaller engagements. small gang work exists today. we have units who engage in small gang work all the time. the fact is that essentially only two alternatives have been presented. one alternative route seeks to create mechanics which would force gangs to be of a smaller composition, limiting fleet sizes or the number of people that can be involved. the other seeks to force people to be in multiple places at the same time. both can have the same root problem of introducing limiters in what should be an open universe with the promise of \"small gang warfare\" in situations where small gangs were never intended to have an impact.so at the end of the day i'd say that small gangs have their place and that people need to be more creative in their application. lamenting the fact that your small gangs aren't making a dent on a large alliance's holdings tends to be myopic, because in reality if you're applying yourself properly you will be effective. the devs can't login and play eve for you. at some point you're going to have to take some of that responsibility for \"finding the fun\" on yourself in any social game.regarding capitals well... i think that's a contentious issue as well. capitals require a lot of work and big investments. it used to be that if you wanted to siege a pos you absolutely had to have capitals. i think that part of the disparity that we're experiencing today is a product of trying to please everyone in this regard. people don't want to have to use capitals to take down pos's and pos's are tied to sov and integral to the game at this point.frankly, i don't have the answer to this today, which is part of why i proposed the 0.0 roundtables we'll be having in iceland. i think that the problem is big enough and complex enough that it will take multiples heads and a lot of brainstorming to work towards a solution.one thing i do know is that for a lot of players eve is less fun today, and i think that rather than focusing on individual mechanics wrapped around niche issues, i'd like to concentrate on that a bit more. why is it not fun? what can be done to spice things up? i think that when people get bored is when they focus on the negative. when i'm having fun i don't care as much about capital ships or small gangs or what i'm doing at the moment. i'm having fun and living in the moment and i think that when we turn the corner and start working back in that direction we'll find a lot of these solutions along the way."
"one of the problems with the current situation is that it takes a long time before the players know what has happened with their issues. often they do not know which issues have been advocated, or even dealt with by ccp already. threads get buried and reposted, and as we've all seen, the forum quickly becomes a horrible mess where it is hard to find information. to that end i am currently working on a wiki, which will be made public this week, so players can see what the csm is currently working on and what the status of their important issues are.another problem is that most eve players do not frequent the forums or willing to post here at all. for these people i want more csm-wide public discussions, as right now all these initiatives were organized by individual csm members (i have ingame focus groups to remain in touch with the players, but i have no idea what the other csm members did to this end).last, right now i have the feeling that our issues end up in a black box, and we often do not have insight in what happens with it. currently a csm member is responsible for each individual issue, and i would like ccp to mirror this and assign someone to be responsible for each issue as well. if promises were made and we do not hear of it for a while, i'd like this csm member to get in touch with the ccp employee that was assigned this issue, and ask for a status update. this prevents the resubmission of important issues as well just to get more information (30d gtc, skill queue, small freighter etc)."
"yup, a major annoyance for a lot of players. i support any effort to clear up communication on those matters"
"a list of issues submitted, voted upon, (escalated and voted down) including links to relevant issue threads should have happened from the start if the csm term. it was clear that ccp was leaving the administration up to the csm from the start.ultimately, such a recording system needs to be linked at the start of the assembly hall forum (as this is where issues need to be posted, makes sense that indexes to past issues etc are here also for reference before posting).its really too little too late for this csm session. i agree there is a lot of room for improvement. i realise that the fragmentation (of sorts) of the csm early on didn't help or inspire members to go the extra mile on indexes etc. csm --> player communication should have a very high priority for the next session.take care,arithron"

"could i please take a moment to clarify what you claim i have said: i have not said that life is becoming 'harder for pirates', rather that a pirate's life is becoming 'harder to enjoy'. i ask you to ponder upon this, as there is a clear distinction in the meaning.to address your question about my opinions on gatecamps, i'm sure we'd both accept that gatecamps are definitely not a new practice. i accept that they are an established tactic, that some enjoy and others find boring. however, i think it is important to appreciate that it is an over-simplification to say that gatecamping is becoming easier or more difficult over a period of time - without considering that many changes have affected it in different ways. i do not profess to be a leading expert on the topic of gatecamping, but i'll do my best to analyse the problem.let's look at the problem longitudinally:examples of factors that might have made gatecamps easier:- superior tanking ability - heavy interdictors- (0.0. only) interdictors and warp disruption fields- gallente recons (?)- overheating (?)- an increased eve population (?)examples of factors that might have made gatecamps less rewarding:- warp to 0- carriers, jump bridges and jump freighters (?)- (low sec) factional warfare (?)- jump clones (?)- invention (?)the list is by no means exhaustive, but it gives me an impression that the problem is not an issue of single aetiology. however, i'd rather not write a thesis on the topic here and now :dnow, let's bring ourselves to the crux of the issue. i will, for our purposes, make an assumption that the current system is problematic and that both pirates and their prey are unhappy with the status quo. i repeat, this is an assumption - i would rather gather more information to allow for a more fact-substantiated opinion. ok, so how would i deal with it?let me explain my principles in dealing with this issue, if it were proven to be a problem:- i don't want to support handing out whimsical nerfs- i would rather support creating new and improving existing things for people to doif you refer to my earlier posts in this thread you will notice that i have supported discussing the following notions:- increasing the number of stargate connections: where these would be sited is a discussion in itself. the principle behind this is that the eve population has grown considerably since the last introduction of new connections to bypass chokepoints, and that they should stay proportional- support an improvement in the variety and appeal of other options available for pirates: if you refer to my main post about improving piracy, as well as to the answers i gave mr slarti on the previous page, you will get the main gist of what i my ideas are in this area"

"greetings scagga,i do not know if you remember me but i'm really surprised and glad to see you campaigning for the 2nd csm election. i have read all your ideas and well... i'm really impressed by your creative potential. ideas and concepts you simply add here are just answering to questions / issues in a really \"universe-realistic feeling\" way (flatlining, outpost pillaging, and many other ones for example).as you seem to be interested by the pirate scale/gameplay/side, i'm wondering if you are thinking of new ideas as well for the bounty hunter system ? it is right you actually need some nrds 0.0 alliance to tolerate neutrals and \"empire-like\" activities in those remote areas, but well... scagga will correct me if i'm wrong but from what i understood in his program i saw big new opportunities to see alliances - if they want to become empires - to consider their territories for inhabitants and population, followers, market side effects, settlements/colonization, etc etc, and not only for ressources and isk-basic rewards only (farming, farming, farming...).

"i need to go through devblogs to check bit more about wardecs cause i am not so much familiar with current mechanics, but they for sure need some attention. i remember some things were changed but before checking some current facts i cant tell much more. when it comes to suicide ganking i see that as valid option for gameplay because current mechanics are allowing it. ccp nerfed it recently so i am ok with it.i am personaly heavily involved in all aspects of industry as i am leading one of the strongest industrial entities ingame. from mining, trade, invention, t2, cap and supercap production to pos chains etc. i am handling those on daily level. eve economy model is close to perfect as it can be in one \"spaceship internet game\" and ccp is regularly adressing \"industrial\" issues, tho ofcourse there is always room for future improvement.i will adress all issues regardless if they are affecting carebears, pvpers, mission runners, miners, inventors of just guys who likes to login and chat in noobcorp channel. my priorities are the issues mentioned in my program, but with same passion i will pursue all other problems. my intention was not to flirt with whole new eden population so i could get cheap votes from \"empire carebears\", thats the only reason i set only 3 \"main\" problems i see atm in eve, but i could easily wrote 40 of them if i wanted."

"so... no chair for a month or so after the election?"
"assuming the csm is diverse in its composition (ie, no more than a third of the members of one alliance get elected), then most definately yes."
"i would have been more satisfied with them increasing the effectiveness of missiles rather than slowing the ships down. something needed to be done though. grid overcrowding is a big issue and i don't think titans were the answer. the doomsday made things worse in some aspects along with ruining the \"fun\" of the pilots who were caught in the blast. the titan also has the jumpbridge which can help grid-choking lag by bypassing gatecamps but people have used it to bring ships directly unto a crowded grid already too. i don't really see a solution here because everyone will want to project as much power as possible in a fight to win. correction, there are no \"fair\" solutions which don't give one side an advantage over the other. ccp needs to be more innovative about the sov system and pos warfare. there should be more advantages to having a capital (sov 4) system. whether it is defense guns on gates and outpost, or something added in the asteroid belts to aid the alliance who holds the area. pos warfare adjustments should be made too, and a good solution would be to decrease the whole grid overload combat that often happens there.missions need to have more variables to them rather than a set script of what you'll find and how many. the ai being improved would be great, but i'm not sure how that could be done. one thing i'd like to see though is roaming npc gangs that are capable of going through gates or chasing fleeing targets. random variables. create missions that have npc blockading a station from being docked at, or having taken over said station and the defense guns too! i've got plenty of ideas here, and i'll be talking to the devs at fanfest about them.i'll be at fanfest this week and i welcome anyone to approach me and ask questions about my campaign stances. look for the guy in the black/red manual wheelchair among the goons. thats me."

"as a candidate for the csm, what is the most important issue your campaign would be about?only one issue, you have to prioritize.digital"
"the most important issue to me at the moment is the stagnation of the 0.0 endgame. the act of conquering space is simply not rewarding enough for the amount of effort required. i think an immense amount of time has been spent on things like factional warfare, industry, concord etc. while we really haven't seen any love in the 0.0 space in a long time.we really need to push to find some balance there while there's still players left."
"work on improving player-csm-ccp communication.the ingame issues i care about are far to diverse to pick a personal favorite from, but i think that getting the csm more involved with the players, especially those that do not visit the forums. as well as assuring that ccp contacts us more frequently if they have questions they want player opinions about. and last, getting everything we're doing documented and organized, although that's probably going to by my task because ccp is horribly slow in providing us with tools. this is going to pay off more in the long run than any inidivual issue i think."
"like the last election, i'm not going to campaign for a specific item - so i guess the most important issue for me is representing the players wishes (all of them, not a niche group) to ccp. yep, i'm a socialist hippie."
"ok, let's make it more specific.what would be one thing you would like to change or not to change about eve?digital"
"i'm sure that most candidates would be able to mention very important issues that they would give priority to. but this question doesn't really do the candidates justice because: eve is not a one-issue game. a similarly structured question is like asking someone which finger they'd be most willing to have cut off (my answer would be the index finger of my non-dominant hand). the answer might be interesting, but useless for election purposes due to its limited scope.a more practical answer to your question is answering it in the conditional sense: my priority issue depends on what other people propose - the principle being that if elected i would make sure that the csm brings up the most important issues in every field. therefore i will make sure that the ideas i bring forward compliment those brought up by other csm members, so that as a result the csm pays appropriate attention to all of eve's different facets."
"i believe the question to be nonsensical, if only because several issues are going to get talked with ccp and worked on by them at once, just like they have several teams of people working on different aspects of the game.the major thing to focus on would be to improve the relationship between ccp and the rest of the playerbase (and the csm) in order to guarantee that the issues that matter most to us, no matter what they are, actually get actionned visibly (progress reports and so on.). with that in place, debating the issues can be done.meissa"
"taking off my csm candidate hat, and addressing the rephrased question;i'd love to see more opportunities for exploring the darker side of a character supported by game mechanics. ideally, such a route should be available in the relatively unlawful badlands of lowsec, which are in need of love.that'd be a start. i also have to agree with darius regarding 0.0 stagnation etc. it also is in need of attention.take care,arithron"
"of course, there's a lot of topics i care about, but if i had to place one above the others it'd be the user interface. the current one sucks, and it provides both a worse play experience for everybody and a major barrier to the entry of new players. i want to see a ui that lets the player interact with the game in as simple, effective, and seamless a way as possible - it should be slick, effort-minimizing, and heavily modifiable. i know ccp has done some work on this in the past and they're planning to do more in the future, but i feel there's still a major role for the csm to direct these efforts."

"i think to make these useful you need 3 things.1. a covert ops cloak,2. modify stealth bombers to give them a specialist role in taking down cyno jammers (take down does not have to mean destroy, just render inoperative). make it a special module requiring an extra skill or two.3. a short range detector for that module for pos'this would give bops a niche roll and would make them a ship to be guarded against. the idea is to give it a roll similar to the target marking that spec ops soldiers sometimes do these days, namely removing strategicly chosen defenses to create an opening for the actual combat units. the bo's sneak in (might need multiple to provide enough fuel for a longer jump), pop a covert cyno, a force recon and a dozen specially fitted stealth bombers come in and drop the cyno jammer, pop a normal cyno and the rest drop in.the detector should provide some counter, when a covert cyno opens too close to the detector, it should unmask it, so there is a beacon for everyone in system. if you own the system and see one appear it means there is a good chance that if you do not stop the cyno jammer being taken down then bad things(tm) are coming soon.as a secondary effect this might open up a bit more of 0.0 space to newer alliances since to be safe from a drop you would need to be able to monitor gates."
"its not emo its frustration on the point it takes soo long and why ccp does not give more reaction on multiple treads about this black ops needed fixing.

"i've stumbled over the fact, which i believe many pilots in their career has. the fact that people more or less often alter the content of kill mails prior to posting them.the tampering maybe be done to remove unwanted pilots or to change the statistics in one way or another. as a techie, i believe that this could be fixed in a very simple way.say for example, that the kill mails sent are signed by gpg, which is a freeware and may be downloaded from"
"the thing is, if you want to assure accuracy in the system, you should be ensuring it all the way through. not only when it comes to ensuring that individual mails are accurate, but also when it comes to ensuring that they're representative and complete. if people not on the kill have a right to know how it went, then they also have a right to know about the kill if you'd rather keep it quiet, right? ccp has said that's not going to happen, and i agree with their rationale. killmails exist to inform the players involved of what happened, any use outside the dead guy and the guy who scored the final blow is incidental."

"i agree. where is the risk? how are jfs going to explode? they must have a weak point, and this weak point is when they return from low-sec/0.0 to high-sec.i do not support the idea of cynos in high-sec. soon, someone will ask why a rorqual cannot use the high-sec cyno, since it is not a war ship like the jfs.edit just for typos."
"i have to slightly agree with this post in one regard and thats is the hi sec griefers that hide in npc corps. i know this has been largely reduced since the suicide nerf but still happens. the issue is you cannot war dec them and only the griefed can attack them which for most pve/traders/miners is near impossible. a solution is that once you go negative statis you are booted to a war dec'able corp whether it be npc or player it doesnt really matter."
"how about this.a negative concord/security status means your no longer protected by concord.so if someone with a higher security status want's to attack you... they can and will.except podding.tack on a bounty for killing the ship.. and you got yourself an incentive to be on the right side of the law.since these guys like living in low-sec and being pirates... why not make it low sec for the entirety of the game.this allows people who get greifed to have the ability to form \"lynch mobs\" to attack greifers/can tippers and the bulk.granted my idea is rough at best... but maybe someone can polish it off?"
"doesn't that already happen when your sec status hits -5, except you can also pod the pirates ?i think npcs also attack their ships.unless they get a friend to pod them for the isk. the bounty system needs a massive overhaul."
"i'm not sure about the -5 bit... as i was warned by concord for attacking them without dong a pvp can tip maneuver.course they had a -1 or something.as for the bounty system... you can make it difficult to acquire a bounty ifa: its someone's alt on the same account. (easy if,then,else clause)b: its someone who has a negative security status rating.... ie: criminal of there own.in other words.. the only way to raise your security status... is to rat your brains out."
"yes, if one character on the account is online, then the other can't be online.what about alts with a positive sec status sitting on another account ?plenty of people run multiple accounts, or it could be a friends account.then just bring the criminal and bounty collector to the same safe spot in low sec, criminal in a pod, collector in a noob ship."
"the only way to \"fix\" macro mining is to put some basic macro controls in the game, so that everyone can take advantage of it. with the latest server updates which expands the number of people each system can support there is no reason not to. besides 90% of the people would just use these with multi-accounts to help stream line their 3-5 ship operation that they are currently having to micro manage.if you want to keep the numbers of afk miners down, make them only work in low sec/0.0. that way someone can go looking for them and have a little pirate fun.the only other solution is ccp needs to get off their butt and add the ability to prospect in the game, exploration is weak at this, so that you can hunt down ultra valuable ore types that can only be mined with small ships and specialized lasers, and leave the big rocks to the strip mining operations.there are only two kinds of people that whine about it macro miners. miners who find stripped belts in high sec and assume anyone that can mine faster than them or that is part of a mining op must be a bot.and high sec wanna-b pirates that are too scared to go to low sec or 0.0 and get mad when no one pays attention to their griefing or is using a hulk that doesn't need to drop a can to profitably mine and there fore invulnerable as far as they are concerned.neither has much of a legitament gripe.my bad - this stupid alt keeps defaulting on my posts. - ackuula"
"macro mining and afk mining are two different things. let's face it, mining can be boring at times. some of the time limit solutions will jut not work, point blank. most of you have not taken ice mining into consideration and how long laser cycles are.i cannot tell you how many times i manually target rocks of various sizes that i know my laser can get several cycles from, then i run to kitchen to start dinner, eat dinner, help my kids with their homework, play some online poker in the background, remote into the job to fix something that i was paged for, run to the corner store, etc... many times, i come back and the targeted rock has been gone for a long time and i just floating there afk. i am not however macro mining just because i do not respond to local or to someone's private message."

"hithanks for taking this point further with ccp. as it was also point out, a larger limit would allow us to use the courier contract to haul assembled ships (rigged ones esp). with regards to the envisaged cons, i do think that this can easily be minimised through a warning system; a specific warning would pop up to players who are about to accept a contract which requires the delivery of a package which does not fit in the cargohold of their current ship. this warning could clearly highlight the volume of the package and asks the player to re-confirm. if at that stage, the player still fails to notice that the courier contract is bigger than any of the ships they can fly (freighter pilots may still accept courier contracts while in a shuttle), than i guess it the loss of collateral would be well dserved! thanks once againrt"
"how about the removal of the mandatory ownership declaration? i believe there should be discrete courier services too where who put the mission up for whom should only ever be disclosed upon completion or if it fails, if at all."
"why discussing the courier system can you not make it cancel insurance to do a courier contract after this? obviously repackaging voids insurance but while i am not in the ship i don't get anything anyway so once i hop back in it insurance should resume.unless you let us put bombs in other people's cargo hold which isn't really on topic."

"sounds interesting ... really. how about adding an hacking usage that can be used on a gate. what could you do with this control? redirect incoming ships to a specificed location automatically decloaked? turn off a gate (such that people that warp to zero, can't auto warp out?) ... other ideas? how long could you keep control? a concord response after a specified time should be based on the security of the system (and minimal in 0.0?), but nonetheless should be sufficient enough to deter the frequent use of this tactic ... other thoughts?"

"the op doesn't support \"hide & seek\" he supports \"seek & gank\"your idea sound like it's all about your fun and none about mine. if you are having difficulty finding targets you are not in the right area, but then you might become more vulnerable yourself, which tends to be avoided by the \"eve should be about my fun\" crowd.the scanner mechanics that pretty much let you locate anyone anywhere in system in under a few minutes is just as broke as cloaks 100% invulnerability to it.the current mechanic is either all or nothing. there are no places to hide, that are sort of safe. you either or in a station, cloaked, at a pos and are basically invulnerable, or you are at a planet, asteroid belt, gate, safe spot, and are about to be ganked.they need to add some more variation to the game before we start talking cloak nerfs.some of my ideas.multiple warp in points around planets, instead of the exact same oneasteroid belts that are 5x10 larger than the current ice belts that, that must be navigated in order to reach the target.asteroids that you can park next to that affect scan returnsship grave yards that give numerous returns and are visually clutter so you hide among the wreckspassive and active probe scanning and the ability to detect active scanning and be able to jump to them, much like cynos are nownebulas that drastically reduce visibility (overview range) and hamper scanning attempts solar flare activity that affects scansthe ability to power down your ship to reduce all signatures as well as turn off those damn running lightsthe removal of local as we know it"

"well bounty hunting system is imho nonexistent. all you can do is to add bounty to pilot with negative security status. on a quick note i would add a bit of roleplaying to it - f.e. concord agents could give you a mission to pursuit people with highest bounties by providing you their current locations and ship they are flying or something like that, but frankly i need bit more time to brainstorm it.with so much broken stuff atm, i really think ambulation is totally unnecessary and personaly i am not looking forward to it. from the other side i assume ccp will get a bunch of new/old customers with ambulation and thats proly their main reason for introducing it. nah, i would spoil her, tho i bought her new pink notebook so she can finally stop harrasing my computer for fekin facebook.thanx for questions..and compliments..."

"honestly, no. and i don't believe anyone else should either.the general players of eve pick and choose (ideally at any rate) the person they believe will mediate in a fashion representing their preferred method and values. the person that the player base choose to be their spokesperson should accept that responsibility. having elected officials appoint themselves into positions of power (in this case the power to control direction and subjects of discussion) cheapens the entire electoral process.yes. it may mean we get someone who is less than qualified in the chairman's position, but i would argue that the csm is small enough in size so that anybody can learn quickly enough to perform adequately in the position. while the csm would benefit from some limitations on discussion (no reintroducing failed votes without new content as herschel pointed out in his thread is one i personally very much agree with) i believe a more free form discussion environment would benefit the csm more.while this is my opinion, should the elected leader step down and submit to a vote for the chairmanship or indeed decide not to step down (as long as he announced this to be his intention before becoming elected) this too is fine. as long as the chairperson acts in accordance with his election promises then they will have my support."

"even being able to queue up 1-2 skills would help a lot."
"they shouldn't let it be any different than the main server. the whole point is to test how changes would affect current game dynamics. if everyone could speed train or have access to all skills, no one would be using what they would be regularly using in game so nothing would get properly tested.all they need to do is mirror more often for things to match up."
"at the very least, give us the ability to mirror our character from tranquility on command instead of once in a blue moon."
"great idea...after all, a test server is intended to test different 'options' before investing time (and thus money) on tq - having to wait as much as on tq to train for skills doesn't help at all, especially since different options might need different skills. some skills could be really long too; just think about wanting to try 2 - 3 carriers before going for one on tq.facilitating testing will also benefit ccp as players are more likley to identify bugs quickly.so full support to any option which would significantly decrease the time needed to acquire skill levels on test serversrtedit: some typos and further clarifications."

"this would seriously screw up camps that are trying to bump ships away from the undock point on the stations. if ccp does this, they need to change undocking in general or pvp at a station goes completely down the drain."
"5% decrease in power grid required per level?and people use covetors because 20m-80 is a lot for the hull."
"ahaha, elastic collision with a 40m hunk of metal hits a some 10m of metal plating (top estimate of bs armour based on ingame values) at 8km/s? yeah. of course."
"whatever it is you come up with... better make sure you don't run into a problem where suddenly you have a pile up in jita 4.there are so many frakking ships piled into places in this game where such mechanics would cause mass destruction of ships.heck.. just having someone park there big fat ship in front of the exit would be enough to be a problem.so don't forget to take that into account.i do agree... ramming should be employed as a tactic in this game.... it would make things... more interesting."
"if bumping is removed (and it should be), the nano nerf needs to keep people from getting to the gates in under 2 seconds and station undocking needs to be revamped even more. first nano nerf, next station undock, then kill bumping. collisions will be a huge problem in jita though. just going to point that one out."
"i disagree. last time i bumped a station with my carrier (through a cyno) i rebounded at thousands of meters per second. as far as fleet battles, this would end blobs."
"bumping doesn't make any sense from a realistic perspective and breaks immersion.a small bumblebee of a frigate should not be able to bump a battleship, it should shatter when hitting the ship at such high speeds that are used for bumping causing some damage small damage to the battleship while doing so.but for gaming purposes, i suppose the frigate need not disintegrate into a little mangled speck of broken metal on the side of the battleship but could instead take some damage.in short: -bumping should be tweaked heavily into a more realistic system. -ships that do or recieve the bumping should take damage in correlation to speeds and sizes of the ships involved."
"marauders have suffered from the fact that those willing to drop enough isk on a hull for one are generally better served by spending that isk outfitting a faction battleship due to the fact that while tanking has diminishing returns, you can always benefit from higher dps.so give marauders a bonus to scan probe launcher times. 10% per level of marauder skill, the same as covops but applying only to scan probe(and not recon probe) launchers.marauders are designed as \"deep space\" pve vessels, this change would make marauders far more attractive to explorers as it would eliminate the need to use a scanning covops."
"as long as it doesn't apply to recon probes (as you mentioned), this seems reasonable."
"makes sense to me"

"i wouldn't say yes, if one character on the account is online, then other can't be online... you kill the multi-session feature.i'm saying that the so called would block the bounty and or give a negative standing rating for exploiting the system.as for the second part.... that's not something you can avoid.... but it does point out one thing... you have to pay an additional 15 bucks a month to have that privilege.considering the fact that the bulk of the community just threw a #### fit and fell in it over ghost training.. not likely to be a problem.edit: honestly there's no real easy solution on the second part."
"i can see where this is coming from, and i agree that missions are horribly broken in terms of mineral impact. i have an idea that has been bounced around the forums for a long time, and think it has the best possibility: remove basic t1 loot from mission/rat droppings.meta items will still be dropped at the same rate, as well as ammo/drones. however, you won't have to haul home 50 small energy transfer arrays from your mission. npc bounties, to compensate, should be increased by about 10%. drones will be unchanged in the alloys they give out."
"i always thought drones should offer bounties.as well as bounties should be given for empire vs empire type of roles.like being minmatar... killing amarians should give you a bounty.stuff like that.but i'm inclined to agree with a increase in alloy percentages."
"sigh, check the data before speaking, especially as you want to run for the csm. 1) mineral value of the mission loot is about 20% of the total mission payout, with a way higher percentage for drone missions. 2) bounties are another 25% for most missions (but there aren't bounties in all the missions against some empire units or against drones).3) compensating for the removal of 20% of the reward (mineral value of the loot) increasing the bounties will require at least a 40% increase in the bounties (in reality it would require a 75% increase, but as you spend less time looting it can be less) to keep the total reward on the same level.4) removing the minerals and increasing the bounties (even by 10%) will cause an immediate spike in inflation as more isk will enter the game and less material.5) removing rat dropping in 0.0 will have a even worse effect as they are the source of a large percentage of the low end minerals used for the production of ammunition and modules. the only positive thing is that it will lessen the effect of the insurance on the value of the minerals. if (and it is even possible) prices don't shot upwards and the mineral basket will keep dictating the mineral prices the effect would be even worse: low end will shot upward (most expendable, especially ammunitions use minerals found in high sec) wile high ends (used in more permanent items) will tank even further. at the same time every \"rare\" items will see more competition from people with fatter wallets, so faction items and gtc prices will rise too. sure the loot/bounty/mission reward system would benefit from an overhaul but it must be very carefully balanced. a broad change with little thought on balancing as the one you are depicting would almost certainly have huge negative after effects.edit: seeing that you are agreeing with jenna about too cheap minerals argument it is possible that the inflation is what you want. but it will be in the wrong direction, increasing the price of low end (not the value as they will simply keep up with inflation) and lowering the price of high end.2<U+FFFD> edit: corrected the % after checking my mission database results."
"this has to be the world's most pointless warning message ever. why would someone not want to join a channel with people inside it? if you need a warning that people maybe inside a channel and could talk to you, perhaps it's time to close the game client.if anything the warning should say:the channel xxx does not exist, do you wish to create it?this would help people joining channels but misspelling the name and not noticing."
"i disagree and believe pointless error messages are actually a good idea.also first post kablammo"
"yeah, that is one of the annoying, pointless warning messages."
"i have some ideas in the works to spice up mining, including making it far more profitable by removing t1 loot from missions and by mixing up the asteroid types in all securities of space. i don't think any one area of the game should be able to be done afk, except skill training of course. mining could be done afk for short times, but so long as you check back about every cycle, you'll be fine.i want to make mining far more interesting than it is right now, without punishing miners or other things. one of the ideas i've seen which have potential is making you have to target a vein to get a better yield on the asteroid.anybody who says macroers aren't a big deal obviously has never been to an ice belt or a roid belt in .9 or 1.0 space. there are less of them now then there used to be, but they still need to be dealt with. i'm not saying that my idea is perfect or even good, but it's an idea to get rid of them, and should be considered carefully with other ideas on that merit alone."
"i have to agree... there are many afk miners there that are inadvertently leaving there ships behind... but i also say that being afk in that situation is begging for trouble as well.it's not macro mining by any means.... but still a bit of an issue to some.as for the macro miners... there are corps out there who do hunt them... even in high sec.some funny videos to watch too."
"i initially thought this would be a nice addition, but upon reflection i think it would in effect make jumping into ether lowsec or contested/pirate null sec a bit to secure/safe.the cyno going off in local (esp. low sec) is like a billboard for a capital gank. its the risk you take when jumping into these systems and shouldn't be removed."
"no. first of all why would those factions allow a hostile empire to throw down cyno gens in their territory. would you mind it if bob were allowed to throw down cyno gens in your station systems even when you have sov?second of all, cyno gens and other logistical structures are meant as a bonus when you have defended space for awhile. your proposal just gives you cyno gens immediately for no effort. npc and low sec is specifically designed to make it less focused on capital ships and capital blobs.lastly, you are in an alliance of over 2 thousand members in a coalition of god knows how many and you cannot find a single one to light a cyno? maybe you should get better alliance mates or better friends.since when do you get something after ccp changes something? what is next, can i petition ccp for my polycarbons that are now worthless? your logic fails on every level."
"i don't like your opinion and you're not agreeing with me, so i don't want to see you post."
"in all honesty your just a whiner looking for a free hand out who doesn't give a damn about balance or game mechanics.look... take a step back and think about this.... lets say you allow such a thing.1: it doesn't change the fact that people are going to use alt's and what not do handle things.2: the balance of power gets completely thrown out of wack at that point.... now you get an increase in jump traffic... our friendly yet hated pirate gate camps become pointless so they shift to cyno areas.. thereby increasing the traffic around known cyno fields. thus making your life a living hell.3: people start throwing a fit and request cyno jammers to be deployed.... there by not only canceling your fun little respite out... but making it nigh impossible to jump period.4: now people are forced to do things the old fashioned way.... and that means flying through space and risking gnaking.5: more blobs show up to escort said ships thereby increasing the lag.now... understanding the above.... you just got what you wanted and also got your worst nightmare.welcome to pandora's box.so is it really worth the trouble? with all due respect... if you can't figure it out by now.. you shouldn't be here.balance game mechanics requires a great deal of care and consideration.... it means you think of others.. not your bloody self.i'm sorry your time zone doesn't permit ease of use... eve is supposed to be not fair.... that's the whole point. it takes work...hard work. so forgive me if i can't help but shine a spotlight in your face to point out the flaws in your logic."
"absolutly not"
"hi i'm not very familiar with pos behaviour as well, however it might be useful to look whether the option 'attack if aggression' is ticked. this option is (as i understand it) pretty much useless in terms of additional safety, but can be very dangerous to corp members as the tower will consider anyone, even corp members, as enemies if they get flagged for some reason or another. if by attacking the can the corp member got flagged(for ex, attacking someone else's can), he will get flagged (yellow timer) and the tower will attack him if that option is ticked.i cannot think of another 'legit' reason if that option is not ticked. in any case, always keep that option off :)rt"
"did you have an aggression timer showing in the upper left corner?"
"can you imagine the nightmare of managing moons in say even 5 systems where an alliance might have 10-20 pos anchored? with the system proposed it would be a living hell i think.enemies can also sabotage moon production by shattering cores with just a couple of probes -> this is sort of good in my opinion because == a war comes, everyone suffers, that is how it is in rl and its not such a bad system where due to wars production and markets change.so i don't and do support the idea at the same time."
"well this may seem like a stupid question, but eft didn't let me activate more than one ecm at a time...what am i missing? is it for certain ships only? or skill based?edit!!! i figured it out."
"only ecm burst are one-at-a-time"
"this. look at your signal strength, compare with ecm strength. so, a frigate will get blocked repeatedly by a solid ecm pilot, or cruiser almost always, a battleship will be about 50/50, a carrier 1/6.there is no stacking. additional modules simply improve the statistical probability."

"didn't know it was this specific one presented to ccp.glad to know it now.thx."
"are there any good proposals on how to deal with a \"cooperative outlaw\" from being \"killed\" by a friend and then splitting the bounty between them?"
"here is a weakness with your idea:person a has a slightly negative sec status (-1) but is not an 'outlaw' (no bounty). he believes himself reasonably safe travelling in highsec.people b, c, and d are gankbears looking to bad their killboard. they lock up a and have their fingers poised over the function keys. player a ignores them, figuring concord will keep them at bay.person b calls up his friend, person e, who is in a station. person e quickly puts a 1 isk bounty on person a. seconds later, people b, c, and d mash f1-f8, obliterating person a, then kill his pod while person a is trying to figure out what happened.unless i'm missing something, the above will become routine under your mechanincs.i would actually be happy with a much simpler system: just allow pilots with a positive sec-status (or more than a 2.0, perhaps) to buy a bounty-hunter's license that allows them to attack pilots with negative sec status in low sec without losing sec status -- and without crimal flagging -- for doing so. simple. test this system for a while, then revisit the reward part of bounty-hunting (which is currently broken).leave high-sec alone; there's too much potential for exploiting, in my opinion.(support for the concept of revamping bounty hunting, and i'm glad that ccp is already looking into options.)"
"eva has my vote and my support."
"he mis-stated my position. the promise was no resubmission without a new supporter, not new content. it's not a major thing - i mostly stuck it on because i was in a mood to keep writing - but it is different enough from what's already been passed to not be crazy."
"no, if i would get the most votes i would stay chairman. seems reasonable enough to me.the person with most votes represents the largest amount of players/voters so seems ok to have that person hold the chair. stepping down makes no sense to me really."
"more sin;t always better, but in the challenge to attract new customers and keep the old it is often the easy fallback. introducting new mechanics and improving existing ones should be stressed but until you can show that there is a reward in doing so for ccp your going to have trouble selling it."
"best possible fixing of (laggg buggs and glitches) that are still around. for example: a pilot still in your overwiew wile you are allready 3 systems away from him/her, large fleets lagging like crazy and ur dead before u notice ur targeted... a plain simple easy topic maybe but still important enough to mention it again i think. offcourse ccp is allways working on progression for these type of problems on the server but u know, sometimes u wonder if theres really enough attention to the trouble out there..."
"click here for an exciting announcement."
"with \"movable ui\" already integrated into the next expansion all we really need is the ability to off-center the screen focus to be able to move the ship to the center of 1 monitor.next to that it would be nice to have in game support to span across multiple monitors.full support!"
"please!"
"hell yea this would be nice"
"here is a relatively simple one:disconnects and drone control"
"bump. i've made a lot of revisions to this so if you haven't read it in awhile i could suggest you do that."
"signed - want aurora back - want interactive events back"
"as a relative newb, i find the current situation particularly confusing. when ccp announces \"news,\" i never know if it is real news or fake news (e.g., if there is a lost convoy, should we actually go looking for it? is there something i should be doing for the trapped miners? etc.)."
"absolutely!"
"you make it sound like ghost training was used by ccp as a bribe to keep subscribers... i'm all for the removal of ghost training, you pay to play, simple. ghost training was a way to progress through the game without paying, which i think is stupid."

"as it helps having multiple accounts i'm all for it!"

"i want it right now!!!"
"yesssssssss"
"now most definitely a needed feature. you took away ghost training - fair enough. but now give us some love.don't care if it's a skill queue, or training the same one from 1-5. just give us something. pretty please.because unfortunately i don't have access to eve from work."
"signed"
"definitely supported."
"oh yes!"
"so, the issue behind this is when, for example, one is running a mission, disconnects, then warps back in to find one's drones unresponsive and 70 km away, and you get to go fetch them in a armor rigged dominix. =) would it be feasible to make it so during a disconnect warp out / warp in, drone control is maintained?"
"i've run many missions where, in the middle of them, my internet decides to cut off or my computer glitches or something. this would make a lot of sense, and allow us to salvage some of the drones.i think the drones should still be attacked by the npcs, however. they would immediately head back to the beacon or something, allowing for easy pickup."
"maybe give them a return to dronebay command when the ship starts to emergency warp. that does not save them 100% of the times, but better than nothing."
"if it was possible to implement something to save drones, i'm all for it."
"i would also like to see this. i myself have lost connection many times, most of the time it's because my cable company decided that they needed to do work right then and there and never informed me, but in any case, i warp out and proceed back to find my drones, about 30k from where i currently am and given that my ships max speed is right around 130 i can enjoy the long trip over to pick up these stupid things. often times, i end up saying screw it and just leaving them behind as i tend to make my own and have a few thousand back at home base."
"yeah.... i think its fair to say that if you disconn and your ship makes to warp... an emergency recall would be good.and the number that get back to you would depend entirely on your alignment time of course./me signed"
"hot key to regain control of drones within range of ship would be nice."
"my isp had a hickup and i my myrmidon warped away during ratting, i immediately logged back in to see my self in warp, then back, then while approaching watch 2 of my drones getting slaughtered by the rats before i could scoop them.i not only want a emergency \"return to drone bay\" protocol i also want to be able to turn off/on the emergency warp protocol.edit: forgot the thumb.."
"i support pretty much all of the ideas in this thread."
"why would you want to turn off the emergency warp? that's like asking you to get ganked for logging off and not being able to log on or something."
"i only half support this.a: over half the people here.... no offense of course.... dont bother to read or think before they frakking post.sorry... but thats a fact. sometimes of which i'm guilty of (will by not searching for older topics).most of them are hate threads/trolls/deconstructive/repeat.b: csm cant have the full rights to this board while we can only repy.... would make things tough.compromise: we only grant those who have proven to be effective and trustworthy with the job... while only allowing everyone else to reply.the csm can grant rights to those who obviously aren't here for ####s and giggles.... let alone to cause trouble."

"watching the third (i think) alliance tournament match between iac and bob is very possibly why i am still in this game.up to that point i had no idea who any 0.0 entities were nor did i know the depths of pvp which this game provides. seeing that tournament motivated me and others in my corp of the time to venture out into other aspects of the game.since that first tournament i have watched all subsequent ones. even though i have never been part of a competing alliance it is nevertheless always a pleasure to watch them compete.the alliance tournaments have given the major alliances an opportunity to put their e-peens on the line. but i think the greatest thing about the tournaments is the fact that it widens the eve experience to players who may not have seen much of eve beyond their local chat."
"ok, let's look at this from physics. momentum is equal to mass * velocity, so a claw interceptor (mass of 1,125,000 kg) moving at 8 km/s has a total momentum of 8000*1125000=9,000,000,000 kg*m/s. if all of its momentum was transferred into, say, a dominix, (mass of 105,000,000 kg) then you have 9000000000/105000000=85.71m/s change in velocity. from what i have seen with bumping that seems pretty close, but it is not perfect, so mabye if they just implemented more realistic collision mechanics things would be better?"
"like punching through the bs armour then producing a heated fireball of 1000 tons of molten metal moving at several times the speed of sound through the battleship? yeah, something like that, roughly."
"ok, talk about realism.i fail to see why it ain't realistic. guys we have to remember it's space here and there is nothing preventing a huge object from accelerating heavily when an object of whatever size and mass is colliding into it.if we do want realism so badly, then how come i have to keep my ab running in order to maintain speed? as there is nothing slowing me down in space i should just be going forever until i decide to slow it down, but slowing down should require power, just as much as accelerating would.there is no sound in space, so please remove all explosion sounds.there is no reason why a large object would be slower and less agile then a smaller ship. again it's space!now i agree we don't need the above to change, and yes, we might do something about the annoying bumping problem. but please don't demand such a change to make it more realistic, as that simply ain't the case!cheers,digaph"
"to be honest, there is nothing wrong with bumping, and it is needed for a lot of purposes.i agree that realism should be out, because the realistic thing would be enabling interceptors&frigates to do suicide ramming rather then bumping, and i don't think people would be particularly happy with being one-shotted by a suiciding interceptor (which is realistic really)."
"very much in agreement"
"makes sence to meh!"
"yes"
"this applies to alliances that have alts, or coalitions like the northern and sothern 0.0 poses. also thinking that your alliance pos will not be used by your allies at one time or another is ignorance."
"even fully expanded a hulk will fill it's cargo hold in 3 to 4 cycles (12 minutes). it takes less than 20 to fill a can, which is easily twice the maximum expanded cargo capacity of a hulk.by your above statement you admit to using macros since you can walk away for 24 minutes and not suffer cargo shutdown. ergo, you should be banned forthwith."
"hmm...cant implement this or any similiar idea without hurting us \"real miners\"..and could someone please show me what statistics your using to show the eve economy is deflated? seriously since this arguement has been used quite a bit regarding macros etc..id like to see your info. i was actualy somewhat leaning on this one till the predictable but inevitable mention of essentialy converting all npc corp players to trial accounts..then i realized where this was all going..uh uh nope cant support."

"so guys i have a negative -2.00 with minmitar and a negative -2.07 with gallante not that this was done on purpose but was done all the same, doe,s this mean i am never gonna de able to get those faction standings back up , in which case if i only work caldari and amarr means that these 2 nagative standings i have will lower even more till eventually i cant enter their space ."
"you have to chose what pirate faction you can run mission for based on what empire you worked for. for every empire faction there are neutral pirate factions, that don't lose standing when you do empire storylines.for example guristas (as the main enemies of caldari) are neutral to gallente for obvious reasons (\"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\").angel cartel and serpentis are neutral to caldari. there is no level 4 missions that requires you to kill serpentis (in wc you can chose to run against guristas, \"cargo delivery\" doesn't require to kill ships). angel cartel ships only appear at angel extravaganza, if you reject that mission you can work up your way to caldari faction standing +10 without losing any standings with serpentis/angel cartel, and later do missions for that pirates without ruining your caldari standing (they don't give missions against caldaris either, no derived standing loss).find a pirate faction that is neutral to the empire faction which you run missions for.if you got your faction standing below -2 by doing that rare missions which are given to you against a neutral pirate faction, you can still get the faction standing up by running missions to small side faction pirates, that are liked by the pirate faction which you want to run missions for (check the standing tab of that side pirate faction), for example thukkers or the syndicate for angels/serpentis (in case thukkers have storyline agents, didn't check that)."
"its not that 'easy'.if you have -2 standings (modified) - you could perhaps still adjust it above -2 by training diplomacy to v (if you havent done so already.besides with gallente and minmatar - they have quite a number of factions which they like. so if you are still able to run missions for those factions, doing important storyline ones for those will give you a derived faction standings gain with minmatar/gallente (eg. soe)well, again its not that 'easy' ^^a) you dont only get negative standings by completing important storyline missions for enemy factions, but by killing structures / ships too. and this negative impact is not related to any gain you have.basically you could manage to have only negative standings with every faction in game by just killing their ships/structures (and not running missions at all).b) there are certain factions (especially blood/shansha/guristas) that are only positive towards each other. so if you run missions in amarr space - or just rat a lot against these factions, its quite easy to get them all to a value, that makes it impossible to ever recover again ... and run missions for them.c) if you happen to run pirate faction missions, you will notice that you will be sent against concord from time to time. thus killing those (see a) will have an impact on your concord standings, which are not recoverable at all, because concord likes no other faction, nor do they give out important storyline missions."
"this is a large obstacle to me leaving high-sec space. so i go to 0.0, and then what, i can't run any missions?"
"to a) + b): of course you will lose access to all pirates if you rat accross all 4 empires. if you stay in caldari space, rats will be guristas, never angels or serpentis. all you have to do as level 4 missionrunner is to reject the angel extravaganza mission, this way you never kill their ships or structure. a little inconvenience for the option to later run missions for them. regarding sanshas/bloods/guristas: they are all neutral to gallente/minmatar, so if you don't rat them (i assume in minni/gallente space you won't find this rats anyways) and avoid the few missions that have them as target, you keep the chance to run missions for all 3 of them, or if you keep at least one of them above -2, you can repair the standing of the other two quite easily. to c): it is true, there is a standing loss towards the concord faction. but if i remember well there's only the mission \"the blockade\" for level 4s that is against concord (maybe few more with level 2/3 agents). that mission isn't very profitable anyways, simply reject it. the good thing with pirates is that they have that hubs with multiple agents, so you can pick only the best missions. in my system there are 10 level 4 q 20 agents for example, so you only do always the best missions, enough room for a lot of rejecting.besides that your security standing is tied to concord corporation standing, not the faction. and when you do pirate storylines the concord corporation is affected, the faction only is affected by ship/structure kills, which can be avoided. and the concord corporation (= your sec status) loss throug pirate storylines is made up by sec gain when killing non-empire faction mission npcs (e.g. i kill lot's of sanshas/bloodraiders/mercenaries/mordus when running missions for angel cartel). so to sum up the long post: all you need is to get your infos, avoid certain missions and you keep your cances to run missions for a particular faction (ofc. you wont do missions for guristas if your a caldari missionrunner, or for serpentis if your gallente)."

"i think i would rather see a compromise on this issue rather than a flat-line aye or nay to the end of ghost training. i would assume there would be a 3 month time limit on canceled accounts to be completely removed from the game, in consideration of those whom actually have real life issues and therefore have to go for a long period of time off of the game."

"i support this after seeing it put into effect on sisi.using a pack of nails where a staple would have done the job."
"i just wish nerfs would halt complelty. it's making my cry. i don't feel one way or the other about this particular nerf but i feel strongly for those who are losing a lot of training becuase of another silly nerf!!i also am against the carrier nerf, and they're not overpowerd becuase spending 1.1b on a ship and repairers with crap loads of training time should be able to instantly redeploy! they've earned it!but yeah, any nerfing is bad. i just feel bad for these players is all."
"against.wake up. needed a few small minor changes... not for you to wade in with a sledgehammer."
"completely against this nerf! there's no reason at all to nerf nano ships. they're just as vulnerable as any other ship. most aren't cap stable, most have paper-thin shields/armor when compared to similarly priced ships, most require a great deal of skill to fly properly. there are also plenty of ways to defend against a nano ship. the fact that people choose not to set-up their ship/fleet to defend against a nano ship, then whinge like 3 year olds when they lose ships doesn't justify wiping out a legitimate tactic.ccp have taken some of the diversity out of the game and have pushed us closer towards blob warfare. completely bonkers."
"been on sisi and dont like what i see - this expansion is not a nano-nerf - its a fundamental reorientation of the game away from fluid fast-paced engagements that rely on position to a slower paced one where numbers are king.it hurts solo and small gang roaming.it rewards static gate camping.it nerfs almost every ship in the game except assault frigs. and murders the most fun ships in the game  hacs and recons.it creates ridiculous imbalances where expensive ships and highly skilled characters are now much less effective against small and cheap ships flown by low skill point characters.the weapons stacking thing is good as are the server improvements  thats a big price to pay for all the rest of the crap."
"fully support the petition against the nano nerf.either way, i got plans for new ship fittings if the nano nerf goes through, but would be nice if i didnt have to bother."
"i think a simple queue of next skill to train or even train current skill to level x will solve 90% of the problems while avoiding 90% of the problems."
"supported - i hardly use my jump clone simply because of the wait time. if i could reduce it with a skill it would be great."
"agreed that there should be a skill to reduce jump clone turnaround, but it should be as difficult as is reasonable to benefit significantly from. say rank 8 or higher, with infomorph psychology and science both at level v?and keep it to 2 hours off with each level trained. simpler to deal with in general i imagine."
"support op"
"why not allow people to report the location of people with bounties, by right clicking on their ship in space on on the listing in the overview and choosing an option \"report location\".and then when people go to look at the list of people with bounties, it will also say their last known location, ( and the name of the person that did the reporting ) even if you kept a delay, it could help.tralala"
"this actually is an interesting addition to the great ideas already posted.what this would enable is for bounty hunters to work together in groups ( player interaction )here is how it would work:- 2 or more bounty hunters work together.- 1 of the bh gets to a station to accept the bounty contract while his buddy is in pursuit of the target updating it's last known location on the fly.- when the contract is accepted he'll race back to his buddy to start the assault.- when the kill was successful the contract can be turned in and like it works with missions at the moment you should be able to share it with your fleet, making bounty hunting a group thing and reward payouts been shared among the participants.either way, i really like the ideas you've posted and this entire plan, although i'm especially interested in the bh aspect of it, gets my full support.i really hope ccp is going to integrate a system like this making eve and empire space a more lively environment without hurting the new players or the carebears at all.cheers,digaph"

"of course there's a way to remove your bid - spam jita local with lies until somebody outbids you. it's like regifting, but for scams. i see no real reason for this feature to be added - it won't prevent scams, just move the auctions into item exchanges. if anything, it'd lead to more abuse, as people bid on their own contracts to pump up the price, and then do a last-second bid withdrawal once they've hit the other person's cap."

"hey i've got a great idea, lets make absolutely certain that the gm's and developers do not have the slightest clue about what the game is like from a player's perspective or in 0.0. this couldn't possibly backfire."
"how do you plan to increase small gang pvp with the nano nerf? and titans."
"the question was for the candidate and not yourself. and stating that gms need to play the game activly to be able to do their job is not true. in fact it is silly. moving people to different system using system tools when they are stuck does not require in depth knowledge on 1vs1 nano warfare. so does censoring forums posts. or implementing new graphic models. or solving network issues. developers and gms do not need to play the game to be able to do they job. a game designer should know his game, but gm does not have.on the other hand if they do they have the unique opportunity to misuse their \"powers\" to gain benefit for their faction, unlike rest of the players. before you say that all ccp needs is honest gms and developers i will quote verified human wisdom \"power corrupts\". you don't trust me? name an honest politician. for each one named i will name 20 corrupt ones. i rest my case. i'm not saying that all of gms and developers will act as politicians, thank god they are not into politics and i am sure that many are honest and hard working. but what shall we do with those that are not honest and will misuse their power to gain advantage of other players? this is why lottery companies do not allow their workers to take part in their lottery games, or some other gaming companies do not allow their employees to play their games. and this is in the hands of ccp. if ccp will listen to csm then i want this question answered by candidates. and not others so please keep the discussion somewhere else.now if a candidate could answer my question please."
"what are you talking about, i am agreeing with you, this is an absolutely fantastic idea! making sure the gm's only see the players as complaining customers of an obscure service they know nothing about that they have to talk to, developing a bunker mentality because they themselves dont know the experience of putting up with bugs and problems in the game is a fantastic idea. i'm sure the decrease in empathy and knowledge of what the problems actually are will lead to terrific customer service."
"red side gm > what can i do for you sir?blue side player > i want my ship back, lost it in lag and stuff.red side gm > sorry sir but our logs don't show any lag, in fact we didn't log anything strange. we hope you recover soon from your loss.red side gm > yo my man!red side player > hey we need some ships respawned now, we got killed in some camp.red side gm > sure! you want faction fittings as well?red side player > hell yes! and make those battleships faction ones, we need some \"edge\" if you know what i mean.red side gm > yup! done. i'll be in for the op, my shift ends in 10 minutes. and make sure our fcs now about the ability to target people inside pos shields, it still has not been fixed and we are still not marking it as an exploit. also blues have been asking to reinforce node in xyz system. expect an attack tonight, unless they plan a mining op in our capital.bunker? it's called professional service which i can request as a customer. it is enough to have to deal with metagamers alone without having to combat developers and gms. i prefer \"decreased empathy\" to \"outright hostility\"."
"we get your point (who doesn't). but you can't have the other extreme where gms and devs don't play at all. accountability is the best compromise. stop fighting."
"my concern with is that you completely dropped the ball on the capital ship issue when it came before the csm, largely because you are a dilettante with regards to pvp, especially unrestricted pvp.in your candidacy post here, you try to take credit for things that csm voters should have good reason to believe that ccp was doing anyway, like boosting black ops and nerfing suicide gankers."
"hello i sure hope that ccp takes the time to listen to your ideas scagga leabetrovo> looking a the history of csm (atm they been ignored) and some foolish statements on the forums between them and ccp. without going into to detail! or pointing fingers \" i hope your not just waisting your time \"your the guy for the job! you have our vote judge ment"
"sorry for the delay in replying to these questions, this week i've been spending longer hours attached to obs & gynae as part of my studies. indeed, i agree that occupancy should have tangible consequences - and as you have indicated, their exact nature is a matter for discussion. factional warfare can require a prohibitive amount of time investment to achieve goals that seem to only 'exist on paper' at present. from information that i have gathered, the current status quo regarding consequences is reported to be a sub-optimal as a motivating factor for many of those involved.i particularly like this idea, giving non-combat means of supporting the war. perhaps this [smuggling] could be introduced as a prelude to spreading the scope of factional warfare - i.e. making new zones contestable? this may also beg the question - is it time for less common professions such as smuggling to receive de novo attention, and possibly find them a role in factional warfare? yes. with regards to station-hugging and gatecamping, while they are for usually tactics borne of battlefield conditions rather than truly 'cowardly' pilots, i support finding better alternative activities - rather than supporting 'nerfing' these combat styles.re: what you mentioned about tax and how it should be paid out etc. - this is a novel idea to me. while i currently don't understand it - i'd be interested in getting a better understanding of this in a more formal discussion setting."

"do you intend to agitate for boosting 0.0 profitability with as much vigor as you will low-sec profitability?"
"i make lowsec a focus for two reasons. firstly, it's at the bottom of the ladder right now - it's got next to nobody using it for anything other than fw, and it really does suffer from being more dangerous than highsec without being more profitable. secondly, i know it better. i've never played the 0.0 game, but i have played the lowsec game, and thus i feel safer making policy prescriptions regarding lowsec. besides, looking at who will be on the next csm, you have the heads of two of the biggest alliances in the game who will almost assuredly make it on - i don't need to be the one championing 0.0 reform. however, i do consider it important, and i will support issues of that nature(within reason) if they come up. i've previously expressed support in principle for such ideas as allowing agents to be hired into 0.0, and i had a good discussion after one of the debates last weekend on the problems with 0.0 and what can be done to fix them. 0.0 should have the highest rewards in this game, and at present it isn't quite there. the ore is spectacular, the complexes and moons are fantastic, and officer rats are the npc-run lottery in this game, but ratting is just missioning with slightly different mechanics and no better payout. i don't feel confident making precise suggestions on how to fix this, but from all i've heard it is somewhat of a problem, and i'd certainly be interested in helping to find a solution."
"can't believe i'm voting for a goon.it's interesting that you bring up the issue of new players competing with old ones on a more even playing field. eve is one of those games where the new guys have an influence, unlike that game that shall remain nameless where a level 10 guy can't even make a dent in a lvl 30 guy. i get what you're saying, and i agree, but i don't see it as that critical an issue in eve. not when applied to skill training and t2 weapons. i do see it as an issue when it comes to wealth, assets, and entrenched alliances. the sov map has looked stagnant to me for a while now. i know how you feel about pos warfare. that's more important.what is your opinion on the current status of missions? i know it's pve content, but it's important to the eve economy. how about the loot tables from them? would you bring that up as an issue?"
"how do you propose to reconcile the dichotomy of entrenched power structures versus a game structure that primarily rewards those who have been around the longest? there are far fewer opportunities for newer players now, versus newer players five years ago. territorial amibitions are curbed by power blocs, profitable-yet-unknown missions/complexes have been removed or monopolized, and the t2 lottery ending, are all good examples of options that players no longer have, but that older players have profited from.the game structure itself conspires to keep new players on their back foot versus older players, but if ccp attempts to address this imbalance they are attacking their most loyal customer base. your thoughts?"
"lets go with last in, first out.there is one thing i want to say before i get into how i ideally see pos warfare working. the skill training wait time is likely a significant issue with regards to the amount of change that can happen in 0.0 space. without a ready supply of competent pilots no alliance can hope to gain space. the isk is easy enough to get with some work, but once the players have gotten to the point where they might be a threat, they have become attached to whatever other playstyle they have taken part of. that is not to say that people cannot change, but its less likely than them not. such, i think that this gap is a contributing factor to some of the 0.0 stagnancy.with regards to pos warfare, i think that the primary mechanic is a good one. it is just implemented poorly. the primary mechanic is, essentially, \"put up object to claim space, shoot other peoples objects to remove their claim\". the problem with the implementation is that there are too many pos floating around, maintaining pos is not an issue of combat readiness, but rather an issue of drudgery, and pos are too hard to disable.i will ignore the first two for a moment, because i feel that they are, more or less, self explanatory. there is a heathly medium between a lot of control points and few control points and we are currently erring on the \"too many\" side. as well, fueling towers is just not fun. it is currently a mechanic that only serves as an argument for making towers stronger or keeping them that way. when you get rid of that you can start to look at logistics as a means of getting ships and ammo to the front rather than making sure that you have a dedicated logistics man who can take a second job.requiring dreads to take down a serious deathstar, i don't feel is a major problem. i think the problem is more that pos can serve strategic functions [cyno gen, jump bridge, cyno jam, moon mine, refine, etc] and still be deathstars. this means that there is no \"training\" for a pos fight that small alliances and groups can do. they will say \"lets go incap that jump bridge, that will really be a pain for the goons\" and when they get there the pos has 50 hojillion ecm modules fitted and perma-jams their entire gang. i mean, say you're a small alliances getting ready to jump into 0.0? you do some raiding and camp some gates. but then the next step after that is full on battleship supported capfleet pos fights.if we can make these strategic pos modules easier to disable then not only do we start a more natural progression between starting out in 0.0 to being a serious contender, but we also alter the strategic choices that are made during a siege. both of these are positive steps.i think a capture point type system would be terrible. i haven't messed around with fr, but i don't think it will work when dealing with large organized alliances.missions in the next post."
"i haven't missioned in quite a while. [just getting back into it in stain], but i am certainly open to looking at how its organized. i think missions need to branch out into conquerable/buildable 0.0 stations in order to increase player density in 0.0. as well there some specific changes to the way that mission rewards are calculated that ought to go through. these changes are pretty simple. missions need to start out at their highest pay point rather than lowest pay point. this is because players are unlikely to want to do a mission that has a low payment. combined with the next thing that needs changing this means that it takes a very long time for a mission to reach its equilibrium payment. this is why very few people ran level 5s when they were first released. they would go find an agent, look at the reward and say \"why don't i just run level 4's?\"the second is that a refused mission needs to count as a \"max time\" mission completion. currently, a refused mission is discarded in the pricing scheme. this means that missions that are difficult are unlikely to see their price rise with that difficulty, instead, people just skip the mission and do something worth their time.regarding loot drops: i am not sure about loot drops. i don't loot in missions. i know that i would love it if t1 items were removed from the loot tables entirely[size issues], but i don't know of any major issues with loot."
"this is only true within the context of trade. and, as you have admitted, successful entities will enact policy that keeps them on top and everyone else below. this is how it is in any such unregulated system. as well the majority of interactions cannot be reasonably considered trade because one party will not be consenting to the outcome. the amassing of wealth concentrates this power. this is the system by which states and empires have been formed since before the modern age. denying it is foolish, as not only can we see its effects across the pages of history, but, on smaller scales, we can see it play out today.neither. entrenched interests are not operating in a market, regulation is then irrelevant, which is just as well, because eve has always been a place where \"regulation\" was at a minimum or non-existent. what eve needs is balance, tweaking the individual incentives to produce a result that we are happy with. there is no need to regulate any transactions when ccp has the power to change the fundamental assumptions.besides what i said regarding pos and sov warfare above, i would really like to see something done about gang mods, remote sensor boosters, log off and scanning mechanics[you may have to scroll down to posts 40 and 41] and think there are some exciting things we can do with industrynote: not all of those are recent, so things might have changed regarding the specifics, but they should all convey the correct idea."
"at least your proposition is in line with what they've suggested and isn't some wild change that will never happenconfirmed that this is what a lot of missioners say. the only reason to do 5's is \"for fun\" but profit wise it makes little sense. personally i don't really care though. the problem (which i think ccp has mentioned once but i don't remember who acknowledged it) is that missions flood the market with t1 loot in general, including loads and loads of unnamed generic t1 modules. if there even could be a market for manufacturing unnamed t1 modules (i suppose some people insist there is if you find 'the right places' which i've never found), this market is crippled by the constant streaming in of this loot. the markets in empire have a lot of focus on reprocessing junk, not making and selling it. cause nobody is making most of that stuff. i'd like to see the majority of unnamed modules removed from loot tables. they serve no function other than to go into reprocessing, which hurts miners and hurts anyone trying to enter into the manufacturing game who doesn't yet have the ability to invent."

"liked everything minus the character interaction on a planet colony. i think it takes too much from the past conceptions of eve as a space mmo. but the proposed additions to a sov 4 system in the manner in which you described does seem desirable."
"well i read it and i like it but.... you don't say a lot of what actually it would give back other than some mins and fuel that are already in game... that will make current mining system obsolete or at least flatten down profit for new player base in hi-sec so i am not trying to pinch your idea but put it a bit further, i hope you don't mind . so here it is how i see it:1. ccp currently has some 'plans/ideas' to put t3 tech and some sort of patents/customized stuff at (as i belive) corp level to be produced so lets go on... lets put in the whole idea with colonies and hubs but make colonies a places where you can build and upgrade your corp laboratory where you can try to achive certain 'patent' to be able to produce customized items. this will obviously need a lot of input from players so lets make laboratory be upgradeable and also possible to fit with special stuff obtained via planetary missions. missions (similar to courier) i.e. gaining contacts and interacting with other scientists on other planets - delivering them some required special items or supplying them with various mins will make your corp (not you personally) gain a scientific points or reputation points for which you can buy mentioned above upgrades/fittings - the more fittings corp has in its laboratory or the higher it is upgraded the better chance of getting his hands on 'patent'. that is the beginning...after you will get said patent you can then even further develop your colony - build planetary factory in which you can make/produce customized items (note that items not necessarily must be an end product it may be only a parts/components for t3 manufacture chain) to actually build tese items in your factory you also need new mins - yes you guessed :) a planetray mines which then will yield new mins (here variations of palnets comes in hand - whether it is volcanic/jungle/desert or whatever it will yield different mins). to run all this on your planet you obviously need power plants just to name one and a people (workers/scientists) to run it, you can also add planetary defences so they will be more resistable for sieges after all if you invest something you wouldn't like to see it destroyed in just 1 hour or so... so this is how i see it and mind you that planetary missions can put a whole new interaction level and give a full boost to ambulation giving it more sense just that the one to walk in stations. this will also give a point for fights and waging wars to get certain corps out of competition ( for producing patented components etc.) so i am finishing here"
"one (unique) point of eve is (jmo) that you can change your activities at any time - using the same character. the sole possibility that you can lock yourself out forever to run missions for certain factions contradicts that principle.just take someone that lived in amarr space. if he didnt follow your guidelines (quite from the start) its very likely that he will have no chance to run missions for the mentioned trio, because he will not only have got derived faction standings loss thanks to important storyline missions (which at least give standings gain for other factions) - but loss due to kills against all those three factions (amarr missions, doesnt matter which region you are in) will force you to kill ships/structures of all those 3 pirate factions.now take the possibility that this person joins a corp that operates in 0.0 blood space ... even if he wants, he wont be able to ever run missions for them. besides the fact, that rats there (if he wants to rat) will be blood too.if you do pirate faction important storylines, your concord faction will be affected obviously, because concord (faction) dislikes all (pure) pirate factions. on the other hand, concord does not like any faction at all and gives no important storyline missions (most likely, because they are liked by all empire factions)so to sum it up - i dont think its 'enough' to be able to not lock your possibilities if you follow certain rules from the start. there should be always a way to recover from your past actions ... even if it would be a tendous task. but it should be possible.ps: i am not suggesting / looking for a 'cheap' solution ... but imo there should be a solution. if u care, take a look at the ideas from the locked thread that i linked earlier."
"this can't be true. my friend sabahl has a standing of -0,10(neutral) to concord assembly and 3,56(decent) to concord. he has done a lot of important storylines for angel and serpentis pirates, check his standings in game, he has 8,17 with angels and 8,00 with serpentis. if you were right he'd have a horrible standing to concord assembly, but he doesn't have it, search in game for \"sabahl\" and have a look on his standings."
"i have to admit, that i seem to be wrong in that case. however my 'experience' with running pirate faction missions is dated some time ago (approx. a year) and iirc i had a derived faction standing loss listed under concord faction (which would only be possible, if you could gain/loose standings by doing important storyline missions).however as i said, its long ago and thus i am not able to proof it, because the transactions contain no entries anymore ... and perhaps it was changed. (thukker relations to minmatar have changed too - iirc - after factional warefare was introduced)"
"i was around (though not in the group defending him) during the death of muritor, and for several visits by the defiants to 9uy, and for the protests in pator when filmir resigned. i don't know much about any loot involved, but i do remember how much activity the events generated and how much fun it was. i was sad to see aurora cancelled. worried about corruption? don't generate any special loot. people will participate just to be involved. much better to have people read about a news event and say \"i was there\", than to read a fictional news event written about something that never happened in game. let's bring events back!"
"events like this sounds amazing! although lag would definately be an issue wiht much more players now then there used to be."
"suicide gank an emperor? i vote yes.also i would have rather enjoyed rigging the mimatar elections by shooting down the ships that transported the votes. a bit silly to be transporting physical votes but we are constantly told they are required for a honest and transparent process."

"really bad timing ccp, with all the other great games coming out on the same day as your fail cascade, looks like i'll be droppin eve for a while.this is no expansion, this is slapping your players in the face"
"first you should probably explain why you think altering killmails is a bad thing, exactly? killboards aren't part of eve itself, they're an external tool for corps and alliances run by people with no affiliation to ccp (sometimes by people who don't even play eve!). the information held within a killmail can be an important source of battlefield intelligence, and players should be free to post, alter or withhold them if they wish."
"mercs get hired for offensive actions as well. any change should enhance and expand the profession, or at least formalize it, not limit it.edit: to clarify, i like the bounty ideas more or less. better than what we have but still need a little refining. the merc thing is my issue, and as the only merc ceo i see in this thread imma stick by it. an in-game merc interface is desireable but simply providing that access to war dec defenders is not. any csm that wants to talk to me about the way this could go is free to convo or mail me."
"you've introduced a new problem with kill rights. derived and unlimited kill rights mean that anyone can take any number of bounty contracts. this means that anyone who lands a kill right on someone is likely to be swamped with hundreds of hostile players after him.you've also introduced an isk sink with no reason for said sink.you've failed to solve one aspect of the \"second party bounty hunter\" problem.[i.e. where the bountied target takes the contract and kills himself.] which will occur if you fix the first people where bountied targets are at a severe disadvantage. in that, someone can take the contract and simply hold it until the kill right expires, thus protecting himself from retaliation.a better system is this:reverse auctions with collateral. when a player posts a bounty contract he posts it with a start value[high], and buyout value[low]. bounty hunters then bid down the price of the contract, and when its finally accepted, pay some percentage of the price as collateral. if they fail to dispatch the hunted target[enough times to cover the bounty], then they lose the collateral to the contract issuer.this solves the problem of people taking contracts to hold onto them, solves the problem of hundreds of bounty hunters going after the same target, and makes competition an integral part of the process.for added slaking of vengeance you could automatically send killmails generated to a bounty hunter to the person who set the bounty."
"actually, if you had read carefully, you would have noticed that no one person can hold the killrights derived from a bounty. its open to many players. hence, a bountied player can't use an alt (or themselves) to effectively stop the bounty being collected.additionally, we envisaged bounty hunting being a profession. thus, there will be players looking to hunt players for isk. this means that players that get killed by a player/s can set bounties on their killers. other players can then attempt to earn this bounty for themselves by accessing the bounty office and accepting the bounty contract. many players can do so (that's the whole point). access to bounties could be on an experience scale, but certainly the number of bounty contracts able to be accepted at any one time would be linked to standing (or some other mechanism) with the bh branch of concord. your idea, frankly, will lead to players making money out of selling killrights (which is what taking collateral and keeping if contract not fulfilled is). this isn't our intention for a bounty hunter system- we think that players should be able to make money by hunting bounties!of course a mail would be sent from the bounty office regarding fulfillment of a bounty contract, to the issuer! bounty hunting is hardly a large isk sink, what's your point?you should note that this issue has already been through the csm/ccp meeting and given high priority for development by the csm. finer details are up to the developers. if bounty hunting as a profession is introduced, eve will get just a little bit more interesting. pvp is good! take care,arithron"

"no it shouldn't, and no its not expensive.considering it is the best fleet boat in the game at the moment, narrowly out-shining the apoc, i dont think making it even easier to fit is reasonable. plenty of other ships need rcu in fleet fit. you have five low slots."

"let's get right in to it:how many of you out there have got home from work or school, or even woken up in the morning thinking \"oh, my skill will have finished by now!\"... so you power up eve to see that your account expired about four hours ago... \"no worries, i'll just resub and change my skill!\"... but wait... the last skill still has four hours left of training time! you're a paying customer! you're resubbing the account anyway, but ccp are denying you your few hours of hiatus!so, the idea: ghost training carries on for 24 hours after your account expires. we all know the real issue is with people that set skills like bs 5, carrier 5, or advanced weapons upgrades 5 training just before their subscription runs dry, but the other 90% of us suffer without this leeway!give us 24 hours where our skills continue to train so that we have the chance to resub and not lose and training time, for the good of the game!"
"and yes, i do support my own idea!"
"iirc i have heard somewhere that they give you a 3 day period where you still train. if not i don't think 24 hours is an unreasonable period to let it train."
"maybe you just forgot to pay the bloody bill and it went by 3 days before you realized it was too late and now your just trying to troll up the ghost training crap again.oh i'm sorry... touched a nerve there.epic fail @ op.ps: and before you open fire realize this.. don't you think its just a tad bit stupid for ccp to not think of that? i mean come on... killing your account access for being 24 hours late? yeah... right."

"in my opinion ccp staff should be allowed to play our game. i think it is very important that ccp experiences the problems of the game first hand. if they were just sitting behind their monitoring tools, they would never know what it is like not to be able to activate a gun. their actions need to be monitored, tho, but as far as i know, the internal affairs department got this completely covered. it is an entire ccp department dedicated for monitoring and ensuring that no ccp employee influences the game in a way that would not be possible without being a ccp employee. as i was not a csm representative back in june, i did not have a chance to talk to the heads of ia, but the other reps did, and ensured me that the ia procedures in place were quite alright."
"hello, gruss gott, servus people of eve! first let me apologize for the delay of getting this proper ad submitted. i could give you and excuse but that is just not how i was raised. i humbly beseech you for your vote during this election for csm. who am i? i am no great fleet commander, nor am i some rich industrialist sipping brandy in his ivory tower. i am just a pilot the same as you all. some days i am mining(on my industrial account) others i am trying to hold down targets for my wingmen(on lowballer). everyday i am working hard to make the tiniest mark on the world of eve for me eve is as much a game as it is a social experiment. look how things have progressed over the years: lone pilots scrambled to join corps, corps banded together to form alliances, and in the common era we have alliances forming super alliances essentially surpassing the nations where we all started in empire. from nothing we now have entire online cultures of our own design sprouting all over the universe. the complexity and organic nature of eve's growth makes it the game i love and wish to serve. i could spout a page about my opinions on the game, and what legislation i want to pass but i won't. this is not what the csm originally stood for. it is to provide transparency between producer and consumer, to give we the players a channel to help keep the game we love honest and growing. even if i did have opinions and plans, what of them? for me, i only want for a strong community to keep playing this wonderful game. if this means listening to people i do not agree with, or bringing information to the table that i may not be interested in, then i am willing to do this.what i can promise you is the following: 20 hours of my spare time per week, in addition to the time i spend checking the forums at work(shh)a clear channel for all players who wish to participate in the governing of evedetailed personal reports of my findings and progress as a delegatecakeout of game contact lines for emergenciesmy 22 years of education, work, and cultural experienceif you have any further questions, please post here,check my website, or drop me an eve mail in game. i thank all for the heartfelt mails of encouragement i have received thus far and i thank you for your time. you, the people of eve, are a beautiful lot and i look forward to seeing where we go from here.grusscheersjohn t. lloyddjlowballer djhighballerflashtrooper corpmunich germanyedit phone removed due to 5 prank calls =/"

"avalloc is probably the best candidate when it comes to the ccp's csm program. many of the others have a exclusive view of how this game works. they've either lived in empire space their whole life, or they've lived in 0.0 space their whole life. a number of the other candidates were practically born into their positions, so they never obtained a real perspective on what was going on. avalloc's 15 years of experience put him at the ground floor of mmo development. csm delegates aren't game designers, they're game dreamers.far from a one-trick kind of guy, he has experienced many different styles of play. ignoring his accomplishments in other games and just focusing on eve, avalloc began as a bare-bones sp pilot with a dream, and rose his way to a position in the directorate of a major alliance. mining, production, pos warefare, blueprints, the market, whatever. he has experience in a wide range of areas and doesn't fall into the stereotype of what you would expect of a player like him.the ideas he brings to the table are important core features to the game that need to be improved upon. not to mention that for all the time i've worked with him, he has always been available to discuss new ideas, and has a strong love for the game.you may have seen him at fanfest, he was the one handing out squeaky bees and making sure everyone had a good time. avalloc has a strong understanding of what basic game concepts need to be brought to the attention of ccp, and this is the main reason why i think he deserves your vote for csm delegate."

"yup, didn't feel the need for it as stronlgy as a very young player though, but that was because there was so much to train for that there was always something usefull to train. now, i find myself training skills to lvl 5 i don't need at lvl 5 just because my skill points won't go to waste..."

"the problem with increasing the number of times you can jump within a certain period of time is how you decide when that period of time begins and ends. is it it set, like measured from midnight et to midnight et a day or so later? or is it based on when you last jumped like it is now, only with even more jumps added on to complicate it?no, much simpler is to keep it to one jump every 24 hours, but with a skill that reduces that time with each level trained."

"and if you've read carefully, you would know that that means that the instant anyone puts up a bounty contract, pretty much everyone in the universe can have kill rights on that target. they just go and accept the contract.at which point bounty hunting is not a way to get revenge on someone who wronged you in high sec or low sec, but a unreasonable restriction on player activity.i don't think you understand how a reverse auction works. you see. if you have the kill right and are setting out the bounty, you agree to pay some amount. the hunters then bid the price down. this means that when the contract is accepted and completed the person putting out the bounty pays the money out. the competition comes from hunters each looking to do the job for cheaper. collateral is necessary so that there is incentive for the hunter to complete the contract. otherwise players can take a contract and ignore it.what is my point about what? you're making no sense. who read these things and often make decisions based on it."
"skill queue is not needed.train skills with short time left while you are onlinetrain long skills while you're offline.no planning necessary.however it is necessary to log in. oh noes!better things to do than queuing skills eh?"
"yes we had that drivel before - think before postinghave a good day"
"hell, the lack of a skill queue is one of the things that just might make me stop playing eve. no, nobody can has my stuff, i might need it if the queue ever get's implemented"
"i am not that far yet but i must admit this constant beating around the bush on ccp`s side about this issue is seriously starting to **** me off..."
"i wouldn't quit just because of the lack of a skill queue but combined with other things it might just do the trick. having a skill queue on the other hand would strongly encourage me to keep playing eve though :) . so ccp: having no queue is an incentive to stop playing, having a queue is an incentive to keep playing. now what would you as a company do with that information?"
"i log in when i feel like it or when it's convenient. no other time. i set skills (mostly) based on when i think i might feel like logging in next. of course when i'm training up for something specific i just suck it up and train whatever skills are needed.yup, i lose a little bit of training time here and there. i don't really care too much about that though, tbh. not having a queue does not make me log in more, that's for damned sure."
"aye morphite is too abundant atm."
"hmm, so we need to remove morphite, because it makes t2 cheaper, and drives down the price of t2 goods? given that this impacts t2 producers, but not the majority of pilots (who benefit from such things), i can't see how this is a bad thing?i produce t2 goods, but by far the biggest price dropper is invention! personally, i see this as a good thing for the pilots. ).0 space already makes good isk per hr via other activities. that's a poor argument imo.arithron"
"zydrine and megacyte should be removed too from alloys"
"to an extent i would agree that while not removed completely it would be good to reduce some what the amount of morphite generated through drone alloys.i strongly believe that module drops should be greatly reduced in npc wreaks, which a minor increase in the ratio of meta gear and a small increase in salvage to offset the reduction of modules."
"yes.so when is it?"
"if you cut training times in half, are you going to double my 80m skillpoints and let me allocate them wherever i please? i doubt it, so no, suck it up and train like the rest of us have."
"very welcome..."
"outstanding idea"
"support the concept, want to discuss details."
"the general concept is interesting but there's a few things...is there a way for the defending corp of detecting and stopping one of these from going up within a reasonable time frame? if you can just pop one up without recourse that could prove to be over the line.i'd also like to see if there is a set limit on how long the cloak can last. being able to refuel it for as long as you please would create some problems. there's enough complaints about lone afk cloakers sitting in a system to scare people away, what's going to happen when they know there's a base somewhere in the system that can have a bunch of black ops/recon ships just jump into at any time? if you add a limit say once per week the cloak dies for 12hrs, or perhaps a system wide notification once per 1 hour about when it will go down and only go down for 1-2hrs so it could be defended reasonably and not have people sitting around for 12hrs with their fingers up their butts. during that time it becomes probable and destructible this would allow people to counter them but give at least 1 week for harassment.you mention metagame espionage as a way of countering this which i very much disagree with especially considering your target for people that will use this are smaller corps that usually operate in very tight nit groups that never recruit. also making these same people who likely do not have the logistics capability to possibly make daily trips to maintain is simply weird. it seems made for the \"elite\" of huge corps to use not really for small corps at all. i think you need to flesh out the whole vision more and what it's for. if it's for small corps then you need to make it simple to maintain but short lived so you only do general greifing ops and not staging a prolonged offensive(which i think you could with the current iteration) that would be likely from most merc corps. if it's for big corps then fuel costs should be extremely high to drain resources at a high rate so that it forces you to commit a non-negligible amount of resources to kicking people in the shins."

"nay, boo , there should be risk in eve."
"+1 for kayleeand yes scotty needs to go"
"i don't support this.as i said in a thread on a similar topic trying to get people out of npc corps where they are \"safe\" doesn't result in them somehow getting involved in fw or pvp in general it will simply push them into 1 man corps where they will continue mission running in safety. complete waste of time to do this."
"to be truthful i have found it useful when trying to create channels that have already been created. i had no desire to join the stupid channel that already had people in it, rather i wanted to create a new one for other people to be invited to join."

"i think scagga is a pretty cool guy, he runs for csm and doesn't afraid of anything. :)you have my vote old friend."
"thanks darius re: consolidation of 0.0. spacethis is a concept i am interested to explore. at present, the degree of 'control' over alliance-held 0.0. space can vary, with some systems behaving like the 'hubs' you describe, and others being mostly barren save for a sovereignty pos and a few npc'ers.in response to this question, you may have read the earlier posts in this thread about supporting 'infiltration' of 'soft' forces into poorly protected/patrolled enemy space? while i haven't at present proposed a game-mechanic difference between the heavily populated vs sparsely populated claimed space, i do support the idea of infiltrating poorly defended enemy space. so, if a territorial entity is unable to keep eyes on farflung possessions, i think that hostile settlement by guerrilla forces is a logical sequela - using the aforementioned proposed mobile bases/infrastructure. this does not necessarily compromise sovereignty. i would also like to hear more about what you would suggest the practical changes would be as 'influence' diminishes, and approaching the idea in the future would require wider discussion.re: inflicting tangible damage on a smaller scalethis is also a good question. i've said before that 0.0. warfare needs to be spread over a wider area - thus giving smaller scale objectives may be an important part of encouraging this. of course one must not promote an idea to which there is no counter - ideas that i would want to discuss in the future would include station sabotage, placing mines or moving moon-mining apparatus outside of pos shields, suicide ships and assessing the feasibility of mobile siege weaponry. of course, this not exhaustive - and as said at the panel yesterday - most good ideas start as bad ideas, so i won't stop brainstorming on that one :p"
"what csm members need to do is help guide ccp to commit to a clear vision of what eve should be like. the vision of eve scagga is presenting i can agree with the most, so he is receiving my vote. i'm sure he will encourage a productive dialog rather than waste the csm's and ccp's time on minor details, which the devs ought to sort out themselves without csm interference but in the spirit of ccp's and the csm's \"eve vision\".support a man with a clear vision, people"

"and here it is"
"oh my god..."
"lyn - it was a while ago, but do i remember good memories of fighting alongside you in the fights against the murientor tribe in northern derelik! thanks for your kind words!as you have understood, different styles of alliance government need to be supported. if sovereignty holding alliances are to be regarded as emerging nations in their own right, eve ought to support their decisions instead of limiting them to flimsy word-of-mouth agreements. now for your question:re: the bounty hunter systemas a standalone issue, i'm open to hear about ways bounty-hunting per se can be supported. i have previously suggested roles for level 5 agents in 'advanced disclosure' of a target's position - including commercial transactions tracing for find alts. it's also matter that i've thought of having a role in different game facets:1. factional warfare perspectivei've mentioned that it would be interesting to see a bridging of pvp and pve through agent missions - issuing missions akin to bounty hunting. i.e. go kill high ranking enemy militiamen and collect your reward, while lowering the enemy's rank. in summary:your rank in factional warfare needs to mean something more than just complex running. let pvp ability factor more.2. 0.0 perspectivei have spoken as of late with 0.0. alliance members on the concept of agents migrating to 0.0., floating the idea of 0.0. agents being the alliance members themselves. hypothetically this could lead to player 'agents' creating unique missions for their fellow alliance members, or residents. this could take the form of bounty-hunter-like 'hits', industrial jobs or difficult logistics strikes. it could also be a boon to mercenary-alliance relations (supporting smaller scale jobs for determined specialists)."
"i gave your suggestion thought in between cups of good coffee, mr smagd (you might have seen me meddling in teonusude, actually :p). my conclusions regarding your proposals:1. sort by meta level - i strongly agree, will be added2. sort by volume - by this i think you mean physical volume in m^3, rather than quantity. worth adding3. sort by base price* - i agree, but i want to take this further (see below)4. sort by quantity - i need to get in touch with you and clarify this point *this is a very interesting idea, which i want to see become a useful tool for producer and traders: add a feature to the ingame calculator for calculating module/hull costs/profitability. set your own mineral base prices and me/pe criteria, then calculate the cost of production.since we're on the subject of making our hangars easier to handle, a conversation i had with mirrorgod lead me to take interest in a suggestion of his - allowing one to create 'folders' for organising personal hangars. i'd add this to the list of hangar improvements.i'd also like to resurrect a well-supported idea i proposed a few months back, which the last csm didn't seem to take interest in - autofitting."
"well starbud, it's a problem worth discussing. to deal with this particular problem, i would say that a 'cap' on sovereignty per se is an artificial way of dealing it. rather, i would support other approaches, such as mobile infrastructure and ways for small groups to 'infest' the larger 0.0. alliance's space. basically ways that could allow smaller groups to thrive in 0.0 akin to nomads, without needing to fight the sovereignty war. see my answers to darius's questions for further elaboration. the end result, i think, would mean that if a powerful alliance creates a huge empire that cannot be defeated by a conventional war, they might have to face an 'unconventional war' with many small groups threatening the security of their space in multiple loci."
"since you mention phoenix's i would like to hear your view on what specifficly you think should be done to rebalance them (and that aspect of the naglfar as well)on any given pos kill phoenix's are mediocre dmg dealers and in capital on capital fights they most of the time end up dealing 0 dmg for either of two reasons, torps not reacing targets in time and the fact that torps get destroyed by smartbombs, do you think citadels should get an increase in speed and hp's wich would make them useable in cap on cap fights, should they get a flat dmg increase so they'll become truly devastating in the unlikely event they reach their targets (and become kings of pos shoots) or do you think they should be left the way they are ?"
"citadel torpedoes are getting boosted by increasing hp from 650hp to 1920hp which should prevent them dying from smartbombs. also ccp is finaly introducing faction citadel torpedoes so they will get onpar with other race ammunition. delayed damage is trait of missile launchers and there is not much to be done. when it comes to comparing all dreadnaughts lets check their base dammage (using eft and all lvl5 skills to simplify things)- moros (3 x dual 1000mm railgun, am ammo) 1998 dps, with 5 garde ii 3048 dps- naglfar (2 x citadel torpedoes, 2 x quad 3500mm arties, emp xl ammo) 2497 dps, with 5 garde ii 2797 dps- phoenix (3 x citadel torpedoes) 1955 dps, with 5 garde ii 2255 dps- revelation (3 x dual giga pulses, multi xl) 2823 dps, with 5 garde ii 3123 dpsi used long range guns with short range ammo as most common setup and no damage mods. we can see that without drones nalgfar is not bad damage wise mostly due to having 4 weapon hardpoints, and phoenix having weakest damage and delayed on top of that. moros damage is almost the same as pheonix but with drones (50% bonus to drone damage he is coming close to revelation).now biggest naglfar problem is divided weapon groups. most common dreadnought setups atm are using 2 damage mods, except naglfar which is in most cases using only one gyrostabilizer ii. lets check the numbers now:- moros (3 x dual 1000mm railgun, am ammo, 2 x magnetic field stabilizer ii) 2937 dps, with 5 garde ii 3987 dps- naglfar (2 x citadel torpedoes, 2 x quad 3500mm arties, emp xl ammo, 1 x gyrostabilizer ii) 2770 dps, with 5 garde ii 3070 dps- phoenix (3 x citadel torpedoes, 2 x ballistic control system ii) 2873 dps, with 5 garde ii 3173 dps- revelation (3 x dual giga pulses, 2 x multi xl, 2 x heat sink ii) 4150 dps, with 5 garde ii 4450 dpsrevelation is clearly the best damage dealer plus it has no problems with reloading ammo, moros is following him and naglfar has even lower damage then phoenix but has two guns inflicting instant damage and 2 launchers with delayed.conclusion: with boosting citadel torpedoes by increasing their hp and introducing faction version of them, phoenix and naglfar are getting a slightly boost but they are still behind moros and especialy revelation which is far the best dreadnought atm. as naglfar and moros pilot i am not completely happy with current situation, but as i said nonbalanced races are on of the eve best perks. sometimes your race rocks, and sometimes sucks, you just need to learn to live with it....or simple - crosstrain :d"
"you made a mistake in those numbers - if you're standardizing for long-range guns, you need to put dual giga beams on the rev, not dual giga pulses. that drops its dps to 2470/2770 base and 3631/3931 with a pair of heat sink ii on."
"yup my mistake, thanx for correcting me. but more or less conclusion is the same."
"the actual question i wanted answered is in wich way (if any) you thought citadels should be changed (do you think the currnetly planned boost is the right way to go or would you like to see it happen in some other way)sry for burying it in additional text"
"ok you get my 2 accounts vote good luck \o/"
"thanks for the support. unfortunately, i'm having some trouble with webbing the dev team. they're a lot more than 10 km from me, i don't fly a rapier, and at this rate it's going to take months to align for warp."
"i've known john for about 5 years. he's a great guy, and gets really into his causes and projects. if you vote for john he really will give you 110% (or more...probably more). i've never been all that great at speeches, so i'll leave it at this:john likes to bake. he could very well be dead serious about the cake.so if you want someone to try and give the best representation for the players of eve, pick john. and if, for some reason you don't, but you like cake, pick john anyway."
"thank you for your kind praise, webb mordock.i will be sharing my observations from fanfest after i return home on the 11th."
"sorry guys....when i see 6 goonswarm canidates i think something just is not right about it.....if on the off chance 2,3 or more pull down enough votes to all be elected do you think they are going to be unbiased? and not support each other... this has a potential to be a power bloc that shouldn't be allowed.... alliances should be limited to one (1) canidate only, of course that would mean any goon, bob, iron canidate automaticly gets elected.of course if csm is a joke as many think this wouldn't matteror would it?"
"don't stop posting."
"actually, darius was a good csm member this round. don't go linking in-game politics and alliances with the player's ability out-of-game to work hard at making the game better for others.that's partly to blame for the last csm being as it was...arithron"
"so...it's bad that one of the biggest alliances in eve has 6 members attempting to gain a seat out of a total of 42? run everyone! fourteen percent of the candidates are goons!see, you shoulda used a percentage. sounds like a much bigger number."
"i guess the one most important thing i would look at if i make it to the csm is the new player experience. i would probably be safe in saying that a large part of the people the try eve via the 14 day trial, (macro miners, isk sellers excluded) will have their eyes glaze over and run screaming from the room within a hour of starting eve the first time. though ccp did announce they are planning on working on making the new player experience more comfortable, i want to make sure that what they do is enough to keep new players in the game without giving up after 1-2 hours. say what you will about new players, eve needs then to grow. besides, new players make for easy targets to boost the egos of some of our more ability challenged players."
"environments because really, that's millions of ways in which eve can be improved just right there."
"how many votes are there? i noticed there are many candidates, and since i didn't vote in the original csm election i kind of missed out on how the voting works. i searched around for a thread that would help me out with this but didn't find anything on the voting mechanics at all. thanks in advance."
"each account more than 30 days old gets one vote. the candidate who finishes first is the chair, #2-9 are members, and #10-14 are alternates. it was outlined in the original csm document(page 14), but you're right that it should be outlined in a way that players can find it more easily, not just in a year-old document a lot of players won't know about."
"a few players have been asking me about my opinions on certain things in-game. i have views on things like 0.0 space, low sec, pvp in empire etc, just like any other player has. i'll condense my personal opinions into a few brief bullets as a summary:pvp opportunites in empire have been getting fewer with all the recent changes. empire has become safer. personally, i don't think this is a good thing in the lower end sec systems of empire (0.5 and 0.6 esp.). players that wish to play the bad guy get very little opportunity in empire from starting as a new character. elsewhere, areas such as low sec aren't conducive to being a new player and surviving. more experienced players also have little opportunity to be evil swines! low sec frankly sucks and is in need of much love.i want to see a system like the reverse of empire, in terms of sec status effects in lower sec systems. if you travel to 0.1 system with high sec status, bad things may happen...this is linked to my ideas for npc pirate corps/alliances that players could join in low sec.there should be opportunities for roving gangs to 'pay off' officials in the lower end of empire (0.5 and 0.6 systems) to ignore their sec status. perhaps allow for a set period of relative immunity from concord intervention away from stations and gates...ninja salvaging, wreck-looting etc: we have all read the posts from players whining about these activities. i'm personally all for them! i'd go a step further....make npc rats non-player owned after destruction, but a chance that if you didn't kill them, you'll be flagged red to player. i'd make cans likewise. for mission sites, lower the chance of finding via exploration a little to compensate for the new professional looting gangs...i'm also leaning for letting capitals into empire space, allowing them to only target war-decced corps/alliances and their assets. of course, a cap shouldn't be able to jump out again or use the gates...ask any other stance-position questions below!take care,arithron"
"yes. we. can. we can hope. we can dream. but when we wake up, the only csm candidate ready for the future is me. and the future is coming. it's coming and it's bringing with it massive changes to production, pveing, armored kodiak bears, attack blimps, and enough weaponized robots to turn hope into a four-letter word. you want hope? keep dreaming. you want change? put out your cup. you want freedom? vote for me as csm. some may say that my bid for csm is too late in the game. late to the race. late to the party. well i say the party doesn't get started until i arrive. and while the other candidates are serving special interests, i'm serving the good people of eve a steaming pile of change with a side order of suck it.when people ask about my position on gate camping, i have two words for them: attack dogs. no turrets, no concord, just dogs. attack dogs. it's time for people to learn that this freedom isn't free. vote for me if you want to live.slanty mcgarglefist for csm. screw 'em all! the whistles go woo woo!"
"here is to showing up late to the party :)love the bubb rub reference"
"/totally supportin factional warfare, we have to deal with ninja looters on a constant basis, there are always some vultures following us around and stealing whatever they can. and even being in low-sec, we can't afford to shoot them down unflagged, getting globaled and losing sec status isn't an option for militia pilots. and yeah, i'm in favor of option 1 - give wreck ownership/flag to everyone in killmail."
"despite flames sent towards patri, his points are valid, and have summed up my negative on this position fairly well. this game mechanic is working as intended, no differently than are current salvaging rules. ccp has every reason to limit hisec profitability and get people to branch out into low/null sec. the risk/reward limitations are embedded into the philosophy if not the code of the eve environment, and to rewrite the code itself to further imbalance the game towards greater hisec profitability is not really in anyone's interest. the established workaround to looting your kills first is to have a dedicated looter, no differently than for a mission runner that wants to 'defend' their own salvage. i say this, as someone that has lived in null sec, while supporting my gameplay, as well as my gtc's running missions, not to be confused with either the empire hugging camps, nor the vultures that profit from the works of others. sure, it may not be the sexiest role to play, but does give the corp newb something to do besides suicide tackler. move somewhere that you can shoot the offender, just like ccp has silently instructed the dedicated mission runner, unhappy that the 'safety' insured by concord seems to cover the ninja salvagers that interrupt their bottomless bottom lines. worried about sec hits? move to 0.0 and fix that too. let us not forget that there have been plenty of corps, dedicated to hisec wardec 'piracy', and can't imagine that ccp will ever make a move to make that any more profitable...eve is harsh. eve is unexpected. eve just might make you think, and if thats not working out, you can join my 5yr old, he really enjoys his gnome warlock on wow."

"/signedthe reason why i support this idea is because it can have various positive effects.currently a lot of people probably log in just to change a skill and they idle for some time so they can activate the next skill training.if there is a queue, those people could queue their short training skills and just log in, set skills, and log out.ccp says they want people to play the game, but the people that login just to change a skill aren't playing anyway.another thing about this is that it will decrease the load on the servers a lot, because people don't have to stay logged in if they are doing some short training skills. also the amount of players logged in will be more accurately.you get the idea..i support this thread - although i would be satisfied with just having 2 or 3 queue slots, unlimited is really not needed."
"there's have been countless ideas for this, and while i support the idea in general, it has to be worked out in specifics to work well.i think the best solution i've seen is where you set a long skill as a secondary and a short one as a primary, and while the primary skill is training, it takes up 3/4 of your training speed, and the the long skill 1/4. once the primary skill finishes, the secondary one trains at maximum speed until you select a new primary skill.first, downside to using it is that neither skill trains as fast as it would alone. but on the upside if you d/c or there is an unscheduled dt, your long skill will kick in at full speed once the short skill finished. also, it makes training up the ridiculously long skills palatable by making them be 'out of sight, out of mind' as it were. carrier v anyone?if it's implemented like this, i would so use it, and my skill training would cease to be interrupted by dts, or connection issues, or even just plain forgetting."
"lets say you have everything nice and planned. you have a 5 minute gap in your schedule where you can change skills, and a skill set to end in that time.just before you login the server goes down unexpectedly. you now have to wait at least 10 minutes before you can log back in, assuming an instant reboot. but in 5 minutes, you have to leave.if you have a queue of sufficient length, this problem won't happen."
"support :d"

"this fundamental change to combat is wrong in so many ways, i hate the direction that eve is going. these combat changes are horrible, does ccp actually think that these changes are going to do anything other than promote blobs? ccp's history is not good, they always overnerf something, then are forced to buff it 1 to 2 years later. the question is do you feel like waiting 2 years for ccp to correct this mistake?the whole premise that small ships can fight large ships is flawed. of course a battleship won't be able to solo an af, so what will it do - join up with 10+ of his buddies. sorry but this 'change' works against small gang and solo pvp - so much for our sandbox. welcome to swg ii."
"against!all they had to do was increase the mass of cruisers so that they can no longer be made to go faster than interceptors and it would have solved the nano problem. instead they completely change the missile damage formula where a specialized cruise missile fired from a stealth bomber (a ship designed to alpha strike and destroy small ships in one volley) will no longer be able to alpha strike a frigate going 150 m/sec or faster, despite the cruise missiles going 7,500 m/sec towards it.i will be forced to quit the game for good as i feel like my years of training in missiles will be useless in pvp and solo stealth bomber pilots will become obsolete."

"had a chat to some people who went to fanfest and they made a comment about walking in stations and the facility to be able to play cards and gamble. is ccp aware that doing/having this will make eve an (r) 18+ rated game in most western countries ?"
"yes, because there are absolutely no players under 13 playing eve.in other words, it doesn't matter."
"while i would agree with your concerns if real money was changing hands as a result of in-game gambling, the fact remains that any gambling done as a result of ambulation would be for isk / in-game items only.as a result, it shouldn't fall under any gambling laws that i'm aware of and so eve would retain it's current age rating."
"i think you'll find that in most western countries anything that promotes gambling to minors is not tollerated and it doesnt matter whether its isk/items or rl money. playing of cards for isk promotes gambling, subsequently most countries will see it this way and rate eve 18+."
"untrue. if that was the case then the likes of this game:-world series of poker: tournament champions (wii)would be rated as 18+ not 12+"
"yea but in world series poker your not playing other people and you dont lose anything"
"neither do you in eve."
"in a lot of places you convert you money to game credits, and use that to play. if gambling was allowed in eve, it may fall into that catagory, due to isk sellers.and that would be a bad thing"
"since isk selling is against the eula, i doubt it."
"did a little bit of digging. most downloadable poker software does indeed have an age restriction of 18+, however this is due to the real money aspect of that software.in most cases however, the point at which age verification is required is when you sign up to a real money account, before then you can happily play on the \"play money\" tables without requiring to prove your age.so, as long as the buy-in's and prizes are all in-game items then there is no further need for age verification in eve.besides, you already gamble every day in game as soon as you click undock. you place your isk and assets at risk from other players and hope that your skill and luck is more than theirs in order to make a profit."
"if player names like \"c**ty f**ps and blowing people up have not already made eve an 18+ game where you live i sincerely doubt that placing bets for ingame money will either.there are countless games out there for under 18's where you can take part in \"gambling\" type activities via mini-games."
"i'm not too much of a gambler but if that is what it takes to sift away a \"bimbominkia\" (aka whiny kid) then so be it, casino and nude gallenteans when i dock!"
"this argument is a waste of time... i can think of numerous games that have a form of gambling of some such or sort.if if involved real currency... it would be a factor.... but it doesn't.so again.. waste of time."
"of course, there are those games where rw money is converted to in-game currency. mining/killing things generates randomly in-game currency, which can then be withdrawn in the rw at a decent exchange rate. sound like gambling to you? i think it qualifies...oh, my point- its restricted to 13+ (with parent permission, of course).take care,arithron"
"yes because it would fall afoul of us anti gambling laws and all credit card payments from us consumers pending could be frozen."
"ambulation will need some spicing up to make it more than just walking around, and gambling should do the trick nicely. i seriously doubt that any us law enforcement agency would give it so much as a second glance, especially since in-game currency is not legally considered to be the same as actual rl currency. if you read the eula's of most mmos, the developer owns all virtual property and money generated.and besides, ccp is a company. thus, they have lawyers to tell them if what they're doing is legal. i don't think the legality of something is a valid issue for csm. we're gamers, not attorneys (for the most part).case in point: second life. second life encourages exchanging rl money for in-game currency, and has player-run and designed gambling centers. to my knowledge they have yet to be sued for this."
"online gambling, as in, that which is generally banned or restricted, is where you must deposit monies into a game expressly for the purpose of gambling, and where you can withdraw those same monies from the game to yourself by some means such as mailed check, bank deposit and so on.gambling in eve station does not cross any of those lines, as you do not pay a subscription to gamble, nor can you withdraw your isk in a means as outlined above to your local currency.you can purchase gtcs to sell for isk, but this is not directly related to the gambling and still lacks a means to convert isk back into real world currencies that is sanctioned by ccp.in short: if you can't put real cash into the game and take real cash out of it for the express purpose of playing games of chance, restrictions and bans do not apply."
"it's not gambling when no assets change ownership."
"hate to break it to you ugly but whatever ccp says goes, they don't make excuses, they make the rules and as such they're always valid.should it not make any sense or be gamebreaking that's another issue. the skillqueue gravytrain to bumville just isn't that important, in any aspect. so you missed to train something for a few hours..."
"agreed, for me, i currently set up my skills to complete at one of two times- betweeen 6pm and midnight, which is my usual playing time so if i'm logging in at this point, i'm logging in to play anyway, not just to change skills.- around 7:30 am, just after i get up but before i go to work. if i'm changing a skill at this point then there's no way in hell that i'm pulling a sickie in order to stick around to do stuff in an internet spaceship game. i'll just change the skill and go to work.therefore, in both circumstances outlined above, not having a skill queue does not encourage me to play the game more as i'd be playing anyway in the first example and don't count the second one as playing the game at all as all i'm doing is changing a skill and logging out."

"i don't think skill training time should be reduced, at least not like what you are suggesting...to encourage players to be try more things in eve like pvp, maybe ccp could take away the learning implants and introduce a new learning skill that would take the place of the implants, e.g. training advance skill progression to lvl 5 would give you +5 on all your attributes. or, keep the implants and introduce a skill that decreases training time by 1% per level...or something to that effect. at any rate, i don't think 50% is fair to both the new and old players, lvl 5 skills should be an accomplishment...not something easily gained, i feel your pain, i just trained caldari bs to 5 and it took almost a month, but it was worth it...and the benefits of lvl 5 skills need to be earned. also, \"giving\" players sp as compensation for the reduction in skill time would cheapen the sense of accomplishment that training those long, desired skills give players."

"bitter much?"
"what you are proposing would, as someone already said, destroy the game within six months. these players that you suggest quite eve because of 'training boredom', in my opinion, don't really 'get' the game. if it is all about having a fully skilled command ship, how many days do you think they will stick around after they (and pretty much every other eve player) has one. then following on, the isk price of gtcs will collapse, due to all the relative newbs selling gtcs, as it is their only way to fund their command ships etc. (and all the vets having left by this time). then the 'training boredom quitters' will quit because all the 'best' ships are too expensive. etc etc command ships etc were introduced after what, 3, 4 years, because the vets had nowhere else to go, but you just want to jump strait to the 'top', disregarding many years worth of great content and infinite other possibilities because..? if you really must have something special early, buy yourself a pimped faction battleship. many other relative newbs with a similar outlook on the game have taken that route (and quite a couple of days later when they get killed by a couple of cruisers or somesuch)."
"ill only agree to this if 50% of my skillpoint total is given to me to allocate to whatever i want, seeing as i would have used 50% more time getting to where i am than newer players would :p"
"one of the best features is the long skill training time . it's the things you learn getting there that will save your ass in this game . skill points dont mean **** without personal experience to back them up"
"there should be a way to increase training speed. booster of some kind! (50% reduction is overkill though)"
"seriously, everything i see on this forum is nerf this, buff that, whine whine whine. us newbies don't care. we want fun and engaging content. not running the exact same mission over and over for weeks to raise our standing.we want meaningful and easily accessible pvp. not having to rely on gate camping, can flipping, faction lolfare, and can baiting to see any pvp at all.we want to jump right in and play the damn game instead of having to wait a month or two on required skills.please pass on the message to ccp that the entrance bar to eve online needs to be drastically lowered. not to the level of wow of course, but enough for us to ease into the game with a reasonable learning curve (don't make me pull out that learning curve chart we've all seen).and if you haven't seen the zero punctuation video review of eve yet, it's in my sig. the video has been making its rounds and is an accurate depiction of the game."
"to start with, i suggest joining a corporation. eve is, fundamentally, a game based on corporations. you will find it a lot easier to get into the game if you join a corporation.also, you can find more info on my priorities, which include reducing that entrance bar here"
"who says you speak for all other noobs?: o )but yes... go join a corp... you'll get what you want... sooner or later."
"speak for yourself not for the new players. all you want is to get into the game, get the biggest beat stick possible the second day in, and then go around hitting people with it. well, good luck with that. i enjoy the time that is spent making my character the way it is. if you really want to go get into a fight, go get into a corp or how about this, pick the darkest corner of 0.0 and fly to it, they will shoot you up real good."
"heh...for pvp you could always just fly down through syndicate space...lots of ::cough:: friendly people will help you down there :-) on a serious note though, i undertstand your frustration, i was the same way when i was a noob and in most respects i am still a newer player, the thing that will make a large difference is finding a corp that will help you learn the ins and outs of eve...or at least a corp to have some fun with. as far as pvp goes, you might try the faction warfare, i haven't been part of it yet, but it might be something to look into."
"what are you highlighting as the bars to entry for newer players? pvp doesn't just take a bunch of skills. it takes practice, isk (to buy equipment) and a degree of luck.there are two issues right there...isk and skills. do you suggest lowering skill reqs, or speeding up skill training? how about a nice fat starting wallet? both have serious issues associated with them. it might be better to have an area of space set aside as 'training grounds'...oh, wait...that's faction warfare!seriously, the best way to gain experience is to join a corp or team up with a few more experienced players. eve is an excellent way to make new friends, and everyone needs a buddy when those ships start flashing red...take care,arithron"
"we currently have a situation where several corporations that now constitute the red.overlord alliance where ejected from red alliance. the reason given for this was failure to turn over to goonswarm systems that the overlord corporations wanted to retain to farm for purposes of rmt.now i'll give that coad is not generally noted for reliable reporting (to say the least). if true however (and goons and ra seem to generally be supporting this claim) then:1. it shows evidence of farming for purposes of rmt by member corporations of red alliance in the past.2. if true this would imply that currently, paid \"professional\" players are engaged in a sov war in 0.0 for purposes of securing space to be farmed for rmt.3. third party transfers of isk for value can be used to front for criminal activity (money laundering among others) which could leave member players not participating in the rmt open to legal action in their home jurisdictions.i would like to see ccp instiute a formal system and policy for dealing with rmt issues on the alliance level. this system would include a formal procedure for handling allegations of alliances or their renters engaging in rmt and referral to a board of gm's not affiliated with any 0.0 alliance for investigation.if these allegations are found to be substantiated the alliance executor and the ceo's of the involved corporations would then be notified. if, after a two week period, the situation remained unresolved, or a second substantiated claim of rmt where logged within a 6 month period, the alliance in question would be dissolved by ccp, all poses deleted, all assets of the executor corp and those corps involved with the rmt frozen and any stations owned by said alliance set to a npc corporation for a period of one week to allow for removal of assets. all corps in the alliance would be banned for joining another alliance with each other (under penalty of enforced dissolution) for a period of six months.a similar fate would befall a sov holding alliance with multiple instances of renters engaging in rmt."
"no, i am not in favour of collective punishment. having corp members who earn isk is not dissolution-worthy, even if those members break the eula as individuals."
"pretty heavy accusations there! if you have evidence of this, rather than hearsay, you'd probably be advised to put it in the form of a petition with associated evidence etc. if you don't have evidence, it's essentially slander...ccp has robust ways of dealing with rmt, such as account bans and such. there is no justification in dissolving an alliance for the actions of a few individuals that flout the eula. ccp will deal with such individuals when it is satisfied that rmt etc is occurring. _if_ it happens that those higher up in alliances are banned for such activities, the fallout within the alliance will probably result in dissolution of the alliance anyway.no need to punish the masses for the actions of a few!arithron"
"i feel that if rmt is a large part of a corp or alliance, then that corp or alliance should be dissolved. however for this to be true, a large number of core players will need to be involved, especially leadership. and i can't see how an alliance can survive if its leadership simply stop logging in, which is what the members will see.so i don't see any extra steps as being necessary beyond individual bans."
"note that dissolution only happens after the alliance executor and ceo's of the offending corps have been informed and on a second offense. i'm not talking about one guy selling isk here i'm talking about records showing a corporation to be hip deep in it. examples of this in game are:1. tyraxx rather amusingly, and openly, renting his enemies space to isk farmers. this in itself would be a lol, except tyraxx also let them into iac, which they then used to make them impervious to empire wardecs. we therefor have a document and admitted instance of a 0.0 alliance openly harboring a rmt corp for profit (500m/week i think and whatever thork was getting as a kickback).2. xelas alliance openly sponsored the doomsday alliance consisting of rmt corps operating in the fountain area in return to payments of isk. (the justification being that cloaked ravens might as well be giving intel). xelas alliance officials openly admitted to sponsoring isk farmers in return for payments and were ejected from the gbc as a result.3. knights of the southcross harbored a corp for over a year in which their where multiple forum posts showing the contract logs of the isk being laundered.4. members of tortuga have openly admitted that their space was well vacant except for a rmt corp that was paying tortuga several bill a month to live in pb.and these are the instances we know about. i'm sure a number of 0.0 alliances have reached arrangements that we don't hear of.and now we have the eve-china scenario playing out on tq with isk sellers openly contesting content. when alliances become involved in rmt with little mercy shown. its a matter of rl security for the members of the alliance not engaging in rmt. if an alliance is involved in rmt and that rmt is being used to fund criminal acts, then under the laws of some countries each member of the alliance could be individually responsible for the criminal acts (with various degrees of knowledge requirements). disbanding an alliance in such a situation is a service to its members, whether they want to admit it or not."
"while i did not say the accusations have been proven i believe that this thread"
"i'll avoid all the caod stuff, since i make a point of avoiding caod like the plague. but this last bit just seems bizarre to me. trading game currency for real currency is legal in virtually all nations. it violates the eula, but the eula does not have the force of law in any sort of general sense. the penalty for violating the eula is an account ban at worst, not rl fines or jail time. and there's no such thing as a eula violation by proxy, association, or conspiracy - you have to break it in your own right to be doing anything wrong. renting space to people for use is legit, even if those people engage in rmt afterwards. remember, eve doesn't exactly have an 800-year history of case law and jurisprudence. we have the eula and the tos, and that's about it - the only thing that could really qualify as case law is the kugu ban. the relevant section of the eula reads as follows: from my reading of that, even knowingly renting space to isk sellers would be legitimate. of course, that's hardly necessary, given the presence of the ignorance defence, but it does put a real limit on how far they can legally take your philosophy without serious eula amendments. i've got nothing against naming and shaming, but as said above, i have quite a lot of opposition to collective punishment, and that's exactly what you propose. if an alliance leader is breaking the rules, ban him, but don't punish the members."
"yah"
"agreed"
"the entire point of marauders was a pve ship, the huge price prevents most people from flying in pvp when combined with it being uninsurable, weak sensors making it easy to permajam, low buffer/tank compared to a carrier which doesn't cost that much more and is arguably much more useful in pvp.with the web nerf, the kronos/paladin get a 10% web bonus per bs level, giving a 50% bonus, or a 90% web.before the nerf, they got a 2% bonus per level, giving a 99% web.the entire point of marauders was an expensive pve ship, little use in pvp due to price and sensor strength. it was an intended feature for marauders to be able to hit all targets with their main weapons, as is shown not only by the kronos/paladin web bonus but also by the golem's painter bonus (excluding the vargur here as it has way too many other issues but those are for another thread).the nerf means that is is now 100% impossible to hit npc frigs even when webbed, while the golem's ability is unaffected.the kronos/vargur need either an increase in web bonus to 13% per level or the web bonus needs to be completely removed and replaced with an actual useful bonus (a second tracking bonus perhaps)"
"you can always use it as a salvager..."
"use drones for frigates. nobody uses torps or cruise missiles on frigates if possible."
"if ccp don't want the main weapons to be used on frigs at all, then why not completely remove the web bonus and replace it with something more useful (also, a bigger drone bay)"
"i did an angel extravaganza l4 this morning in my kronos and my warrior 2s handled the frigs fine in fact i can't remember an instance were hostile frigs weren't all dead b4 i was done killing bs's and cruisers ."
"hello,dont have much time to go through them all and see their policies, also because the few i read sounded somewhat obscure and not clear.me wants an antiwhiner anticarebear \"bring the violence but keep it polite\" kinda thing, is there any csm candidate that supports this single and sacred rule \"eve is pvp\"?thank you,r"
"hi"
"mmm, i checked your page out oz, but nothing specifically made me feel you going to make the whiners shut up and let the pvpers enjoy it more :-/"
"i certainly think there is a reasonable stance that can be taken against \"whiners shut up\". whiners are one of the only ways imbalance can be detected and fixed. fixing imbalance makes the game better. all of us are here because there is something about the game we wish was better. even you. as such, an \"anti-whiner\" platform cannot really be internally consistent. that being said, there are a number of candidates, myself included, who are dedicated to ensuring that more aspects of the game involve pvp and that creating conflict is the central purpose of design decisions, whether that is market pvp, research pvp, mission pvp, or good old fashioned boat violence pvp.e.g.link to campaign thread"
"well, as \"anti whiner\" i mean i'm tired of people trying to petition me every time i try to declare war on them, i specifically play this game for pvp as in player vs player combat, in space, i dont do market, i dont do production, i leave that to the carebears and select a few to extort every once in a while so i can make income (very hard earned) from pvp, so i can finance more \"interesting\" pvp. for one thing i don't like the war system as it is, 3 slots are not enough, should be at least five or seven.i would like the eula to specify that anyone can kill you (yes more than once) and nothing will be done if that someone isnt being rude, or racist or whatever. the \"harrassment\" smack on the hands should kick in over time! not just for me telling them i'm coming to get you. otherwise you're not tackling the problem, if i feel restricted in my possibility to pursue someone i'll just hire someone else to do it, simple as.i'm not calling for an open fragfest where the shooting never stops, this is why we have empire, i'm not saying that all people should pvp, i'm just saying that everyone is free to do missions, free to do trade, free to do whatever they want except for the purist pvpers (as in ships vs ships), and if someone in the csm isnt there to protect this dying race then i'm gonna call wwf animal protection! (joking)no really think about it, \"sandbox\" and \"balance\". if i've benn in the game 3 years and paid my monies every month i want the ccp given right to wardeck who i want for as much as i want, and possibly if i can afford it how many as i want, and all my targets can do about it is learn the game and kill me, or pay up.another thing i'd like to be tackled by csm is the insane misproportion between t2 ship efficency and cost, things are already unfair for us long timers, we skilled months (if not years) for them nice t2 ships, saved up loads to buy a nice versatile combination of ships/modules, and lo here comes along the speed nerf... what you going to do nerf jammers now that every gang will have falcons? whereas all that should have been done is give the players some more time to learn how to pvp or skill rapier/hyenas, now any noob in a frigate can come along and turn an mwd off, great a couple rifter noobalts and a blackbird (total cost? 15 mil?) can pwn any t2 recon or hac, i call this unbalance, but on the other side of the coin i also call a machariel 14k m/sec unbalance. i dont have the answers, i just want to keep enjoying this gamer"
"pvp is the past, the present, and the future.i'll be looking for issues that address the 'safer' feel of eve lately. i want to see low sec become more of a pvp zone for the players that wish to explore their darker side (actually have meaningful content there for them to participate in). i'd like to see a reverse sec status system operating in low sec also (the higher your sec status in low sec systems, the worse off you'll be). ninja salvaging, loot stealing etc; all good professions that should be encouraged. maybe a few tweaks to the system to make it chance based that doing such activities will result in aggro...arithron"
"i have never experienced this type of problem and i've done my fair share of pvp. the worst unwarranted thing that i've seen have been local muting. anything worse requires some serious abuse. there is a lot of concern about the speed nerf, but you're an elite pvper, right? you'll adapt.i think, for the moment, we are just going to have to accept that smart tactics will have a larger advantage than they did before over the expensive ships.i, personally, think that is a good thing, even if the changes might be a little bit severe, it means more people will be fighting. more pvp is good right? more challenge? new challenges?"
"i'd like to think that i'm something like what you're looking for. i'm not quite as much of a pvp purist as you are, but i think the war system needs work, and i'm a strong believer in pvp being legitimate and in fact the cornerstone of this game. as for people petitioning you over a war, i don't think that ever happened with me, but given that i know exactly what the answer will be, i don't see why you'd care. anyone who does that is choosing to hide behind false hope instead of doing military preparation during the opening stages, and is thus an even easier target than they would otherwise be when a gm rejects their petition. as for t2 ships, you're trading cost for capability. a hac is simply better than a cruiser, and mostly better than a battlecruiser. if you're good enough that the added capability is worth the added money, pay up - a veteran pvper should have a good enough kill ratio to justify the added costs. otherwise stick to pimping out your t1 ship skills. it's not like cruiser 5 is wasted even if you never set foot in a hac, after all. i won't address the balance issues - i haven't been able to get on singularity for a good round of testing recently - but i trust that it'll all more-or-less balance out at the end of the day, even if it does take a few months. and if you think falcons are going to be that common, fit a long-range battleship with eccm already - you should utterly demolish one if you plan ahead. don't whine, play the metagame."
"nice try,imho there is nothing more meaningful that the feeling of the pvp itself, when you do your first podkill, aaah. some players actually thanked me wardecking and killing them, saying they had their best time in the game, surely the adrenalin rush of an engagement in my eyes cant compete with a slowly growing wallet on lv4 farming.low sec looks to me already full of \"dark siders\"i dont understand what you mean by reverse sec standing hits, but me thinks that the sound of it aint goodlooting already makes you flashy, but i think that who loots should be flashy to the corp that owns the wreck but also to the person who killed him."
"ok it looks like pattern is the man to vote for!"
"i do like the idea, a calender that tells the player the day/month/year in the eve universe which they could plan activities or schedule things for themselves. maybe provide a corp planning calender which adjust date/time automatically to compensate for the players timezone (maybe through client settings).edit: kuzim, please update the name of this post to something simpler, e.g. [idea] in-game calender, so people will have a better idea of what the post is about and may be more inclined to read it.e.g.= exempli gratia which is latin that roughly translates into \"for example\""

"does anyone have any information on the next tournament? has ccp given up on this fun event too? if so, we need to kick someone to get it up and running. with the new patch it will be interesting to see people adapt to the new mechanincs, and flying styles. lets get this party started!wildcat"
"iirc in the most recent live dev blog someone asked a question about why there has been no alliance tourny in so long. the ccp people there started talking about how the tourny costed 5 digits and the significant number being very large so instead of doing that again they decided to create a small team to work on some way for there to be tournaments without direct ccp involvements (arena's or something like that)."
"the turny is boring as hell. who cares what stradigy or tactics you can come up with when 10x carcal missile spam will win. or 10x thorax, or 10x ruppies or 10x vexors or 10x <insert other random gank ship here>"
"^^^ yeah, i agree. but i still find it fun to watch the good parts of the fights and the commentary and some of the funny banter. i may ff through 75% of it, but i enjoy the alliance tourney and am very disappointed to see it disappear if that is the case."
"it was never the 10 ships of the same class winning... yeah, they did win some fights, but it was never the ultimate strategy in the end. it is simply not versatile enough, it does not have a strategic reserve so cannot adapt when already in the arena. i think that being professionally organized was a very important factor in the success of the tournament. i hope that even if they change it so that more teams can enter, there are a lot more qualification rounds that are not being broadcasted, at least the matches of the final 32 are done in the way of the previous tournaments. if you wanna push it, do not forget to vote in the relevant csm thread!"
"did anyone catch a glimpse of planetary flight update at fanfest? i think they spliced it into the quantum rise trailer too...the claw frig getting gunned down in an atmosphere of some type.i sorta need to see the presentation on that. it was when they were discussing war on planets.thanks o7"

"sorry for the delayed responses guys. i'm in iceland and the internet at this hotel is a pile of poo. i'm for what i think any reasonable person would be for. i have no problem with responsible and mature developers who can exercise proper judgment and not interfere with the game and cheat having access. i think we've had a series of unfortunate circumstances which have allowed the actions of a small niche of people with no self control to have a very negative impact on the game. i believe that the institution of ia is a great start and that if we can be assured that these things aren't happening, or at least if they are the people are actually punished, then the playerbase will be significantly more comfortable with the idea of developers playing eve again. i think for a majority of people the poor judgment wasn't as much of a problem as the complete lack of accountability."

"is there any that dare say they're not interested in a gooned out council?i think it's a fair question because i for sure will base my decision and cast my vote on someone anti-goon."
"i for one am running on an anti-stellar solutions platform."
"i guess it is a fair question, but also potential suicide for a campaign. but alas, i will bite.i am not specifically anti-goon. i respect them what they have done in our game, how big they have become, and will admit that hearing tales of the goonswarm is part of what got me back into playing eve. love them or hate them, they are a force to be reckoned with.that said i am not specifically pro-goon. rather i would prefer to put alliances aside and try and find out what is best for eve and act from there. if a proposal is also in the goon<U+FFFD>s best interest, great! else their influence will not sway me.in real life i am always thrust into a leadership position due to my outgoing personality and work ethic. i have been at the helm of student governments, sports teams, clubs, and random political activists groups for as long as i can remember.even as a child i always ended up leading team b in gym. with all of this experience i know what it takes to be firm yet not to the point of being hard headed. my will is strong and if elected you do not have to worry about me being \"gooned\" or what have you. finally, do not base your vote on a totally anti-goon platform. what if they actually were all the best candidates and could have done great things for eve?"
"what does anti-goon mean? does it mean that they are against the interests of goons? does it mean they are against the interest of large 0.0 alliances?because goons are players like anyone else, we like to have fun, and we do it within the context of 0.0 sovereignty warfare. this means that we want 0.0 sovereignty warfare to be fun, and all aspects of the game that we partake in to be fun.i suppose if you are against having fun in 0.0 and against having fun in other aspects of the game voting against a goon makes sense. it also makes sense if you are looking for someone who is going to focus more on low-sec or high-sec issues. otherwise you should look at specific ideals that each candidate has and make a decision based on that.darius for example has a pretty strong record for arguing for things that would weaken the position of the goonswarm alliance as a 0.0 power. he does this because the power of goonswarm doesn't mean anything if goons aren't having fun. at least, that is how i see it, maybe he is just griefing us."
"i admit i would gnash my teeth a bit if we would get 5+ goons in the csm (i assume that's what the op meant with 'getting gooned out of council'), but i don't think that being anti-goon in the csm would get anyone anywhere. we already had enough conflicts during the first csm and it was very counter-productive. the csm needs to work together and represent the players, goons and non-goons alike.in the end it is not up to me who has the right to be on the csm, it is the players decission. if a large amount of players vote for goons, then we have to respect their decission, as well as respect the council members they advocated.if you don't like goons, that is fine, and you can use your influence to vote or lobby for someone else. but starting a conflict, especially after elections, is disastrous and should be one of the things i, and i hope you as well, learned from the first csm."
"anti-goon? you mean, will i let the in-game politics/events carry over to a player body that meets in real life, to discuss whole game issues?i won't! in-game remains firmly there. i am working on the principles that all those that have stood for the csm have stood for the right reasons, and wish to make the game that we all enjoy (all players enjoy it, otherwise they wouldn't play) better. darius has shown himself to be a good, intelligent and useful member of the csm last round. it was just a shame that many csm members couldn't put in-game alliances and politics aside.eve allows for many different playstyles, which is why it's such a rich and entertaining place to reside away from the real world. i don't think it follows that a player's style reflects in any meaningful way their rl ability to be part of a council. there is the possibility this round of 7 members of goonsquad getting onto the csm. so long as they are there for the right reasons, and are prepared to listen and represent players, does that really matter? is it any worse than csm members being on the council, and running for the council, with the stated aim of catching ccp's eye for internship? i find it interesting how there is always one large alliance that everyone loves to hate...a few years ago it was bob, now it's goons...hopefully in a couple of years it's the gallente trade alliance!take care,arithron"
"anti? no, i think eve is about freedom. the goons certainly push that envelope. i am however worried that too many goons in the council could defeat its purpose.i would also like to see the goon candidates officially renounce the once proclaimed goal of the goons to \"destroy eve\".issler"
"destroy eve? they are doing a pretty good job so far, just a goodly-sized chunk of 0.0 to go, plus empire....pvp for the world!arithron"
"don't kid yourself, it's still bob. when was the last time goons did something putting them on the news radar?with this many goons running there should be a good size portion of votes open for candidates not in the goon pocket."
"you mean that goon goal that wasn't ever actually said by the goons? that one?-dbp"
"i think she means the \"goon goal\" that was \"renounced\" multiple times last election cycle by all the goons running."
"are you implying that i am in the goon's pockets? i might have misunderstood. it's really irrelevant which alliance/corp you play in within eve. given that players often have multiple accounts, they can be members of opposing alliances if they wish! what's important is the player- they are the ones that front up to meetings, discuss issues and vote. it's up to voters to decide which candidates they think will do a good job on the csm. it's interesting that 7 of the candidates are from one alliance, but there is no way of knowing how many of the other candidates have a bob/goon/red alliance etc alt. for all we know, 20 of the candidates could have a character that is a member of one alliance!i can look past in-game politics and work with others on behalf of players. it doesn't mean i am in anyone's pocket; just open-minded take care,arithron"
"i've said before in other threads that i regard the possibility of a goon-owned council as fantastically unlikely, and thus not really something to be afraid of. for a similar reason, it'd be almost impossible to block them - you'd have to find candidates, organize a campaign around the principle, and coordinate vote splitting well enough to get five of yours on the council, without any of the organizational basis the goons have and used to hardly world-shattering effect last time. but even if it were possible, i wouldn't be particularly worried - if that much of the eve player base is behind them, they deserve to be spoken for, and i trust ccp to filter out any ideas that are particularly stupid. now, i'm hardly pro-goon, and i don't think a \"gooned-out\" council would be a proper representative for the player base as it exists today. but if you're basing your vote on blind prejudice, i don't want it."
"the whole \"destroy eve\" schtick was mittani's attempt to instill xenophobia within goonswarm as a means of raising morale during a period of intense turbulence within the alliance. he believed that using propaganda to intensify the \"us versus them\" mentality within goonswarm would galvanize members, though if it did, it was only temporary, and in any case it was never official alliance policy."
"whatever the spin is i wouldn't want 7 gbc cronies on there either or russians for that matter. just give me one candidate that's not favorable to the goon mob scene."
"edit: added quoteswhat do you think that 7 \"gbc cronies\" would implement? we have to remember that this is a game, and we all play to have fun, there isn't some piece of the pie that we can cut off and keep for ourselves by playing politics. i would not be afraid of 7 \"gbc cronies\" on the council unless they were 7 completely foolish people. there isn't any damage they could do in a political sense that is not damage that anyone else could do by being foolish, the council is not set up in a manner that would allow it."

"well, as \"anti whiner\" i mean i'm tired of people trying to petition me every time i try to declare war on them, i specifically play this game for pvp as in player vs player combat, in space, i dont do market, i dont do production, i leave that to the carebears and select a few to extort every once in a while so i can make income (very hard earned) from pvp, so i can finance more \"interesting\" pvp. for one thing i don't like the war system as it is, 3 slots are not enough, should be at least five or seven.i would like the eula to specify that anyone can kill you (yes more than once) and nothing will be done if that someone isnt being rude, or racist or whatever. the \"harrassment\" smack on the hands should kick in over time! not just for me telling them i'm coming to get you. otherwise you're not tackling the problem, if i feel restricted in my possibility to pursue someone i'll just hire someone else to do it, simple as.i'm not calling for an open fragfest where the shooting never stops, this is why we have empire, i'm not saying that all people should pvp, i'm just saying that everyone is free to do missions, free to do trade, free to do whatever they want except for the purist pvpers (as in ships vs ships), and if someone in the csm isnt there to protect this dying race then i'm gonna call wwf animal protection! (joking)no really think about it, \"sandbox\" and \"balance\". if i've benn in the game 3 years and paid my monies every month i want the ccp given right to wardeck who i want for as much as i want, and possibly if i can afford it how many as i want, and all my targets can do about it is learn the game and kill me, or pay up.another thing i'd like to be tackled by csm is the insane misproportion between t2 ship efficency and cost, things are already unfair for us long timers, we skilled months (if not years) for them nice t2 ships, saved up loads to buy a nice versatile combination of ships/modules, and lo here comes along the speed nerf... what you going to do nerf jammers now that every gang will have falcons? whereas all that should have been done is give the players some more time to learn how to pvp or skill rapier/hyenas, now any noob in a frigate can come along and turn an mwd off, great a couple rifter noobalts and a blackbird (total cost? 15 mil?) can pwn any t2 recon or hac, i call this unbalance, but on the other side of the coin i also call a machariel 14k m/sec unbalance. i dont have the answers, i just want to keep enjoying this gamer"
"pvp is the past, the present, and the future.i'll be looking for issues that address the 'safer' feel of eve lately. i want to see low sec become more of a pvp zone for the players that wish to explore their darker side (actually have meaningful content there for them to participate in). i'd like to see a reverse sec status system operating in low sec also (the higher your sec status in low sec systems, the worse off you'll be). ninja salvaging, loot stealing etc; all good professions that should be encouraged. maybe a few tweaks to the system to make it chance based that doing such activities will result in aggro...arithron"
"i have never experienced this type of problem and i've done my fair share of pvp. the worst unwarranted thing that i've seen have been local muting. anything worse requires some serious abuse. there is a lot of concern about the speed nerf, but you're an elite pvper, right? you'll adapt.i think, for the moment, we are just going to have to accept that smart tactics will have a larger advantage than they did before over the expensive ships.i, personally, think that is a good thing, even if the changes might be a little bit severe, it means more people will be fighting. more pvp is good right? more challenge? new challenges?"
"i'd like to think that i'm something like what you're looking for. i'm not quite as much of a pvp purist as you are, but i think the war system needs work, and i'm a strong believer in pvp being legitimate and in fact the cornerstone of this game. as for people petitioning you over a war, i don't think that ever happened with me, but given that i know exactly what the answer will be, i don't see why you'd care. anyone who does that is choosing to hide behind false hope instead of doing military preparation during the opening stages, and is thus an even easier target than they would otherwise be when a gm rejects their petition. as for t2 ships, you're trading cost for capability. a hac is simply better than a cruiser, and mostly better than a battlecruiser. if you're good enough that the added capability is worth the added money, pay up - a veteran pvper should have a good enough kill ratio to justify the added costs. otherwise stick to pimping out your t1 ship skills. it's not like cruiser 5 is wasted even if you never set foot in a hac, after all. i won't address the balance issues - i haven't been able to get on singularity for a good round of testing recently - but i trust that it'll all more-or-less balance out at the end of the day, even if it does take a few months. and if you think falcons are going to be that common, fit a long-range battleship with eccm already - you should utterly demolish one if you plan ahead. don't whine, play the metagame."
"nice try,imho there is nothing more meaningful that the feeling of the pvp itself, when you do your first podkill, aaah. some players actually thanked me wardecking and killing them, saying they had their best time in the game, surely the adrenalin rush of an engagement in my eyes cant compete with a slowly growing wallet on lv4 farming.low sec looks to me already full of \"dark siders\"i dont understand what you mean by reverse sec standing hits, but me thinks that the sound of it aint goodlooting already makes you flashy, but i think that who loots should be flashy to the corp that owns the wreck but also to the person who killed him."
"ok it looks like pattern is the man to vote for!"
"as a low-sec mission runner with an interest in industry and trading who enjoys eve's lore and frequents the chronicles section of the site, i must say you have my support."
"no slight to darius intended.....have read logs and he does seem to be a solid personhowever, if one alliance has a controlling block of votes it is not so much as they use it incorrectly as people seeing it as such. the csm is a great idea and i applaud ccp for setting it up.. it cannot afford the impression that it is pandering to one group or another, it loses credability and that is all it has to go on. i am not impying that goon csm members would be dis-honest or push a hidden agenda that benefits only them (if one could even exist), but more that alliance \"x\" (for lack of better name) complains that every suggestion made by it's members is falling on deaf ears because of in game politics...which as was said before plagued the previous csm council.hey it's a game and it's the internetopinions and impressions are a dime a dozen"
"multiple candidates from the same alliance split the alliance vote. its about strategy and tactics. if an alliance wants to win the chair position on number of votes they need to concentrate on one candidate, if they want multiple votes for power bloc advantage on issues they need to split their votes. its a fine line though, and splitting too many ways might actually cost them any delegate positions if the split was too equal and below the entry level reqs of the council. realistically as long as this csm has the same number of votes cast as last time (or preferably more) then i can't see goons (or any other single interest group) managing more than 2 candidates from the nine. but ultimately thats something the eve public need to get involved in preventing by simply getting out and voting. if we ever got the situation where people were too lazy and cyncical to actually vote in volume and an organization like goonswarm did manage to foist six delegates of nine on the council then the blame would not fall on ccp or the csm organizers, (or even on the goons themselves) the fault for this would fall entirely on the player base itself for not caring enough to prevent it."
"the goons are the biggest alliance in the game, and part of the biggest alliance bloc in the game, with virtually no non-goons running from that bloc, and a coherent voting strategy. with this, they could have gotten the chair, two members, or possibly as many as three if they had split the vote with razor-sharp precision and had known exactly how many they needed. in order to get the 5 seats they would need for control, they would have needed to have a minimum of 966 votes each, or fully 2026 more votes than they actually got - if they knew in advance how many votes they needed, and if they managed to split them perfectly, with nobody forgetting to vote. there is no conceivable way for one bloc to have the influence you describe. also, candidates run as individuals, not as alliance members. how do you decide who is the alliance rep - let the leader decide? random chance? get everybody else to jump into a one-man corp for a month or run under an alt's name? what do you do if someone joins an alliance during the middle of their term of office - do they have to resign? no, that way lies madness. leave in-game politics for the game, the csm isn't about that, and we shouldn't create rules that make it be about that."
"on one hand i agree with you, and being out of any huge alliance really made me question running anyways. on the other, california gets 55 congressmen because it is the biggest state with the highest population."
"null"
"i would leave the average 0.0 income as it is, i think it is quite okay right now, it is not the lack of rewards that prevent people from going to 0.0. on the other hand, income distribution in 0.0 is not okay, as there are far more isk to be made for the average player in npc 0.0 than in player-controlled 0.0... that somehow contradicts the fact that holding player-controlled 0.0 requires quite a lot of effort.. there should be something changed so that these areas get at least as lucrative as the npc counterparts. operating an estabilished empire in 0.0 became too easy. starting a new empire in 0.0 became awfully difficult. barrier of entry into the 0.0 game should be severely lowered, while the operation of uninhabtant, but claimed regions of 0.0 should be more difficult for the alliances.also, with the new jump technology, roaming gangs have pretty much lost their targets, which is a very bad thing. ganking some random noobs in belts who do not pay attention is not the same as the roaming gangs ability in the past to properly cripple logistics inside 0.0. so roaming gangs actually lost their tactical value in 0.0 inter-alliance warfare. more simcity in space. they should be able to transform the space they have claimed and are defending in the way they would like to transform it. with waste amounts of investment they should be able to defend it better, or increase the rewards available in the systems. pardon?we definitely need some kind of role separation for the pos system. sovenerity and industry should be decoupled. by making sovenerity holding pos-ses special and more limited in number than the currently possible number of posses in system would make 0.0 sov wars more fun and the battles being fought around these posses more decisive. titans need to be changed. doomsday needs to go, it is ruining large parts of the game. i think the role of the titan needs to be rethinked. i would also like to see 0.0 logistics become more difficult, because right now it is bloody easy with all the jump drive capable ships. there is no risk transporting stuff between 0.0 and empire, and even the average people have access to these secure methods of transportation, by using jump bridges and jump clones. i would like to see more people doing the \"classic\" style of convoys that involve player movement through regular gates. i think ccp is on making it cooler anyways, with walking in stations, new graphics, and stuff like that. it would be cool to have options to decorate your space. within the design guidelines of course, noone wants another second life. random, unexpected events would also help a lot, like random rogue drone attacks on space. i am also missing interactive big scale, interactive ingame storyline events organized by ccp for 0.0. like the serpentis stealing that gallentaen titan."
"something needs to be done with the discrepancy between highsec and 0.0 incomes. unless you have a good system, its pretty much easier just to mine in empire and not worry about bringing your stuff through gatecamps etc. put more of a dependance on 0.0 in the game and maybe it will all balance out. i am afraid i do not understand what you mean by this question. please clairify or drop me an eve mail to discuss. i do not see 0.0 as an endgame. anyone and everyone can be productive out there. from the 60mil sp super vet, to the 6 day old newb in a cyno frigate there is a role for everybody. once you get past that initial shock of getting killed life becomes much easier. i think the ideal way to get more people into 0.0 is to educate. most people who start in eve(myself included) think nullsec = instadeath which couldnt be further from the truth. a better tutorial would do wonders, augmented with missions that get the people out there and show them what it is like. 0.0 is kind of a big deal already. with the growth of the mega alliances we essentially have several new empires in eve. a cool segue from the last question would be to allow alliances that grow to a certain size the ability to put their own npc agents in any place with an hq. then lower level players could do little missions which help the alliance in question and reward the new players with money from the alliance coffer, loyalty points, and standing. there are many kinks to work out, but this would be a neat direction to take eve in. again this question is sort of weird. i think that role bridge ships are a good idea, but only if the ship in question cannot outperform a ship specialized in a task. it should be about utility and not win mode. i really do not have experience with capitals so this is only opinion. i think the amount of caps is getting pretty high now(heard somewhere that alliances have at least 10 each or something) which is unimaginable to me. i see no problem with weapons buildups so long as there are enough incentives to risk them being destroyed. basically more epic battles.rainbows, cupcakes... seriously i do not know. you tell me what your ideas are. 0.0 is already my favorite place to go in the game and i think it pretty awesome. the only thing that would make it cooler is more variety in systems or different resources to capture. something to make combat happen more often and away from pos/gates."
"in what ways would you like to see 0.0 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvement?planet cracker class starships.how do you see the ability to operate in 0.0 evolving to improve and keep up with the game?perhaps some sort of npc faction, 'reavers' if you will, that attempt to distroy improperly defended systems. just to give people something to do. see city of heroe's 'rikti/zombie invasions' or wars live events as an example.what improvements would you like to see in 0.0 as an endgame, things to reward players for having \"made it.\"a welcome pack with fruit, hats and a dvd? the thing i'm told about 0.0 is getting there is the first step. how do you know you have 'made it'? nah i think you should set your own goals and rewards.how would you raise the status of 0.0 in a productive way to enrich the game?walk on pleasure hubs. nuff said.are you in favor of any role separation or gap-filling with regard to the infrastructure of 0.0? (in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined roles)personally i would like to see a deployable public station. or as close as possible at any rate.changes to any capitals or sub-caps in context of healthier 0.0?titans should have an exposed exaust port that leads directly to the main reactor. it should be about the size of a whomp rat.any other comments in areas not covered by the questions?witch space?finally, i'm a breakdancer in the real world. elements of style and expressions of soul are indispensable to anything i do, and will greatly affect my selection of csm candidates. how would you make 0.0 cooler?ability to overheat your engines maybe leading to self destruct causing damage in a wide area."
"keeping eve as a hardcore, competitive game and ensuring that the way it is being played in becomes more fun. these are my priorities. i know, i know, it is very general, but this is the best one-issue answer i could come up with. it covers all the areas i would like to support: roaming, lowsec, 0.0 sov fighting, in order."
"the most important imperative for ccp and the csm is to make sure that all aspects of the game have a strong tie in to pvp activity in some way. to make sure that the incentives for conflict are high, and the penalties passivity in the face of competition high."
"my biggest priority would be putting my money where my mouth is and investigating what issues are biggest to eve. my forum campaign has been low, but i have spent much time in the past month flying around to speak with pilots all over the universe to get their perspective on the status of eve.i would make this a priority and only after gathering a good amount of data(from the forums, players, etc) would i be prepared to answer this question again. the csm is about service to the denizens of the galaxy, and i would really like to do just that.too much of a cop out????.... uhhh i would like to put a mwd on my freighter! is that a good enough answer?"

"like i said in another thread on this topic, a paladin/kronos web is even better than it was before when compared to t2 webs. it's gone from 2 normal webs to 2.51 normal webs, ignoring the stacking nerf. and it's not like 90% webs are bad, after all - they mostly stop pretty much anything, especially when you put a pair on(and really, why else would you bring one of those ships into pvp?). even before the nerf, a nano hac with a t2 web on it was slower than a battleship with an afterburner. and if your preference is shooting npc frigates, it's still stupid easy, so that's hardly a concern."
"how about make it only appear on scans, both directional and probe, and uncloack to refuel for like 5 minutes at varying intevals, maximum four times minimum once, a day at random, that way some jerk can't just see it on scan and have some on come and probe it then next day or when convenient that day. as for the problem with things being cloaked inside it: simple! give it like 7500-10,000 m3 corp hangar, have it have a 600,000 ship maint bay, and make it take like .75m worth of strontium clathrates per day. ships that warped to it could use their cloaks in its special like say 12km bubble, so they could maintain covertness if they weren't idiots.also i like these names:dark blood covert fleet support substructure(instead of superstructure because its relatively small)ofcourse you would also have the different pirate names there, and maybe you would only be able to get them through faction rat drops or loyalty points for 0.0 npcs?"
"i'm loving the concept but not the details. no ships should be cloaked while using it, only the base itself. giving a group of ships an autocloaked safespot is too much.the fueling requirement should not be materially based. what about giving the black ops and the blockade runner new roles that enable them to interface their capacitors to the bases and reload them? the bases should be capable of allowing a ship to refit as long as the base is exposed during the ship's refitting. no defenses...no reinforcement period. if it gets found it dies.the technology that allows that thing to sit there cloaked should be expensive."
"i think he means that you should gain standing for killing players that have a low security status. this would be an incentive to attack low security status players and increase the amount of pvp and division between people of various sec status.its a fairly commonly proposed idea, but it probably wont fix the problem that it intends to fix[that its hard for player to aggressively defend space against pirates without becoming a target themselves]pattern is a good choice, but he is more for implementing environments[which would be more variation in the space we fight in]"

"1. i would like to make 0.0 production more dense. currently space cannot support very many players. while this seems like it would give alliances a reason to expand, it really just reduces conflict as player density and contact with enemies is reduced. this means moving missions to player built stations and adding other methods of dense production. this will naturally draw later alliances closer together, opening space for conquest.2. i see it getting harder to actually do stuff, but easier to maintain the system when you're not being attacked. ideally you want to make attacking things very profitable and reduce the burden to maintain space to offset the increased risk.3. there need be no reward but the space you have taken. if you think there needs to be, i would ask you, what is best in life?4. make the space valuable and people will fight over it. this game always needs more things to fight over.5. this question is not complete enough to anwer, though in general, infrastructure needs a trimming in terms of durability and reduction in upkeep.6. doomsdays become a single target attack that does an immense amount of damage. possible: capital remote repair units only work while in triage mode. this reduces the effect that titans have of removing an entire class of ships from the fight while the second chain removes the ridiculousness of invulnerable carrier blobs.bonus question: jazzhands."

"i am start a formal petition to eliminate the missile nerf that has been put into effect with the release of the queantum rise expansion. according to these new \"changes\" missiles of all sizes are relatively ineffective against ships. every \"class size\" that the missiles are designed to target can move faster than the missile's explosion velocity. therefore, the only way to get your base damage back is to target something bigger than your missiles were made to shoot. even then the speed of the vehicle is still faster than your missile explosion velocity and decreases the damage. so i ask you to sign your name and or comments to this petition to return missiles to thier old already weak state. or to at least change the specs to make missile use viable again.update- this thread is for those of us who think that the changes to missiles are unfair and hurt our game play compared to the other races. this is not a thread to argue, or curse at eachother. i wrote this thread because i think that cruise missile should hit a battleship for full damage, not because i think a cruise missile should hit a frigate for double. missiles were underpowered for pvp compared to all other races, thats why in previous patches, they increased the torpedo launcher rate of fire while making its range shorter. they made that change to give caldari a fair fight. why would they now, make missiles ineffective in anything but shooting a stationary target? i agree that they had a good idea, but there numbers are too extreme. you're not going to get better damage against a larger target than the ship you fly, you're going to get your old damage back, but against a ship the same class as yours you will be underpowered. consider hacs for a second, a cerberus with hams had about 2/3s the dps of a ishtar, and half the tank, now, you wont even stand a chance.\"please make sure that if you support this topic that you select it from the menu under the text area of your reply located above where you click to post your reply.\"arikanaiz--"

"/signed also. how does ccp even justify the logic in a cruise missile having an explosion velocity of 69m/s?i was about to blow up a sin on sisi when he realised he was being owned so he started to run away from me. it was bloody annoying to see my explosive torps go from doing 780 damage per missile to 130 damage cos he had an afterburner fit. ffs"
"/signed. these missile changes suck really bad. i trained those skills for nothing."
"signedwe have tested missiles now and they are totally worthless... bs can speed tank part of torpedeos damage only by moving without mwd ot ab. missiles are totally busted now, i'm really hapy i have cross trained gallente and minnie ships and gunnery.missiles weren't that good before, why did they had to totally broke them.p.s. caldari militia will have some problems ahead..."
"like any good socialist country where the morally \"superieur\" elite plays to the whining weak to get their vote. ccp has decided to cash in the amarr, minmatar and gallente vote by nerfing missile skillsagain! maybe all caldari ship players should start petition ccp to get their money back for all those months spent on missile skill training. since that has now been a waste of time and your money.the upside is that ravens will go over the counter for like 20mil in 1 month. //signed//"
"/signed a 1000x along with the changes to the speed, faction mods and everything else you did in this patch you can take it back and give us a game we like again. how many accounts are being canceled, that's all i want to know.oh yeah i forgot to mention during the livedev blog that the zulu stated that our opinion doesn't matter to the developers, besides being priceless jackassery that made me feel special, i doubt anything will change the declining state of eve."
"you mean they work exactly like all the other types of guns? *mind blown* it is my opinion that this is exactly how missles should work but everyone is just used to them being broken."
"/signed. there should be no such thing as \"explosion velocity\" for missiles. isn't the signature radius enough? that alone should prevent us(if done correctly) from wrecking smaller vessels while allowing us to keep the dps up against ships of our own size.as for the previous posters argument that missiles work the same way as turrets, no, not really. the thing screwing over turrets is tracking, and that becomes less of an issue with increased range, and ships at close range will almost undoubtedly fit webs instead (which btw, you cant do with cruise and long range missiles...) so the tracking issue isn't as big for them as the explosion velocity thing is for us.also, let us not forget that missiles also have the minor issue of not being able to hit an opponent whatsoever if that oponent is heading away from the missile at a velocity greater than the missile itself. i don't know to what extent the speed nerf might have effected this, but considering base velocity for a missile is about 3.5km/s i dont think it's difficult for a well fit ship to zoom away from one (or at least move fast enough to get out of range of the missile before it hits them...)."
"signed.fix this problem"
"only after they fix webs, and make damn scramblers non-mandatory modules (and less overpowered then now, instant full stop is silly, and even sillier after agility changes since now you deaccelerate much faster).missile nerf is just as balanced as the 400% tracking nerf in webrange, and the inferiority of even dual webs compared to scramblers for holding people down.reap what you sow."
"did you not notice that webs have been nerfed as well? did you not notice that the battleships that need to get into web range have had their speed nerfed? sorry but believe it or not it's not only missile ships that have been nerfed, get used to the changes."
"webs have been nerfed by 400%, at that."
"helpful eve tip: races other than caldari can and consistently do use missiles."
"no they don't work like all types of guns, the damage penalty they suffer from a moving target is great than that of a hybrid turret and thier rof is no where near the same. if you remember, a raven couldn't rival the dps of a megathrone, moving target or not. now, if the target is moving we can have up to a 50% drop in dps... is that still balanced and fair?"
"but your guaranteed to hit every time"
"what use is that always hit mechanic if a t1 torpedo only deals 40% damage to an unfitted phoon?"
"fix it!.ya i can hit everytime but i cant kill **** all, thanks ccp :). really balanced!!"

"/signed what mik said"
"/signed"
"this is not the problem. in fact, consider yourself lucky a 'short range' weapon travels that far.the problem is due to the fact that missiles do 10% damage to classes larger than the missile, and instead damage me when i aim at smaller vessels."
"/signedgotta laugh at the idiots at ccp who say that missiles in 26,000ad underperform missiles right now in real life. i think someone in the development section screwed up their math and left out 2 zero's somewhere along the line and were too ashamed to admit the mistake so they said \"oh yeah that..........that's what it's supposed to be\""
"oh noez... now a raven earns the same amount of isk as all the other ships while spamming missions. oh please ccp fix this now! i am crying real life tears now that missiles work like every other weapon in the entire game. i know i cried and whined for the nano nerf, but i changed my mind, i swear. please fix my cnr. my children are running out of food due to my lost isk sales!!!"
"i find this quite hilarious, many of the people who are against the missile \"fix\" are the very same people that cried \"nerf speed\" and were very smug when they knew they had got their way, now the tables have turned and now you also have to adapt like everyone else....... whats good for the goose is good for the gander.i've been in eve for over 5 years now, i know and expect i have to adapt from time to time, you are not going to get this changed so just get over it."
"stfu you ignorant fool. my former corpmate used to solo the blockade in his tempest (i think) in 40 minutes. with my 7 mil sps in missiles, i could hardly break an hour. now i'm not even going to bother trying because i know it'll take twice as long."
"if you aren't gonna sign the petition then stfu. we couldn't care less about what you think"
"so, heres a novel thought. quit spamming missions like an isk farmer, go to low sec and play the damn game. you kids were sooo happy when you thought this nerf meant \"drakes online\". and now the streets are running high with a river of carebear tears. heres another thought: fit light drones. buy a tissue. dry tears. problem solved.and hold on..... it took you 10-20 minutes longer... oh noez... this is an out rage. you should petition to get your life back."

"i'm not even going to justify this garbage with a respon...damn!"
"it's not a physics arguement. this was done to keep missiles from over-powering the game. ccp wont roll it back. go play wow please, i hear the pve is wonderful."
"yes.. i was angry when i posted the above and forgot to factor in the speed mitigation. and no.. i have a reason to be a bit irritated with the shorter range.. 36km before (no rigs in widow/raven) 20km post.. with the ability to speed tank the dpsto the carebear comment.. sorry .. but i am more ****ed my training for a torp/cruise support widow is gone that covered the last 5 months. 58 mil down the drain for that skill book."

"...dude you know that 69m/s is 250km/h right?"
"for all of you who think that missiles are now \"balanced\" and \"inline\" with the other types of weapons, consider this, before the patch, a torp fitted raven, with full missile skills, and drones with full skills still couldn't match the dps of a megathron, now with this new patch, the torpedo damage is yet further reduced if the target is moving, a megathron could solo kill a raven just about any day of the weak, now, a mega can possibly take on 2 or 3 ravens. you say our weapons are now balanced and inline with the other races, i tell you if you look at the math, and actually take a second, you'll see that all missiles are now ineffective against thier given targets. as far as \"use webs\" well that kinda kills out tank since caldari missile boats are shield tankers and need midslots to be able to do so, so now we have a ship, with reduced damage, and reduced tank, so there goes fleet opperations for caldari. now to bring up the faction warfare issue... i think ccp is telling us that the gallente are going to win the war!! considering that the gallente race has ships specifically made to use microwarp drives, kinda kills any chance the caldari have. picture a gallente ship, with a microwarp drive, outside of scram range spamming you with railgun fire, while another with a tank, afterburner, and scram hold you down so you can't go anywhere, well you can't kill either of them now can you?"
"/signedspeed rebalancing = now everyone can speedtank 50% missile damage, not only few nano***gots can tank 100% like before? wtf? long-range missile dps was already far from stellar and delayed, now it's nerfed even further against any ship of same class?missiles don't even have modules similar to tracking computer/enhancer. and even more missileboat tank is supposed to be sacrificed now to fit a target painter."
"*snip - mitnal*why do think missiles even exist in todays world ? to over-power the enemy, thats exactly what missiles are/were designed for \" shear destruction of any type of target from range\". i mean i know this is a game but it is designed around real life dynamics(the future)community, prosperity , millitary .. the list goes on. lets put some real life perspective on this as seen the makers want eve to seem so real.are you telling me (for example!) an apaches helfire missile should barley damage an enemies ****ty run down truck just because hes going 50 mph and because the enemies ak47 cant do much damage to the chopper becuase of its range ? missiles are meant to over power guns !!also would todays millitary forces nerf there missiles because they own tha fck out of the enemies forces ? hell no again .. missile are designed for that.at the end of the day real life and game life you have choices .. either be a terrorist with a ****ty ak47 and get owned by millitary missiles or be gallente with your rails blasters or projectiles and again get owned by the caldari might of missile massacre.we all had/have the choice at the start of the game to be .. gallente/gunboat/drones or caldari/missiles-pwnage/ err whats the 3rd ? can think of anything else that caldari have/had going for them lol .. etc etcthe problem is we've all had that choice taken away from us in eve now. the missiles testers have all come back with disasterous results which is truely bad not just for the missile users but the whole caldari race aswell. and all those months of training missiles skills to the max just for them to be made worse than guns which will take alot of members far to long to rectify by training gunnery skills.what a f****n farce this is! expansion my ass more like demotion of the caldari race./signed by the way !"
"if you can't refrain from using vulgar language in this thread then i guess you voice your own ignorance. if you feel you must curse at those of us who use missiles and are trying to voice a change for ourselves, then by all means continue. however, when they decide to make your rof slower, or make your tracking speeds slower, don't complain to us about it because it will fall on deaf ears. you think we're just a bunch of carebears who whine, fine, think what you will, but i feel truely and honestly cheated that now my pvp experience is tarnished by any ship that can travel at 100m/s or faster. how would you like to have you damage halved against everyship from cruise up unless you're using light weapons? i wonder how strong your battships would be with small nuetron blaster iis or small beam laser iis??? i don't think you'd stand much of a chance at pvp either now would you?"
"tbh the missles were as out of line as nano ships, so ccp fixed both. there is no way that a long range bs weapon should be able to hit a cruiser at under 1km from you, its completely out of line and no other long range bs weapon can hit a orbiting cruiser sized ship that close. bears got nano killed and missles inlined, that just the way ccp works"
"jesus tap dancing christ.. is reading comprehension really this bad on these forums? do you even know why people are complaining? at all? the least you can do is read the damn thread before opening your mouth and spouting a bunch of inaccurate assumptions."
"ok now theve killed caldari missile monstrosities its time to make smart bombs caldari only,put them under the missile skill tree, pimp the dmg power, extend the range of the bombs and allow them in empire. then i might forgive ccp for this"
"if anyone would even look at the numbers, a light missile, designed to shoot frigates, has an explsion velocity of 170m/s, the only things that can't out run that going its base speed are battleships, industrials, and mining barges woot woot, now theres some pvp fun!!!!"
"i cant say anything, it's just wrong to lower the damage capabilities of a weapon in this way.turret weapons arent effective on short range if u use long range weapons or in short range if u use short range weapons, but they all can do allways max damage under the correct configuration.let's describe the correct configuration for doing max damage on missiles.* your missile explosion velocity has to be higher than target velocity. after nerf, it's like if every ships is flying ten times faster than it was before, so a crap bs flying 130 m/s is like a 1300 m/s bs.* the speed comparison between any missile explosion velocity and their same size ships objective is totally a joke. on normal combat they have like a 40% speed of the ship and in most cases in pvp it's down to 10%. even a npc-rat can speed tank u.* the drawbacks from missiles keep the same (fly time to deal damage, posible destruction by smartbombs-defenders, u can keep outrunning they).* missile weapons + shield tanking is a total pain, so being missile ship focused has a huge lack of posibilities in fitting.it's totally out of range. u have lowered speed for all people but u have destroyed the way of playing using missiles./signed."

"i like the new missiles. no more escaping their effects simply by going fast, meaning that the range advantage of long-range ships becomes meaningful. meanwhile, close-range missiles are pretty much unaffected.the old situation was far too binary, with missiles doing either full or no damage. it was stupid. the new formula is much more sophisticated. cruise could do with another look, however."
"lol if people think devs cant make bigger stupid nerfs, than they making a new patch full them :dwhat a noob of balancing team. even a stupid half bake chicken would make better changes"
"lol regardless of how sophisticated the math is, the outcome is still the same, and \"no more escaping their effects simply by going fast,\" every ship in the game can now speed tank missiles, depending on thier size, some without even using mods. and missiles didn't either hit for full or no damage, damages were reduced by sig radius and explosion, they just booted the ratio for some reason. \"rage rocket, assault missiles and torpedoes and fury light, heavy and cruise missiles will do less damage to their own ship class but will do more damage to a larger ship class. they will also have a -10% range reduction. \" so, if i fit a rage torpedo, and engage a battleship, because i'm' in a battleship, it'll do less damage? the folks at ccp didn't think this through, and didn't listen to anyone that told em it'd be a bad idea, they simply said, hey, this sounds complicated, lets do this!!! it'll be great, they'll all be glad we're here to come up with such complicated and \"shopisticated\" ideas.....\"the simplest answers, are usually the correct ones!\"put it back to normal and leave em alone!! they sucked before don\"t make em suck worse."
"dude... did you know that every ship in the games speed is in meters/second???? not km/h????/"
"do you know how the metric system works? km/h is the same as m/s."
"oh dear.if a ship larger than a frigate or certain hacs is fitting a ab, the chances are that your damage output to it is quite inconsequential, because said ship is lol fit. also, an abing ship is trivial to web, and if you don't have your target tackled and webbed, why are you shooting at it? damage mitigation via abs looks nice on paper, but doesn't actually work very well in practice.rage hams and torps still require the target to be tackled, but now do more damage. that's a boost, in my book. as is the massively increased damage of any missile to any fast mwding target."
"binary? at least there was a way to use missiles @ 100%.cruise raven for pvp? deadstealth bomber? deadwidow? it was pre nerfed before... now it's even worst.using caldari ship for pvp with missiles today:torp raven/golem, only if your fleet is rdy to support you.good dmg vs any bs without ab. bs with ab or any other ship can speed tank ur torps.cerberus, you can deal dmg to every ship, but you can't break any tank alone and also you don't have tackler capability, but if your mates are smart, you can see your name into the killmail."
"hyperion, a massive tank? srsly hype got one of the worst tanks due its 6 lowslots, not to mention active armor tanking in general sucks. srsly missiles are fine now and ships like the golem aren't straight overpowered anymore. look man shield boats got best tanks available (i demand crystals for armor reps!) so they should live with dealing less dmg than armor tanking boats. and yes u need to sacrifice a mid and sacrifice tank in order to do more dmg; armor tankers had to do that for aaaages. get used to it."
"are we not getting something here? where is the \"massively increased damage of any missile to any fast mwding target\".... the faster the target the less damage the missile does. \"also, an abing ship is trivial to web\" so, now those of us who shield tank instead of armor tank must sacrafice a mid slot to equip a web, even though the web has had the its effectiveness reduced from 90% on a t2 to 60% on a t2, which even on cruisers, 1 t2 webifier still leaves the ship traveling over its base speed, which inturn lowers damage done by missiles? so that negates the purpose of the web.people may argue, that turrets don't always hit. yes thats true, people will argue that missiles always hit, no matter the range, yes thats true too. but whats a turrets rate of fire? whats a launchers? a large t2 nuetron blasters rate of fire, 7.88 seconds, the rate of fire on a standard light missile launcher, t2, is 12.00, so a missile, made to hit frigates and destroyers, which any noob starts out with.. has over a 4 second delay in rof than a turret designed for engagin battleships! now, if that battleship is flying away from it, the missile does less damage.\"turrets have negative effects for speed as well arik!\" only if that target is orbiting, and even then, you have mods to increase tracking speed, oh.. and our \"explosion velocity vs. ship velocity penalty, it doesn't matter which direction thier going, as long as thier going. turrets can strike for perfect damage if a target is flying straight towards them. i've seen people 1 volley an interceptor going over 9km/s, a megathron, with railguns, taking out a ship going 9km/s, with one volley. now, my missiles wouldn't even do 0.2 damage.thank you ccp"
"there was also a very easy way for people to avoid missiles 100%.cruise has problems, i agree.torp raven is unchanged. it always needed support, so nothing has changed here. in fact, it's a stealth boost because some of its competitors - blaster- and ac-boats - are being nerfed by the greater difficulty in getting to optimal.ham drake has been boosted. it still gets full damage against a webbed bc target with rage. ham drakes always fit webs, and rage damage has been boosted. loss of jav range is inconsequential. and again, some of its competitors have been nerfed by their greater difficulty in getting to optimal.cerberus has been massively boosted. it isn't a solo ship, so the only ships that you'll be firing at alone are things like falcons, which don't tank. now its range tank is far stronger, and it can defend that range, because anything capable of closing on it will be 500% painting itself. (apart from interceptors, but you can still damage them with hms, where they were previously immune, and the aml cerb is death to all interceptors).btw... stop mention lolafterburner fits. abs are not sensible on anything other than frigates, certain hacs and logistics. and even when you do need a web, you do not need to fit a web. your gang does. but it did anyway, to stop targets simply mwding off and laughing at your cluelessness."
"rage torps damage got \"boosted\" from 540 to 576, that's only an increase of about 6.67%. do you think that \"boost\" is in scale with giving rage torps over 15% more explosion radius?point is, whatever standard rage torp boat fitting you have, you will do less damage now because of the decreased damage per sig radius ratio of rage torps - not to mention this is disregarding the ridiculousness of targets being able to speedtank torps with only an ab.so now you need your bs-sized target double webbed, and double painted - the only way to do full damage with rage torps now to bs targets.yes this isn't a solo game, but look at it now, a megathron up against other battleship targets doesnt need as much/many support/support modules to hit for full damage with t2 close range ammo than a raven with t2 rage torps does."
"not signed everyone brought this on there selves with moaning about nano's but then the nano's moaned about the misiles uber dps and ability to hit them and that got nerfed gallenete moaned that we couldnt get in range we got a speed buff for us all so whats this tell u dnt whine about stuff that means nerfing!! it will just nerf everyone"
"let's do the same to turrets that u have done to missiles.if u try to hit a ship that is smaller than the ammunition that it's supposed to be required to kill it, u should reduce the damage in the same way than missiles are suffering now.using a large turret vs a ceptor should mean doing 25/400 = 1/16 of damage.using a medium turret vs a ceptor should mean 25/125 = 1/5 of damage.using a small turret vs a ceptor 25/40 = 5/8 of damage.let's see what happends then.this is totally ridiculous to think that this nerf means balance. this means de destruction of missiles."
"what you forget is that sig radius and exp velocity are multiplied together to get a factor to apply to your damage, here is an example for you; my vagabond takes more damage mwding in orbit (what you used to do to reduce/eliminate damage), than it does just flying at base speed, even though going ~3km/s it is a lot faster than the exp velocity, its signature radius is so greatly increased that it takes more damage.also, bring a friend in a vigil or bellicose or their t2 variants, there is a nice 40km range dual web dual painter for you (or maybe an interceptor with a point and painter, or an ab with web and painter that can sig/tracking tank, while you put point on, small gang turret bs are going to need tacklers too now, why should you be any different. as for torps not outdamaging a megathron, you are wrong, they could on a raven with equivalent implants and skills do more damage, at 6x the optimal range, so don't know what you are complaining about, you should compare with lasers with scorch ammo loaded in for your dps bracket, not blasters with high damage ammo."
"have you not noticed all the complaints about gallente blaster boats in web range now that webs are nerfed? the damage reduction against a smaller vessel with a savvy target is 100% from main weapons (i ignore drones as both missile and turret bs can field them).i can tracking tank a deimos in web range with an interceptor, he cannot kill me, period, against a cerberus or even a caracal, i would likely have to disengage.edit: and blasters are the best tracking guns, so whatever problems they have are amplified inside webrange for the others. you trade off potentially reduced damage at all ranges with missiles, for potentially full damage at all ranges."
"instead of just complaining i offer a fix to ccp, increase launcher rof 30%, and decrease the size of the missiles to allow launchers to carry more ammo.currently torpedo launchers carry around 18 rounds, while blasters carry 120. about 7 times as many rounds.with the current \"changes\" to missiles in regards to velocity penalties with missiles, increasing the rate of fire and ammo capacity will \"balance\" the pvp aspect for missile based characters. considering pvp makes up the core of player interaction within eve (yes everything eventually goes back to player versus player, don't argue that point.)"
"ur nowlegde on hybirds failthe blasters llready miss 9/10 times on smaller oponents due to tracking failness on the turrets even with ship bonus it isnt enough but we dint whine about it as much and ask for them to nerf everyone else so we can win"
"saying \"you brought this on yourselves\" sounds more like an argument of spite rather than logic.did you ever think that this missile nerf to bring it in line with the nano nerf went just a tad overboard?"
"this is because misiles have range and allways it unless the target is moving fast yet blasters miss 9/10 times and have very very reduced range compared to missiles"
"i do on some level yes but wasnt the nano nerf allso tad overboard as the nanoers said ?"

"/somewhat signedi'm ready to adapt to the current changes, but cruise missiles are definitely screwed. i found it weird while missioning in a battleship that npc cruise missiles were dealing less damage than npc heavy missiles, by a significant amount, even though they were of the same damage type. makes no sense for pve and neither does it in pvp."
"looks like some isk farmers got unhappy and forgot to adapt..."
"agreedand the wiered fact is caladari are trying to blame it on gallente saying there overpowered by missing nearly all targets with fail tracking and they have loads of charges in there ammou -_-"
"dps was balanced over the years anyway.that is not the case on this moment, all the other types of turrets have higher dps.in most alliances they advise everyone not to use ravens for fleet combat anyway, with this change, its even less worthwhile."
"this only works if the speed nerf is removed. if the speed nerf is implemented and the missiles left the same all that will happen is you will have 15 drakes on a gate and missiles would become the new nano. while both nerfs were over the top the reducing of the ludicrous speeds was needed and with the over insane speed nerf missiles needed to be nerfed."
"this patch *cough* i mean expansion is farcical. heres what ive seen up to now just testing my hawk on a ****ty high sec drone exploration plex.pre-nurf (with out the maths)hawk - top speed w/o gistii b type ab - 325 m/s with ab 525 m/s4 light launchers with cal navy blood claw light missiles kills all drone types with 1 or 2 volleys stationary or moving !post-nerf hawk - top speed w/o gistii b ab - 325 m/s .. with ab 774 m/s (nice speed nerf :p )when stationary it took me about 5 - 8 volleys to kill the same type of ****ty drone. when moving some of the drones took 3 volleys and other drones still took up to 8 volleys even with speed tanking or w/e its called lol.so the nerf has actually increased my ab speed by roughly an extra 50% on top of what it was before the patch. and also easy (1-3/10) drone plexs in my hawk are now as difficult as a pre-patch raven in a lvl 4 mission.ive also noticed the hawk has the same paint job as the harpy now .. what ive also noticed (maybe im wrong) is that i'm sure the hawk had shield resist bonuses before the patch and now its says my hawk has shield boost bonus (on the discrip page)... am i wrong ?also my minnie alts probe frig ship had a top speed of 375 m/s and now its over 400 m/s"
"you caldari guys always cry for something.you want the speed nerf and now starting cry when come out.can i have your stuffs ? :d"
"yes but which would hit more often therefor doing more dmg in a 1v1 if raven has set his range right u could take mega o half armor maybe before mega got there and then you could just keep on missile spam whille ur shield is pretty much safe"

"ok, you show me fraps of a mega missing 9/10 against a battleship, and i'll resign from eve completely. show me a raven, that can 1v1 against a megathron and win, web or not, damage is still reduced from a raven while the mega can use 5 ogre iis, and 7 blasters. last i checked raven only had 6 torps.and as far as this whole speed nerf, what did they really do to your speed? made it so afterburners are faster? made it so mwds are stoppable? and just so you guys get the picture, the only real way to stop an ecm boat, was with fof missiles, now all that ecm ship has to do is fit an afterburner and its about invincible :-p you want us to adapt, be prepared to see alot more ecm.. wait, then you'll complain about caldari being better than you."
"whatever you do, it will not work, ccp don't change changes ^^so just drop it.i actually like the idea of the change, although we need some expl vel mods and it is a little or a lot overkilled, and the dmg need increasement to compensate"
"i've noticed, the only ones who really seem to be say we should stop complaining aren't caldari? eliminator2, i wonder what yendaj would say, seeing as how she primarily flies caldari ships i'm sure she'll give you an ear full."
"ever flown a turret ship?"
"raven is a much better gang boat, doing the same dps at much longer range, therefore it is not unreasonable to expect mega to be better solo boat.fof didn't work, didn't have enough range to take down a jamming boat, and they would always go after a closer target anyway."
"yes stalina, this isn't my only character, i have a gallente one as well. she is alot younger than this one, but now, could easily whoop me in a bs vs bs fight.turrets don't miss 9/10, tracking doesn't effect damage against another battleship even if the thing is using an ab, they have more turrets and a higher rof. my raven, even with a web, still can't beat her.and for those who say armor tanking is weak, ever tried to make a cap stable active tank for shields? i can do it for armor, but i can't make it work with the same effectiveness for shields... hmm wait, a majority of the engineering mods are mid slots, ohh shield tanking takes midslots? my hyperion, massive tank, 6 lows or not, 7.5% armor boost amount per lvl makes for a nice tank.. like everyones been saying why don't you adapt???"
"what is going to happend?well, all missile bs gonna be dropped to unwanted stuff. not usable in pve and nothing to say about pvp so just scrap.pvp gonna be restricted to turret weapons even more that it's allready.the only worth ship with missiles will keep on nighthawk but it's price is a problem for pvp so any 1 trying to do missions with missiles will switch to it.time will show what i am saying here.have fun."
"i am truly worried about a lot of you. please adapt your ship fittings.target painters are your new best friend. stop firing at frigates with missiles that are too oversized. if you want to kill frigates in a cerberus/nighthawk then fit assault launchers. it just isn't rocket science (lol get it). if for some reason your innate ability to troll yourself rotten is only derived upon the forums, maybe you could have friends in game.consider forming a balanced gang able to take on a number of targets. maybe i am just speculating however. medium and large turrets now also are totally ineffective against a ship they were not designed to hit too. it's not just a missile nerf lols."
"sorry was playing a diff gamemaybe not 9/10 but it was a estemate and i was taking range into perspective allso plus ogre t2 can be deatroyed by a ravens t2 drones which then gives raven a uper handedand a properly at ranged raven can beat a mega at 1v1 as on sisi i have been beaten by a raven ask my older corp mates as it was one of themand yes a mega has more high points but a raven doesnt miss any shot at range or not the mega does loose dps and may mis at diffrent range over 5kmand as for speed they reduced our align time our top speed our quickness to top speed (which wa sboosted because we gave facts not omg these guys are better than us boost me) which infact all thoughs points make it harder for the mega to get in range and towards things and we have to thin k now do i fit a mwd and have it stopped in a battle or have a ab which is even worse and web doesnt help us at alland the ecm ships are caldari's frav pvp ship so u just gave a good point and fit for a falcon/scorp and ecm r really really hard to stop since 9/10 (that was a estimate for u omg hes sayin its exact 9/10 pple) they perma jam uand we carnt see any more ecm that we do now because they are really good ships even eccm dont stop it but that will just bring more and more ships to kill you all so there u go. can i haves ur stuff now?"
"i do believe they need a boost in dps but to try and bring gallenete down with u guys saying were better in every way just enoys me and yendja can say wat she/he likes i dont really care its my point of view im stayin buy it and no1 will change it"
"maybe ur raven is wrong then because my mate who had/still does have a caldari char actually made a raven cap stable that can kill megas and im sure he cn make one with the changes and once i gain im sayin 9/10 as a ****in estamite u morons -_-"

"you're right, i'm just gonna bring my scorpion out, and have your mega for ransom!? name calling isn't nice btw."
"in 0.0 missions?and this subject not for discussion, and for reference maintenanceand, i was not rude to you......"
"the 249km range on them say on a raven without sacrificing all of your mids/lows is certainly not a 'plus' of the weapon then...you have in the cruise missile/raven a real niche weapon platform that can ewar/tank as well as snipe in a gang. just because you can no longer mercy kill a frigate from x km away it is not a nerf. battleship beams/rails/artillery simply are not wroth firing at anything smaller than a cruiser and even then, they need to be afk. (this of course without the help of a hyena/huginn/rapier/bellicose painting one)it just amuses me that because people are now given the beautiful chance to re-invent tactics and ships within eve, the first thing most do is reach for the pitchforks."

"hey man, just gimme a rof bonus, but i still say, in general missile boats are screwed, i'm still gonna ransom your ship though :-p."
"all means do ^^ and i agree and have allways through this that missiles have gotten a bit screwed from this it just ****ed me of that caldari are blaming gallenete for this :d"
"its not that i'm \"blaming\" gallente for anything, i have a gallente character, just stating for fw purposes, and the fact that amarr and minimatar have been screwed over since the game started :-pto all caldari ecm ftw!!! btw, 2mil isk to any caldari pilot that can bring me eliminator2's frozen corpse, btw, i'm in the middile of goonswarm space, univited, becareful getting to me :-p"
"true, but the issue is the fact that a cruise missile can and will hit for less than a heavy missile on an enemy battleship. this is as weird as if a thorax was hitting a dominix harder than a megathron would, assuming same skills.(edited for generally lousy typing)"

"you had a chance :devery race has been nerfed like this in at least one expansion but iv never seen any race go this dramatic over something like this :d i find it funny now and ill just laugh at most caldari pilot that doesnt have a point behind what there saying :d"
"linktake a look and see for yourself why so many people are complaining about this missile nerf.missiles were never the king of dps to begin with and now they're even more useless"
"make it into a link i cba to copy and paste :dand yes i no thre never been the high dps but they were wen it came to nanoers and missiles thats why they got nerfbatted because this expansion is about speed and that is what they consentrted on most and wen they found out missiles can pretty much hit nanoers easy as anything they had to nerf the missiles to ballance it"
"tell me the last time you used a missile boat to snipe nano'ers instead of a rokh or something similar.such hypocracy"
"do you know how long does it take for a cruise to travel 250km? sniper ravens are just an epic fail. if you aren't a noob you should know it."
"never because i carnt use caldari thank u plz come again"
"/signedwas there a demand for that or is it just fun to establish such useless changes?maybe we just have to wait for t3 items before we can use our missiles again??so eve-universe is the only place that we know from now where inventions are going backwards.it would be a good idea to fix all that crap with the corporation hangar array's where you can not put bookmarks into. fix tis stuff before you bring new problems into the game."
"if people stopped whining about things that don't really need a fix maybe ccp can consentrate more on things that do instead of having the entire team split up completly there all ready split up enough with the whole ambulation and t3 stuff just give them time and a chance its not as easy as it looks running a game like this"
"not read all the whining but as i understand it - its not speed alone that determines how well your missiles hit its the ratio between speed and your signature radiusnow i've not tested yet and i do have 6mil skillpoints in missiles so i could easily be upset - but lets not forget a torpedo raven did an obscene dps in pvp with only 6 launchers with a pretty respectable range for gate camps etcso was unbalanced every other ship had to think about relative velocity - getting into range for blaster boats etc - webbing targets - a raven just locked and fired witha target painter. yes the figures for explosion velocities are low but they are just a balancing system they dont actually reflect the real world - if was real world any ship could reach pretty much any speed ( except lightspeed of course ) jsut a question of how long you leave it with the engines burning awayperhaps ccp should rename km to some weird named thing then people would be so upset at the explosion velociuty of the missilesnow somewhere in the posts i read somewhere that a bs can speed tank a missile frigate - if that is true then yeah that has gone to far but i'm pretty sure the speed to sig radius ratio will mean any loss in damage is very small indeed to the point of effectively nothingbut since my precious vagabond was whooped with the nerf stick rather hard too this means that anyone flying any sort of missile boat cant insta kill it like i had thought was going to be the caseso yeah caldari have been hit hard by this but - think about minmatar - pretty much half guns half missiles so they got this nerf to think about then they got nano nerf please remember that anything smaller than and sometimes including bs and bc's speed tank pretty much exclusively - so now they have no speed tank to rely onnow think of the minmatar recon pilots ohhhhhhh yeah they got useless webs that couldn't slow a sleepiung tortoise down and yep they used speed tanking too =/ so minmatar ships been hit harder than caldari if you ask meand gallente been hit speed nerf/web nerf as they need to get into blaster range then hold there targets there - but now be lucky to catch up to there targets and a single web probally wont hold them there either - so gallente nerf tooammar do seem to have come out rather well since they never really relyined on speed/webs or missiles but you can bet in the next expansion or patch they will get hit by the big ol nerf stick too"
"then you would have no idea about missiles in the first place. so i guess that makes you a pretty huge liar for talking like you know everything"
"actualy ur brain seems not to big because someone doesnt use them doesnt mean they dnt no nothing about them i have seem plenty of caldari ships hunting down nanoers and killing them its not hard to do really and i suggest reading the persons post above urs for the simple fact he speaks more reason than all of us so remeber because someone doesnt use them doent mean they dont no anything about them i havent played the game for 2 years and 5 months to no nothing about missiles i have mates that use them and tell em ratio and show me what there like and explain stuff to me wen i dnt understand it"
"i guarantee my brain is larger than yours and it doesn't matter how many \"mates\" you hear about it from, if you haven't used them yourself, then you can't speak on its behalf"
"so the fact that so many caldari pilots say that gallente are so more overpwered than caldari (wich they should be because gallente are the ones that are drivin by power and weapons) and have never flown or used blasters means that they no about gallente in that case half of the posts on here are ireelevant and i forgot to mention i did use missiles at one bit but i wa bored with them and wanted to use the mega which got nerfed a few times and so what if mates told me about it i no what there like and no what they need they need abit more dmg back but not to be able to hit smaller ships than them like blaster ships can most people in here dont have any evidense or facts to show this stuff is true that they claim"
"roflmao. learn to use full stops and grammar once in a while. i never said that gallenete were overpowered and i actually can speak on behalf of the gallente because i use both caldari and gallente ships.stop trying to implicate me in things i never said, stupid."
"it wasnt actually based on just you nothing is based on just one person i was meaning it on the ones that said all that, and i no my grammer isnt that good and i appologieze for that, but still just because someone doesnt use the items doesnt mean they carnt have a say and if it was true that if you dont use the item you dont have a say this expansion would never be made because it was made for people that dont use nano and was whining about them beening to fast for them to hit yet you can hit them if you use your brain once in a whille. and i actually did and have skills for caldari so i can actually have a say in this thank you very much (forgot i trained missile skills when i was gunna use sb) o and another thing sb for gallente are hurt by the missile change but we arnt moaning even though they are used alot and as the person said minmatar got hurt the most in this expansion but they have changed and adapted. use ecm boats if you dont like missiles or do what iv done and train for a diffrent race"
"so give them a bigger sig penalty instead of a velocity penalty as well. problem solved, we're all happy, i'd still like a rof boost please, and an order of fries.gallente are all drone luvers anyways, who cares what they think."
"crikey, batman!!! it's the great wall of text!!!"
"actually not true im not a drone luver id rather use blasters over drones any day and i could say this about caldaricaldari are all missile luvers anyway, who cares what they think even though they have the best inty (crow) and have the falcon and scorp for ecm and have the rohk for rails/blasters even thought there missile race"

"ive played eve for years and now am just a light player the odd mission or two before work or on my day of, but this nerf just blew all that out of the window. well im sure what ever we say ccp will not change it or they will just nerf something else..nerf and counter nerf blah blah blah"
"thx for the fu**ing missl nerf now caldari is the biggest fu** rasse in game thx ccp you can not predict what you think makes."
"they can kill any bs now though part from domi but naa they carnt kill ur raven cause u would use ur med/liught drones on em :d"
"is it that all of you who don't use missiles think that they're finally \"fixed\" because now you are able to kill the majority of players in eve who are in fact, caldari missile users? missiles aren't fixed, they're severly ****ed. last time i'm going to say this.yes they should be redirected to do less damage to smaller targets, give them a bigger sig penalty, not a velocity penalty as well. low will be the day when any player minmatar, gallente, or amarr have ever had a problem hitting a battleship going its base speed. if your tracking is that bad, why don't you do what you're saying and adapt, train your skills up, or just leave eve? quit giving the caldari players crap because we don't like something. if you have a valid argument and facts to back them up why this \"nerf\" should stay, state them, if you're just going to patronize because your life sucks, stfu, and leave the thread.as far as ccp goes, great idea, poor math and implimentation. no, my cruise missile should not hit a frig for full damage, except maybe on a stealth bomber.. but my torpedos shouldn't hit for half damage because the enemy battleship has an afterburner!! thier tracking can compensate, they have mods to boost that, we don't. a bcs increase damage and rate of fire, doesn't do me any good if i can't break the tank on a cruiser rat with cruise missiles."
"signed! please reconsider this crap"
"oh cool my cruises got less explo velocity then my torps that makes sense.. i didnt test in pvp but i saw a angel bs speed tanking me with his mwd damage got down by 75%.. every gun would have hit them as they came up to me..why shouldnt i hit a bc with my cruises when i am doing nearly as much damage with a drake with same amount of damage mods.. what are cruises for now. theyre useless for sniping as they were before, as aspeed tank against missis work on every range.its all written a little crappy but i just want to say that they nerfed nano.. that would be cool as before you put on youre mwd and dont get damage from missiles.. now nano is nerfed but explo velocity is so low that its actually muuch easier to speed tank anything."
"signed btw"
"bump. i add my favour here. it seems that it is no longer worth flying caldari with the recent and previous nerfs. i am also in favour of a change to 'nerfing policy' see my other topic (linkage):"

"signed!!!! it's ridiculous that my cruise raven missile explosion travels 81 times slower than the missile itself. a little physics lesson is in order at ccp. target navigation prediction just became a near worthless skill. 69m/sec explosion velocity increased to around 100m/sec at level 5 is pathetic. i played around a little last night with my navy raven and a taranis. my taranis with no ab/mwd could easily permatank the raven at base speed. i agree that missiles should be much less effective against smaller targets but a cruise hitting a taranis for 3 damage while it is orbitting at base speed is way out of line. all the gunnery pilots can keep cheering that a missile nerf was a long time coming but the arguement doesn't fly when most pure pvpers still chose guns over missiles due to their effectiveness even prior to this expansion."

"ghost training nerf.and now missile nerf.man, the idea of a cruise missile not hitting a frigate now is just redonkolous, especially if the frigate is just using an afterburner. i could understand the speed nerf, and the ghost training nerf, although i'll play less now.but the missile nerf is just dumb, along with those certificates. this expansion sucks ballzz."

"stop whining rocket. my abaddon has top speed of 90 m/s. with ab i think it can go up to 200 maybe..."
"you put alot of thought into that one. it was an experiment 2008 boy! you may want to do your research before you throw around your noob tags! no web, no painter, no drones, just a base speed ship against 7 caldari navy cruise launchers. speed tanking shouldn't be an option with zero speed mods on a ship. would a gun ship be able to hit the taranis? no, not at close range but your chances increase greatly as range does and you quite possibly instapop that taranis at your optimal. i had my other main in a geddon there also and i one vollied that taranis at optimal with ease. my missiles hit the taranis the same at 200k as they did at 5k."
"vidin, your abaddon is plated and trimarked. the mega i tested had 3 plate 3 trimark, and got 260m/s. and why are you putting speed mods on an abaddon anyway lol.besides, i'm pretty much gonna butthump the guy, the only time this applies is if hes trying to run. which happens alot."

"and how many read these boards or this thread? you might have a few thousand at best read the boards and most are complaining in general descussion. alot of in game complaining. i did a level 3 in a drake( modified with 5 heavies and 2 standard assaults) and did the lvl 3 intercept the sabatuers mission. i could literally speed tank the entire mission in my drake... 30-40 ships all locked and firing on me and as long as i kept moving they did almost no damage cause my drake goes over 180m/s base even the 10-15 frigates at close range barely touched me. if this patch sticks im setting all my ships up to speed tank..... oh wait they already come standard speed tank nvm."

"yea i have to agree. missiles where already useless enough in general combat, i thought the speed nerf was supposed to be a boost to missiles. please change it back."
"i can understand allowing things to ab/mwd tank missiles, but just like an tank it should devote a few slots to that tank.a substantial amount of dmg reduction against an unfitted mega, just because he is in orbit, coming from a cruise or torp raven. no ab no mwd... thats where it has gone a bit too far. and what exactly are rage torps for again? ah yes the shooting of freighters and capital ships ffs.so are shield tankers now supposed to give up another slot for a target painter ontop of the: mwd/ab, warp disrupt, web... maybe for a bs you can pull this off, but smaller shield tankers trying to hit the same class sized ship, that dont have as many midslots. and lol stealth bombers with cruise missiles... yeah find a new profession i guess.yeah we will adapt yada yada yada but this was a bit too far off the top. i do agree bs sized weapons shouldnt be hitting frigs for what they were doing... that part needed to be fixed"
"to start off, i haven't used missiles in forever. i run around in a harbinger and a friend in a drake. before qr was released, the drake's damage output with heavy missiles was slightly higher than mine. we could both 1-shot non-elite frigs, and at normal ranges (20km) there was only a 1-2 sec difference in kill times for everything else. the main exception was elite frigs, which i just plain couldn't touch (sorry, my drone skills are crap, and i have other skills i need first). it was handy having a drake that, when i webbed and painted the frig, could kill them in a time far more reasonable than 15 flipping minutes.and then came quantum rise.my goodness, what a nightmare. i followed all the changes, and i suppose i should have actively tested them as well. fact is, the only ones that come out of this cleanly are the veteran characters. webs took a huge nerf... there goes killing frigs at anything but sniping range. missiles and medium drones took a huge nerf... there goes killing elite frigates before june 2008. webs took a nerf... there goes killing normal frigs in anything less than five minutes! so, to do anything in this game now, i need... what do i need? i need a hulk. ah, i see what you did here ccp. industry buff indeed! combat is totally broken for all but the turret snipers now, so might as well sell it all and mine! wonderful. ccp... nerfing combat since beta. congratulations!roll it back."
"/signed10 hours to delete all the characters on 2 of my accounts. goodbye 4-year old characters! no, you dorks can't have my stuff - i've already given it away to deserving individuals. i guess i should have actively been testing this, but honestly i don't believe in pay-to-beta-test and i'm already involved in other beta tests as it stands and worked the past 3-4 years as a software quality assurance technician, so i really don't feel like *paying* to provide my services in that area. ccp, this is epic fail. this is not how you fix problems, this is how you increase them. i thought that nobody could out-statesman jack emmert of cryptic studios when he instituted the global defense nerf (gdn) and enhancement diversification, but i guess there's always a second time. those two nerfs lost, by jack's own admission in gamasutra, over 6000 players within the first week, yet he never had the balls to rollback the patches to their previous stages and admit his screw up.ccp, i hope you're smarter. i hope that you realize this is a dumb way of going about to fix god knows what that required such changes for those who are going to stick around for the ride. unfortunately, i'm not one of them."
"/signed with both hands upthis \"improvement\" in the gameplay sucks big time there was something explained that the missiles were too good against small targets. well i may kinda agrree to that but the \"fix\" was to intoduce a base explosion velocity of the cruise missiles for instance of 69m/s ????!!!!???? helloooo ....every f...ing batttleship in this game beats that speed even without ab. we aint talking just saving frigs from the big bad caldari missile boats. we are talking of nerfing the total missile gameplay. i had trained missiles for nearly 2 years and now this comes... i am mad as hell and seriously thinking of quiting the game. this was the last straw. if ccp are ok of me canceling 3 accounts then i have nothing more to ad."

"/signedof course, there is certainly some ways to adapt of this critical nerf, but this don't consider that it was already difficult to equilibrate a caldari ship with the lack of medium slots, now it is worse as target painter and stasis become nearly mandatory.and we speak about a <U+FFFD> 90% efficiency nerf, who is really difficult to correct, in both pvp/pve.the idea of the change himself is probably good.doing it by nerfing so much all missiles instead of a more reasonable number, is a proof of stupidity.i don't hope, ccp will not correct a few this change, they proved many time that they are a studborn company."
"caldari is a shield tank designed race.. and you have to put a warp dist, web, ab or mwd on your med slots to have a proper pvp ( just like the other classes do without dropping any tank ) .. erm i m abit confused now, if we spend another med slot for painter, how we will tank (just incase someone decide to shoot..) seriously is this a kind of joke ? or really someone came up with that genious idea to punish ppl for training missile/caldari skills for years.. i dont have any intention for blowing inty's or frigs with torps or 1 vollying cruiser size's but atleast i want to make a max dmg to a bs while i m in a bs who cant actually fit a mwd/ab, point, web, painter atsame time, while other races go 2x times faster, web and point me without loosing anytank ... that realy isnt fair atall! please next time dont fix something not broken..edit : i ve already setted a long skill maybe it s time for a break ..."
"/signeda single mwd/ab (without any other speed mods) is for mobility/range control, not for tank. giving huge missile damage reduction is like having warp disruptors give you the passive shield tank of a drake. to fix it, we need one of two things:1) set explosion velocity equal to the speed of an abing target of the appropriate size class. no nanos/overdrives/etc, no damage reduction, period. a mwd alone will give zero reduction, as the sig increase to velocity increase ratio is 1:1.or2) increase missile base damage. if you're going to give them all the \"tracking\" problems of guns, especially against same-size targets, they also need the maximum potential damage of guns."

"for the benefit of ccp in reviewing the csm request, i strongly support the request stated by jade constantine in the original posts (as do my alts! 8) ). second-hand stories about the live events are what got me to subscribe in the first place.rewards could be provided easily through the new medals system rather than giving in-game items. the major benefit of event participation should be the involvement, not profits.in cases where ccp really doesn't want us to act directly (i.e. the coronation), strong-arm us by preventing us from flying with armed ships (e.g. prevent all ships equipped with high or medium slot items from undocking in or stargating into amarr for 24 hours) and/or do the events behind crazy-powerful station shields. while being able to interact with the event would be more interesting, bringing the eve universe to life by making news events real is more important to me overall."
"/signed also would like the removal of the qr patch all together, ccp has lost the plot and losing me as a customer. only thing i would keep is the new ship, but would give that up in a second to get speed back into the game. this patch is a really bad joke, that is not funny."

"ya'llwe have been reeding about the new eve-64 and its so wonderfull and all. ive noticed thats its better even in places like jita. but what i want is a client-64. mock me if i'm totaly out of line. most of the gaming-puters that one buy today is often with a 64-bit processor. and since we want, atleast i, even the client to go smoother. much smoother than it does today. i dont know where to put a discussion out better in this forum. so the issue is: are ccp working on a 64-client? even with a client wich spreads the threads over multiple cpu's, if it has it?-------issue iisince the day i begun with eve-online. i've had problems with memory-leaks wich makes it difficult to use a client more than 4-6 hours before one starts to notice effect. do we get the same amounts of leaks in the client as ccp solve by each patch? or does the problem dont have high prio? i want a game wich holds the whole op! not until i die due to the clients internal glue'ish due to mem-leakif those two issue's are not in the right part of the forum plz move it. /j"
"a 64-bit client would only allow you to address more than 4gb memory for your client. i doubt you have a single instance that takes up that much.as for memory leaks. how do you actually know it's a memory leak?"
"from the first time i played eve, the client have been a bottleneck. the client have been slow. i have taken up most of the puters strength. i use a asus maximus motherboard 4gb ram 3.2ghz hyperthread cpu :(. 8600 silent. and its still slow. i never been around seing the cpu go under 95% while one client is running. there must be issues!the client builds up memory all the time even if i sit in station spinning my ship as slow as possible. i ursually starts at around 215mb and when its goes up to 600mb its turns out to be horrible. what else can it be?"
"eve caches all kinds of in-game info in memory and on the hard drive. the bigger the cache setting in the client the smoother it operates. if you have 4 gb of ram, then by all means crank the cache size up to maximum.64 bit processing is overrated. the main use is like the other fellow said, addressing more than 4gb of ram. aside from that being able to do 64-bit math helps some, but 32^2 is already a very huge value. most variables in even the most complex pc games are still less than 32 bits in size.however, i would love to see multi-threading come to eve."
"64 bit clients are a waste of time at this stage in the gaming world.reasoning that your dealing with a piece of crap operating system known only as the infamous and notorious windows.to use windows xp 64 or the 64 bit vista is always unstable at best and full of problems.because it is not a true 64 bit environment.the majority of the software.... drivers....are all derived from the 32 bit world.the only platforms on the market that are solidly there... is of course... linux... and most recently... the apple (mac) computer. even they don't widely use 64 bit software.but most eve pilots are windows based... and whats funny is i experience literally none of the above mentioned or frequent problems.... other than what you would get for being in the middle of nowhere on the coast....because i run windows xp pro 32 bit... 2gb's of ram... a big assed vid card (which added to the power bill... ouch) and i keep my system free of infections.i've only had 1 bsod in the last 3 years i've had my system (aside from my usual tendency to push my system too hard so basically this was a totally random occurrence... which happened to be eve).i don't tolerate crashes... and for the last couple of months eve crashed on exit... which didn't bother me as i was... uh... exiting?it's gone now.... qr fixed that....so with all due respect... save your 64 bit requests for the day when microshaft gets there act together... if ever.you should be more concerned with security.... anti-vrius... anti-malware... anti-spyware... your internet connect... and your systems \"load balance\" and efficiency.your memory leak could be traced back to a number of possibility.if your running winxp64... downgrade to winxp 32 bit professional.if your running vista.... welcome to the new windows .no i don't have a solution for that.the 64bit world is still at best... a pipe dream... and reserved for server platforms until such time the consumer world catches up.and i'm quite sure thats what ccp meant by the eve64 thing."

"something that some seem to overlook:isk cannot be sold for real money without breaking the eula rules, but real money can be used to buy isk without doing so through selling gametime codes.since real money can be converted into isk, isk have a very real value.eventually it is very much possible that people with a gambling problem might end up buying gtcs to fuel their gambling addiction. those two things in combination might become a legal problem.it saddens me to see that things like this actually have the potential to become problems."
"this is actually a bigger risk then people think.gambling laws are highly localized and sometimes very sticky. for instance within the uk there is a board that decides based off unwritten criteria if a game counts or not (or if you are trading something worth something, it doesn't have to be money)...in many us states, having cards in the game environment (regardless of money being involved at all) is enough to get the gambling boards involved if they want to. and new jeresy is just insane with it's laws if the board even thinks a game might effect gambling (since the state brings in huge amounts of revenue from gambling and the industry is pretty in-bed with the local government)note - i say this having worked for a company that produces an on-line non-gambling game. while it is rarely a problem, if some da looking to make a name for themselves or someone locally takes offense.. it can be a headache. we actually had to alter (or disable) our product for differnt regions because of it."
"gambling fake money is bad....but allowing people to inject their characters with performance enhancing drugs is good?you sir, have an odd way of thinking.if it wasn't rated r before, it won't be now unless someone has a stick up their ass when they rate the game.and above all else, eve will always be available for online download. so even if a store doesn't carry it because of a local rating, you can still get it hassle free online."
"interesting factoid, but .. so what?are those local markets/countries actually able to do anything about it? and even if they can, is eve really such a big game that they will bother?"
"never said the laws made sense. i think the idea though is the gambling laws in question don't care if money is actually trading hands, it is how the game is played.for instance, the old uk swp 'grey market', games were legal or illegal based off how much randomness they have in them (i.e. the player must always be able to get the maxium score). canada works in a similiar way. utah all they care about is if it has cards in it,.. and nj who knows.as a consumer correct, but as a company ccp can get a lot of headaches if some local laws start giving them trouble. you often have to fly to the local jurisdiction to defend yourself (at your expense) or forfit the hearing, and us states have done quite a bit over the last few years for extending their community laws to other countires, esp when it comes to gambling (for instance, arresting members of the company if they travel to the us, feezing assets, forcing cc companies to no longer deliver payment, etc)while unlikely, it is a legal concern ccp is going to have to look into if they implement virtual gambling as part of eve."
"example: : state of kentucky seizes control of 141 domain nameskentucky's gambling board felt that these were sufficiently gambly sites that, since they were accessible to it's citizens fell under their authority so they seased them, even though many were owned and hosted in other countries."

"new player content now is far more impressive than it was a few years ago, and you also have the advantage of a tutorial that actually tutors.as for waiting a month or two to gain the required combat skills, you only really need to be able to use webber and warp scrambler to be an asset to a corporation in pvp and you can generally use them within a day or two of starting."

"if you can find me the provision in american law for isk selling being illegal, i'll buy your argument. any other legal system is good too, for that matter. there's only a couple countries in the world where it actually would be illegal, because of anti-online-gambling laws written far too harshly(e.g., greece, a few years ago), but in the vast majority of countries you can do just about anything you want inside a virtual world without even being a de jure criminal, never mind the extraordinarily unlikely possibility of becoming a de facto criminal."

"support my issue!"
"whoa whoa whoaslow down...1 step at a time.first introduce the idea of walking around your own ship."
"heh, yeah, but is this something a capsuleer wants to do? or even can?.from the chronicles that i have read where the pilot moves between his ship, he only seems to leave the pod once it's out the ship, and get back in it before it's placed back in the ship. so, there isn't really any need for a capsuleer to walk around his ship, that's what crew are for, where necessary.i am on the fence about this proposal, i might change my mind later.ab"
"its a good idea but think about ityour in space in low sec and it goes inside your ship next miniut ur zoomed out and all you see is a pod"
"does this guy even read or bother to do his research?"
"so wouldn't this mean perma-death (or at least revert sp to last clone) if the ship was destroyed?also.. i'm just not getting the point."
"the only feasible way to do this is to use ambulation.... and have a tour of the ships as you browse the shipyards/market or something.but when your in space.. your in your pod (duh).there is no cockpit... unless you find the ickygood surrounding your body to be appetizing."
"with the back-story stating that we sit in our ships in goo, inside a capsule with direct neural connections to the controls, then getting out of the goo would also mean losing control of ship.it would be a nice thing to do when it was docked, however at fanfest, ccp saw even walking up to ships as an unimportant feature, as they figured people would walk and look at it once, then probably not do so again. hence the priority could be better spent on other features.all that said, i think it would be nice, but a nice-to-have none the less."
"pod piloted ships don't have crews, as previously mentioned, so the ability to walk around inside your ship would basically amount to ccp modeling the interiors of uninhabited ships, some of which are simply massive, so you can wander around with no real point to it. waste of resources, at least ambulation has a social aspect."
"uh... yeah they do... at least the larger one's do.at least there's a large number of implied indications of such things.but that's not the point.... the point is you as the pilot so to speak are in a pod and cannot walk around your own ship.... unless your not in your pod...in which case your docked...so to speak.as far as the crew bit.... who do you think fixes the gapping holes in your armor and damage to structure when in mid flight?to you its a module... but you may have a crew on board...and if your structure fails... you lose control of your ship so to speak... makes sense to me at least.^_^ role play or not.... you can't honestly tell me that those big massive titans have no crew."
"i figured repair modules were simply some sort of automated repair system. you have unmanned drones you can order around, automated repair systems don't seem so far fetched. thought it was implied that the ship be dock first. you wouldn't walk around in a ship you're supposed to be controlling via the pod for the same reason you as a player don't afk while your ship is out in space."

"currently, the only way to set weapon groups is while you are in space with your guns unloaded. this means that we can't launch a new ship with guns loaded if we want to group guns. so if we are in a new ship and know we are undocking into a fight, we either go without weapon grouping, or we have to launch with our guns empty.this doesn't seem a good idea. so i would like us to be able to set weapon groups while docked."

"group all would also be an appreciated feature."

"hii think there should be introduced a new set of learning skills which you will get by hiring \"special officers\" to whom you will pay a one time fee. the \"special officers\" can get lost by your ship (not pod) getting blown up."
"support my issue!"
"i don't know what you try to say. but i support faster learning."
"what i mean is that so far we have basic learning skills which gives you +5 in all attributes, (charisma, memory and so on) we have advanced learning skills which gives +5 in all attributes and we have cybernetics skill which allows us to buy implants so we have +5 in all attributes. i think that there should be one more way to get +5 in all your atrributes by being able to hire \"officers\" for example a trainee diplomat could give +1 in charisma a head diplomat could give + 5 charisma and so on. these officers would die if your ship blows up."
"so its a carebear feature because i dont think anyone that pvp would buy these just to see you loose em by ship death but then again you could cheat the system by buying a frig and jumping in that in station to learn faster and never loose them xploit detected :d"
"waste of time and not worth the trouble.for one everyone here likely has more than one shipand even then.... it would be messy at best./me thumbs down"
"did i miss something? there's only 2 sets in game now. where did you get 4th?and no, before anyone says it, implants don't qualify as the third as they are not a learning skill."
"might have accidentally counted certificates."
"wouldn't this further skew the game towards either;- veteran players, as they are most likely to be able to afford the extra attribute boosters? - empire mission runners, as they are least likely to die?"
"i wouldn't go that far....the damage is training up skills at a too high a pace.doesn't stop you from stupidly fitting your ship and getting killed.: o )"
"so 90% is better than 99% now?"
"no, but if you read my post you'll note that i never claimed it was."
"a spider drone slapped by a paladin with a t2 web will... be essentially unaffected.from 500m-1km/s down to 50-100m/s inside megapulse tracking threshhold. pretty much unhittable with the main guns, whereas prior to this nerfspansion they could be stopped dead in their tracks.bs, prior to the patch, would coast through a 99% web pretty well unaffected simply due to mass. now they completely ignore webs entirely.now, everyone knows that if you web an orbiting frigate your drones will not be able to track it (game bug from waaaaaaay back) nearly as well, but if you don't web it they won't be able to catch up.the paladin needs to have it's web bonus increased to return the 99% web bonus.now, think about someone using faction webs? the domination, for example, was reduced to 50%. with marauders 5 they'll only have the effect of a meta-2 web prior to the patch (i.e. 75% max velocity damp). doing that at 15km is as pointless as 10km."

"web bonus is so much more usefull then painter bonus, i could set 5 painters on the same frig and still not be able to kill the damn thing (due to the rediculess speed dmg decrease) while 2 webs will make you instant pop any frig and webs are your medslots, that means support slots for you while painters are med but means it takes up the tanking slots.so all in all the golem is much more useless, lower dps, gotta offer tank, and much worse at hitting anything then the turret users.while i totally agree with you that all the marauders seriously would have a giant buff for the pve purpose, i don't agree that the golem is better, actually much worse now.i mean when t1 bs's t2 fitted, can do the missions better and faster then the marauders there is a problem, which should be corrected :/"
"a spider drone also does zero damage to you, meaning that your own drones should have enough time to kill it before to destroys you."
"omg get some skill.i kill frigs in my redemer with mega beams without using a web.wtf do you need a web to kill frigs.fit a bomb.if your worried about concordski in high sec or there just out of range use drones.if all your drones are dead ( duh ) put the little feckers on approach hit ab and blow them away with your mains.or if you wanna do it properly dont let them get to orbit range in the first place.lock them first > open fire. frigs go pop , pop , pop , pop so fast you cant press the buttons fast enough.marauders may be pve orientated ships , but that does not exclude them from pvp and the days of 99% webs are over.90% is still awesome compared with what other ships can do."
"titans need to be changed, somehow, doomsday devices seem to be somewhat not working properly in any case (gameplay wise, not technically). after a little chat at fanfest with jade, he mentioned changing them into death rays, rather than smartbombs, as in, target a ship and kill it. this would however be quite harsh though.a little more thinking led me to the idea of changing it to an actual death ray. the titan targets a ship, and shoots the ray at it. the trick however, is that it also damage all ships along the path of that beam, instead of just the targeted ship. the weapon still retains it's \"grid\" range.the damage would be enough to threaten capital ships, but probably not enough to kill them outright. the point to this though, is that it forces fleets to spread out, rather than hump together, as it would mean massive damage to their blob - much more than a current doomsday, in any case. if they spread out, they would limit the damage greatly, whilst still keeping the ray very effective in terms of the damage it does.as the fleet has to spread out, this means that range will be affected, and fleets will have to split fire because the outer ships might not be in range anymore.spreading out takes space, and the larger the blob, the more damage the death ray does to it, obviously, as spreading out takes time and space, but usually starts in the same space for whatever the fleet size is (jumping into a cyno, for example). effectively, this means that larger blobs remain effective, but have to cope with more losses and have to split fire much sooner.on the other end, since subcaps are so small compared to caps, this makes them much less vulnerable to death rays as there's less chance for them to get hit, multiple titans or not.in short, changing doomsday devices from huge smartbombs into death rays will:- force fleets to assume rudimentary formations,- make blobs slightly more vulnerable the larger they get,- make blobs slightly less effective the larger they get,- make small ships much more useful in cap fleets.imho, a change worth looking into, or at least discussing?"

"still, she makes the effort to dig into things, as opposed to just sitting back in a chair and commenting. she's explored other corporations, ran through ops, sat down with people evening after evening, it is a generalistic perspective yes, but she makes sure she goes where she has to.it's a choice between someone who knows everything about a little bit, or a little bit about everything, combined with the will to listen and learn and experience :-)there are csm candidates out there who are further in terms of exposure and to a degree experience, but the ability to step into the shoes of others counts for a lot. as does a sound communicative and administrative skillset.everybody has a learning curve in eve, heck, many learning curves over time :-) what matters is the ability to grow, listen, communicate and combine. from where i stand she is one of the top three candidates exactly for these abilities, she'll make an even better csm member in a next term. she does not fit in one box indeed, instead she's capable of seeing more then one box. most people never get out of their box in their entire life :p"

"well i already cast my vote, but i recently had an interaction with scagga laebetrovo i felt i should share.he contacted me, rather out of the blue, to get my input on some of the pvp changes in this thread here. i gave him my thoughts and among other things we had a very interesting and lengthy conversation about how to properly balance cloaking to disadvantage cloaking abuse by non-stealth ships while still making logistics for deep strike small gang warfare units viable (a role which my corp has done alot of recently and would like to keep doing).what that conversation showed me is that scagga will proactivly seek out policy input and feedback from players experienced in the nuts and bolts of the day to day aspects of that portion of the game. while i am still happy with who i voted for, i really wish we could vote for more than one candidate. he's not the only csm candidate i'd go so far as to support, but he's the only one who has sought it out and his thought process/approach to decision making has convinced me to give it fully.gl m8, i hope you're in the mix!"

"when i checked the csm candidates i had two reasons in mind that said i shouldn't vote for you. why? i haven't seen a web page, which would be a valuable communication tool. it would be good to tell us more about our ideas, give us a contact address, and if it would come with a forum it would be good to tell you about our ideas. how can we expect serious \"work\" from someone who doesn't start right now? the secound against reason was when i seen a name of a \"feared by many\" alliance from 0.0 space.mostly because any big alliance has permanent advantage compared to new players and when anyone comes out from 0.0 and makes things harder for new players, who don't have a chance, can make the game worse. right now most of the new players leave after 7 months, mostly because \"entrenched interests\" make sure they can't compete with others and they see the differences are permanent, and they have very limited amount of motivation in pve, since it isn't interesting and motivating enough.if we want to see eve online as a strong game in the future, it should be able to keep new players interested. and the problem with entrenched interests are in sp total, alliance size, bpos, poses, experience, etc.as long as in low sec your new player won't have a chance against most residents, why would you try to move to that place? you would lose too often and risk vs reward says keep out.and with every month we see bigger and bigger gap between new and old players and more and the newbies and carebears will have more and more reasons to leave. they won't move to low sec, but they move to a different game.to me, it is clear: lowsec is ruined already. several careers in eve are ruined already. without a change there, the game is dead. no point in discussing protecting carebears from goonswarm or making risk more visible to carebears with a stronger goonswarm, since without a change there the game is dead.so i hope to see your home page soon.and there is a question about skills and entrenched interests: how would you reduce it? would you change learning skills?"
"first time voter here and i must say you have my vote! it's a shame your all the way at the bottom for candidates. i almost didn't go through the entire list.something i would like to see in eve is a single player owned starbase/sructure. i'd be interested in having the ability to setup my own private pos for moon mining while still belonging to a corp. currently i'm using my alt in a 1-man corp to moon-mine and fund my main characters pvp. it'd be alot simplier if i could do everything on one character."
"so to clarify our current \"goon' standings. tada o, the executor corp for the honda accord was briefly a member of the goons. my comment about the intentions of the goons is a result of some of the communications i saw while that was the case. we left the goons after it was clear that they were a little too \"crude\" in some of their internal communications than seemed to fit the majority of our group.we left on good terms. i even made a brief attempt to get bruce (while tada o was in bruce) to work out a nap with them when we first moved to syndicate. some time later after we left bruce when we moved to molden heath we were seeing them regularly in the space were were active in. i contacted them to get us set \"blue\". we were told by the goons they would. for a while they honored that araingement. some time after that several of our members were attacked by the goons and we set them 'red\" to be on the safe side.so we consider the goons \"red\" to us.hope that clears up any confusion.issler"
"deception or not you're one of the candidates i was reading up on. seems to fit my bill."
"i used to be in bob and fought goons for 2 years if that counts for anything..."
"well, i am not a big fan of getting 0.0 alliance politics into the csm. the csm should concentrate on the overall health of the eve universe, and not on the well-being of any political powerblocks. i think the csm candidates are supposed to represent specific game styles, not political factions. like ankh was representing the carebears, and later the faction warfare guys, lavista stood out for the lowsec, darius represented the interests of bigass 0.0 alliances and i tried to stand for the small 0.0 corps (when i had the chance). goons have said and done kind of nasty things to eve which i did not like. however, the csm candidates are real persons, who should not be generalized in any way. darius, for example, has said kind a lot things that made me worry a little bit, however after meeting him in person i think that he is an extremely funny guy who knows what he wants, and a lot of his interests are the same as mine. his opinion on sovenerity in 0.0, for example, were kind of bright. he thinks in \"large\", has a perspective on the game that also made me think a lot and think on a larger scale. so, i do not think that it would be a good idea to discredit any candidates just because he was a goon.of course, it would be a huge risk for the csm if goons had the majority in the council. if i am wrong and they are actually the kind of \"evil people\" half of the community believes, they could actually impose a great danger on csm, probably get it to fail completely, and i do not wanna see that, so in my opinion no in-game faction should gain absolute majority in any csm... and right now the only faction that has the chance doing that are the goons. but with 7 candidates... i do not see a chance of them doing that. do not take me wrong: i do not like goons in general. however i think that they should not be discrimated as candidates as long as it is not proven that they were planning the \"destroy eve\" kind of stuff. and a final comment: yes, hun reloaded is member of the gbc."
"i think this point has been voiced, even among the candidates.but all in all it comes down to one question\"will the goon candidates if elected, think of themselves, or for the people of eve?\"this is a heavy question, it is hard to think in a play style, and then suddenly come into an advisory role. but in the end, only time and opportunity will tell. i think any corp or alliance who wants to go for csm, then i think at least it would be in their best interests to adopt a \"good governance\" mentality. politics in the real world is a case of charm, chrisma, and in the end likability. people are afraid of the goon \"agenda\". when that statement about \"us vs them\" was made. regardless of the true meaning behind it. statements like this will be taken out of context. you have to watch what you say. when a faction within, whether official or not, does things like terrorist attacks in empire space against players because of \"ideological\" differences. regardless of your meaning behind this, you loose credibility. because negative ideas get associated with you. so as such, you have the suspicious voters. also the jihadswarm attacking of miners lost you a lot of points from the industrial sector.if you act like an ogre with a battle axe people are going to be afraid of you.because your a big alliance that already makes people worry, and that's when your being friendly! i know that's unfair and in many ways yes it is. but that's what people believe. compound that with the actions of jihadswarm and such groups like this with in goons, damage your reputation even more. if you work on the direction that goonswarm ultimately wants to go, and try to repair this reputation. try to put friendly and good nature into goons, then i think you will be able to come back. i believe even goons can be redeemed. this combined with making sure your message is that you really are as a candidate wanting to improve eve.then i am willing to give you a chance. a fair try. but also know that if you try to set up something or otherwise screw the eve community, i honestly don't think your rep would ever be able to recover.if you here for good, then i wish you luck, if your here for a scam or screw job. may god have mercy on you, because the eve community won't.in the end and in due time, the truth will come out, whatever that truth is.-kaiden"

"pos1. should a player be able to launch pos for self, or after launching assign tower/modules to specific players?answer: yes, but i would want to discuss whether people in npc corps could do so to avoid 'undeccable' high sec pos.2. should players be able to use their own hangar when manufacturing and researching at a pos?answer: a good question, but not one i want to answer without reading arguments for and against.3. should new industry be made (fuel rods) to make pos refuel easier?answer: i support this concept. don't make things more difficult than they should be.standings4. should it be easier to share standings?answer: yes. perhaps also consider reworking the ui in the standings department, it's quite fiddly.5. should it be possible for a corporation to chose to apply alliance standings, so docking/pos use alliance standing.answer: technically yes, but i had ideas to streamline such processes with the evolution of treaties.6. should standing list be expanded?answer: ideally, i would prefer there to be an unachievable limit of standings you can set. i would support expanding the list as far as is reasonable.7. should alliances be able to set standings to players and vice versa?answer: yes, i don't see why not.universe:8. should all of 0.0 be conquerable?answer: no, i think excluding npc regions gives useful variety.9. should the universe be expanded?answer: it is inevitably going to be, but expanded further than what is currently planned? i'd only agree if someone can prove that the universe really is overcrowed. pvp:10. should rokh powergrid be boosted?answer: that's quite a specific question. as i'm not a rokh expert, could you tell me why ask?11. should missiles be more useful in fleet fights?answer: missiles have their role in fleet fights, and i think that the recent patch effectively has made many changes to them, so let's see how the changes result then return to this question.industry:12. should ccp boost hulk cargo capacity by 2000 m3?answer: i haven't recently read any arguments for or against to be able to give an informed answer. as far as i know the hulk, with expanded cargoholds and rigs can be left to run alone for up to 2-3 cycles. if there are arguments for it, could you link me to them?13. should t2 bpo me be nerfed to 0, and invented bpc gain positive material level?answer: argument of the year. this contentious issue is not black or white, so a yes/no answer is not one i'd give here. i've given this issue thought in the past and thing that the only conclusion i'd agree with is one reached after thorough evaluation.14. should hi sec asteroid belts be boosted?answer: no. the gradient between high sec and low sec 'value' needs to be increased, not decreased. 15. should a pos be able to refine alloys/ore at 100%?answer: not to 100%, but being able to refine them should be possible16. should it be possible for alliance member to use another corporations copying and inventing labs?answer: yes. make this a service to sell.more pos17. should it be possible to charge a fee when players are using jump bridges?answer: yes. makes sense to me - however i wouldn't want a pop-up invoice to appear every time you tried to use them. imagine how that would fan out if large numbers tried to use the same jumpbridge simultaneously.18. should a pos ai get boosted?answer: yes, but the way i'd like it done is that players be given more ability to 'tweak it' e.g. priority to certain ship classes, etc.factional warfare:19. should fw start actually having any impact?answer: yes, see my thread20. should corporations in alliances be able to participate in fw?answer: yes - but with preconditions - to be discussed."

"interesting answers, let me pick up on a few posted (i have listed them above):1. small anchorables have been kicked about for sometime. you represented the issue to csm, and the csm asked ccp- who stated that they already were being looked at and developed...9. why does the universe need expanding? empire has many systems that are underpopulated (or empty apart from pilots passing through). low sec is essentially a wasteland in many regions. 0.0 space has large areas that are rarely flown through, due to bypass highways via jump bridges etc. i fail to see why it needs expanding more at all...larger space means less conflict. 11. so you aren't good discussing specifics of pvp/fleet battles etc? missles and fleet battles are seperate than missle changes, speed nerf effects on missles etc.14. high sec belts boosted? to what end? you are in favour of making it more viable to mine higher end minerals in empire, meaning pilots can make more isk for few risks? this in turn impacts on the economy and spreads out from there...17: being able to charge a fee for using jump bridge is unimportant, but being able to award medals is important? interesting....19/20: what you meant to say is that the csm has raised this with ccp already...take care,arithron"

"ran a few missions yesterday with my arbelist raven and tbh i can't see much of a difference and no real problem. if they hadn't been nerfed they would have been very overpowered though so i think ccp did ok here. for reference i'm equally trianed in minmatar/caldari and mostly use missiles and drones. tested against cruisers, bc and bs (all npc's) and seemed to do fine. also this was using the exact same raven setup i had before patch, no painters or webs and only shield rigs on it"

"to all other races who think this is fair, seriously, do your math, and come up with a plausable arguement other than \"haha you guys suck worse.\"if you're gonna complaing about tracking, consider rof, if you're gonna complain about damage, consider ammo amounts, if you wanna complain then give us some cold hard facts, with math equations and numbers. more caldari pilots have posted math supporting the fact that missiles completely suck, than any of you have even tried to give reason against."
"while i feel that the qr patch is pretty good in most respects, the nerf to missiles is a bit over the top. i understand the intent of avoiding missile pawnage due to slower speeds, but the reductions that are in place now are woefully lower than necessary.my suggestion would be... if you halved the explosion velocity of each missile from the pre quantum rise patch you would have had a good balance. heavies were 750m/s, reducing that to 350m/s say would have been fine. an ab cruiser can easily push 500m/s and then reduce damage from missiles. while a frig would have a greater reduction of damage both from sig radius and there base speeds close to the explosion velocity already. but bringing it down to the current 81 m/s is really unexplainable. same with cruises. pre patch it was 300m/s, 150m/s would have done nicely, and easily would have tied in with the reduction in bs base velocity. but 69 m/s is hulk speed. a hulk with an ab could speed tank a cruise missile while rails and artillery would shoot it like it was standing still. i don't think missiles should be brought back to there original values, i understand the intent, but i do disagree with the current values. they are simply too low. so..... <signed>"
"moved to assembly hall."
"whilst i support this move, i do think it's gone too far. you only need a minimal speed boost (which a single overdrive injector can provide) in order to tank missiles; even if you are heading straight towards them.i applaud ccp for trying to bring missiles in-line with guns, but this is a nerf too far."

"supported. both this and other \"features\" brought about in qr have made me question, for the first time, if this game has its hooks in yet. i guess not, because as much as i enjoy (pre qr) it, these changes make me unhappy enough to consider it a bad investment, and act accordingly, before i get to that \"i've got too much invested in this to quit\" syndrome. one interesting point? after 5 years of eq, and what sony did to it, i had that kind of investment, and i left to come here, which softened the blow alot. it's not so hard, this time around. so, i unsubbed, although both my accounts are paid until feb 09, and i'll play when/if it becomes enjoyable before then.so...........u kant haz my stuffs, just yet. edit: forgot to hit the thumbs up thingie after previewing."
"this is the main points of argument for people for and against the new missile nerf - people for the nerf:\"missiles were far too overpowered. they would be too effective against targets smaller than what cruise missiles are supposed to hit\"answer to this:my guess is that 99% of people who say this are just plain happy because they used turrets to begin with. it's their way of throwing their anger around at the nano nerf and saying \"hahahahaha. in your face!!\" at someone. anyone. impotent rage at people who are actually making valid pointspeople for the nerf:\"adapt or die\"answer to this:those are some great words of wisdom coming from a 2003/2004 char who has every race trained anyway so they can smack-talk all they want and seem like they know everything. remind us again how long it took for you to train up large hybrids to t2? and say that to the players who only just started playing. you think you know the answer to everything. every game needs some sort of system that let's you make some easy money in the beginning. missiles were just that.apart from the above points that i have stated, it's all about the rage from people who hated missiles in the first place and are letting off steam to make themself feel good.p.s. reported eliminator2 for trolling on a forum and encouraging verbal fights to break out."
"this"
"this man speaks the truth.i honestly have a hard time seeing how missiles pre-qr could be argued as being overpowered. conventional pvp wisdom seems to state pretty clearly that missiles, with the exception of a select few t2 ships, are not the way to go. one could argue that their lackings in pvp are balanced by their excellence in pve, but even in pve there are better t1 options than the drake / raven line.i can only conclude that missiles before qr were at best balanced and at worst underpowered, and that any changes made in qr should be made solely to preserve the previous balance."

(every pvpeur should/use faction)btw, with t1 missile you dont get the speed malus on your ship, and you'r missile flight 2 times longer than t2that's only an example. now torps.few months ago, we got a explosion velocity nerf, a little boost to rof, and a massive range nerf (-400%)after this patch, to make full damage on a bs, we were forced to put a painter, and to hit target put a ab/mwd a little reminder :caldari tank shield = we use med slot for that, there ships aren't design to tank armor (not enought low slot)\"ewar\" module (painter, web, ab/mwd) fit only on med slotok, some a us deal with hit, damage with torp was still good enough, but you'r forced to lower you'r tank by removing one or two tank module (sb ampli, hard., lse,...)know we got explosion velocity nerf.t1 torp and cruise missile got 'exactly' the same explosion velocity; something likes 100m/s with skill lvl 4that's mean we are now 'forced' to put a web and remove again a tank module if we wanna a 'full' dps..... hey ab/mwd + web/painter... what the hell, only 4 slot to tank with a raven ?! and something about speednerf too (thats in direct relation with missile nerf)ok now we got slower bs.ok ab got boosted (only low meta level, t2 ab are exacly the same than before), but with the basic speed of my bs, i loose -20/-30% speed (and now, no more speed gang bonus = -30/-40% less speed in gang)but, why thoose stupids npc wont get nerfedthere bs (angel) still go 170m/s !!! (remember the nicely new explosion velocity of cruise/torp of 100m/s)it took me 10min, but i found what i want in my game log : on shield angel saint (bs sized npc, going 170m/s), my torp (3 damage mod) makes pre patch :386.6 damage (there is no mistake, damage on hull is something like 690)post patch :225 damagethats a lovely ~35-40% nerfobviously, you'll have the same result with cruise missile (same explo velocity than torp)btw, full damage are still not reached when you shoot at a cap ship going full speed (ok ok, a cap ship under fire is web 95% of time...) the funiest thing is heavy missile who are not able to make full dps on a bs (a ship who's 2 classes bigger than a cruiser)and i won't talk about the chapter where ship speed tank your cruise/torp with a little ab finally, i'm agree with ccp, missile should need a nerf because of the new speed nerf, but not likes that !t1 torp and cruise was fine, why nerf them ?!t2 cruise may need a nerf, but with low explo velo, there are useless now.with old stats, heavy missile won't be overpowered against a cruise sized ship who goes +2000m/s (explo velo was only 1000m/s)nb : sry for my english :("

"/signed x6i am supporting this pettition 100%. ccp has changed the dynamics of the game so much that i lost completely interest in playing the game any more. after multiple missile nerfs, this last one is simply rediculous. i tested in pvp with my nighthawk, manticore, and caldari navi raven. i have maxed missile skills on one toon and max skills on gunnery on other toon. missile boats are so outclassed in various combat scenarios that they are simply inferrior. game is broken.i am letting my children's accounts expire in two weeks (they were both caldari and their interest was weak and only npc) and my two industry and trade support accounts. my combat peeps have about 2, and 3 months left and will let them expire. i am dissapointed in training so long and seeing a great game go backwards. this is not an expansion - it is simply a patch, a bad one at that.i am incuding below my detailed pre patch post fyi.sateneposted - 2008.11.07 05:15:00 - [789] - quotereport --------------------------------------------------------------i have spent hours reading the changes in missiles and things are definitely going in the wrong direction. caldari must use mids for tanking. new changes require more mids to be sacrified to achieve full efectiveness of missiles. complexity is getting rediculous. this very reason for mids handicap, made caldari so weak in solo pvp. gang pvp is not an answer. you can say go in gangs to fill any deficiency in any scenario but really not the answer to this major missile nerf. why ccp has to screw so much with missiles is beyond me. speed issue can be fixed many other ways. lets put things in simple terms for example:there is no way to win in a raven vs a domi/megathron in pvp, providing equally skilled oponents and appropriate top mods. can ccp see this clearly? or this is done on purpose. or there is no way a nighthawk will win against astarte in pvp, providing equally skilled oponents and appropriate top mods. can ccp see this clearly? or this is done on purpose. the above list can go a long way like this. my point is, missiles are to compensate for the mid slots tanking (defence) and mwd/ab/web/tp/ws... (offence) problem or handicap. it is a major caldari disadvantage and has always been. there are no mid slots to fit all this to be any effective with missiles.so stop with nerfing missiles in general and deal with 10km/s cruisers flying arround. cruisers should not be fatser than missiles period. under any circumstances.or maybe you will blend all the featuers in this game so much that everything becomes so nerferd and blended that peeps lose interest and the edge in the game. it is a scary thought, but it has happened before.respectfully,satene1 of 6 accounts"
"changes were needed, but the ratio of how explosion vs. sig radius and explosion vs. target velocity factor into damage needs to be tweaked a bit. cruise missiles should be hitting battleships for full damage considering velocity alone, but not wtf owning frigates. ccp got half of that equation correct in qr, but the error they made in over nerfing on explosion velocity will hurt low-sp characters the most.i'm almost more peeved that 7+ million sp in missiles (cruise-centric) only nets me a low-level booby-prize certification. that's for another thread, however..."
"bs sized guns hit bs's for full sometimes and sometimes they hit for less and so it was proclaimed by the masses that missles were balanced.but alas delay is the elephant in the room, as long as it is taking 8+ seconds for my missiles to reach my target it should be real simplebs cruise missile + bs target = full damage.that's the trade i get for having to wait while you get a good shot at jumping away before my volley hits.explosion velocity was nerfed too hard.oh and just for fun comparison tnt has an explsion velocity of 6,900 m/sand rdx/c4 has an explosion velocity of 8,750 m/si think our nuclear missiles are powered by farts."

"before answering, please note that i have no opinion whatsoever on the alliance politics under discussion and don't pay attention to them most of the time. this reply is purely by way of being an 'fyi'.in th us, the patriot act gives the government extremely wide-ranging powers to address whatever they perceive to be money laundering, as does rico, which is directed at mafia-type organizations and drug dealers. additionally, a court in the netherlands has recently ruled that theft of a virtual object (through real-life aggression) was in fact a criminal matter. now, that was in a quite different game, one which does not allow in-game scamming as a playstyle, whereas if you are dumb enough to hand me 1 billion isk in return for 1 unit of tritanium, it's your own damn fault.my point is just that the virtual nature of mmo transactions does not automatically exclude them from legal scrutiny. i have no idea what sort of sums are traded in rmt, but under us law i believe that cash transfers in excess of $10,000 are subject to record-keeping requirements. that's about 300 gtcs or 15 billion isk.i am not a lawyer, usual disclaimers apply, but i am interested enough in the subject to see a potential liability situation - more likely for ccp as enabling party than any individual player.(just for fun)have you thought about why the icelandic banks had their assets frozen under the uk's anti-terrorist laws recently? have you??!?!?!!!!some references if you're interested. i am not going to get in an argument about this, like i said it's just fyi material."

"hello laiyna,this is indeed a hot topic, especially for those of us who spend most to all of our time in high-security space. i think something should be done about the widespread canflipping, but not about the process of canflipping itself.deployable containers should take up less room in the cargohold (about 500 m3, maybe), then expand when anchored and allow for a great deal of stuff to be put in it. these containers could only be accessed when anchored in space, and would have a password as well.the space inside the expandable container should be about 15k m3 (about half of a jetcan, but still enough to get you by for quite some time). shooting it would trigger concord, so it'd still be a risk using one of these flimsy units in low-security space over the more stable giant secure containers.the practice of canflipping is an old system, and is working as intended. there should be more options open for the enterprising miner, but it shouldn't impede time-honored techniques used in the game."
"mr. laebetrovo is a rare example of someone who can not only come up with diverse ideas about the problems of new eden, but also listens to what other pilots suggest and how they sometimes don't agree with him. that quality marks him as a prospective csm member. i am sure that my vote is not wasted when i support him - and i do that with great pleasure.good luck my friend."
"i think scagga will make an excellent csm. i have met him several times at various eve events and also know him through our connections in providence.i would recommend him to anyone having problems making up their mind on who to vote for!"
"got my votes."
"i'm sure vuk will make a fine csm member, but more than that he's by far the best candidate for chairman so needs all the votes he can get.he has a special knack for dealing with people in a warm friendly (and humourous) way that's also incredibly uncompromising and hence effective in a csm setting. he won't allow himself to be fobbed off or sidelined by ccp or by other csm members, you can't distract or troll him. online for instance he insists on knowing everybody's real name and calls people by their first name (in corp chat, on msn etc..) which helps disarm the anonymous asshatery that pervades much of the internet.he calls a spade a spade and if someone tries to call it something different he'll call them out simply and effectively without letting the debate get dragged down to petty biased, personal levels. judging by some of the problems that plagued the first csm situation i can't see anyone better than vuk to chair the second session and set a no-bull****, business like tone."
"i'll be out of town until sunday afternoon, so if i don't answer your question immediately, i'm sorry. however, i will get back to you as soon as i can."

"lowsec has been a point of contention for quite some time with regards to its risk/reward versus empire. i am certainly aware of the issue and am looking for solutions. i am certain ccp is as well though i do not know how close they would be to implementing it.i will not be putting up a web page. the forums have a means for the csm to communicate with itself and with the players. keeping it all in the same place is important.if an outside medium is needed, you could pm me on scrap heap challenge. but aside from that, we have the assembly hall and speakers forum. i read this thread and those forums regularly and will not miss raised issues.learning skills should be removed from the game. they are nothing but an extra skill grind for players. whether or not ccp actually does it, that is another issue. with regards to combat effectiveness i would reduce the requirements for using t2 modules. the skill advantages are significant enough. my stances on entrenched assets are fairly well known."
"thank you, and it certainly would be. however, with current mechanics it would be necessary to have that moon only in low-sec or 0.0, since individuals cannot be war-dec'd and this would leave high-sec ps invulnerable. fixing that is certainly something to look into, but i am not sure how it can be done and still allow pos in high-sec without ruining the concept of introductory corporations."
"i'd just like to say that, regardless of personal feelings -- and i certainly have those on this subject, as alliance members can well attest -- i don't think it's particularly constructive for csm candidates to speak negatively about other csm candidates. multiple people are going to be elected, and if both you and someone you spoke ill of are elected, that could negatively affect the csm's ability to work as a team."
"hello all,as a character, i wouldn't shed a tear if both bob and the goons got into a battle and were wiped out. i disagree with a lot of the things which both sides have done, as they have both become too big and too proud.as a player, i understand that they're just people playing this game for the same reason i am - to have fun. while their technique might be pretty crude tbh, it's their right to play the game the way that they want (within reason - actions such as the forum shutdown of a few years ago were wrong).as a member of the csm, i will take everybody for who they are - a player with a unique insight towards eve. i'll be the first to admit that the goons have more insight due to experience than i do in certain aspects of this game, and i look forward to hearing what they have to say."
"1. goons are not out to \"destroy\" eve2. however last csm has shown that in-game politics can and do affect csm i would dare say the goon is not above this and neither is any of the others.3. there is a valid concern, but as has been said it is probably a minor one"
"i'd like that too, actually"
"i think it is fascinating that a lot of people \"fear\" the goons. yes, over the years there have been goons who have done what could be considered \"foul\" things in eve and out of it. do i condone those actions as a player and a goon? no, i don't. but to judge the whole group based on the actions of a very few is pretty shallow.\"but avalloc, a lot of goons took part in jihadswarm and killed miners all over empire!\"the whole jihadswarm fiasco wasn't a bad thing for eve, imho. it generated excitement and tension in a game we all play. look at all the buzz which was created and the elevated activity among all payers when they heard about what was happening to high-sec miners. i wasn't personally out there shooting the miners but i was following the whole situation on the eveo forums. i never want to see eve become boring and predictable. do you? the simple fact players -could- create such a huge event says a lot of good things about the game. this isn't wow where you are hand-fed every freaking live event and \"plot twist.\" this is eve online where the players drive the game. a safe game will eventually lose its customers when they max out on their money and levels. i don't see eve ever doing that and sure as hell won't let it while i'm around stll playing it.i care about this game and the community that supports it. if you're afraid of voting to support me because i'm a goon, then your ignorance of exactly who i am and what i stand for is truly unfortunate for you, not me."

"it's me, i'm perfection."
"alright, crossposting blog from before. very late, but better late than never. let's just say that it's a long story i'd prefer not to go into.on to business. let's start with ways to improve industry and trade.first point:currently, a large amount of tech one modules are fairly useless to produce, at least if you intend to sell them, because no one really buys them. there are various reasons for this, i believe, and it needs more investigation, but i suspect that module drops off of npc ships are largely to blame. this can be seen in a number of cases where the sell prices on the market for modules available only as loot (meta level one and two items) is less than the sell prices for the same type of item that was manufactured (meta level zero varieties). the sell prices for any manufactured item are of course limited by the mineral cost to produce it, people selling looted items might not use this as a consideration. thus, while buy orders for all meta level zero items exist, they are for prices below the mineral worth of items, and sell orders for many meta level zero items have very low rates of sale. one of the net effects of this is that manufacturing is somewhat more difficult to get into for a new player than combat or mining, as one needs some experience and knowledge of how to read eve's market to figure out what modules will actually provide a profit when manufactured, and even then the competition for limited sales can be daunting for the budding industrialist.there is, of course, no easy solution for this problem. simply turning off all loot is not really an option here, it is a part of the game, and while there is room for adjustment, i do not believe such a big change should be made without very careful consideration of all the potential implications, and a plan to deal with them. however, there is room for change. as a possible  and i stress possible, it needs a good deal of thinking through  solution or partial solution, perhaps a reduction in the amount of meta level loot, coupled with the ability to produce meta level items. details obviously need to be worked out  would these be produceable from bpos buyable from npcs, or would some form of invention be required? special components, or just minerals? would you need skills to make them or not? but that brings me to my next point:point two:we need more midlevel manufacturing opportunities  something between tech one and tech two manufacturing. to some extent, tech two component manufacturing helps, it's something you can do that requires more skills and resources than tech one manufacturing, but not as much as tech two research and production requires. production of meta level items has the potential to fill this niche.point three:speaking of niches, it would be nice to see a manufacturer be better able to build a brand identity. now, there are two problems with doing this currently: one, your items are exactly the same as someone else's that produces the same type of module. you can't say we make the most reliable ones or we make the most powerful ones. i remain cautiously optimistic about tech three items in regards to this, but i'm not holding my breath. second, the market doesn't allow for people to choose who to buy from based upon who's selling it. more on this farther down. so i'd like to see some way to establish a brand identity, and i'd like to see specialization rewarded. perhaps more advanced industry skills that make it faster to build certain groups of modules, maybe tech three will allow other things. we'll see.(continued)"
"point four:i'd like to explore the idea of having components for most all items, even tech one items. this could give newer manufacturers something to produce that would always be in demand, be another thing people could specialize in, and make manufacturing of tech one items slightly more interesting that just putting in minerals  you actually put in the parts to assemble the item, which makes a little more sense. but perhaps not  it's an idea to explore, not something that i'm completely sure of. and maybe tech three will give something like that, i'm waiting to see.point five:the market! i think we should take a look at potential changes to the market. the current market is fine for some things, but it has some noticeable failings  you can't pick and choose who to buy from, nor do you know who you're buying from, making it impossible to boycott a specific company, or be loyal to a specific brand name  in fact, it makes the building of a brand name rather hard, and makes advertising rather less important for many corporations (speaking of which  i'd love to be able to rent ad space on the concord billboards). it also encourages undercutting by .01isk, in fact, it makes anything else rather dumb in most cases (obviously not in all cases  but in most). personally, i'd like for someone to buy my goods because my goods are the best, or because i have a good relationship with the customer, or something like that, rather than because i managed to lower my sale order or raise my by order by a tiny amount more recently that anyone else.---i'd like to take this opertunity to thank all the people that have given me support, it's very heartwarming to see all the support coming together, from friends, corpmates, aquantances, and strangers. thank you, and i hope that i will be able to represent you and live up to the confidence you have placed in me."
"redlions post almost every canidate was against decreasing the gradient between high-sec and low-secwhy?ankh is only one in favor of that... which is oddly the only canidate that seems not to be a rabid pvp houndone delegate suggest moving to better roids which is fine until you get to ones only found in 0.0..and lets face it... a hulk mining is a wet dream for most in 0.0another states that the roids are worthless enough in 0.0?if so what difference would it make other than not giving pvp'r the easy kills.i am not suggesting that you should be able to fly to a belt and find morphite.....just be able to find a step or two better.eve is a great game but definately puts builders at a disadvantage from roi (return on investment)"
"because right now, the ores you find in highsec are better than the ores you find only in lowsec. this is obviously wrong -- it's not highsec mining that needs a boost, but lowsec mining. lowsec mining is rather more risky than highsec mining, so it should be a good deal more profitable. if it were actually worth it, then perhaps people would fight over lowsec territory for mining, trying to keep it safe from pirates and clear of rivals, creating a much more dynamic, interesting, and rewarding situation than what currently exists.basically, lowsec is bad enough compared to highsec as it is, the difference doesn't need to be made even worse. besides . . . unless you put nullsec ores in highsec, it's hard to find better ore, considering that highsec ores are better than i think all but one of the lowsec ores."
"as you know, eve used a risk-reward model. without going into any ridiculous amount of detail, those two words 'risk-reward', should answer your question. agents, npcs, moon minerals, trading profit margins...these are examples of areas that are consistent with having a gradient between high and low sec and allowing an active, enterprising player a chance to make headway against someone who does not want to take any risks. why should minerals be an exception?as for your reference to ankh, i've noticed that your interesting posting history so is running the 0.0. cosmo complexes for others, or owning stations, or mining dysprosium. having dreams encourages people to adapt and innovate, and appreciate hard fought for goals. this is a good thing in my opinion.please produce evidence. all you've said there is based on opinion, which is not conducive to a serious discussion.false. i know groups of people in t1 production with a weekly profit margin of 17.5% on a <2 billion isk investment. i have also had opportunities to make 10%+ profit on a drake bpo i used to own. meanwhile i am involved in trade, and can make 50-100% profits with investments as small as 25m."
"first, how do you mean \"wet dream\"? do you mean it is something miners strive for or a ripe target for pirates. in both cases i would agree. but in the latter isn<U+FFFD>t any solo target in pvp space far from backup a ripe target? if you are in 0.0 you most likely are a part of a corp and should have backup anyways. yeah a lone miner is a pretty target, but 5 hulks 2 haulers with full sec detail becomes a bit less enticing. especially when you consider that odds are most hulk pilots can come back in a combat ship pretty quickly.that said i think there needs to be more of a boost to low sec mining. sure you can make a little more money, but if you are alone why bother risking your beautiful hulk when you can just mine trit half afk and still make good money? especially when in empire you dont have to worry about refining it, or getting it back into market areas.it<U+FFFD>s not a rabid pvper issue by any stretch of the imagination. 0.0 is one of eve's unique selling points and it should be more populated than it is."
"because, in order to draw more people into the other areas of play there needs to be corresponding reward over the risk.decreasing the gradient means less increased reward for the risk increase.this means people will go to empire and stay there and not leave. the game resolves around conflict and that is bad for the game"
"there are allready high end ores in high security space, you just need to find them..."
"i don't necessarily think that there needs to be loads of good ores in highsec.i still want mining to receive a boost in the way of larger asteroids (so they don't get eaten in one cycle) and more asteroids in a belt so the system won't get stripmined in a matter of hours. preferably in combination with more hidden sites/belts that people have to scan for.but most of all i'm in favor of a total overhaul of the mining system, with game mechanics that reward (and interest) players that pay attention.mining needs love, after all the mechanics are very very boring and have not changed since eve's conception."
"i believe the quality of ore should clearly increase the sec status decreases. 0.0 should be where the most of the best ore is found. right now i think it is hard to make a case for low sec mining over high sec. i've often run the numbers and there just isn't much money to make in low sec even though the risks are much greater.what i would love to see is all ores available in all sec levels but as a \"rare\" find. the chance of finding a \"rare\" roid would increase as the sec level drops. not enough of the rare ore to change the value that the lower sec systems offer but as a way to make mining more interesting. maybe a skill that increases your chances of getting a rare roid. an alternative might be \"trace elements\" in the current ore that you could extract based on a skill.just a thought...issler"
"do you think that there aren't enough hidden belts, and do you think that there isn't enough ore to go around?what about...hidden belts?t2 mining lasers/crystalsmining gang links?rorquals?i think mining has changed a lot since eve started."
"first: a hulk alone is dead in 0.0.... second: risk-reward i understand, the risk to mine in 0.0 to get mins you cannot get in empire is .not right imho..first miners contend with rat spawns that can take out a hulk fairly quick...then have to contend withpvp aspect. in 0.0 pvp'r only have to watch other pvp'rs...the rat spawns are easy to handle and are no challenge for all but the most new pvp player.think the exploration mining sites in empire should have even the rare and ultra rare mins to even things up"
"ok pixel and all others....if you think its not a issue...which i doif only if csm to me is suppose to be a active cross-section of players and play styles so that everyone is represented.if you vote them in thats your choice and i hope you get the representation that you want from it.disclaimer:this is not a anti-goon thread, it would exist if it was any.... any alliance. i have no problem with goons, actually the burn quite nicely and set me on fire equally often"
"if you don't want too many goons, vote for someone else.and ask yourself why no other alliance is represented with any reasonable amount of candidates.is there even a single bob candidate?"
"pretty sure the csm is a joke that's already happened."
"this sophie character certainly seems to be an industrialist to be reckoned with.+1 vote!"
"i swear i'm a perfectly honest businessman. yep, nothing to see here, move along.while not a pirate myself, one of my priorities for my campaign is lowsec and all who live there (and encouraging more people to live there), and i know at least one pirate corp is supporting me in my bid for csm. so while not a pirate personally, i do hope that i'll do a good job of representing them!"
"i'd have to agree with arithron. booms are pretty, not a waste!that aside, i think that while this would be kinda nice, arithron does have a point that they would unbalance things somewhat . . . unless, perhaps, they became wrecks with a very high difficulty to salvage, so it took a long time to get anything out of them, or just dropped metal scraps . . . hmm. it would be nice to have them have some other use besides looks, but . . . not really a priority when you consider how much work it would be to balance it."
"1. should a player be able to launch pos for self, or after launching assign tower/modules to specific players?sounds like an interesting idea, but we never had problems because of the lack of this feature. 2. should players be able to use their own hangar when manufacturing and researching at a pos?well if they had an own hangar, then sure, yes. 3. should new industry be made (fuel rods) to make pos refuel easier?depends on what you mean. if you refer to fuel rods, e.g. composite material containing all key commodities required to run a pos, than yes, i am okay with that, it is just a pain in the ass that you have to coordinate the purchase and distribution of so many different goods. on the other hand, i really do not want pos logistics made technically any easier than it is today. in my opinion pos logistics should be more difficult and more risky than it is today. to compensate that, the number of posses you need to feed could be reduced. standings4. should it be easier to share standings?yes, but we do not need ccp for achieving this. it is supported by the api, so players can create tools that support sharing this stuff.5. should it be possible for a corporation to chose to apply alliance standings, so docking/pos use alliance standing.yes. 6. should standing list be expanded?no. ccp said it would create a lot of lag. i hate lag. we did have to juggle a little bit when getting closer to the limit, but the ability to set corp standings towards alliances helped a lot. 7. should alliances be able to set standings to players and vice versa?yes, as long as it does not create more lag. universe:8. should all of 0.0 be conquerable?no. 9. should the universe be expanded?no. pvp:10. should rokh powergrid be boosted?don't see a reason why it should. 11. should missiles be more useful in fleet fights?i have not participated in a fleet fight since the speed nerf so i cannot tell you that. however our initial tests show that missiles are quite alright.industry:12. should ccp boost hulk cargo capacity by 2000 m3?no. i do not see why more afking people would help this game forward. instead mining should be made less boring, so people do not start afking at all. something interactive maybe. 13. should t2 bpo me be nerfed to 0, and invented bpc gain positive material level?nope, they are fine as they are. 14. should hi sec asteroid belts be boosted? no. 15. should a pos be able to refine alloys/ore at 100%?no, posses should remain inferior to stations. 16. should it be possible for alliance member to use another corporations copying and inventing labs?yes. more pos17. should it be possible to charge a fee when players are using jump bridges?yes. 18. should a pos ai get boosted?yes.factional warfare:19. should fw start actually having any impact?definitely. 20. should corporations in alliances be able to participate in fw?yes, however there should be requirements that ensures that only the corps that are really dedicated for a given faction can enter.alliance:21. should alliances get medals?i think this issue is kind of irrelevant. but why not, yes. to the very bottom of the development list. 22. should alliances able to change the support percent required for executor by vote that require the same amount?i do not think that there should be any automated method of preventing takeovers. alliance leaders should be wise enough to make sure that things like this do not happen."
"if you want change, sometimes you have to force it. need more people to dedicate themselves in getting rich by stealing loot and salvaging missioners wreck. with the missile nerf, perhaps missiosn won't be worth doing at all anymore, and that's when ccp will notice."
"/signedwas recently in a couple wars.. had to pop the wrecks because of the scavenger frigs running around to steal the loot from my war targets. npc wrecks belong to the player.. so why shouldnt another players wreck belong to that player if they killed them. on a realistic level, there is no difference between an npc and a player. fundamentally, sure.. but they're both targets you're allowed to shoot at.. the npc.. though not a \"real\" player his wreck would still belong to him and his corporation, which means regular players should just get flagged to that npc corp for stealing from them."

"agreed.the goal was to change speed, to bring ships down to a velocity that allowed positive engagement on both sides (especially for missile users who were distinctly feeling left out of pvp by the large simply because they could not damage anything they hit) but with quantum fail not only are speeds reduced, but the ability to slow ships down was likewise reduced.the net result:nothing changed.and then missiles were rendered so much worse than they were prior to quantum fail that missile users are left even further behind the curve. explosion velocities should have been increased, not decreased.and no, i don't use missiles as a primary weapon (because they've been terribly sub-par since the introduction of explosion velocity. that was a godsend, but failed to factor for the steady increase in speed). i prefer every other weapon system... though, granted, artillery is just as bad (if not worse)."

"/signed - letting my accounts expire now that i've wasted months and rl $ on millions of sp for missles. i think the dev's should spend time adding new elements to the game that don't suck, instead of constantly rethinking the mistakes they've already made. the only thing worth seeing in qr would have been storefronts and product branding (now pushed back). instead we get nerfs everywhere, certs (new players still have no idea how to use this system, old ones recognize the point but dont need it because they already have evemon which is far better..hull tanking...really you had so much time to mess around with this dev cycle that you could waste it on that horrid attempt at humor), medals, and a drone window that doesnt disapear when we dock. i wasnt sure why i was paying for the game before and now im not. its been a real pleasureoh wait maybe i should stay because i can align the hud to top, or perhaps because aa is supported ingame, the \"new\" graphics with skyboxs using horrible levels of d3dx texture compression.gg to us i guess...we wasted our money. guess ill play l4d until next patch and take another look."

"missiles pre qr were underpowered, post qr they are close to be useless.as you can see, i rethink my old ideas about missiles."
"definitely not signed.large missile ability vs small ships is now similar to that of large turrets, and has been increased vs larger targets.if you think missiles aren't balanced then you need to accept that the review of weapons, tracking and combat pre-qr was unfinished and that they all need a looksee, including inter-race and intra-class balance (e.g. torp raven vs blaster thron).if you think turrets are fine, then missiles are too.if you think that missiles are unbalanced because of anything to do with missions or npcs, you are wrong, because pve is not relevant to balance."
"with pleasure. i am a 37-mill sp character completely specialised in caldari missile spamming. i have investigated the new missile damage formula extremely thoroughly.under the previous mechanics, it was trivial for cruisers and below to avoid 99% of missile damage simply by hitting mwd and going faster then explosion velocity + 2x falloff (precision lights excluded). the high speeds of those ships meant that range advantage of long-range missiles was fairly meaningless, so long-range missile users were unable to defend their range advantage.with the new mechanics, missile damage linked to sig radius far better, making mwds a 500% self-painter. missile damage against fast mwding targets is vastly improved, immensely increasing hms' ability to inflict damage. this, in conjunction with the slowing of all ships, has vastly increased the long-range missile users' abilities to maintain range, and deliver meaningful dps across the battlefield. also, missile users now have options for increasing damage against fast targets, such as painters and crash, enabling a greater range of tactics.short-ranged missiles - hams and torps - are unchanged in practice, as they required your target to be webbed beforehand anyway, to stop it simply mwding away and laughing at you. rage hams still do full damage to webbed abing bc, torps still do full damage to painted, webbed bs - mods that were required beforehand. in fact, they're really received a stealth buff, as their ac- and blaster counterparts now find it harder to get to optimal, and the range advantage of torps is more meaningful.specific examples:hm drake boosted, as it can now hit fast targets for meaningful damage and defend its range advantage.ham drake boosted, because of increased rage damage and the greater difficulty of its ac-and blaster-fit counterparts in getting to optimal.aml cerberus boosted, as now it is deadly to all interceptors, rather than just non-pimped ones.hml cerberus boosted, as it can now deliver massively more damage to mwding cruisers, enabling it to defend its range advantage and even meaningfully damage interceptors. its ability to damage falcons is unchanged, as its ability to damage tackled targets of its size or greater.torp raven boosted, because no additional tackle needed in your gang (i don't regard the torp raven as a sensible solo ship, nor that it should be one), and the greater difficulty of its ac-and blaster-fit counterparts in getting to optimal.problems:cruise. its pvp role was one of antisupport, this has been hit. although note that the nanoed support in question could have previously avoided pretty much all cruise damage simply by hitting mwd, a feat that is now impossible.sbs. although they can now damage interceptors at speed, their ability to instapop frigates - which is really the entire point of the class - has been hit. note, however, that this is really a sb problem, rather than a missile problem, and that ccp has said they are looking at reworking sbs.rockets. well, possibly. they're ok if you can web your target, and have a significant range advantage over acs and blasters, a range that is easier to maintain with nerfed webs. but frigates, with their limited slots, have difficulty fitting a web, so this may require looking at, i'm not sure.perceived problems that really aren't problems:omg afterburners! will not be used commonly used on bcs or bs and their ability to mitigate missile damage is massively reduced as soon as they get webbed - which is easily done by a mwding ship.omg i can't hit small ships as easily! neither can turrets, in general - certainly not within web range.in short, the combat utility of missiles has been, in general, vastly improved."
"this man speaks the truth. i can do nothing more than urge the op to read and understand."
"ok, the sooner you people get this through your head the better, its not about large missiles vs small ships, its about heavy, cruise, and torps, doing accurate damage to bc's and bigger. got it now? its been stated many times, wake the **** up. and no combat utility vs large targets has not been improved."
"/me applauds and agrees with jade constantine... and the individual who he quoted."
"okay after the patch i logged in to contine on my level 4 missions..and i was amazed at the changes yall made. same mission ive done before without any problems and within 30 seconds i almost lose my raven cause i couldnt kill the freaking scramble frig. both my accounts will be cancelled. what a waste of my money."
"light drones are for frigs, always have been, why would you waste expensive cruise missiles on frigs? or torps which is even more silly."
"it's like milk is a drug, and my droogs have been taken away."
"i prefer speaking about missiles that i really use a lot: torp/cruisefact:i can post kills of nano cruiser (vaga/ishtar/rapier) died against my cruise raven. what you miss here is the old webber power, with the old missile formula.in qr, it's impossible for a cruise raven to reach 100% damage against ab/mwd speed tanking cruiser using 1,2 or even 3 meds (read here med slot from support ships if you prefer).i'm not telling it was easy killing nano, just that it was possible without blob, in qr is impossible for a cruise raven ---> nerfcruise missiles are less effective against frig <-> bc ----------------> nerfalso for sb, it was a flyable ship, now it's just a lol ship against any frig/cruiser/bc/bs/etc ----> nerftorps: bs ab speed tanking is very powerful (more than pre-qr mwd bs speed tank), bc/cs can not be threaten by torps any more. ----> nerfabout the stealth buff, bss had max speeds higher pre qr, but to mitigate speed nerf, close range bss have received more agility to reach top speed early. also torps had 10% range reduction. in a typical 10-20km distance situation, it doesn't have any impact. ----> just a fair modification.hm drake was alrdy able to do that with nano, with just 1 support ship with just 1 web fitted. how many meds (of your team) do u need now for full dmg now? more than 1? ------> nerfham drake does more dmg to bs (only t2 rage), less dmg to bc or smaller for t1/t2 ammo ----> mmm i dunno, t2 rage can compensate the less dmg to bc and smaller?we have to see how many pilots will use mwding cruisers now, ab is by far better to speed tank. also your example is not speaking about ewar necessary to delivery 'massively' more damage, 3meds+2rig+booster+t2ammo? pre qr one webber was ok for 100% dmg, or am i wrong?it's your opinion about a not known trend. for a short range bc/bs i guess that we can see at least 50% using mwd and 50% using ab (new scrambler bonus + ab tank + lower cap for ab). for medium range bc/bs better to orbit at optimal with ab than using a mwd, and in any case, if mwd is fitted also for medium range, the new formula allows high dmg reduction only pulse mwd on/off (dmg mitigation with this technique is close to ab speed tanking).where is the missile buff?"
"way to completely miss the point i was making about turret vs missile balance. and yes, vs larger targets has been massively improved. hint: rages were useless. now they're not."
"part of a nerf against missiles hitting small stuff was needed. thats not a problem, when a bs w/o an ab or mwd can slowboat and greatly reduce damage to a t1 torp. let alone even larger reduction if that bs fits 1 ab.missiles for the most part have been a large laughing stock of the pvp world. finally the torp raven was given its boost when they changed torps around. then they decide to gimp explosion velocity greatly so with this patch and now unless they are idiots and stay at 0m/s there is a large amount of dmg reduction done against the same size hull your engaging in.guess my shield tank now has to be gimped even farther to now accomodate mwd, 2x web, 1x tp (web nerf), and point. out of 6 mid slots that leaves you 1 for tank. tp drones hardly do enough to make a difference. i would use webbing drones except for the lul 75m3 drone bay. only worse bs drone bay being the 50m3 of the rokh... and its blaster purpose is lulz... and now its only a sniper ship(though its main role)looking at it from a standpoint that everyone fits mwd's is wrong. granted it might be that way in a 0.0 world, but in a lowsec/highsec pvp environment fits can change.well back to armor tanking gunnery. missile shield ship fail again thank you ccp. and screw pve... you can use a domi just as easy as raven. and the raven works almost as well... it just takes a few min more to finish the missions."

"what ****es me off here is all the turret users telling the missile users to stop whining before even considering what turrets are capable off and what missiles weren't even before the patch. caldari ships always have had better tanking abilities than other races for 2 reasons 1) because its quicker to get to the tanked part of the ship i.e the sheild. 2) because missiles although were good at consistant damage always have do lower damage than other ships. e.g. sniping tempest can do 2000+ dmg when fit correctly. sniping apoc can do 1200+ dmg when fit correctly with tach 2's the dmg is lower but the rof is higher than tempest. gallante do massive dmg with blasters at close range which torpedos can now never match and would have to sacrifice tanking ability to fit a web and painter but a blasterthon wouldn't. in the time i have been playing caldari have had many big nerfs1)splash dmg removed2)ability to use cruise missiles in seige launchers3)missiles were completely reworked in cold war july 2005 which introduced a massive nerf which required the training of several new skills to accomodate the sig radius/flight time/velocity/rof changes.4)torps given a massive reduction in range.5)now another complete rework causing them to become the worst race in game and the training of more skills for modules which when fitted ruin the ships tanking ability. why was it needed ?its argued that the speed nerf would have given missiles users an advantage however it actually gave all races an advantage because no matter what you fire with, its easier to hit/dmg a slower moving target.but webbers got nerfed ?so this doesn't affect missiles then ?so instead of balancing missiles the devs completely reworked them so caldari pilots do 60-70% of the dmg they did before and thats providing the target sits still. when all they had to do is rebalance the current formula by making sure missiles were doing the same dmg after the patch."

"no excuse now, give us a skill queue :p"
"needed...the game is so skill intensive (perhaps a little too much, but ccp needs your money) and you don't get any kind of experience points. mostly i train log skills while logged out, but some unexpected work/family issue can make you lose a day or a week sometimes.now that certificates exist (even though they are a bit broken), they are the obvious place to put the skill queue interface. better yet let corps define their own ceritifcates based on what skills they think really matter, rather than ccp - i mean, who uses multitasking when relatively few ships will let you have more than 6 targets anyway? most people don't need it, but apparently it's a 'core' skill now. sure."
"yeah. im sure that ccp will be all fine with letting a 3rd party access their db..."
"posting to show my support.give skillqueue now!"
"i'll add my name to this petition... a skill queue would be beneficial. a cheap alternative would be the ability to automatically continue training the next level of current skill (this could be a skill-training setting, perhaps?)or... and here's something to make certificates perhaps more worthwhile to advanced players...allow the ability to enroll for a certificate. you'd have to ensure you have all the skillbooks, of course, but if you start training the certificate, it would automatically queue those skills for you till the cert was done.

"if payout is only a fraction of the damage inflicted, there's not much incentive to risk your own ship trying to collect the bounty either. unless you are talking implants rather than ship damage.like the contract idea, hate the skill idea. why does every last thing have to have a skill associated with it? i start to wonder if ambulation will require a 'walking' skill. tentative support."
"everyone is a passive target when enough people are shooting. gaining advantage by bringing more people is fine, but enforcing that advantage is not.if a guy generates a lot of bounties(i.e. one per kill right generated by the pirate) and they are contracted then there may be a lot of hunters, but the other way around, where many hunters can get the same bounty is not reasonable, it enforces an imbalance with a single action. remember, any system that we implement is going to be a brake on pirate activity. we have to be careful that it is not too much of a brakeyou have to in order to prevent fraud. the payout needs to be an amount lower than the platinum insurance on the ship. otherwise the pirates alt takes the contract and blows up the pirate and collects the bounty as profit."

"since the qr \"expansion\" i have seen lots and lots and lots of whining about skills being useless because of this, that, or the other. whether people adapt or not is up to them, but i had an idea. what if ccp introduced an in-station service that would allow players to re-allocate skill points. obviously ccp would have to have a fee associated with it, say 5mil per skill or something. to keep people from completely respec'ing overnight ccp could limit it to one skill a week or so. once a skill has been completely unlearned the player will not receive the skill book back. if the player wishes to relearn a skill previously unlearned he will have to buy the skill book all over again. same goes for new skills, the player will still be required to buy the neccessary skill books before the sp can be re-allocated from one skill to another. i am sure there are other aspects that can be fine tuned, but i wanted to put forth this general idea to the community. i know other mmorpg's have a similar system in place, if ccp were to implement it, i think it would give players a chance (maybe expensive) to try different roles and aspects of eve without having to start from scratch."
"i must support my own topic, mainly because i don't have much else to do right now and i also think this would be a nice feature for ccp to implement :-) cheers"
"no.if you don't like the skills you have, simply train some new ones."
"this sir speaks the truth."
"again... you forget... and yet you blindly propose like every other foolish \"lets unlearn\" type proposal.the bulk of skills out there require prereq's that must be met before you can use them... not including fittings and other aspects of your ship configs.if you get people who start futzin around with there skills... your going to have a hell of a mess on your hands.as for the \"caldari\" whiners out there... they need to buck up... and just adapt.this also causes major issues with the fact that your so called proposed fee...even at the limitation of a timer... would cause a massive issue with the fact that some of us put some hard earned time into those skills... and its just not fair for us if you can learn one skill...and a pile of little skills... only to learn an another skill that takes several months... only a few hundred million isk.in short.. a very loud..and emphatic... hell no."
"i like the current system. it punishes people who mindlessly train for fotm, which is great."
"qft.math fail. skills train at the same rate whether you're training level 1 or level v. you'd heave to learn a lot of 'little skills' at level 1 to trade them in for a quarter or half a million or more needed to get something else to level v. as in hundreds or thousands.thumbs up for idea with some potential."
"like i said in my opening post, the idea needs to be refined...i am a caldari pilot currently skilled for missiles, but i am not worried about the changes, i will figure out a way to adapt like alot of the much older players had to during the years they have been on. i also look forward to cross training into gallente and minnie, maybe i will even wonder into amarr one of these days, it is one of the aspects i enjoy in eve.i also agree that planning your training is very important so you dont waste sp on things you won't use, personally i didn't do that and i trained all kinds of crazy things :-pwhat if the system was implemented but everytime you unlearned a skill, not only does it cost isk but the player would also lose half of the skill's learned sp due to \"scotty pressed the wrong button\" or something. i agree it shouldn't be a scape goat for ill thought out skill training, but for those who really want a change of pace or want to unlearn useless things they trained as noobs and put the sp's toward something useful, i think the players would like that."
"i'm not quite sure what i forgot, i am sure you will enlighten me in some further post, however, this is not just a \"lets unlearn\" proposal, i think that unlearning a skill should have a serious drawback, maybe something like what i proposed in my previous post, maybe more stern, like i said it shouldn't be a scapegoat.i am not even sure why you brought up prereq's everyone knows this and this proposal wouldn't effect this in any way, unless someone tried to unlearn a skill that was a prereq for something else they plan on keeping, in which case you would not be allowed to unlearn it. as far as ship fittings, changing skills to support different fittings would force the user to learn to use those new fittings which could be amusing for some players, frustrating for others.as far as futzin(i find this word amusing) around with skills, i agree that it could make a mess of the server, but with some of the random stuff ccp comes up with, i don't think it would be to out of place :-p seriously though, you are right, it could be a db/scripting nightmare.i know all about hard earned iskies spent to train skills, i just bought and trained skills for cap's and bought a phoenix last week, curious to see how the missile patch will work with it, but its all good...anyway back to the subject. since there will be a ton of scripting and db/server side work that would go into this, i would think ccp would come up with some ingenious way to keep that from happening. maybe put a limit, like you can only transfer sp from one rank 5 skill to another rank 5 skill, this would generally limit a player from taking a ton of rank 1 skills and transferring them into a higher ranked skill like cap ship or awu.and last, please keep this thread civilized, no need to bash each other, call names, or whine about who got nerfed more then the other, i have yet to see the changes with this latest \"expansion\" due to me being deployed, but i am not going to be whining about it when i do finally see them, i will just train different skills and adapt, i have the basic skills for minnie and gallente so i am not to worried :-)edit for spelling, i may have missed some, its been a long day and i haven't had my coffee :-p"
"i listened to the fanfest 2008 dev panel audio file uploaded to eve files. i believe it was tyraxx that asked the devs about the alliance tournament, as there had been no news about it's status.so i took a couple days to mull over it all and now i've decided it's time to make some points about the whole thing.i can understand what ccp is saying in that the costs were quite large, so cut out a large portion of it. dont pay for the evetv people to go to iceland and drink. granted i like the show and everything, but if u have to cut something that's where it should start. cutting the whole tournament i think should be the last resort. i'd be happy to simply watch it (maybe a little higher quality client so we can read the pilot names, etc) with eve sound effects only. we have the irc channel on coldfront, we have the forums, and etc.an ingame mechanic is nice for small corp tourney's or etc... but the alliance tournament has a magnitude to it. it's epic, it matters, an arena system is a poor substitute and i like it for friends to play around in or etc... but i would really like to see the alliance tournament continue.the reason players new and old flock to this event isn't becuase of the flasy animations, super important commentary or anything else. it's an e-peen contest between the major entities of the game. it's not just a tournament its community event where all the aspects and parts of the community come together.i really hope that ccp can come to a compromise on the issue, i mean granted there are cuts i'm sure that could be made. it's entirely to much apart of the community to let fade to black forever. please ccp rethink this. make sure to click support people. thanks for reading."

"as little as i use blasters, i am forced to support this thread simply because of the changes that now make blasters a dangerously impractical system (i.e. web changes).scramblers need to be extended in range and strength if they're expected to be used at all. currently all a mwd ship has to do is the same thing they've always done: run to the edge of disruptor range and orbit.current changes = no change at all. everything does just as it has always done in the past, just at a slower speed."

"i do think there should be a price reduction for buying in bulk.if goonswarm wants to award all its members at the end of some campaign.....i think that the first 10 medals should have the 5 mil fee, but after that the price should drop, so medal 11-25 should cost less, and medals 26-50 get even cheaper, and so on.and i also think its a pain that you cannot award medals to people not in your corp."
"i think it should be exactly the opposite. large corps have larger wallets. just like the fee of war-decs increases, so should the price of medals. what you suggest only makes the actual \"worth\" of a medal even less. if medals aren't only given to people for something \"big\", then what are medals worth? i could be given a medal for every pod i blow up. then what are they actually worth?"
"what makes them worth anything is the receiver of the medal, and the corporate dynamics behind it. attaching a price tag to it is going to turn people off to using them. all the price tag amounts to is another isk sink for the game.oh dear.-kaiden"
"uh excuse me? 5 mil is chump change...no way..../me thumbs down"

"this is currently the #1 greatest issue in factional warfare."
"this issue has been raised like a month ago, no need to raise it a second time."
"could you please link that thread?if you referr to theissue - faction warfare plexing spawning mechanic is brokenthread, that one is not adressing the downtime spawning and especially their distribution related to the downtime mechanic, which currently favour anybody who can play shortly after dt/players in specific timezones.as in the linked original thread in the game development forum this mechanism is confirmed as \"working but imperfect\" and we would like the csm to raise this issue up into a higher priority at ccp so they can offer at least a \"working and balanced\" solution."
"its obvious that this patch is for the most part.. a total failure. for being a nano nerfing patch it sure didnt nerf the nano ships. everyone is moving slower, but we still cant hit anything thats moving at a moderate speed (read base speed). there was never a problem with nanos because there are ships designed to counter them. missiles were one of the worst pvp weapons in the game and now they're even worst than that. blaster boats now have trouble killing anything too. personally i write this patch off as a total failure.. lets stop digging the hole.. fill it back in, and try again.certs are neat.. but ill thought out. medals are also a cool addition, along with the orca... but the nerfs need to go."
"ccp has rolled back small patches in the past, but they have never rolled back a major content patch.when exodus came out there were so many bugs that they reimbursed every ship loss for 30 days following the launch and made a lot of small tweaks to fix the staggering faults with the expansion... but they did not roll it back.perhaps they'll realize the monumental failure of qf and perform small fixes to repair all that they broke, but don't expect any sort of rollback."
"i was looking through the notes and saw something which makes absolutely no sense at all.****45. 0102-07-0076 kill rights should be transferablethe idea of trading killrights has been knocked around internally for a long time. the two things that have held it up are the aforementioned issues with bountyhunting which tie into this and the fact that a simple killright market lets you buy your own killrights, rendering the feature largely counterproductive.****if you buy your own killrights, you have sent payment to the individual you killed. this is far from counterproductive.if the killrights market were an auction market of some sort, then people who really dislike a certain person would have the opportunity to bid whatever they thought it was worth to pop them in empire space. make killrights transferrable 1x after auction, so nobody can know for certain, other than the one who ends up in posession of the rights, who is the hunter, or if there is a hunter at all.sorry. as far as i see it, a killrights auction is win-win. it would take a real effort on the part of ccp to make it not work."
"i'd say auctions would make it too complicated.why not have kill rights set at a consistant price based on the bounty... sec status, sec penalty, etc...you purchase it for a percentage of the cost and the player who has them gets a cut.something to that effect... thats quicker...and less messier."
"i like the idea of an auction killrights system because it is much more likely to generate real compensation for victims.a canflipper who has been around a while flipping cans flips some noob and ganks them. newb puts up the auction. several antipirates begin bidding on the auction because the canflipper has been making a real arse of himself and they all want to kill him. one of the canflipper's friends joins in with an alt and eventually wins the auction.either a) the canflipper's friend just gave x isk to the noob and won't attack the canflipper, or b) he just gave x isk to the noob, and will have a _great_ deal of fun suprising his buddy sometime in the next week.in either case the noob just got a lot of isk they would have never seen otherwise."
"well... aside from the complexities... i have to agree with that statement.. as i've personally been the victim of a few can flippers who just \"flipped\" me off when it comes to my ranting and ravings./me signed."
"here's that video i mentioned in the op but forgot to post:the escapist: eve online review."

"i'd like to propose better controls on the sound settings.currently i never listen to the music in eve, because the sound of warping / cloaking / gates is simply too loud. either i listen to the music at a proper volume and sacrifice my eardrums when warping, or i can't hear the music.i think that many people turn off the sound in eve after a while because of this, and i think that reduces reduces immersion, and keeps players away from some pretty damn moody music..so.. i propose;1) allow us to turn off or greatly reduce the volume of warping / cloaking sounds3) more diversification of sound controls; music, ambient, module related, speech, etc.please let me know if you support this idea. thanks.-ranges"
"so yeah... big complaint showing up is people who lose there wrecks and or loot and what not.is it possible to implement a solution in which the acceleration gates for missions only answer to the \"owner\" of the mission and \"members of the gang\".which means... you have to work much harder at getting at the so called mission area... it keeps you locked out unless your a member of the persons corp/gang/fleet.if the gates can deny access to certain classes of ship or people who don't have the \"key\".why not additional conditions?"
"why do so?"
"ninja salvagers running off with millions of loot.... loot theivery.... etc.it's not impossible to jump into a mission area...but only after it's done.missions are granted day in and day out to every single individual or group of individuals who grab em.since deadspaces \"block warp\" to the area.... that means they are restricted to the \"gates\"so lock the gates.... keep the rif raff out and you'll have nothing to worry about.if someone want's in on the salvage and or scans it out after the missions done... then go for it.they can even ask to join the fleet/gang.but when the mission is in progress... people have no business to be messing around in there.chaos and sandbox aside... this makes what is so very easy to do... much harder... but not impossible.maybe my idea is off the wall... it just dawned on me that no one's suggested this.i'm not against salvagers picking up wrecks that no one wants... i'm against salvagers who just fly in... grab what they want without bothering to ask... let alone bate them with a concordoken trap and or gank-fest.this of course is strictly mission area based.... and just that.but considering no one's stepping up to comment.. i feel this idea is going to be shot down quickly... oh well."
"i'll comment. i disagree. eve is a game where people play with other people, and are not just free to play with themselves. miners have to deal with people stealing their ore, so mission runners need to deal with people salvaging wrecks.consider your idea shot down. was that quick enough for you?"
"only as quick as my ability to destroy your salvage."
"not sure if this has ever been brought up so here goes1. with war dec's, they are sanctioned by concord so why is it when a wt is engaged on a gate i have to wait 60 sec to jump through for recent aggression ? this makes no scene the war is sanctioned therefore no aggression. 2. why cant a player be kicked from a corp and forgo the 24hr wait. ceo should be able to kick player/member with no waiting period. at least this would stop unnecessary headaches.ok just a couple of thought that may or may not have been brought up"
"to the first point, gates are controlled by the empires, not concord."
"2nd point: this prevents corp jumping like leaping frogs being struck by lightning.my thinking is war-dec's should actually make that timer longer because people ditch and thats not good."
"see that's the problem with people they hear but don't listen i said kick kick a person if your corp gets a tool in and you need to kick the jurk 24hrs is a long time to put up with him.. yes i know you can block but a kick option for ceo's would be good.."
"well when you put it that way...i suppose something needs to be done....thing is.. what if you get an idiot ceo?"
"errr wait... what??? ccp is privately owned as far as i know (they bought out the investor a couple of years ago)."
"yeah i was gonna say... ccp is privately owned and quietly hiding away in london/iceland.they have a working relationship with an another company... but its not viacom.if it was viacom.. youd be seeing crap ads."
"0.0 alliance shouldn't wonder about isk farmers/renters at all. they should not have to. and they are not tasked with doing so.ccp should go after the corps that are renting instead of the alliances. if a player can find out that a corp is isk farming , ccp should be able to do it easier and more efficiant .. ccp should try harder themselves ..."
"for too long caldari have been oppressed by the evil npc's of eve now with the drone and missile nerf what we love to do most the killing of endless hordes of hostile npc's is slower,requires far more expensive equipement and too much thinking.my proposal is for npc damage, hitpoints and resistances to be reduced by 50%(stupid overpowered nanos have been nerfed more then this),as well as bouties and lp gain increased by 50%. ccp have shown that enough feedback on forums makes things happen(as proved by the nano nerf).vote for changevote for the liberation of eve from evil npcs"
"i agree that for your standard player isk making can be a pain, i for one hate griding missions just to buy a ship i could lose so easy in a pvp environment.how ever this is not the way to do it."
"i suggest we boost them instead so they can kill whiners and make them emo quit faster"
"i vote that each time a emo post whine about ghost training,nerfing missiles, nerfing patches, whining caldari... gives all there stuff to me.: o pseriously.... get a freaking life people."
"you have my support for this idea."
"all you would be csms, read well and bring this to ccp:allow us to filter out 'want to buy' orders from the contracts window!!! 99% of 'want to buy' orders are just twits scamming. the entire contract system was set up to slow down scams, so keep going and limit them further!you don't need to eliminate 'want to buy', but just give us a selection to not see them if we choose.also, in the market pane give us the ability to filter out market orders beyond a certain percentage above/below the regional median (a percentage we can select). this, also, helps filter the dross so we can get a look at the real market and not the scammers."
"i agree that this should be an option, so i'll endorse this during my time as csm, if i should happen to be elected. the second filter, while nice, is not really pressing."
"also, since the new plex certs are generated from real world money all scams that are attempted concerning them should lead to a ban."
"doesn't putting a 1 in the min price filter on contracts filter out want to buys?"

"i think it'd be cool. although i'm pretty sure anything smaller than a bs will pull enough g-force to turn you into a squidgy mess, definately with a ab/mwd anyway and definately if you're orbiting at close distance. hence the need for a pod + goo i'd assume. dunno how the imaginary crew survives, if there is one. not that eve is very realistic anyway. could be a feature for just the biggest ships in eve, unless you're docked."
"[x] the ninja salvager should not be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because i support ccp's current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecks.it would be different if every player could salvage without skills. however if one doesnt salvage, then its just junk out there going to no use."
"[x] the ninja salvager should not be aggro'd to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged, because i support ccp's current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecks.i like this current system, and no i dont ninja salvage and yes i do run missions personally i think this system helps blance out the lvl 4 missions that ccp already consider unbalanced in thier profitability and it helps discourage people from crowding mission hubs, not to add to the fact it goes with the competitive harsh nature of eve.an interesting copromise i think would be if you made salvaging the wreck flag the ninja to some of the npc's left in the mission. this would make sense and would also be more consistent with game mechanics that currently exists, namley those in pvp."
"ninja salvager should not be aggro'd for clearing wrecks.chances are the ns will trigger the red flag anyway by stealing some juicy loot from a wreck. i personally start destroying the wrecks if a ns shows up and i feel upset about it (ie, haven't had a chance to open them to look at loot!). however, it often depends if i can be arsed or not...most lvl 4's i don't salvage or check loot at all.i guess a way to make it more difficult for the ns, but still allow it to be a viable profession, would be to make the ns have to scan for the mission runner every time the mr uses a gate at deadspace site.it still doesn't stop 'baiting' by ns for the mission runner to attack them. just last night i had one return after his frigate was 'accidently' destroyed, in a pvp ship (obviously with the intention of trying for my mods on domi). however, this was quite fun really :) i'd hate to stop such excitement and chances at pvp just because missions are seen as isk earners...it should be difficult to earn...oh, and he warped off once he figured his shield-tank was about exhausted, and my armor one was holding well...take care,arithron"
"i think you have provided one of the most articulate and well thought out responses that i've ever seen from someone who runs missions, and i respect that. all too frequently, people are ready to jump up and beat their chests demanding changes and reparations, and you, sir, seem to have found an answer.good on ya, mate!"
"one of the items introduced by me in the last csm was a particular small anchorable which would be used purely for small gangs operating in deep hostile space. that idea has been passed directly to the devs. i've also spoken in support of increasing certain types of objectives for small gangs in 0.0 in the form of decoupling the industrial aspects of pos's from sov among other things. as time continues i'm sure there will be a number of other ideas and suggestions that i'd be happy to support.that being said i believe the biggest limiter to small gangs today is the creativity of the individual players. goonfleet has rather effective units that participate solely in small gang warfare. the idea that it doesn't exist, is dead, or that the game needs to somehow be rewritten in order to make the playstyle viable is simply incorrect. i think the pot can be spiced up, but i also find it to be far from empty.as far as titans. i don't support the idea of any grid-killing aoe weapon whatsoever. never have."
"i'm telling everyone i know to not vote for you because of that."
"its common sense that if you sit something unprotected out in space people will come and take it. i am a fairly experienced miner and i have never had a can flip. why? because when i see somebody warp into my belt i do two things: first i call in my hauler to pick stuff up, second i hail the approaching pilot to let them know i am not a macro miner. seriously, most of the can flippers will leave you alone if you have the courtesy to give them a heads up. those that are not looking for macros will generally leave you be because a proactive target is less likely to be an easy ore snatch.i think this system works as intended, forcing cooperation between players."
"gentlemen, once more i thank you for your support! i shall be adding a writeup of the matters concerning agents and the csm itself this weekend."
"good luck vuk, hope you get in! :)"
"well i already voted but i wanted to know your stance on the missile nerf.although there were some tweaks that needed done so cruises just couldnt wtfpwn little ships. coming from someone who has poured way too much sp into missiles for a pvp weapon, it means alot."
"trust me, i have tried. we had an issue about it in the first submission round and i kept bugging people about it at fanfest.soon"
"i confirm nor deny"
"voting for you again. point 2 and 3 will hopefully revitalize eve for everyone."
"perhaps it was, but the ganking itself really isn't what i think made it so offensive -- it was the fact that it was offensive against a real world religion (which i believe is against the tos) and made light of in a rather tasteless way real world terrorism and suicide bombings. suicide ganking people is a valid game mechanic, and while i don't really agree with the rampent suicide ganking of jihadswarm, is was the 'jihad' part of it that crossed the line, not the gankings themselves."
"jihad is arabic for holy war. it's a language and a literal translation. shoot us for engaging in a little role play. what else would one call a planned string of suicide bombings in the name of god?"
"i thought that jihad actually means 'struggle'. as to an alternative name, you could have used several.crusade comes to mind as one example. \"the goon crusade\" has a nice ring to it."
"people really need to stop being so uptight. this is a game where people murder other people multiple times a day and you're getting annoyed with a word?"
"rp is based upon eve, not rl. if you wanted a term for a 'holy war' that fits in eve, you could have used 'reclaiming.'and yes, i believe jihad more accurately means 'a struggle,' (maybe specifically one related to faith, i'm not sure). or so i am told.it's not so much the word per se, but the context in which they were using it and the other real world religious associations they used."
"dune borrowed heavily from middle eastern words and contexts. if you choose to read too deeply into a situation that's your uptight problem. assigning intentions to people based on your personal perceptions is silly."
"avalloc is a pretty ok dude."
"what part of mechanics did you miss?the core game mechanics regarding mining are still* target roid/cloud* activate harvest module* pick your nose and wait for your cargo hold to fill upwhich is boring and stupid as there is no interesting interaction that makes people want to remain at the keyboard.i think this youtube video illustrates the problem perfectly."
"well, by that logic pvp hasn't changed at all since release either then.- target player/npc- activate weapons- pick your nose till target diesedit: i'm not saying that mining doesn't get boring, i'm contesting where you've said that mining mechanics have not changed at all since release."
"that is true, however the core game mechanics of combat are more complex as they involve:* range and maneuvering* capacitor power* ammunition choice* ew, webs, scrams* (in)ability to disengagewhich results in a game loop which requires user interaction and constant decission making. opposed to mining, i highly doubt that there are people that alt-tab out during a combat situation.in addition, pvp has more interesting secondary mechanics such as the factional warfare system and sovereignty mechanics, while mining only has the logistics to haul the ore somewhere where it can be processed and sold/used, which are not really that interesting eh?"
"so you don't have anything to say about:or are they not a change to the complexity of mining mechanics?"
"nope as the core mechanics are still the same.the only thing that slightly changed game mechanics is hidden belts / exploration, but that's a small secondary, just like rorqual compression had a tiny impact on the logistics mechanics.mining crystals and gang links certainly have no impact on game mechanics - if the game requires you to kill someone by swinging a sword, the damage range of the sword itself has nothing to do with the game mechancs, likewise there is no difference in mechanics between mining in a hulk with stripminers or in an ibis with a nooblaser.if players were allowed to constantly modulate the mining beam and this had an impact on the resources obtained, that would be a change to the mechanics. (just an example)"
"ok, so you've now admitted that there have been changes, but i see that you feel that they [hidden belts, rorquals, mining gang links, crystals] represent only 'tiny' changes to mining mechanics. i don't agree you there, but opinion is opinion after all.i'd like you to consider the reasons people choose to mine. do you think they do it because they find it 'boring'? i don't think so, and i don't think you would either. let's analyse this (thankfully a schedule change has freed my morning up )what i say from here is based on personal experience - which can vary. one may consider that mining's lack of labour-intensive demands is something that might attract some of its adherents. when i was a new pilot i used to mine, and many miners i met used to view the long ops as a social activity \"crack open a beer and listen to the radio\". others, due to health reasons, didn't want to experience high levels of stress while playing eve. from that point of view, mining can be a relaxing past-time.now, looking at the changes to the mining mechanics, i view them as significant changes. why? when i was miner, i was always trying to get the most yield out of my time. t2 mining lasers, t2 strip miners, t2 crystals, gang links, barges, exhumers...these all extended the goals i saw as a miner, giving someone something better to want. when the rorqual was introduced, i wasn't a miner. however, i know of many people who have spoken its praises. it helps miners have 'ninja' mining ops in potentially hostile 0.0. space. it reduces the logistics load. now, i appreciate that you think this is a 'tiny' change, but i think this is a significant improvement to the profession.relevant to a previous post of yours: it is important to note that the prices of minerals have also increased significantly since i started mining. this can only mean good things for a miner, right? to preserve these high prices, scarcity is key. thus keeping the best minerals in a position where they are more challenging to extract is a logical way of rewarding the miners with the most initiative.regarding exploration, which you also said was a tiny change. like the guys who made this video, i've found that finding hidden mining belts is well worthwhile. it can give a miner in empire access to 0.0. quality ores. if you still think that's a minor change that doesn't represent a significant change since release...just wanting to point out that kind of change would make mining more labour intensive. are you sure that the miners you are claiming to represent want this?"
"that is not what i said.i said that mining links and crystals have no - zero - nada impact on game mechanics as yield is not part a part of game mechanics any more than the color of your ship is. in a first person shooter, the core game mechanics are running aiming and shooting stuff, it's the game loop which a player is in most of the time. whenether the player has a pistol or a minigun does not affect the core game mechanics. if the player gets a portal gun which changes the running and aiming aspects of the game, then it will have an impact.hidden belts and rorquals have no - zero - nada impact on the mining core game mechancs, but a slight impact on secondary game mechanics, as they affect the actions before and after the mining process is initiated.i understand that you're not a game designer though so i'll try to go easy on you. :)i don't deny that at all, back in the days when i still mined i liked being able to alt-tab out and do other stuff.that's not a change to the mining mechanics itself though. i'd say that would fall under progression.of course that made a chance, just not a change to the core game mechanics.it was giving this as example to illustrate what exactly a change to the core game mechanics would be, i said no-where that i wanted to make this specific change. any change to the core game mechanics would likely be an increase in iteraction though, as it couldn't get much less than it is now. i would agree that we shouldn't change the game mechanics from boring to tedious and boring though, and for this reason interactivity could be constructed in an optional fashion.i got to go now, meeting with a client in an hour, got a game to sell... :)"
"yup, you're right - i'm not a game designer in rl like yourself. i'm sorry for getting bogged down in the semantics of 'game mechanics' versus 'progression'. perhaps, since most people who read the forums aren't game designers like yourself, you could use your knowledge of the terminology (when you use it) to specify for philistines such as myself that the changes i listed were not changes to the 'game mechanics' - even though they made stark changes to the profession.indeed. perhaps it's not the 'mechanics' that are the problem, maybe the 'progression'?i look forward to seeing your ideas on 'increasing interaction in an optimal fashion'. i really hope you know what miners want. good luck with selling your game, i'll strike up some chats with miners and discuss these ideas."
"i see you haven't seen the \"how to run missions in a dominix\" guide.it works like this:1. aggro mobs2. release drones, engage drones3. go afk for 20 minutes4. profit.there is no way to fix mining into a system that resembles pvp since there is no way to add unexpected changing variables.i think it is also quite funny that you also say you want larger roids and more roids in order to \"fix\" mining, when all that does is reduce the number of things you have to do when mining.any system you create will devolve into monotony when the pattern is discovered. players will be unwilling to participate in more complex mechanics[after all, i can read forums while i mine], if it does not come with increased rewards, and said increased rewards will ruin the risk associated with various areas of space."
"my intention of the question was to boost roids so that you don't have to pop 9 roids to fill your cargo. (but i see that many probably misinterpreted it.)"
"may i remind you that this isn't wow, and there aren't any swords here?in your discussion of mechanics, you have overlooked the economic impact on markets (and hence on many areas of eve) of increased yield or larger volumes of minerals available (from increasing size of droids). supply and demand dictate prices for minerals. more supply, same demand = a fall in mineral prices. hence, mining becomes less profitable. some fix eh?mining in high sec doesn't need any boosts. what needs to happen is that industrial activities like mining need to be made more attractive in the vast areas of low sec that are way under-utilised. mining solo is a little tedious...better to also look at ways to encourage gang-mining and such (like gang-derived mining bonuses), which also makes sense if you want to encourage low-sec mining (for better ores).take care,arithron"

"guys, this whole idea is just crap, will be hard to implement, and will be complicated to use.simple solution: loot theft (ie, looting by anyone other than the pilot who was shot, or his corp) results in the looter becoming flashy to everyone for 15mins, and can't jump, dock for a brief period in accordance with standard aggro rules.edit: obviously, salvage remains free-for-all"
"this is drivel. utter drivel.you make utter spurious claims (e.g. blasterthron doesn't need webs, or that torps cant match blaster damage (hint, they can do more now following the rage boost, at still four times the range). then you selectively edit history to try and claim that missiles have been repeatedly nerfed - and leave out all the immense boosts they got along the way as well:1) the fact that missiles got special t2 ammo to murder small stuff, and had their velocities and range massively improved by the first rebalance.2) the ridiculously overpowered nature of javelin torps when they were introduced3) the introduction of hams 4) the insanely long range of javelin hams when they were first introduced5) the torp rof buff giving them near-blaster damage at six times the range.6) the rage missile buff in quantum riseif you put that together with your list of nerfs and guess what, they've had dozens of balance changes over the years in both directions.you can whine away about the last changes, but its not in the slightest bit relevant. you need to adapt, because everyone else, particularly blaster and ac pilots, is doing the same. we all lobbied for a better balance than what went live, in the weeks and months before. some changes were made, many not. now we live with what we've got, and there's absolutely no reason why the perfectly reasonable missile changes wouldnt stay if everything else does."

"sur, the nerf is too strange for the caldari.raven with cruise vs angel bs have more dps that raven torp vs angel bs.it's very strange.caldary is the bad race in pvp, if it's the bad race in pve, what are we going to do ?signed"

"why does everyone always say \"torps got boosted\" after quantum rise?it only got a 6.67% increase over the old damage, in exchange for increasing the explosion radius from 540m to 650m. thats over 15%, not exactly scaled with the damage increase isnt it?this means you now do less damage with a standard rage torp boat fitting because the damage given per m of sig radius is decreased.now, to the losers who say \"fit a painter!\" are utterly clueless - one always fitted a painter on a rage torp boat, but now post-qr you need 2 painters for most battleship hull sigs to match your torps explosion radius. please note, painters do get a stacking penalty on your target.please bear in mind that torpedoes do not benefit from crash boosters, missile precision skill or the radius reduction rigs.also, this is not taking into account the fact that your battleship targets can easily ab, or just naturally, speedtank your torps for a significant reduction in damage. this thus necessitates the use of dual webs (to be fair though, one should makedo with one).torps have not been boosted in any way. if you call increasing the damage by a measly 6.67% a \"boost\" whilst disregarding the unproportional increase in explosion radius then you suck.so post-qr, if you stick with the same rage torp setups, you will do less damage. \"adapt!\" is what people say, but it's somewhat difficult to fit 2 painters and 2 webbers on shield tanking ships.yes, this isn't a solo game but i shouldn't need support ships or so many support modules to use t2 high damage ammo against ships of the same class - bs vs bs.i don't see megathrons needing as many support modules to utilise t2 high damage ammo effectively against battleship targets.edit: by accident, i posted with my alt, my main is ursaemajoris, in case any of you were going to try that argument-dismissing-\"post with your main\" crap."
"you did actually flyed and tested caldari missile boats before and after the patch with proper skills, and claiming all those points or just making estimations with what you are hearing around?i personnaly see the obvious difference by flying those ships before and after the patch and seriously when u say \"murdering small stuff\" or \" overpowered nature \" etc. its like we are playing different games and talkin about different things..."
"this tbfh /threadto all those eft warriors who dont fly the ships and just saw a damage % increase... then try to state that torps got a boost.and testing the supposed torp boost. take a raven w/ t2 torp launcher: fire 1 t1 em torp at a bs not moving w/ no mods, then fire 1 t1 rage torp at a bs. let alone the bs moving w/ out a ab. hell now w/ the same revelant lvl 4 specialization skill do the same with a 1 cruise launcher. do the t1 cruise then do the t1 fury. after that compare the t1 torp to the t1 cruise the t1 cruise to the t2 torp and vice versa. then start moving the bs again.the results are eye opening"
"firstly its not driveli pointed out that the different ways missiles have been nerfed over the years.i pointed out caldari ship now have a lesser tank due to the nerf.i pointed out that missiles do a lesser max damage than any other weapon type.at no point have i said the blaster boat nerf was reasonable. so stay in your own thread."

"dearie dearie me, get a clue. missiles were fine - except from the speed cliff.good dps, excellent force projection, shield tanked ships with full room for damage mods.now the speed cliff has been removed and all you do is whine cluelessly because you don't do full damage to an mythical abing cruiser.khemal, you've been on sisi, you've tested the cerberus. you've seen that it's now able to kill any interceptor, or drive away any fast cruiser. how are you coming to such absurd conclusions?"
"i don't know him but i've been on sisi, i don't think you can kill anything using only a cerberus. you need support to scram / web / tp / etc.i'm telling that pre qr, caldari ships needed less support (less meds of your gang) to reach 100% dmg. it's a fact.pre qr a cerb with support of only 1 web was able to do full dmg to every ship in game. with only one module.4now you need much more meds to achieve 100% dmg. do not be surprise if ppl is not happy with this patch."
"well this missle nerf has pretty much gutted an account i have worked on for months. when a manticore can barely dent the shields of an assault ship i have to say i may as well just cancel that account and start over( sorry but that will not happen i will waste my time elsewhere ). this nerf has made my caldari pilot somewhat of a joke as now i need to go and spend weeks, probably months training skills to compensate. in a war dec i as pretty much now a permanant ew boat or repper. from a sales standpoint aweseome job you just created a program that if i want to enjoy my character i need to pay you more money to train up just to get back to where i was before the nerftime is money, this nerf has ruined 8 months of patience and gameplay, seriously considering just going to another rpg that rewards players for loyalty, not waste it. this was not a well tested change in my opinion and i have played many rpg on line , the good ones actively for 7 years now adn none have ever made me feel like i may as well just cancel the account because of a game patch or upgrade.i have played another rpg from its birth and when a major change like this occours at least they allow you to \"'respec\" you character so that situations like thes never occour, and hey they have gotten my money for 6 years to play. is that not the purpose for the game creators, it is a business afterallwell sorry long winded, but i am so disapointed this may very well be my last post and i cancel my account and look elsewehre good luck all adn fly safe!!"

"tbqh, i can understand the frustration of training missile skills and then having the system change quite a bit... i have over 9mil in missiles alone and i will continue to use/train them, i suppose i will have to rethink how i play, but i am always up for a challenge, maybe this patch/nerf will make t2 missiles more widely used, before qr i didn't really see a reason to use t2 ammo, but now t2 cruise can hit ceptors, not a lot of dmg, but it's funny none the less. as for having the patch taken back, we all know it won't happen, ccp is considering trivial additions (any else read the thread on instruments...wtf?) however, maybe ccp should consider revising the systems for all weapon types, actually didn't have a problem with the missiles pre qr or with them now, to each his own i suppose."
"yes, skill tree queue please, and a skill tree dependency chart as well thank you."
"edit: fully agree with the ability to train a secondary skill6-hour skills are simple to handle. leave a long-training skill going when you aren't playing. when you log in, switch to training the 6-hour skill. when you log off, switch back to the long-running skill. you'll chisel away at that 6-hour until it finishes while you're playing. i do this all the time and it works great.that said, i do like the idea of training two skills simultaneously at 1/2 speed, and i would certainly use that feature if implemented."
"this game has a steep enough learning curve and high enough barrier to entry without adding extra hurdles/annoyances. a skill queue of some kind would make things a tad easier.if i wanted more micromanagement in my life i'd just go to work and get paid for it--paying $15 a month for the privilege...no, thanks."
"enlighten me pls"
"i would like to suggest that the slots for turrets and bays be directly linked to high slots, so that when fitting a ship, a pilot can arrange his weaponry as desired, and be sure that the next time he visits a station or reconnects to the game, the weapons on the ship won't be randomly rearranged. i know this is not a performance issue, but it does directly affect the aesthetics of the game, by affecting the appearance of the ships.as an example of what i mean, take a punisher and fit it with any two identical lasers and a rail gun. as the game operates now, the weapons are randomly distributed on the ship, and the distribution changes each time the ship re-loads, whether from logging in, going through a jump gate, or visiting a station. what i am suggesting is a change so that, once you establish where you prefer your weapons to be mounted on your ship, they remain in those locations, no matter how often you connect to the game or visit a station.(yes, this is the same suggestion i made in features and ideas. a gm suggested i should post in both places, to get twice the visibility for the suggestion, as he felt it had merit, but gms don't have any direct ties to the devs.)"

"proposal: extra trading skill.when a caracter has all the skills that allows you set (more) orders on the market, the maximum number possible is 305. this includes the skill tycoon at lvl 5. a first impression may be that this is a high number, but for a player that realy likes to trade and is playing the markets, it isn't. to realy play the markets of eve one needs many orders more. now, of course one can also use, to a certain extend, contracts. but this is only possible/practical for a limited amount of more expensive items. and contracts are not as flexible as market orders. an other alternative is the use of alts. however, using an alt has a serious drawback, one has to log in and out all the time. this is annoying for a player. but i suspect logging in and out all the time also put a strain on the servers computation resources. and more active traders results in more competition on the market, so more players can get better deals. so the best solution would be to add an extra skill so one caracter can generate more orders.jeancolbert"
"you mean setting up 305 buy orders in jita asking for a stuff for some silly prices, and then setting other orders selling it back for a higher price. thats why there is to much money in hisec.procuders have 11 slots at max, market manipulators have 305 market orders, miners have 3 strip miners on their hulks and cnr empire carebears have 7 missile slots. deal with it, want more slots = train more chars."
"i totally agree with you mira, i have a whole container full of bpo/bpc and i have to click on each and every one to find out which are my copies. i would think that ccp could just change the icon that represents the copies to either include a small c on it, or just change the overall color of the whole thing. i wonder if ccp could put something in the database that could recognize the bpc and alter the icons appearence at the database level, say all bpc's have an identifying number that the database attributes to adding 63% yellow hue to the image to make bpc's a greenish color (or whatever color they deem bpc's should be). or just try and organize your bpo/bpc's until they fix it...hehe, i guess i should do that one of these days as well."

"weird, suggested something similar tonight on another thread on ninja salvagers...here is what i posted:ninja salvager should not be aggro'd for clearing wrecks.chances are the ns will trigger the red flag anyway by stealing some juicy loot from a wreck. i personally start destroying the wrecks if a ns shows up and i feel upset about it (ie, haven't had a chance to open them to look at loot!). however, it often depends if i can be arsed or not...most lvl 4's i don't salvage or check loot at all.i guess a way to make it more difficult for the ns, but still allow it to be a viable profession, would be to make the ns have to scan for the mission runner every time the mr uses a gate at deadspace site.it still doesn't stop 'baiting' by ns for the mission runner to attack them. just last night i had one return after his frigate was 'accidently' destroyed, in a pvp ship (obviously with the intention of trying for my mods on domi). however, this was quite fun really :) i'd hate to stop such excitement and chances at pvp just because missions are seen as isk earners...it should be difficult to earn...i don't agree with you regarding ns being locked out altogether of a deadspace site. deadspace is just a way of generating the mission...it should still be scannable (or the mission ships should be) and available for characters to enter who aren't associated with the mission. it livens things up a little, and who ever stated that missions should be major isk-generating activities with low risk?arithron"
"you say low-risk and yet you obviously ignored the fact that npc's shoot to kill.: o ) ironic.not to mention that ns's have literally zero-risk."
"actually, if you are doing missions in a decent fitted ship, missions low risk :) a ns has same risks as anyone flying into a belt/deadspace area where there are npc. he also has to deal with the mission-runner, and if he triggers a red flag, he runs a high risk of losing ship. of course, he has to first scan down the site (so you get a head start on the deadspace as you get an auto bm).just because you trigger the mission, it doesn't automatically give you ownership of everything within the deadspace. npc rats are npc rats...anyone can warp into the deadspace and kill them, if they can find the deadspace. you get rewarded for the mission by the agent- loot and salvage a bonus, that you may get if no one scans down site before you loot everything.arithron"
"never had anyone flip my can to get agro in 0.0, they just kill you straight out.seriously, according to the backsstory of the game- everything you do has danger-risk-consequences associated to it in space. that's why i play. i have been can flipped tons of times, and no i don't like it, but that's the risk of mining anywhere in this game. suggestions-join a corp that offers some security for their minersuse a gscget an alt that can warp in and close the dealchange your subscription to second life and cry no more"
"qfe on this. im not a can flipper i have a miner alt that doesnt can mine unless we have a mining op. its a mechanic i find part of the game that makes it interesting and adds."
"it could also be cool to see also some sort of \"micro\" governements inside alliances. i mean, still in the \"adding content in 0.0 alliances\" purpose why not create some tools for corps / players to manage their global assets (poses, mobiles bases or whatever you could imagine) ? you could directly though such \"governements\" make some products illegal, set laws that could flag pirates (or any other kind of player if you are a kind of a pirate alliance, why not), etc. maybe a bit ambitious though, but your idea made me think to that raw concept. well, btw that is something i have always wanted to see in sov places, some tools to manage standings easily, some tools to get overlays of your assets, some tools to get closer to the \"alliances = growing empires\" concept.what do you think of that ?"
"yup, this is along the line of ideas i want to work on/with. giving alliances the ability to set certain 'laws' is something i've been looking at, but the concept is still very open. let me share with you how far i think we can take this...i've been working on the idea of 'nation states', where sovereignty is at a level higher than alliances. this would work somewhat if several alliances wished to 'co-govern' space without merging. in such a setup, there would be the option of allowing 'citizens' rather than the current system 'pets', whereby any member of the eve community who isn't on bad terms can apply to become 'citizen' of the bespoken 'nation state', and thus pay taxes to the 'nation state' coffers and be given docking rights/standings automatically. this works more realistically and fairly, in my opinion, than the current rent-standings method, which i also think is also more labour intensive. allowing the game to support the empire building it has gone so far to advertise would be consistent with where i think eve is going.now, coming back to the 'laws'. suppose this is linked with citizenship? e.g. make a trade order of a certain good in one of our stations and you automatically lose your citizenship. npc in a certain system and you lose your citizenship. these are just hypothetical examples, i admit that they may be impractical from a programming/game balance pov, so please stay open-minded with regards to them. where could the nation state lead us to? perhaps it could be the precident of nation-states forming relations with the existing npc empires? perhaps it could be a platform for a real form of empire 'government', which could perhaps be democratically elected? food for thought."

"boondock, try some low sec sites ;)"
"this only happens if the quantity supplied increase for each individual is lower than than the price reduction.eve has proven to be a very inelastic system, an increase in mining yields would mean more profits for the majority of miners. an increase in the fun of mining may mean less profit/hour, but it would be made up for in the fact that mining was more fun[and so people would likely do it longer]if you're going to claim an economic reason, at least get it right."
"hehe sorry about that.i did not mean to say that mining has not changed at all since eve's launch, when i referred to the core game mechanics i meant the game mechanics that lay at the fundament of mining (target roid, activate lasers, wait for hold to fill), and everything that is slapped on top of mining is not core game mechanics because if you remove it all, mining would still work and still be the same.yes and no. i think the mining progression has already gotten a lot of attention in the form of lots of new mining related ships and modules, do we need more of that? i don't think so.on the other hand, the players often do not progress to areas with better ore in them. a mining barge has a smaller chance of surviving on its own in lowsec/0.0 than a frigate with a mininglaser slapped onto it, for example, thus it is not a good idea to take your shiny new stuff there. you can do high-sec exploration, though.i think we need more discussion with miners first, but one of the things that could be done is that mining beam modulation, which is optional as you dont have to keep it modulated, but will extract more/better ore or have a chance of gaining rare resources if you do.missions are not pvp last time i checked, and it was pvp we were talking about.and why can't a computer introduce unexpected changing variables to the equation?as if people really want to spend time looking for a belt that has not yet been mined dry?i don't see the problem here, any changes could simply be optional, and there could be rewards associated with it, and there could be better rewards in low-sec/0.0...and i don't see why it couldn't be completely dynamic so there is no direct pattern."

"of course i've tested it, i have top-end missile and gunnery skills.you totally missed the point ofc, most of those changes were in the last four years - not quantum rise. try reading the acutal post.whoever whined abotu rages - you confound your own errors by repeatedly saying \"with the same setup\" - newsflash - you need to change your setups. everyone else has had to do the same with the patch. the fact is that your max dps has gone up, again. you can whine \"its eft dps, its theoretical!!\" but that is true of all weapons - considering how frequently people need to fight in falloff, or get out-tracked. you actually need to put effort into acheiving that dps, not just train skills to 5 then press f1-f8, and now that's true for missiles too.so what? get used to it, thats how the game should be."
"i am the op1.) yes i agree that missiles should have been hit to limit the amount of damage done to smaller targets.2.) yes, every weapon has different tactical advantages and disadvantages.3.) no one told any of us which race to pick or how to train our characters, your choices were your own, missile or turret.4.) each race has specific strengths and weaknesses, you chose it yourself at the begining of the game.5.) not everyone uses rage missiles- the nerf in general is a negative effect for all missile users, caldari, or minmatar. 6.) blasters have a higher rof, missiles have a longer range, blaster have a higher ammo capacity, missiles do more damage per round, blah blah blah. it makes no difference when you compair them they're different for a reason. in general now, if you want to compair, 9/10 times, missiles fall short of thier counter parts.7.) i fly caldari, minmatar, and gallente ships, yes i know what i'm talking about. i will be posting formulas later in the evening."
"newsflash, you missed the point of my argument - yes rage torp users do obviously have to adapt just like every other battleship pilot but what i'm arguing about (and this is the point you missed out on) is that rage torp users need a lot more support/support modules to adapt/compensate for the changes introduced in qr than other races' battleship counterparts for bs vs bs fights. \"your max dps has gone up...\" again that is only a 6.67% more dps than the old pre-qr damage which is nothing to brag about when youre getting an explosion radius increase of 110m (over 15%).do other t2 high damage ammo-using battleships have to equip 4 ewar modules to be able to do full damage (or at least more damage than t1 or faction ammo to make rage ammo even worth using/training for) against other battleships? dual webs required to prevent them from speedtanking the ridiculously small explosion radius of torps and dual painters to bring the signature radius up to rage torpedoes' awfully large explosion radius."
"you forgot amarr, yet only ones complaining are the missionrunning caldari carebears. you are stupid because you just think about your missiles. you should actually sit in something like a vaga or interceptor, attack a drake or cerberus and see how much the missiles hurt, even when orbiting with 4.5k/sec. it is not only unfair for caldari to be the only ones hitting the newly nerfed speed ships ( as you did before the patch ), but you want to do even more damage to them? while other races dont hit them at all ??? you should come out of your missionhub and should look how missiles actually hurt all the smaller ships. you should stop collecting numbers outgame and actually get in the game, play the other races and see how much missiles hurt now. no, you dont. you seem to not have a clue about other races ships at all."

"i guess you can do missions even in lowsec."
"only 6.67%? thats a huge damage increase, considering that void, conflag and to a lesser extent hail didn't get the same love,and are still useless compared to faction am/mf/emp.you dont seem to understand rages at all - its a bonus ammo, for use when you can - e.g. instead of whining you desperately need two painters, why not choose rage when you're fighting one of the bigger bs - tier 3, marauders, for which you only need one painter. as for \"needing two webs\" - this is only true versus afterburner bs. how many of those do you really think we';ll see on tq? precious few, and yes, you should be worse against those, because they're chosen to lose their ability to get through a bubble/back to a gate/in range just to speed tank your torps. 1 60% web vs any other bs either mwd or slowboating will allow rages to hit for full damage. due to the new formula, mwding with high sig elimintes your damage loss due to speed as its now based on a ratio of speed:sig.so you only need one web and one painter for faction torps, one web and two painters for rage, on most bs targets. some may require just 1 and 1. its hardly a difficult thing to acheive, especially with the absolute rarity of bs 1v1s.as for the other t2 high-damage ammo - it depends on the ship, beause different turrets perform differently at that range. certainly with blasters you need at least a dual web, if not triple, to get void better than t1 am, let alone faction, because crippling your range and tracking isnt so difficult. but even though you need 3 mods on a blaster ship to hit max on void, and you need 3 mods on a torp ship to hit max with rage, i dont think its fair to compare because nobody uses void, and it didnt get the luxury of being improved like rages did.you keep on ranting about how you have it so difficult, but the fact is you got benefits with your nerfs, too. where you lost out was on easy-mode: just firing and forgetting. now you need to be a bit cleverer, like a turret pilot, in where you put your ship and locking down your opponent. this is how it should be.at the end of the day, what is this thread about? i hear lots of ranting, but the actual op says something along the lines of \"revert this nerf\" - ie. just go back to the stats from pre-patch. could that possibly be serious? i mean, missiles would be so insanely overpowered in qr without these changes"
"well, im galentte, i dont agree with the nerfing of any caind, in fact i consider that other things should b created to contradict a overpowering issue, like it appends in nature:\"fox its to fast for rabbit! natures reply: ups, lets nerf is legs...\"owever, ive tryed t1 standard missiles in enyo gallente af, and i found out, even with out any weapon upg fitted in low slot, thing that all caldari ship can easely do due to any tanking restrictions,the damage dealt by this low skilled gun (less than 1 m sp) was at least as effective than my highly skilled (9 m sp) t2 rail or light t2 (5m sp).in fact i know people that can passive tanking trough any |v|3 mission in caldari bc, that is impracticable with any gallente bc. in fact, gallente drone bay ships have theyr drone bays nerfed, and now with qr, medium drones tracking as well. drone skill training for a gallentian was mandatory to complement tower gunns tracking and range issues.so, its bad but fare if missiles and explosion velocity its nerfed, i have same problems with rails against smaller ships and i have to use webers.so, if and wen i use missiles, (that can select damage type, by the way) ll b using webers... and drones. every caldari use drones wen mining, so use the overpowered raven and drake drone bays to use some weber drones, do some active tanking and put web in middles as well instead of whining about. every time someone complains about something, all of us get nerfed..."
"a change to the qr missile change has my (amarrian!) support.that change was, while needed in a certain way, over the top. simple as that.up the explosion velocity again by 100 to 300% from current values and we should be ok and be able to adapt enough without feeling being completely hit by the big bad nerf st...*errmhh*...hammer.don't feel like argueing more about it here as well, we do that enough at the moment ig."
"signedccp has put down missiles so much that are now useles in pvp.they did umbalancing the game."
"missile changes are fine. because of the speed changes on all ships in the game, if they were left unbalanced then it would be caldari \"i win button\" more than what it is.get over it."
"plz tell me that you are caldari and made a few tests already after the patch and surprise me!!why ppl talk about things that they dont have a clue?? ccp : plz take take 2 sama skilled char and test (raven for a start with 2 of the fallowings-> point/web/speed mod ) vs other race bs's.. then lover the other race chars sp and make the same test again. you will notice that the result wont change!! we are unable to kill anything who is smart enough to move around abit.. our dmg become worthless.."

"sign, ccp do it now"
"that is completely false... as a new player with practically only 3hour and 6 hour skills, i was missing training time a lot. now that i have lots of multi-day skills, i miss training time a lot less."
"i am against this speed reduction.at least base ship speed should be like it was.vindicator now has a base speed of 105m/s."
"funny, at the same time you are complaining about changes that came with the nerf. enjoy your missiles now ?you too, haha have fun with missiles."
"there should be no limit to the training time... ccp forget that a large portion of their subscribers have jobs! i've probably at the moment in time got about 15 skills with between 1 hour and 6 hours training left that i just can't get around to training!a primary/secondary system would work better, so before i got to work/bed/whatever, i can leave my primary skill as something with a few days to train, and put my secondary as one of those hour-long skills i have... get that finished, and the next day do the same, i'll be able to finish off loads then! current method of training is fubar."
"i am also one of the people realy convinced that even the most modest form of skill queue (1 to 2 slots) would enhance the managing of skills while not being online in a major way. i regularly miss 4 hours of research, or just end up researching skills that are at that moment totaly irrelevant, just because i cant be online in time to do the research on those skills i realy need to have...i dont see what the problem or objection could possibly be against a 1-2 slot skill queue"
"check this out.according to entity this is a really old picture. but god, it's so much easier to actually figure out what's going on. it shouldn't take all that much resources to do and it would decrease the amount of mistakes people make when they by accident reprocess stuff(hi verone?) or trash it.i see no reason why it shouldn't be done. thus, ccp should do this with \"true exploration\" along with the ui being reworked."

"i live in and around the drone regions and recently had the good fortune of finding my first 'faction' drone bpc in an exploration site. now, i've been living here a while, and these seem to be relatively rare, so i though 'great, i've found a nice valuable bpc that is worth the time it took to find it\". wrong! the drone bpc i found (5 x 'integrated' warrior) is actually worse than t2, and is only worth about 1 million isk. not only this, but all 'integrated' drones are only slightly better than their t1 counterparts. now, these are meant to be faction drones, but only the 'augmented' ones (which are almost impossible to find) are actually better than t2.this would all be fine if there was other stuff to get in the drone regions, but no. there are only 3 things you can ever find out here: minerals, 'faction drone bpc's, and the parts needed to make them. now, since almost all of the bpc's are worth little more than 1 million isk, the parts needed to make them are almost worthless too. this leaves us with the total useful exploration content in the drone regions: minerals... great.now, all other 0.0 regions have regular spawns worth anything up to billions of isk from bpc's. the most you can get in the drone regions is a few hundred million from an 'augmented' bpc, but having asked around the alliance very few people have ever found one of these. this just feels like a total joke in terms of exploration, since it is actually more worthwhile to just rat and collect the minerals, rather than probing them out.anyone who agrees that this needs to be improved significantly please support this topic."

"being a trader myself, juggling with 301 orders (with my main ), i can see the reason behind this proposal.300 orders are a ways insufficient - if you play more than one region... considering being present in one core region's market only, 305 orders are enough.the positives of possible order raises:-traders can \"control\" more goods on the market, it's their profession, they can expand their game-urrhm...none else that can't be countered, reallythe downsides of a possible raise:-starting traders won't ever be able to compete by finding their until-then-neglected niche.-the rich get even richer - ok, that's why a trader is a trader after all *capitalsim-yarrr*-as a result of rising influence of few on the markets (speak: monopolism) prices would skyrocket, driving off younger ones that aren't even interested in trading (but have to rely on it anyways)every pilot in eve is relying on a healthy market. the downsides outweigh the single positive reason by far, so even while i would personally wish for more orders myself as well you won't find me supporting this proposal.(interestingly enough, you didn't support it yourself )nay."

"i see a reoccurring pattern with the trolls in this thread. they feel that since they had to walk to school uphill both ways in the snow with no shoes, the newer players have to as well. clearly this is flawed and ultimately selfish reasoning.some of the trolls even fear new players climbing into battleships right off the bat. a very silly fear when one thinks about it. scared of a newbie who's on equal footing as you? really?i fully support a reduced training time. though i somewhat dispute the specific reduction posted. imo, i believe skill training times should never be longer than ten days. either that or a different method of training would be preferable. anything rather than logging in, starting a skill, and turning off the computer for two weeks.if ccp is serious about getting newer players into the eve universe, the odds against them should not be so drastically hopeless. a guppy in an ocean filled with hungry predatory sharks? come on now.*edit* and i see trolls claiming eve will turn into wow if the game eases new players into the game. isn't that in the best interest of ccp? more paying customers? you can criticize blizzard, but by setting the entry bar relatively low, it encourages newer players to stick with it, giving them goals that are reasonably challenging yet are not discouragingly impossible.this is why wow is the 11 million playerbase mmo juggernaut. this is also why eve is not. not even close. ccp could rake in some serious cash if they wanted. the mmo playerbase is desperate for a decent sci-fi mmo. unfortunately eve online doesn't fit the bill because of its steep learning cliff that so often bars and discourage new players."
"50% flat reduction is a little overboard but i think ccp need to boost new characters with additional learning skills yet again (like they did in rmr).character progression is supposed to be rewarding, but there is nothing rewarding about training skills that just make your other skills train faster. it feels like a painful waste of time but every single character is forced to do it if they are going to skill at all."
"i think we should be the first game community to get past using the \"don't make this wow\" quote when ever anyone posts something you don't like. anyway, i think a small hike would not be a horrible thing. or perhaps something else in game that would give a slight boost. make us earn it, but make it available. i'm sure it was much worse in the beginning, but just because you \"had it rough\" doesn't mean everyone else should too. besides, training times were slower but there was also less to train for. with all that has been added to the game over the last few years people will still need to specialize and spend time on support skills to really fly the ships they choose. the idea is to find a happy medium between keeping existing players and attracting new ones. the extremely long training times are one of the major reasons a lot of players leave before they ever really get started. but yes 50%=game destruction imo"
"its and idea but noits ok for the new players but what about the veterans they have trained these skills for years and then the skill gets cut in half there gunna be enoyed that noobs can train the vets skills in half the time it took them"
"if you are gonna give me 45 million skill points to distribute can i get a free titan skill book too please.sorry mate but your idea sucks. i know long training times are boring, wait till you want to max out marauders or all four races dread's to level 5 then you know boring ;-)"
"skill training times need to be reduced by alot. over the years things have got out of hand. it used to be that no item or ship required anything higher then a skill at lvl 4. when they brought in tech 2 things got silly.im surprised at all the people claiming the time delay is a good thing. i wonder how many of them have learning skills and implants?my opinion is that being able to train some of those prerequisite skills to lvl 5 while i was taking a break from the game made the whole situation almost bearable.ccp's new pay to train policy is the straw that broke the camel's back."
"no they are directly related. with ghost training, and a skill que, people would be able to train for an incredibly long time without paying. now there is no ghost training, so that is no longer an argument against a skill que. paying customers have every right to some for of a que."
"there is no such thing as training boredom. you are bored. do something else while you're waiting for longish skills to train.you can't have exhausted all of your eve options during your limited time in eve. go have fun and be glad eve releases you from having to grind exp to advance your character(s).also, if you're really dismayed by a mere 3 months of training to get 3 classes of ships open to you, eve may not be for you long-term. just wait until you have only 1+ months per skill level waiting for you."
"t2 salvagers would be nice. with an increased access difficulty bonus or longer range and possibly scripts for both. i would also like to see t2 small tractor beams in addition to medium and large (more range but intended for cruiser/battleship). i would also like to see an item.. possibly modify the tractor beam interface (with scripts or something) to push an item to another ship to resupply it with ammo or other goods that it requires. this could possibly lead to an ammo supply and production ship that could make and store ammo out of range of a pos and transfer it to ships engaged in combat. hope this is the direction you are looking for tchell ( i know i went a little off subject).edit: scripts for salvagers"

"hino i was not stupid enough to get scammed and so this is not a whining thread...i am simply annoyed by these 1001 scammers in eve. they are even getting more annoying then the few isk sellers that are still alive in eve.in jita it is simply impossible to do any serious trade talk in local because of the flood of scams (offering a normal ship as navy issue, get back 10x the isk if you send me isk, selling bpcs as bpos etc).if it would be against the eula you could simply petition these idiots and after a while only serious trade chat will happen (hopefully). currently all you can do is block them, but you still see the discussions and warnings about their scams.i guess i know why it is currently not against the eula... because it will be a lot of work for ccp. but i think placing one gm into jita and watching the incoming petitions is enough... and it will get less after while... and the game fun would increase a bit.regards,zyrus"
"you obviously don't do any serious trading, or you'd already know the answer to this one. join the specific channel.others have to read posts about useless crap they don't want, so why wouldn't you? even if something is being sold as a scam, it's still a sale, and viable isk for the seller and buyer. the world is harsh place - and it's 'buyer beware'.here's an idea. make jita \"local free\", without the ability for anyone to post up in local. then, you don't have any issue."
"in soviet russia, scammers make you an eula violation!but in all seriousness, scammers have just as much right to use the market as you. i'm sure they feel that your legitimate orders are hurting their business, and would like to see you banned, but they don't go making crap threads about it on the forums. the only thing i would support would be an option not to display local chat if you don't want to read it."
"this topic is being opened anew every few weeks *sigh*ok, scammers are the social most negative bottom of the barrel of the pod pilots community.so what? if they wouldn't be hugging their personal hangar 23/7 you would hunt them down like you do with overly annoying griefers or even pirates that you have a problem with. unfortunately enough, you can't shoot anyone who's docked. bad luck....eve is about being smart enough to survive and make a living in its universe.as a result scammers have the same right of existance as anyone has who leads his/her life in eve conducting piracy (which is an essential part of our universe) or finding stuff even before someone else has lost it.as soon as \"it\" leaves the borders of this universe (=oog) it is against the eula automatically anyway...ig actions within the coc should never ever have any influence on a players account.maybe one day a system of ig trials and indictments on characters is introduced, that day the population itself would hunt these antipilots - with in-game means.until that day or a solid proposal for exactly that kind of system arrives here: nay"

"i agree that the qr patch is a failure. this is the big boost to industry they've been promising for quite some time, and what do we get out of it for us industrialists? a single new ship, redesigned haulers, and a small upgrade to fix t2 mineral hogging? sheesh, rmr and rev had more upgrades for industry than this patch does.the nano fix is needed, but i feel that ccp is swatting a fly with a nuclear bomb. the fix doesn't need to be this big - affecting 90% of the ships in the game - it just needs to fix a problem with guns/webs/etc.certifications aren't honestly all that useful, although they are a step in the right direction. needing to have mining drones (very limited value) for some of the drone/harvesting certifications is a joke, as well as needing to know both armor and shield tanking just to get a basic tanking certification.the etc trading method, while somewhat alright, has jacked the value of etcs up even higher than the previous threshold. instead of giving us new etcs to use, they instead make it so you can make more money (and give players less options) by skipping the forum system all together.i'm sorry for the long-winded whine post, but i feel that qr is a disaster of a patch, if only for the fact that it's a huge industrial patch that has little to do with industry whatsoever. while they're not going to roll it back, they do need to give us an actual industrial patch and not this half-hearted attempt. i'm hoping for a qr 2, like rev had."

"shoot someone in high sec, get concorded. flip someone in high sec, it's up to you to enforce the law. why should an aggressive act have no immediate consequences for the can-flipper other than the possibility of getting shot at? can-flippers are jonesing for a fight, often against someone inferior to them. so that their e-peen can grow. i watch them. often they will warp in with a passive targeter, ship scan, go back to station, refit, then return to flip. my suggestion is simply this: so called can-flipper should take a security hit for engaging in aggressive behavior. everyone gets to keep their cherished mechanism. like suicide ganking, the penalties will get stiffer as you transition from low sec to high sec and also based on the standing difference between the flipper and the victim."

"hello lavista and good luck on your campaign.i am hoping that this session you will champion the issues related to industry as you appeared to do the last time.i do have one particular bit of \"pork\" i am interested in:remote refining and remote reprocessing.it seems so great that i can remote purchase things like blueprints and even remote research them. i can set up a remote manufacturing orders and remote sell orders. i can even remotely manipulate the price i am requesting.to keep this process at its most efficient level, i need to purchase refined materials. it would be the grand link in the manufacturing chain to set up orders to by raw ore or mission drops and remotely refine and reprocess them. this way, with good skills, i can truly set up a trade empire that spans a region. having to travel to the purchase location of raw materials to reprocess or refine seems to water down the benefit i gain from all those remote skills. refined minerals and ice products also fit nicely into those undersized courier contracts. (but that is another issue for another day)well enough begging.good luckpatrip.s. you have my vote."
"you got one of my votes.... while i not always agree with you're views you seem to have a bit of sanity during discussions and will listen to the other side and give a well thought out responce."

"i've slogged through the numerous blogs, but have not been able to find a clear answer. perhaps it is best to ask outright:what are the candidates views on solo gameplay?"
"i'm a solo player so i might be a bit biased here, but i think solo play should be a valid strategy in eve, in pve, industry as well as pvp. the same goes for people that hang out in loose groups or small corporations. i do not think that people should be forced into large corps or alliances to be successful. of course, we cannot expect all content in eve to be accessible by solo players, but fortunately eve is a sandbox where people can set their own goals."
"can you be a bit more clear, in what capacity of \"solo\" are you asking about."
"solo play in eve is good and there are opportunities to do well. i solo play generally for missions, trading/market activities, industry and exploration. however, solo play pvp (with the expectation that you can do it all the time and win) is much harder, since many players gather in small gangs/coprs, larger corps and alliances etc. it's unrealistic to expect to be able to compete with non-solo players in pvp; ultimately you will lose if the small gang etc know their business! i don't think any players think this is unbalanced in any way...the nature of eve allows for all play styles. teamwork and cooperation mean these types of players have an advantage over solo players straight off (esp. in combat activities). it's possible to solo play all areas; it just might not be a good idea (if you worry about costs!).take care,arithron"
"i think that playing as a solo player is a perfectly valid playstyle, however, i also believe that eve is at its core a social game, and that to be among the most successful at most (there may be a few exceptions) goals and tasks you do need and should need to be part of a group -- depending upon the goal, you may need to be part of a very large group to be really successful, and this is as it should be.certainly one can have fun playing solo, and some things like missions are more suited towards solo play than others, such as pvp -- not that you cannot be successful at pvp as a solo player, but being part of a group gives you an advantage as it rightfully should. some things, such as holding territory, are and should be impossible or at least nearly impossible to achieve solo.in sum, solo play should not be discouraged or given disincentives. however, group play should be encouraged and rewarded."
"i enjoy solo piracy. but i'm not really a pirate, because i don't ransom. and i've enough money that i don't care about the loot. or losing ships. it's more about the challenge. and i'm not really alone. i run into solo fighters all the time. they're generally the people who will enter a belt and slug it out without calling for backup.in the grand scheme of things, we're not considered very important. (for instance, as a 1-man corp, i cannot even post in coad.) we hang around low-sec, as we have no means of affecting 0.0 sovereignty any way. the infrastructure of a 0.0 alliance is designed to be engaged by large fleets. there is nothing for the solo hunter to do out there.and while i believe that one person should never be able to, say, 'dismantle delve' on their own, i still believe the resourceful individual should be able to become a 'thorn in the paw' of the large 0.0 alliances.currently, this ability is reduced to sitting afk cloaked to irritate ratters. so, i felt this would be a good limitus test to determine which candidates to support."
"as a mainly solo player, i think that solo play should be given the same attention as group play. group play is currently encouraged in a few aspects, which are understandable for mining but not for pvp (with the focus on blob warfare and system sieges).ccp has hinted that they are looking for techniques to make sovereignty different, and i feel this might also include the ability to be a pita for some groups by guerrilla warfare. we'll have to see how ccp fares in the long run with this change, but i personally feel that solo play should not be discouraged or encouraged, but rather given an equal platform option."
"unfortunately for you, i do not think that this is going to be possible within the framework of eve. if you design a system by which a single individual can become a thorn in the pay of a large 0.0 alliance, then coordinated actions would be near impossible to defend against.currently, the only way that a single player can become a thorn in the side of a large 0.0 alliance is by flying under the radar, there is simply nothing that can be created, within the framework of 0.0 where anyone can attack anything anywhere for any reason, that a single player can become a hindrance to many. the many will simply group up and solve their problem by shooting it until it doesn't move.that doesn't mean there should not be things for individuals do do, but it does mean that no one will be able to design a system to do what you want without ruining the game for everyone else. they types of things that solo players are able to achieve without breaking the system mainly amount to logistics and production interdiction. these aren't changing any time soon, though hopefully we can get some sensible changes in that would increase the strength of these types of operations.in terms of promoting offensive solo play the only real and productive way to do that is to promote player activity into low-sec and the surrounding areas. in these areas, there is little to no infrastructure advantage which is what drives the main advantage in 0.0. without that advantage, solo pirates[even if they don't ransom] can thrive. it might also be possible to have npc 0.0 style with more station density, but you're looking at a lot of reward needed to draw people out there."
"sadly, i agree. though it seems silly that, to have any affect upon the political structures of eve, i must submit to becoming a faceless member of a blob (as le skunk once put it: \"part of the fc's extended dronebay\"). the individual, unless an alliance head, has no importance here.unfortunately, that means cloaky-afk games trying to pick off a ratter or miner. but understand that this is on an individual scale... the target loses a ship... but the 0.0 alliance is not hurt. given the ability to easily jump goods from empire, logistical lines cannot be harmed. only if all ice belts were removed from empire would you start seeing some gaps in the alliance armor. until that time comes, they are untouchable... and that breaks the whole risk vs. reward most pilots play lip-service to.to what purpose? we've all been in syndicate at some point. from the solo fighter perspective, it is no different than any other patch of 0.0: blobs rule this game. as long as 0.0 alliances are able to feed off empire and easily (and safely) truck the goods back to 0.0, there will never exist the ability for solo (or even wolfpacks) to damage the alliance. logistical lines are not vulnerable these days... and therefore cannot be harassed. i appreciate the responses here. thank you for taking the time to reply."
"it really depends on what you're doing. you can mission with one player, you can't conquer a region with one player. obviously, those are both necessary. you don't want to exclude people from playing because their friends aren't around, but there are some things a solo player simply cannot do. at present, i think that balance is about right - the primary forms of moneymaking are soloable, and pvp can be done solo with some success, but both generally gain in effectiveness with gangs. industry is actually far too solo-oriented, given that the only groups there outside the real high end tend to be either buddies who group for chatting or alts with 10 extra lines, but mining and combat professions are balanced basically properly between solo and group gameplay.i see what you're saying, but as was said above, there's limits in how far you can go with that. yeah, you can gank the odd hulk, but can you really justify a system whereby one player can do more than that without need for extreme amounts of player skill? any serious alliance should be able to hunt and kill one player somehow - not instantly, but effectively enough over time."
"answer this question: where do 0.0 alliances get the lion's share of their needed ice products? that's right: from empire. jumped back to 0.0 safely.nearly every candidate here has mentioned a desire to reinvigorate low-sec and support small gang warfare. i believe the answer to this is to remove ice belts from empire, restricting all ice harvesting to low-sec and 0.0.then pilots would be able to affect logistical efforts, by targeting macks and hulks in low-sec and 0.0. and then you would see increased corp presence in low-sec. large 0.0 alliances would have a tool to use against rival alliances (disrupting their supply lines) which could also be turned against them (they must protect their miners).you don't have to rewrite sovereignty mechanics. you simply have to open up some vulnerabilities in the process of fueling towers.attacking ratters does nothing to harm the target alliance. but if they were forced to (gasp) actually defend material acquisition forces... you'd see a more interesting game."
"voted for goum. don't always agree with him but he is very talented at putting together solid arguments."

"and using the word \"crusade\" isn't offensive to catholics? i hear that's what they call their holy wars. a bit less hot-button, of course, given the difference in era, but in both cases you're creating a name based on one particular religion's most common term for religious war. why is one a less-offensive alternative to the other?"

"sure there are - minmatar hics"
"there are those min ships, but i don't think that was what she was referring too :)upon reflection, and linking changes for low sec to encourage players there, i would like to see most ore types moved to low sec from empire i'm not in favour of mining becoming more low risk than it currently is in empire, or better rewards for miners that choose to stay in empire. if you want better rewards, you need to take risks...arithron"
"worst case scenario, there would be 6 months of no issues being raised to ccp that were relevant. remember that the csm raises issues and recommends solutions and priorities to ccp. ccp still make up their own mind about what to/not do.in particular when it comes to balancing the game, ccp are pretty careful and stubborn about their approach to it. what could change is the priority with which empire/0.0 were treated, which could potentially have a negative effect, but unlikely to advantage a single faction/alliance."
"it's not an issue, as the csm has no legislative power. yes, goonswarm as a political party could get every single seat on the csm, but unless they make decent decisions that the devs agree with, it's irrelevent. any more than 1 candidate for an alliance nets no advantage for the alliance. it's actually a pretty good system. the devs have an absolute requirement for the game to suceed, and if the csm aids that, all is well. if it doesn't, nothing is lost. edit: chribba got an orca today thanks to the csm giving a great case to ccp for the ship's worth. there are numerous other examples of the csm's relevance."
"apart from 0.0 politics you should vote for the one you like, the one who shares your grudges and visions, the one having ideas and knowledge about what he wants to change.get the csm out of 0.0 stuff. csm is an installation to give a more precise players view on current game mechanics so ccp can draw conclusions out of it and change the game for the better.so what matters is not 0.0 politics, its the fun for everyone playing this game.might it be goon, nc, reds, bob or whoever. vote for the guy working for the game to evolve. not for the guy boosting your ship/alliance.i am a gbc guy and voted for a goon, did so last time too. not because i like goons, but cause i like the ideas and the way my candidate presents stuff approaches issues etc.best guy for best job. if i think a certain char is representing my needs i vote for him regardless of his 0.0 affiliation.edit: chribba can have a titan to mine with. result would be more lovecans."
"i would have to say that the quantum rise patch is a step in the right direction for some things, but a travesty for otheers. the following information was already posted on a different thread, but i'll repost it here so you can see what my opinions are:"
"vote prom, i did \o/"
"seeing this quote does make me change my mind on the matter i skimmed through the thread and didn't see this until now but a change like that would be a good one and fair to both the killer and the killed."
"the problem i see with the whole situation is the fact that, if the thief was in a non npc corp their corp could be war decced and you could take action against them without concord assisting them by shooting you. i would say that these pilots who no doubt have alts in player corps are actually hiding behind the fact that you cant war dec npc corps. it is really more of a high sec issue because of that, low security doesnt have concord roaming about willing to pod you for looting the wreck of a legitamate fight."
"the fact alone that pvp wreck and npc wrecks aggro different are enough to warrant change imo.just like npc wrecks... anyone can salvage. but the l00t belongs to those who killed him. i would say it should be aggrod to the person who laid the final blow. it at least gives the l00t theives a chance, since in of itself can be considered a \"profession\" albeit not high on the totem pole of people's views.still this needs fixed/changed"
"so./me points to the gunnery skill treeright click and train."
"that's not adapting. our missiles sucked before, they suck harder now, and we want them to suck just a bit less."
"that won't work.... you have to have rationality to understand such things.^_^"
"my major problem with the whole missile adjustment and the way that has been handled is the fact that, most of the other races normally are fitting a web in a midslot and 9/10 wont be comprimising their tank, caldari ships to me are suppossed to be damage and tank ships because, we really dont have the same versatility in fittings for midslots as most webs and target painters happen to fit in midslots which is where our tank is suppossed to be, where as armour tankers have their tank in low slots. sure i would happily fit a low slot target painter or web, and happily take out a damage mod. missiles have never been a i win button in pvp, and a battleship isnt exactly a fast target and really is bigger than the barn door, so why shouldnt another battleship be able to hit for full volley damage at a stand still with no mods fitted on the ship being attacked, whether it is caldari, minnie, gallente or amarr. i dont think it should go back to what it was, but some adjustment is neccessary."
"oh only ?for pvp i only need a :scramble/disruptab/mwdwebpainter(painter)thats ony 4-5 med slots, on a shield tanking ship with 6 med slot !i got 2 uber med slot left for tank \o/is that a joke ?if ccp don't wanna change a bit (i did'nt say remove) the current nerf to missile, change the tank of caldari ship : makes them armor tank.gime caldari ship with a layout (more low slot, less med slot) that allow armor tank, and i'll stopped complaininga raven with, 4 med, 7 low would be fair."
"or low slot equivelants of webber scram painters, actually wait would it be easier just to add an extra mid slot."
"one extra mid slot for all caldari missile boatsamen!"
"both statements are correct for me. if you dont do anything about the missile nerf at least give us the possibility to web, scram, paint and have a speed without sacrifying to much tank like the other races can do without sacrifying anything...or just fix the missile nerf and leave us as we were before but at least do something.. it s obviously to much and plz if you have nothing to do in this topic but say \"yes missiles are ok as they are now, all caldari pilots should train gunnery...\", then plz go to make another topic and expose your arguements but stop spamming this one with **** for a clear readability of the problems exposed..."
"without sacrificing anything? are you stupid?they sacrifice their 3 damage mods that all medium and large caldari missile boats can fit without any issues whatsoever!thats one of the fundamental differences between shield tankign and armor tanking boats.there actually exists armor-tanking missile boats in the game, if you want to tackle+tank+missile then you need a typhoon, a sacrelidge, a vengeance, a damnation etc.if you want to shield tank missile boats, if you want to 3bcugank+missile+tank then you need to pick raven/cerb/drake/nh, and leave out the tackle. everyone whined they couldnt fit tackle+shield tank before, but accepted it and worked in gangs. now you need more support mods and you whine that you cant fit them all... solo is dead. im sorry its like this, because it sucks for other races too, (and indeed more), but if you want to solo in a large ship, that train has sailed.if you are in a gang, webs and painters help everyone."
"from a bs on bs perspective-most armor tankers get 7 lowslots w/ 4 midslotswhere as most shield tankers get 6 mids w/ 5 lowscaldari have - rokh, raven, scorp scorp being an ecm support boat that is paper thin. the rokh (4 missile slots, so not really affected) unless your running a interesting rokh missile boat.so you have the raven basically. almost everyone agrees to bs pvp you need 3 mandatory mods - 1 point, 1 mwd/ab, and 1 web (maybe painter instead). with web nerfs you almost need the 2nd web... but thats not mandatory. with missile pvp you have two choices either sit right at your missiles max length and keep a high transversal to stay out of gunners range. or get right at 0m so their guns track horribly and your inside their optimal. raven layout - teir 2 - 5 lows 6 mids 8 highs, 6 missile slotsdomi - teir 1 - 7 lows 5 mids 6 highs, 6 turretmega - teir 2 - 7 lows 4 mids 8 highs, 7 turret slotshype - teir 3 - 6 lows 5 mids 8 highs, 8 turret slotsarmaggedon - teir 1 - 8 lows 3 mids 8 highs, 7 turret slotsapoc - teir 2 - 7 lows 4 mids 8 highs, 8 turret slotsabaddon - teir 3 - 7 lows 5 mids 8 highs, 8 turret slotstyphoon - teir 1 - 7 lows 4 mids 8 highs, 4 turret slots 4 missile slotstempest - teir 1 - 6 lows 5 mids 8 highs, 6 turret slotsmaelstrom - teir 3 - 5 lows 6 mids 8 highs, 8 turret slotsin respects to short range guns and long range, in respects to cpu and grid usage.blasters:torps - blasters are more grid intensive and less cpu, and on the flip side torps require alot more cpu while less gridlasers:torps - lasers are even more grid hoggers than blasters, and require even less cpu autos:torps - autos take the least amount of cpu, and are inbetween blasters and lasers for grid reqsarmor tankers w/ 4 mid slots (only 1 w/ 3 mids is the geddon) - 1 point, 1 web, 1 propulsion, 1 extra(cap booster, eccm, tracking comp, sensor boost) the geddon's 1 less midpoint is made up for in 1 more low slot. the tempest and hype each only have 6 low slots, and the hype has an 7.5% armor rep per gallente bs to overcome the 1 less low. armor tanks require more powergrid while they are less cpu intensive. that is the exact opposite for shield tanking, while not powergrid intensive at all, they are cpu hogs. majority of active tankers use that 4 and even sometimes 5 midslot for cap boosters to extend tank and gun shooting.tanks w ganks!:armor tank:->passive - 2 eanm ii's, dc ii, 2 1600rt plates. you then can tack on 3x trimarks or 2x trimarks and 1x anti-explo pump for the rigs->active(varies a bit more) - dc ii, 2 eanm ii's, 2 large armor rep ii's. you can then tack 2x aux nano pump, 1x nanobot accel for the rigs.*armor reps take 400 cap over 15 seconds for repairing 800 armor hp (not counting any skills, bonuses, or rigs)shield tank:passive - 2 lse ii's, 2 invuln ii's, 1 dc ii(low slot). then tack 1x anti-em screen and 2x core def field extenders or do 3x core def field extenders.active - xlarge shield booster(best named because of cpu needs usually), 1 invuln ii, and 1 photon field ii. then tack on 1x core defe operation solidifier, and 2x core def cap safeguards for rigs.* x-large ii rep takes 400 cap over 5 seconds for repairing 600 shield hp (not counting any skills, bonuses, or rigs)shield active:ok try to fit an active tank, even w/ a best named xlrg shield boost, with torps on a raven. lol you need one of the following:1. awu 4, 1 rcu i, and 1 pdu ii 2. awu 4 and rcu ii w/ a 3% grid implant3. awu 5 and a rcu ii w/ 1% grid implant... and oh thats just to fit the grid. your going to need a lowslot for a cpu mod too, unless you can afford the 5% cpu mod w/ energy grid lvl 52 fitting mods and an implant is a gimped setup, let alone 3 fitting mods; so next we look at active tank w/ cruises on raven."
"(part 2)active tank raven w/ cruises:(of note if you try to active armor tank a raven. your going to be fitting heavy or heavy assualt missiles due to lack of grid, let alone cpu... lolz at best)so the only active tank raven is a shield tank (it can vary a bit):1. 1x x-large shield booster(cpu is too tight for t2), 2x invuln ii's, 1x heavy cap booster ii, 1 100mn mwd ii, 1 warp disrupt ii. tack on the rigs 1x core def operation solidify, 2x core def cap safegaurd.2. 1x x-large shield booster(cpu is too tight for t2), 2x invuln ii's, 1x heavy cap booster ii, 1 100mn mwd ii, 1 warp disrupt ii. tack on the rigs 1x core def operation solidify, 1x core def cap safegaurd, 1x anti-em screen.3. 1x x-large shield booster(cpu is too tight for t2), 1x invuln ii's, 1x photon field ii, 1x heavy cap booster ii, 1 100mn mwd ii, 1 warp disrupt ii. tack on the rigs 1x core def operation solidify, 2x core def cap safegaurd.3. 1x x-large shield booster(cpu is too tight for t2), 1x invuln ii's, 1x photon field ii, 1x heavy cap booster ii, 1 100mn mwd ii, 1 warp disrupt ii. tack on the rigs 1x core def operation solidify, 1x core def cap safegaurd, 1x anti-therm screen.w/ all the above setups you can either do:1. 2 bc ii's, 2 pds ii's, and 1 dc ii.2. 3 pds ii's, 1 dc ii, 1 bc ii.3. 3 bc's, 1 pds ii's, and best named dc (or dc ii and a 1% cpu implant)passive tanks:armor:as stated before passive tanks require 5 slots: 1x dc ii, 2x eanm ii's, 2 1600rt. then 2x trimarks and 1 anti-explo or 3 trimarks. the abaddon differs here as it can legitametly get away with 1x eanm ii because of its 5% armor resists to amarr bs lvl bonus.technically the raven can armor passive tank, but unlike all the other armor tankers it will do so w/o a dmg mod. then if you want to fit the close range hi-dmg weapon of torps, you will have to sacrafice 1 rig for an acr, then 2 trimarks, or 1 trimark and 1 anti-explo rig. so for a full armor passive tank, w/ rigs, your reduced to cruises.shield:here is about the only place the raven shines any by shines i mean not as much of a turd as the rest of the setups.few choices, both encompassing around 2 lse ii's, 2 invuln ii's, and 1 dc ii. 1 anti-em and 2 core def extend rigs or 3 core def extend rigs.1. 1 dc ii, 3 pds ii's, 1 bc ii - around 700 dps w/ 5x medium ii drones, and cal navy ammo2. 1 dc ii, 1 pds ii, 3 bc ii's - around 900 dps w/ 5x medium ii drones, and cal navy ammo.both of these still only allow the raven 2 midslots for pvp setup. so you can choose between point, web, painter, propulsion mod. pick any two... in reality now that qr hit you have to \"adapt\" so now you dont even get to do full dmg unless the idiot sits still(even then unless their sig is larger than torps explosion velocity (skills dont modify this due to it being an unguided missile)... some of the dmg is dissapated. since almost every one, to include the n00bs is going to be moving during pvp... whether to escape, mitigate dmg, or chase after someone else. the fact remains that you are reduced to propulsion mod and point... so no web, no target painter. ok what about web drones and target painting drones... ah in my 75m3 drone bay! yes!3 heavy web drones or 5 medium painter drones... either way by fitting those im loosing over 150 dps, just to try to regain my torps dps back.---------------in closing, this patch has me adapting... im going back to using guns, as the few missile ships that are out there for bs have to be flow gimped. i could fly an armor tanked raven, passive or active. but neither of them are using torps(unless you use an acr for the passive. or you use heavy/ham missiles for the active armor tank.. hahaaaa).the passive shield tanked raven is the only other setup that allows me to fly around w/ torps and pew pew. but i have to fit a mwd due to not having a slot for a web. and even then i still dont have a slot for a painter or a web."

"hey smart ass lets see what you have added to our knowledge else then i m stupid? jhmm nothing..i m playing this game for around 5 years and knows what to do with caldari ships as i m ony caldari trained.. but you still didnt understand the issue here.. i was saying what about ppl who are only caldari trained? by your exemple you ssy, if you want to fit a point web mwd etc you need to cross train..well the whole fckn point of this topic is why caldari cant be self sufficient? why we have to cross train now not 3 years ago or 2 when i was maxing my skills to fly caldari ships effectively? why if you train only gallente or amar or minmatar you survive but with caldari you cant do nothing on your own? ... those were the questions and you enlightened us by saying there s other missile boats then caldari and they r using armor so use them.. woooow and solo is not dead at all, many ppl still loving and doing it maybe you dont but it doesnt make it dead.. you can easily solo with minmatar before and after the patch. you can solo in amar, in gallente ( even i heurd some ppl whining about.. ) but :*when you cant fit a point your target can flee, when you cant*when you cant web them your cruise missiles do 24 dmg (with all missile skills at 5 and spec 4) to an heavy assault who dont have ab or mwd on.. he laugh at you and continues to kill you slowly while arbiting you again without anyspeed module..*when you cant approach him coz you are slow, you cant web him or even point, so you need a speed mod.*with the nerf you need a painter to make more then 20 ish dmgso if your answear to all those questions is \"use typhoon, a sacrelidge, a vengeance, a damnation etc. \" you simply say train something else then caldari.. well thats the whole point here mr einstein...edit : well so gallente bs's and tempest's abbadon's have dmg bonuses if i remember well, maelstrom has shield boost bonus and abbadon shield resist+ dmg, that makes you think about missing dmg mods or tank mods on low slots??"
"i fly a mega on my other character, it still solos exactly the same as it always has. still has 1100dps and the same tank as my raven (930dps) with torps, still tackles fine, can fit a sensor booster which my raven cant without changing my tank, did i mention thats with 2 damage mods in that mega fit compared to 3 in my raven for more dps.missile ships werent over powered before the patch, they most definately are now under powered.i would think that because i have a character for each race, that at the equivelant training and ship i am not particularly wanting one ship to pwn them all. i just want it to be able to fullfill its role. an extra midslot was needed before the update, definately needed a lot more now"
"no. you're doing it wrong. when i say \"if you want tackle+missile choose typhoon or sacrelidge\" i do not mean \"caldari suck but its balacned cos you can cross train\". that would not be right -all races should have value in their own right.when i say \"use sacrlidge if you want this\" it means if you had wanted the versatility of tackle and tank then you should have chosen early to do x. if you choose y, you need to play like y are good at - in this case, caldari in a gang.its not \"y sucks, train x\", its if you want to play like x, train x, dont choose y then try to play it like x, then moan like a whiny ***** when it sucks.caldari have never been good at solo on their big missile boats. you can argue away, but the truth is that all solo got a big nerf, and might as well be dead. you are wrong if you think missiles aren't balanced because of a difficulty of soloing on certain boats on one race. why cant they be \"self-sufficient\"? well why should they? all races are different. i needn't remind you that you have turret boats and fast boats as well. your last point is nonsense -all missile boats have rof or damage bonuses or both."
"yes i m clearly saying i want to fit a scrambler and web and tank and dmg, which is my right as all of the other races lol. \"if you had wanted the versatility of tackle and tank then you should have chosen early to do x.\" when i choosed caldari, you could hang around in a torp raven with only 1 scram and no other rubishness, and have a proper pvp kill ships or any size or lose your ship to another ship who s doing the same thing as you.. so i choosed the x many years ago. maxed the skills and then x become z and later today it become y that you are talkin about. so these skills and sp's are wasted today is that clear? if not read odessima's post right above you cant not understand mine... quote : \"why cant they be \"self-sufficient\"? well why should they? all races are different.\" are you serious?? how long you have been in this game to decide what role caldari have? or to decide what role it should have?? i tell you it was possible to have a proper pvp around in a bs or bc whatever you want with only 1 scram + web and shield tank.. it wasnt wrote on caldari ships like :\" if you wanna fly this you will need some other support ships to scram web and paint, if you dont have that sit in a station..\" that is new.. atleast the fact it got worst is new...every race in this game can and should be able to be self sufficient which means scram web tank and dmg ( not beeing the best on everything but do everything), tanking and making dmg while able to scram is not a race specific fact, it s duable for 3/4 of the races in the game, and it was like this for the 4th one as well but now not anymore so stop saying that caldari cant fly alone or shouldnt scram web and tank or shoudnt do better dmg and dont try to fix it some roles from your mind. drakes, nh's, raven's, cerbs were self sufficient ships, nh, drakes and cerbs were/maybe still are able to make somethings on their own as they have resist bonus's they can fit scram or speed mod's but the dmg become crap for them this time../me stops here argueing with you, you have everything infront of your eyes to understand if you want to understand.. but if you dont it s not becoz you are right, missiles are perfect as they are and not underpowered at all, or caldari should not scram, web or use speed and tank at same time, it s one or another for them (wtf?? ).."
"never thought i'd say this to a tri but,/thread"
"thumbs down!!i find it funny all the ones saying how they are leaving because they cant ghost train anymore, even though in a majority of causes ccp wont miss it because they werent paying for it anyway, except when their long skill has finally finished and have to log in to change it again.for the ones with multiple accounts, it is a bit of a problem but i would think with the ability to have 3 characters logged into game there is a fair bit of opportunity to run missions, mine build to make enough isk to buy gtc's fairly easily.i dont agree with account deletion after 3 months (someone mentioned it above), because if you are deployed get sick or otherwise unable to access your account, it would be unfair to come back and have to start over again.oh yeah and i have 3 accounts and i pay for all of them, i dont expect free skill trains."

"one of many necessary ui fixes, but probably the most obvious. the location of \"trash it\" on the menus has alone probably claimed tens of billions of isk worth of stuff over the course of this game. not that i pity those people too much, but it's still terrible design."

"as a drone user i feel that the faction drones both augmented and integrated) are worse than standard/t2 drone version thank to the split damage. in missions (and where you will be using drones that cost several millions each if not in missions?) the split damage is a drawback, not a bonus. the other stats are slightly better than the commonly produced versions, but not enough to make them worthwhile.to make them worthwhile there are two ways:- make them and the components much more common and easy to find, so making a low cost faction item that will be used and brought regularly an in large quantitiesor- keep them as rare as today, but making them much more powerful."

"what the new players dont seem to understand even if you take away the obvious selfishness of the older player in not wanting it changed because they didnt get it, to me really you would loose a sense of accomplishment when you actually trained the longer skills, battleship 5 anyone in 22days...,then you have the fact that quite a few people really dont understand proper tactics that early on, combined with the fact that actually being able to fly a battleship, hac, or really any t2 ship becomes old real quick if your loosing it all the time because even though you have the skills to fly it you really cant anyway because you havent got the know how to fly your u beaut battleship.i quite often fly smaller ships, and still find them fun to fly and actually more challenging when running missions, because running level 3's in a drake or lvl 4's in a raven becomes very mechanical and not really that much of a challenge.pvp wise sure you can dash out in your brand new battle ship into pvp and you will probably loose it inside 10mins, even with a good fitting it realy doesnt mean you know how to use the ship at all.everytime i see one of these posts it just seems to me that op wants everything other people worked for straight away, to me there is nothing wrong with the people against it, its the people who dont have the patience that are really asking for a little to much.you can significantly reduce your skill times, by actually training your learning skills and implants in the beginning.i have a lot of loooooooooooooonggggg skills to train, and i dont want it changed at all.btw is that dapto as in aus."

"yes... lets make scamming a eula violation.... and lying... and theft... and...oh... wait a second....yes... your idea is that stupid.the basic scam is just that.... the moment it involves accessing someone else's account or real money transaction... is when its a eula violation."
"1 - there are people who are stupid enough to fall for the most obvious of scams. i say they deserve to lose their isk.2 - i was attracted to eve because i heard about the eve intergalactic bank scam.3 - how would you define a scam so that players and gms could easily agree if something is a scam when given the same information ?so i say no. if you fall for the scams, you deserve it. if you can't stand the spam, just have local minimized until you leave jita."
"if it's too good to be true then it usually is.if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck...then guess what? it's probably a duck.these are life lessons that have been pounded into our brains for the better part of our life and considering that eve is a intelligence heavy game, and a lot of life principles can be brought here then i see scamming as a game mechanic.i do not promote, nor do i scam myself. i just feel that for the realism of the game, in a cut-throat society with corporations and alliances constantly trying to better themselves and get ahead in the market that scamming should be totally legal. if you look around in your own day-to-day life how many scams are you presented with each day? whether it's that telemarketer, or a new weight-loss program, or even a co-worker trying to jew you out of something at work. it happens to all of us, and if we weren't intelligent enough to understand and realize that these were scams then how would we make it?exactly."
"ccp dooesnt allow scamming because it would be too much work to police it. ccp alows scamming because thhey wanted to creat a sandbox, a virtual world where everything is possible. there is no reason in thier eyes why virtual crime shouldn't exist; and i have to say i agree with them.eve without its dark side and its virtual crime and its freedom of choice would not be eve, personally i think that the harshness of the eve world is part of what attracts eve players to eve. sure i dont much like scammers myself, and yes they are probably the lowest of the low but no i dont think its ccp's job to police them; if anything they help keep the comunity on its toes."
"ah. now i get it ."
"there is risk in everything you do, but if someone is stupid enough to fall for it... its their fault. just use the block function... it exsists in this game for a reason.then again you already stated all of this stuff.then what defines a scam, overselling by \"accidently adding\" one '0'. by a [wtb] for 200mil less than the item is considered \"worth\" at the time? what about 100mil less or 50mil less. where do you draw the line.to much grey area for you to stick eula against it and have accounts/characters banned for it. supply/demand and suckers born everyday. especially the idiots that buy isk then try to come and buy all the best faction. so in some ways scammers are helping to clean the dirty isk bought by the rlm isk buyers.these are no longer the days of escrow... now that was a scammers heaven, to fall for a scam nowadays means you really deserved it in the first place. if it wasnt profitable scammers wouldnt be doing it either ;-pjust some things to think about for your flawed plan"
"scammers are necessary part ov eve to make stupid ppl emoragequit back to wow"
"\"look before you leap\" comes to mind lol!"
"not going to bash the op, but scamming in eve has been around since day one. getting scammed sucks, but logistically it would be near impossible for ccp to go back and put a stop to it. not after the game has gone this far in it's life."
"i agree that scamming is frightfully annoying... but it's a big part of human existance: screw the other guy if you can.the only scam i would like to see resulting in instant permaban is when dealing with the new plex certs, since they deal with real-world out-of-game currency."
"claiming oh i made a mistake on my contract offer so it looks like a scam is another scam in its self. scammers are like the child molesters of eve. they prey on the weak. i donlt think they should be banned however it would cause a serious reduction in whine threads between nerf patches."
"hello all,i'm brand new to eve but am working hard to start a career in politics, so figure i might petition some problems i've seen so far in the game, one of them being how bonus' expire during downtime. i'm not sure if they're supposed to do this but my missions have expired during dt and i would like to see mission times be halted once the servers go down. this is a negative action to the player that he or she cannot control once the mission is accepted. there is no way for a player to complete the mission and therefore shouldn't be punished since it's not their fault that they were unable to complete the mission in a timely manner.would love to hear everyone's thoughts on this...thank you for your time,candy"
"for most combat missions, the timer is long enough that any serious mission runner can do it with more than an hour to spare. and if you can't finish it before dt, don't accept it until after dt(unless you're looking to kill everything twice to farm cash from a good mission). i don't object in principle, but i see no need for it."
"agreed further more all missions in my opinion give ample time to complete and collect bonus. if you find you are having trouble completing missions period perhaps you need a better or more suited ship for the mission. i f you are unable to do that i suggest lower level missions (not needing to warp in and out to survive) until your skills as a player develop."
"heh, yes it's a problem for people who actually want to play factional warfare rather than just get free war-declarations."
"lol @ minnies crying sadly because they can't blob us all day long and might actually have to fight outnumbered sometimes. seriously guys, cri moar.edit: to put it a different way: in other words, it's not fair that the plexes spawn when we actually have a chance to capture plexes, but having them spawn during the other 18 hours that *you* outnumber *us* is a-ok."
"i support this."
"much as the idea seems good for streamlining many things, ccp has said that their database really does not like players inside players, and as such it is very unlikely to happen."

"personally i think the ability to buy/sell kill rights would be a good adition to the game.when you have the right to kill someone why shouldn't you sell that right.it woulda - add bounty hunting into eve on a solo basisb - give people who are killed a bit of isk backan auction imo would be the best way to do this and at the end of the auction the kill right is transfered to the buyer and the person who can be killed gets a notification that the right has been sold but not to whom.on a side note i didn't think flippers generated kill rights because he flips canyou can kill him for 15 minshe can kill you for 15 minsno kill right generated but i may be wrong"
"scorps > this guy cannot be killed by any man.krugerrand > i am no man!"
"would it be possible to implement a filter on the star map to refine your agent searchinstead of \"show my available agents\" to allow you to pick say show level 4 only or level 3 only etc.staring at a bunch of small to large green globs and trying to read extra small text to see which system has what level agents for me is a bit of a nuisance.not sure if this has been suggested or not but it would be a nice tweak.tl;dr put an agent refine search on the star map."
"this is not going to be a whine about battleship speed.. just some of the gates such as recon 2/3 are 80 km off the start point.. that takes about 10 min to cover in a bs these days. even with an ab its about 5. some missions were changed to adjust the gate closer for the lower speed of battleships. anyone else know of missions that are similar (i seem to be geting the same after the qr.edit: forgot some info"
"without the ability to can flip, the market for deployable cargo containers would drop off to almost nothing. they'd become near useless when a player can create a much larger one for free."
"so what you are requesting is the ability to remotely process things?it makes sense to me. in fact, i think it's really missing big time. it's certainly worth doing.that's a quite solid issue. i will make sure that it's on my list for some of the things to do inside the first submission round when we go to ccp hq and talk to them!"
"got my vote! err.. 2"
"i love your signature"
"i take your point, but i think you're being far too one-dimensional with your solution. mining ice is important, but i'd rather see a broad-based solution to the problems of lowsec rather than just take one of a dozen things people do and wallop it with a nerfbat."
"they would after that change as well, it would just increase prices if it caused any supply hicups in low-sec. it would certainly get a number of people to move to low-sec, but i am not sure its a comprehensive solution. i'll look into it"
"thanks. i've posted a more detailed topic here."
"well. i have always been a bit of a solo-player in many aspects. my daily life, especially now with csm, keeps me from playing for extended periods of time, in order to make actual gangs. so i solo-play a lot.solo-pvp is still alive. it's not not easy and it leaves you only the option of ganking poor targets. but i guess that works.pve is nice and solo friendly. such a shame it just sux and is no fun.industry is solo friendly and interesting. i love it.we do need more high-end industry however. but that's a whole different topic.solo-pvp is viable. and so it should be. but eve is still a mmo. it's focused around gang warfare, but it shouldn't limit it to that, imo."
"have to say that i really don't understand people who pay 15/mo to play solo. there are many single player games out that provide a better single player experience.yes every player should be able to get to a certain point solo. be able to replace their own ships, buy some new modules, and otherwise not be a destitute pod pilot. however i think to get the best ships, the craziest content, and other \"high end\" items, one should be forced to work with a team."
"the competitive environment is really what does it, at least for me. it's one of the few games where it takes a reasonable amount of work to progress a reasonable amount. that's quite unlike another game which has been quite a bit in the press recently with it's new expansion"
"because i cannot resist hacking every single game that runs on my own pc.and i seriously have not found any game worthy of buying since oblivion, and i think that game sucked balls too and got bored with it after 3 days (i finished the main storyline in two days and found it very unrewarding).dwarf fortress is of course the best game ever but even on my nasa-pc it runs too slow to my tastes, plus whatever i build now will be incompatible with the february update"
"actually, i'm not surprised. i get that a lot. one of my pet peeves really. it's the challenge. no ai can surpass a human being at the keyboard. therefore no single-player game can provide the challenge of a mmo.so why am i in a one-man corp? because i believe flying solo in the pirate hubs, not going after ratters but targeting people who want to fight (and sometimes bring friends), is far more challenging than traveling around in groups, calling primaries, and wondering if your lock will complete before the target vaporizes. but, given the response to my post in gd, i have to say i get the feeling i'm the oddity in eve. anyway... thank you for the replies. i have enough information to make my voting selection. good luck to all you guys/gals."
"this sounds like a really excellent idea.right now the 0.0 alliances are extremely monolithic. probably the biggest barrier to new players in eve (6 mos to a year old) is the inability to do anything past low sec unless they are willing to put themselves under the thumb of a 0.0 alliance - and they frequently don't have the connections to achieve that.take a section of space away from a 0.0? even if it's not being used? forget it. taking out even a small tower doesn't automatically require cap ships, but it comes pretty close. the one tower i have on my killboard took more than a hundred ships a long time to kill.perhaps another thing that would help the game would be to make towers more of a liability. something that requires protection rather than something that provides it almost flawlessly."
"nice ideas, especialy agree with the lack of ingame events, one thing you might want to mention is the recent merging of the ingame events forums and out of game player gatherings, this further compounds the fact the ingame events never happen.perhaps you could suggest a support system for helping players wanting to create ingame events, coming from a rp corp i've thought about starting afew but been put off by the fact that without any offical backing any attempt is unlikely to be taken seriously.i'm going to sound stupid here but what exactly is \"blobing\" and why is everyone so opposed to it?"
"i hope this is soon something of the pastbasically blob warfare, stricto sensus, used to be defined by the ability to field 2/3 of a node capacity or more to prevent any fight to happen...this is now more or less gone but still. conquering a system is a matter of numbers. large numbers. can be boring :sapparently sov is under heavy reconstruction and i hope the csm will be involved in overlooking at least the new system..."
"i hope you guys remember this thread, as the council chair has to have authority...roberts rules of order already exist. don't re-invent the wheel...ak"
"the csm does not use roberts rules and likely, being a small body, does not need it. even then, roberts rules are administrative and if no one will cooperate with that administration then they will not work.the council chair arranges meetings and moves along the meeting discussion, that is all. it has no authority."
"small bodies are just as capable of petty infighting and stubborn disagreements as large bodies are.my time on the student senate taught me that robert's rules are invaluable and that we should definitely use them on the csm."
"asuri, as far as the csm is concerned, rro does not exist. gou, as far as i'm concerned, they should. i've run a group before where the rules of order consisted entirely of \"don't be a jerk\" and that functioned in perfect harmony doing so. and hey, that works great for a group of buddies running a campus club whose primary activity consists of weekly trips to the pub. however, i've also been on groups where debates over who could do what when have gotten to rather extreme levels. in the case where rro was in place and understood by all parties, it merely created long-term adversaries. in the case where it wasn't, it led to people ragequitting groups that had been their life up until then and physical violence. the former is bad, the latter is far worse. the csm is a group of egotistical geeks who only know each other from forum argument. the fact that the first council had half a dozen low-level wars raging for its entire term of office surprises me not a bit. when harmony is nonexistent, you need to replace it with either bureaucracy or force. of those choices, i prefer bureaucracy, and thus rules of order. i don't like the need for it, but i don't see the world through rose-tinted glasses. rules of order make groups function better, small or large, and they're necessary for any but the most peaceful group that wants to consider itself well-run. as for the role of the chair, that can be debated - nobody has said what the rules would have to be, rro has just been an assumption. even if you don't like rro, i hope you can agree on the need for some kind of rules to exist."
"as an update, this channel is still live, and a good number of csm candidates are in it much of the time - right now, there are 8 of us. other candidates and non-candidates alike are certainly welcome."
"its what you said, but its not what you were discussing. unless you were discussing how to be completely unrealistic in your goals and expectations. seriously, you're going to develop a pvp system for use in mining?because of the framework of the system. because there is no direct player competition. any such variables will not be acted upon and simply be random returns. any variables that can be acted upon will those naturally effected by scarcity.what in the world does this have to do with what you quoted? if all the belts are mined dry then people can go to exploration. if all the exploration sites are found then people have to go to low-sec or 0.0.this is the driving force created by scarcity and is good for the game.have you ever designed a \"completely dynamic system so there is no direct pattern\" to do something so terribly simple? are you going to introduce mini-games into eve? how do these systems interact with the risk/reward model?your ravings and rantings are ridiculous and nearly incomprehensible. we started out discussing why a small gradient between 0.0 and empire was bad and you claimed you wanted to boost empire mining. we explained why that was dumb and you have now gone off into la-la land about completely overhauling a system in a manner which is pretty much impossible while (possibly) reneging on your original claim."
"i was directly responding to:so we were discussing mining mechanics and pvp mechanics. it was you that suddenly went raving about pve afk missions, which had nothing to do with what we were discussing.and where did i say i want a pvp system in mining, what the hell are you referring to? maybe if what i say does not make sense in your head, it's not what i said, at all.of course they will be acted upon if the system was the thing that introduced these variables in the first place, as the return is part of the variable outcome.because wasting time looking for ore that is not there is not good gameplay. if players want to mine they should be able to mine. immediately. it is fine if all high-end ore is hard to find, but it is not fine if all ore in the system is simply gone within a few hours after it spawns.the risk-reward equation is incomplete.there are other models as well:* time-reward* skill-reward* effort-rewardnot all activities in eve are or should necessarily be linked to risk.right now the problem with the pve activities in eve are that they are all static. missions are always the same, exploration sites are the same, people know what to expect. if these systems were modular and dynamic, then this would provide players with new experiences and challenges all the time.if you take the mining beam modulation example (which i said several times was and example, not something i actually want), that would be a minigame of sorts. the challenge with those is to make them interesting and non-repetetive. players do not want to play the same silly minigame for hours and hours just to get some ore. thats why i proposed to have these things as optional. players can use the same mining mechanics as we have today and alt-tab out if they like, but if they want to uncover special stuff, they have to put more effort into it. effort-reward. that is what i would like to see, special stuff being able to be uncovered on occasion through mining, if the miner is putting some effort and attention into it.speak of yourself. and why is it dumb to have more/better roids in empire?"
"no, they do. unless we aren't discussing the system by which mining occurs. you responded with a non sequitur and changed the the discussion. the system by which pvp happens doesn't relate to whether or not the system had changed. his logic was correct.the only way that bringing up these differences between mining and pvp could possibly have made any sense whatsoever, was if you were claiming that these were the things you could do with mining.but you then mentioned how you can't do afk combat. now, you're now claiming that there is some system by which we can make mining like combat and have it not be boring by comparing an activity played against humans to an activity played against a computer while ignoring the main difference between activities played against humans to those played against computers.i am sorry, eve is not a single player game. if people want to mine and everything is mined out, then they can go to low-sec or 0.0. scarcity is one of the primary driving factors in eve. miners, the first cog in the economic system should understand this.what? its impossible to divorce any activity from risk. risk is a factor in everything you do. its a factor in everything you do in real life, its a factor in everything you do in your virtual life. it is impossible to divorce actions with risk because risk is defined as the chances of adverse effects. if those chances are zero then risk is still a factor in your decisions, it simply has no modifying effect.if you increase risk, effort, time, or barrier to entry without increasing reward, the amount of people partaking in that activity will go down. this is just basic human decision making. its no \"other models\" its a single model that incorporates all those factors. ahh yes, all we have to do is develop a \"modular\" and \"dynamic\" mission and mining system. congratulations, give yourself a star. now, if we just ignore all the reasons for why we can't easily create a \"modular\" and \"dynamic\" mission and mining system we will be well on our way to declaring victory over the problem.because then no one will mine in low-sec/0.0. because risk will increase and reward will not. because people are risk adverse and we want to utilize space to its fullest to create a competitive and cooperative game rather than jamming people into safe space where they don't have to make these types of meta discussions."
"because highsec ore is too good as-is. the last thing we need is for it to be better."
"the only one changing the discussion is you, with your totally irrelevant and non-productive comments. there wasn't any problem between me and herschel.strangely enough it wasn't even me that brought up the combat mechanics...i claimed you can't do afk *pvp* combat.just because there may be some differences between computer opponents or computerized mechanics and humans, does not mean that computers cannot be challenging or interesting.that is no excuse. people should not be forced into a specific playstyle if they do not want to. playing in high security forever is a perfectly valid playstyle. eve's playerbase has expanded, the abilities to mine ore has increased, so it's time the belts increase to match.oh really, is there risk attached to progressing through skill training? no ****. too bad i never claimed that there is no such thing as risk, i only claimed that risk-reward on its own is incomplete. that's exactly what i've been saying.why couldn't we?if one man can, then why can't ccp?well too bad eve is a sandbox game, and there are people out there that may have zero interest in competition, or even cooperation, and they are entitled to play this game in the way they like.you speak of 'we' but there certainly are people out there that do not want what you want.and there will always be those that are willing to take the risk to come out if the rewards are better. one of my campaign points is to boost low-sec, you know."
"sorry, with better, i meant larger, as stated in my first post in this thread."
"signed"
"best nerf ever!!!"
"ok here is the thing bud a mega may have 1100dps on eft but the truth is you will never get 1100 dps in eve and not only that but the actual sweet spot for that dps is minute compared to the 30km ish? range of torps. not only that but there is plenty of ships in eve that cannot solo well the raven is just one of them.......missiles may get a reduction in dmg due to speed and sig but then gunships get a reduction of dps depending massively on range and transversal speed."
"i agree with dierdra vaal's original post that empire wars needs some changes. i'm a ceo of 3 months old corporation and we have been wardeced by griefer corp for last two months. it seems it will be neverending war. :(our new corporation in empire was soon wardeced by griefers. that time we had many new players joined in our corporation it made our operations very hard. after two months the war is still on, but enemy gets less and less kills. we do not want to pay pirate scums any isk, so probably the war will continue forever. this suck.i would like to see some changes in wardec. example: after few weeks price for keeping the war on should double each week until it will end. another problem is that usually griefers are not after the money! they have plenty of money and just try to make playing for new players miserable. no wonder why eve is considered hard for new players and many quit after a month or two. please ccp, do something for neverending wardecs in empire."
"eve wardeccing is now that aggressor pays the war. how about if a new corp (or maybe any corp?) could pay for protection?if your corp is in caldari empire, why not to be able to pay insurance money for caldary navy? if you are wardeced, then caldari navy will help your corp in war. after few months insurance money should increase significantly to make it more expensive for older corporations. example, a new corporation could pay only 2m/week for insurance, 1 month old 5m/week and over 6 month old 50m/week.i believe a system like this for new corp would definately make grieferes think twice about wardeccing a newbie corp. some highsec corporations could think paying hundreds of millions every month is a good price for not getting wardecced. we need a stromger police or somekind of higher author in empire."
"i disagree completely with the op. the amount of time a pos manager put into setting up a pos shouldn't be shorter than the time it takes to destroy it.best argument i can put forth is the issue of people like goonswarm knowing full well they can take advantage of any leeway given on this subject to ninja a deathstar into somewhere they'd normally never get away with. sort of like sticking yer tongue out and making a raspberry, since it would take them way less time, and effort (needing only one person) to impact a great many more players negatively.which is what goonswarm pride themselves in, is it not?"
"last time i anchored a death star, i was happy when -a- dread fleet \"unanchored\" it for me :-)ccp: allow cooperation when anchoring modules (stacking penalty when anchoring n modules). eve supposed be a multiplayer online game not a linear batch script. add skills decreasing anchoring time."
"the nerf of unsubbed training has been the most ill-advised and destructive change ccp has made to eve in the 2-1/2 years i have been in the game. like many others, i am reducing the $$ i send to ccp from the $1,620 annualized when all my accounts were active, as they were when the nerf was announced."
"do it!"
"this may have been mentioned before, but i didn't feel like searching through 12 pages of postes to find it.how about a new learning skill to que skill trainig. each level adds an additional que slot.no lvl = train one at a timelvl 1 = que 1lvl 2 = que 2lvl 3 = que 3lvl 4 = que 4lvl 5 = que 5this way you can have one skill training and be able to que up to 5 additional skills."
"sweet jesus yesget with the times ccpyou let us click to train so that more casual players can play eve, then expect us to wake up at 3:00am in the morning to change skills??skill queue!"
"i agree with a skil queue idea. if only for the fact that people who work are at work while their skill ends and loose hours upon hours of training time."
"count me in."
"a skill queue thread wouldn't be one if ol' sir smelly didn't show up to give his support. skill queue, we wants it, we needs it!!"
"then you must also check the thumbs up box ;)anyway just found this - doesnt look good :(in the same thread:\"skill queue:as i said in the live dev blog yesterday that's just something we were talking about and one of the risk factors we had to keep in mind. we're not really decided upon if we want a skill queue or not and it's something that requires some serious thought on our part. i'll see if i can't get ccp hammer to answer this question in more detail.\"and\"ghost training:i can't comment on that at this point, sorry. currently however there are no plans to implement a skill queue or multiple simultaneous skill trainings.\"thats a bit contradictive?just say yes or no *sigh*keeping players hopes up and then just letting them hang there instead of just saying there will be none is contraproductive."
"about time we had this - it's not like people character farming don't already have an easy time of it - how about those of us that don't play eve as part of our job get a break?"
"against.i dont even have to play this patch to see that its the farthest thing from a good idea possible.remember the days where good things weren't messed around with? what happened? i'd rather go back to playing gemini or red moon rising than this crap. /signed"
"lets play eve . not world of evecraft"
"certificates bite tbh.... if a skill queue would mean you have to train all skills for a certificate i'll keep doing it manualy. which is prolly just what ccp will do, and then say \"look, we've implemented a queue, what you whining about??\" we need a proper sort of queue, one which you can fill in yourself, even if it was just possible to queue 1 skill, it would be a tremendous improvement. today i got lucky, was home early from work and had enough sparetime to babysit many of my nearly finished skills, so i finished a bunch today. but with a skill queue this could have been so much more enjoyable and i would have been flying my salvage boat about a week sooner... ccp, stop this torture and give this the highest priority."
"i am posting today both to query ccp as well as making some suggestions regarding the up and coming configurable ships. when i heard about this, it got me very excited, infact i'm looking forward to this more than ambulation (shock horror) and want to know more about it.from my understanding, you build your ship using 5 different components, each giving you different stats and make the ship look different. sounds great and it got me thinking, is this ccps take on adding player generated content to eve. as many of you know, player generated content is the new thing in social networking games with examples such as spore (which is ****ing aweful) and little big planet. customizable ships would definately be a good approach to adding this kind of thing to eve (especially when combined with ambulation, imagine designing your own ship and selling it in your own store ) and best of all it keeps within ccp's artistic vision of the game. while the first release of this will see around 3125 different combinations. there is nothing from what i can see stoping ccp making this on the kind of level that would work as player generated content. by making duplicates of the components which give the same stats but simply look different or even adding components which do nothing but look good, as well as some components which give new stats that also look different, we could theoretically expand the different combinations from 3125 to tens of thousands of different combinations without making eve unbalanced (and of course ccp's artists do not need to design tens of thousands of ships, simply design a few more components). as well as the 4 main races, we could see the pirate factions also offering up components for there own ships (ok, maybe the last bit is wishful thinking )with tens of thousands of combinations, we would then possibly see a situation in eve where players design there ships not only to give them tactical advantages in a fight but also designing there own ship purely based on asthetics which they can truely call there own. then with eveopedia possibly even uploading there designs for other players to look at.as you can probably see, this is worded like a suggestion however i also mean it as a query to ccp! is this the avenue ccp are considering taking with customizable ships. could we get a dev blog with a basic rundown on the future (post initial release) for customizable ships and if ccp plan to vastly expand this fantastic feature."
"i'm pretty excited about this new direction from ccp myself, but we must keep some things in mind. first, this is going to require a ton of balancing and changes before it ever goes live, so it'll probably take a while.second, the ships are tech 3 ships, meaning the skill requirements to use are probably going to be insane and keep them out of the hands of most starter pilots. we don't even know what size the new t3 ships are going to be (frigates? cruisers?).overall, it's an interesting direction which ccp is persuing. i'm glad they made t3 customizable rather than the rumored thermodynamics bonuses (which few people even bother with)."
"hell yes"
"+1 yea to this. stackable salvagers just make sense."
"i'm only approving because i believe a complete overhaul is necessary for the current skill training system. uberness should come from effort and experience, not by logging on, clicking on the next skill, and leaving for two weeks.a complete revamp of the skill training system is needed."
"rather than this thread merely saying 'you're wrong, ccp!' - which they are - perhaps it would be better if we via the csm said 'ok, ccp, you claim skill training promotes playing the game. show us some statistics. find the number of characters logging with a skill change following that by say, 5 minutes, and then graph the log-off time following'. i think their position would be a lot stronger with some actual data to back it up, and a lot weaker if they discovered that actually their belief is complete rubbish. just a thought."
"my idea is trying to change low sec that would necessarily be an increase in overall security of low sec... but also create better optionality for the pirates. so here's my idea. :)1. remove sentry guns from shooting global criminals. stations-gates. making them essentially work like 0.02. create a concord faction navy spawn.-sentry guns as it is now deal 200-250 dps? fail warfare faction navy in 0.5 systems spawn roughly 200-250 dps.-these concord ships just like the faction navy spawns are killable which respawns in a bit.so what changes?-those for example who are mining in low sec belts have increased security.-gate camps are allowed drones.-the aggro from concord isnt changing ships. so smaller ships are capable to be used.on top of this idea.make it possible to declare war on concord for free obviously; automatically stays active.so you can spawn the concord spawn elsewhere in the system and jam it up. so those @ a gatecamp wouldnt be bothered by the concord navy. with this... make it also possible for corps and individuals to join concord. you then become wartargets with those declaring war on concord aka pirates."
"i like it.i always wanted to be able to pew pew more with any ship i want, no matter if i am in 0.0 or low sec. the sec status hit should still be in low sec ofc.these police ships should be killable, i like. but they cant be uber ships that webs and scrams at 100km range and can track everything.wonder if they would drop some nice loot."
"if the concord spawn is comparable to the 0.5 faction navy spawns almost entirely. the respawn rate obviously changing depending on 0.1 vs 0.4-you would still have sec status hits.-the police ships would be killable.-they arent anywhere near uber.no loot though at all."
"pretty nice way of making anti-pirate not 'pirating' in itself... using the fw system already in place too.\"spawn the concord spawn elsewhere in the system and jam it up\" - means the big gatecampers aren't too effected ether... but then the anti-pi sneak in and finish off the guys keeping concord occupied, thus allowing concord to respawn to coincide with an assault on the camp!! lol tictacs"

"so it seems that ccp has decided to make a series of changes to evemail in the next minor patch released, of which the two most notable are making it impossible to read more than 1000 mails and deleting all npc mail more than three months old. the former is wholly irrelevant to me, given that i don't get anywhere near that many mails, but many corporate officers will get that many inside a day or two, and as such will be even less able to read their mail than they were before. the second issue, however, is absolutely appalling. killmails are the core of a pvper's recorded achievement, especially in small gangs and piracy, and many players have years of them stored up from the time before the combat log came into existence. this is just going to erase them to no purpose except freeing up some database space. i don't have too many old killmails, and it'd be easy for me to archive them by hand, but what about the guy who has been playing since 2003 and has 1500 mails stored? it's not apathy that has led them to be stored for that long, but instead the fact that he does care. and now ccp is going and trashing his achievements to save a few stinking gigabytes. at a minimum, ccp should convert old killmails to combat log format or keep them intact and unchanged. ideally, we'd get a proper mail system that doesn't have the embarrassing deficiencies of evemail, but i'd be happier if they at least didn't further wreck the system they already have while we wait for a replacement.update: ccp's plans have changed, and killmails are being saved. as such, this is no longer an issue."
"supported. making seperate topic in regards to the issues i have with it, but i understand this issue as well even if it doesn't apply to me that much.though i might like to keep the message i got the first time i got podded."
"new rules, noone knows how to play anymore. perfect time for a tourney to show ppl the new strengths(if any ;) )and weaknesses of the quantum frog, leap, mouse or whatever they call it."
"i had been hoping to work on improving the eve mail system after the csm elections, however, it seems that ccp's announced changes to them make this rather more urgent, and so i am bringing this up now.it's no secret that the eve mail system sucks, and sucks badly. message length is severely limited, just this past week i had to split a diplomatic message into four separate mails. and while four separate mails is a little rare, having to split mails into multiple messages is an everyday occurrence. if ccp is going to limit the number of mails, this is something that needs to be addressed, and addressed very soon.there is also no easy way that i know of to mark messages as things that you need to deal with -- messages that you have time to read when you log in to change skills, but that you don't have time to deal with until the next day, but that you forget about because they're not new anymore and are lost in a sea of other messages you keep in case you need to reference them at some point. which brings me to another point, but let's finish this first. we need to either have folders we can put mails in, or a way of marking messages as unread, so that we know to deal with them next time we log on.as mentioned above, we also need to be able to store old messages without them cluttering our inboxes. this is something that needs to be dealt with before any limit is set on how many mails appear -- we need to have a way to export mails to a text file, keeping all information about sender, subject, and date sent. copying and pasting this info to a text file manually is far too tedious, especially for corporate and alliance leaders who get a lot of mail.an outbox box would also go a long way -- i've more than once had to try and remember if i did or didn't reply to a particular message or send out a mail yet, or been unable to recall exactly what i did say. while not as urgent as the things above, this would be extremely useful. even better would be if you could keep drafts in it before sending them, instead of having to write drafts in the notepad and copy and paste and then deal with different length restrictions.i've also seen the idea of an api for mails mentioned, this would be extremely nifty, though not as vital as some of the things mentioned above, many of which are really necessities, and not things that 'should be done' -- they are things that 'must be done.' but an api, and a way to read (and maybe even send) your mails while offline would be totally wonderful for people who send a lot of their time on eve dealing with mails.there are possibly other improvements that can be made, and i encourage suggestions in this thread.."
"adding support -- clicked it when i posted the topic but it didn't show up. odd."
"it is a truly sad(and sadly true) statement that replacing the current mail client with outlook express 1.0 would be a massive upgrade. we've all known for years what was necessary, and why the devs have chosen not to fix it is utterly beyond me. how this game ever got out of beta with this client i don't know, for that matter - could they not have grabbed something open-source and slapped it in? as for having to support your own post, it's a known (bug? annoyance? oddity?) in the assembly hall, ops cannot have thumbs. personally, i prefer to wait until i have something to say in a reply and attach my thumb to that, so that i don't lower my post:support ratio, but instant support is common too."
"/supportfaction drones need a boost, i fully agree."
"setting the required skills for the t2 version of the faction drones down to below t2.giving more dps to the t1 version would be the other option."
"fascinating. supported."
"this was answered in"
"this petition is in response to the panel, which i re watched today... granted ccp have a lot of claims as to why not to do it. i understand that their bandwidth bill alone is probably staggering. but in response i say cut some costs, scale it down a bit, spend less money on the side stuff and keep the tournament running. player based mechanic would be interesting, however it just wont contain the magnitude that was the previous tournaments. the bob upset by hun reloaded, the ascn v. bob inty fight (rails on a crow?) the destruction of tyraxx's impcc. tri v ev0ke at the finale of v. it's not just about an arena to fight in, or bragging rights. it's about the depth and experience of the fights. i've never flown in one, would be nice in the future, but i've watched many of them live, even through some hijacked bandwidth when i was in the military and deployed. it's entertaining, it's historic, it's epic and it's awesome. i agree give the gm's the tools to manage the tournament. lighten the load on them of course. make it work better and more efficient. a ccp hosted tournament carries so much more wieght. an arena system would be entertaining, but a tournament championship team from an arena fight and an alliance tournament championship team are very very very different. i just see it as too deeply in the eve community and history to downsize into foam weapon jousting in empire.. sure put that in for people to play with... but keep the big epic battle for the crown."
"they took all the fun out of combat with this last patch, i personally looked forward to the alliance tournament every year but a lot of the good pvp'rs are leaving the game anyway. it is just another sign that ccp is knowingly killing off eve.i support the vote even though i have canceled my 3 accounts!"
"heh give power to the players...yeah, cos champions league is so similar to amateur competition with a few guys and no cameras.it's all about the tv, the atmosphere, the silly remarks ppl will remember what that or the other guy said, the aaahhhs and ooohs of commentators when the ships explode. ffs we already have pew pew by the tons, slapping a few medals, awards or titles ain't gonna change it. we love tv and eve (for only eve i can log in every day....)when ppl remember more a 10vs10 man fight than titans blowing up(yeah now you know the difference between reading about it or watching it live) you know that's the real thing.guys at ccp eve tournament is our soccer, our basketball, our baseball, our f1 and the teams playing are up there among the champions and legends of those other sports.ffs put in a ton of commercials if you must, it will feel like a real tv anyway :d this sells this is global this is sports. give us tournament! with cameras! and commentators!(don't worry about the beer and popcorn, i already got those)"

"a lot of names are reserved and taken by accounts that havent been played in years. i suggest that the accounts that have been inactive for a certain amount of time have the names of characters changed so that the names can be used by more active members or new players coming in"
"it's been raised before - it was a bad idea then, it's a bad idea now. you do not mess around with the accounts of paying customers, even if they're inactive. it's not like there's any shortage of names to be had."
"supported. the value does not come from the cost, but from the reason a specific decoration is awarded, and the frequency. cost simply limits the imagination of poorer corporations in using this otherwise wonderful system."
"say goonfleet wants to issue a campaign medal, to people who fought in a certain theatre of war. 3000 people, at 5 million a medal, is 15 billion. you can build a mothership for that. that is a wholly reasonable use of medals - not just good for corporate morale, but entirely analogous to rl military medals - and yet it is mindbogglingly expensive, to the point where the corp will never issue one. i'd have no objection to it costing a billion to do, but at 15 billion the math just doesn;t work. fat wallet or not, that's a painful hit. look at it the other way - i was in a wardec/merc corp a while back, and it had maybe 10 active members who fought in most of those wars. 10 active members cost 55 million to give a medal to, and our usual contract was for something on the order of 100 mil before expenses. again, wholly infeasible. the current prices basically limit medals to pure vanity. that is not a worthwhile use for the system, and it should be made more reasonable for larger use. they're in place now, and as such ccp will wait for data before they consider any changes. but personally, i can't see this being used for anything like their desired purpose."
"hi all!when i first saw that eve websites have list of player alliances i thought it is brilliant idea and spent lot of time just browsing or looking for ideal alliance and corp for me. but how i was disappointed in the game! everything what i<U+FFFD>ve read was terribly out of date. i know that alliances and corps are changing every day, but would it be so hard update that list at least once every month? now it is just very old gibberish that could only confuse newcomers and therefore it is better to don<U+FFFD>t show it at all."
"you find that depressing if you are using this site as a background you will find all item databases seriously out of date..second patch to include new ships and skills yet can't find them here. if you are looking for an alliance eve mail me i can point you to a few that would probably fit your corps needs not matter what you do."
"solution: make drone alloys only reprocess into tritanium.problem: unless you live under an icelandic rock, you'll know that (a) tritanium profits are now lockstep with other belt roid types from 0.1 space on up. (b) nocxium prices have only been attractive enough to draw players to low sec to mine, just before drone regions were coded in.experience: jaspet has always, always sucked (except for that small time period before drone alloys swamped the noxcium market)hypothetical situation: were noxcium to raise price by x5 it would not \"break\" mineral balance and mining habits, but actually balance the attractiveness, and highlight the risk/reward that should be intuitive, not counter-intuitive as it is now.even if it went to stupidly high levels in price (say half that of zydrine) it still would not make a mockery out of eve's mineral index.benefits of this: more targets for pirates in low sec. and of course more excitement for miners because they'd actually get a decent reward for the risk they put in. now, most people might not understand my point of view. let me just state for the record that high sec mining bores me to tears and i enjoy low sec mining simply because the risk factor keeps me awake. there's another benefit i think most of you might not realize: currently drone alloys of the commoner sort hold more tritanium volume than the alloy to be refined (in other words, the more rare drone alloys would naturally hold more tritanium in a sort of free 'compressed' state...and wouldn't that be attractive all on it's own?)the cons: hmmm...well, i'm not sure if it would impact the production business. i wonder what lord fitz would think?"
"i've lived in the drone regions for a while now, and they are one of the most annoying regions to live in. yes you get minerals, but you get nothing else. no exploration content of interest, no loot, no bounties, nothing. if you want to come down here and try ratting here for a bit, feel free. maybe then you'll learn just how terrible it is trying to make money when you have to loot and sell everything in order to get any return. yes you get more money, but imagine trying to run l4 missions where you have to loot every single wreck with an industrial... yeah fun.in fact, only the high end minerals (zydrine, megacyte, morphite) actually get hauled up to empire in significant quantities. most of the others are used for manufacturing so we have ships to fly.a much better idea, since most of the nocxium actually comes from highsec belts (pyroxeres ore), would be to make highsec mining more dynamic, and rebalance the ores to give less of the mid-range minerals, and more of the low ends. this would both boost the drone regions, and make lowsec more attractive.[/shameless boost request]"
"fix for both of you. add drone bounties and sec increases. then add the content of zydrine in jaspet to 5% yield to put it more inline with low sec minerals....oh and a bump for fellow caldari pilots put a roid in cladari low sec that gives a high end mineral....currently kernite only yields isogen that can't be found in caldar high sec but easily found in gallente or amarr space wtf??? carbears are happy and drone region is actually worth something."
"ah yes, there are plenty of 90 day cards around there, and they knocked down the prices of gtc's to be inline with credit card or other forms of subscription.oh wait, no, that didn't happen at all."
"of course they didn't, they are a company that would prefer a regular cashflow, hence a price differential to encourage players to use credit card payments etc. many companies do it (eg, in uk companies give discounts for paying regular direct debits instead of billing/payment). besides this inducement to move to credit card payments, there is the matter of reseller profits to consider. a company selling gtc needs to make a profit on them. ccp need their bottom line. add these together, you get a more expensive gtc than just paying for your time direct with ccp. buying a gtc from ccp can't be cheaper than resellers, otherwise no-one would buy from resellers, number gtc sold (and hence players logging in) would drop.the 30 day pl, available in-game on markets, allows you to buy multiples of 30 days for isk...ie, no rl cost to you at all. if you are smart enough, or partake in the right activities, you can play without costing a cent (or whatever) of you rl money.take care,arithron"
"cant happen. just say no."
"scamming is fine.they add flavour and character to eve :)"
"scamming is an extreme edge of the diversity and openness of the eve economic and trade platform. it should be no more banned than people who adjust their orders by 0.01 isk.neither are very sexy, clever or creative, but they do have their place."

"ankhesentapemkah, i think you are misunderstanding the idiosyncracies with the current spawning system. of course i could be wrong. let's confirm my understanding of your understanding of the issue:you believe that the current system is such that when a system is captured, it respawns somewhere else, and that constant 'farming' of high-traffic systems (combined with the fw hinterlands remaining relatively untouched) causes complexes to accumulate in out-of the way systems, leading to a shortage of complexes in high-value systems until such time as the complexes in the boondocks are captured and redistributed (in some cases to high-traffic systems), or until dt, when the complexes are reallocated.while this is true to an extent, if that was all there was to it, then the problem could be addressed by more aggressively searching lesser-used systems. the post-dt crowd would still have an advantage in that almost every system would have a few plexes immediately available, but the remainder of fw could still force plexes to spawn in target systems with enough effort.unfortunately, the problem is worse than that (and also difficult to explain, but i'll try). during any given day, the number and ownership of each complex in a region is fixed and proportional to system control. i don't know how many complexes exist for each region, but for the sake of argument let's say that the bleak lands has sixty complexes distributed among it's fifteen systems. if the bleaks began the day with kourmonen under matari control and the balance under amarr control, then there might be four matari complexes in kourmonen and fifty-six elsewhere. dt ends, and the post dt crowd captures the kourmonen complexes as quickly as possible, since it has been declared a primary target by the fw flavor text.as each matari complex is captured, it respawns to a random location. if that random location happens to be kourmonen, then \"all is well\" and the post-dt crowd gets an extra complex to locate and capture. however, if it spawns to any other system then it will, in effect, become invalid and unavailable for use for the remainder of the day -- because it will continue to be a matari complex, and therefore can't be discovered and captured while in an amarrian system. and the same time, as amarrian complexes are captured elsewhere in the region, some of them might end up in kourmonen. but those, too, will become invalid, since they are amarrian complexes in a matari system.this has two key effects. first, the total number of complexes in the region decays over the course of the day. second, the number of matari complexes in kourmonen drops to zero almost immediately, as each complex has about a 93% chance of being spawned to an invalid system each time it's captured. so only those active in the half hour or so immediately after dt have any chance at all of capturing complexes in kourmonen.while the problem you describe is worth addressing, this problem is entirely crippling. and it needs desperately to be addressed. greyscale's comments show that they are aware of the problem, yet uninterested in solving it."
"its not that hard i think. maybe it should work like this. if you dock in with your ship in to a carrier, then your ship will be stored like atm in a carrier in the ship hangar. after this you can only see (look at like)the carrier like your own ship, but you can't control it, you can only leave the ship in a pod, or in the last used ship if its in the hangar. if the carrier use a portal you go together with it.if someone destroy the carrier all the pods drops out."
"so they perhaps put a team on the project of optimizing and creating a change that will allow this.as a note; you can check the ccp panel videosomeone suggested an idea of hostage taking and such. if they were to try this... they would also have the same database issue.actually afaik they would be all destroyed. anything inside the ship maintenance or corp hangar is automatically destroyed."
"well, you hit a major one with me, darius.thier customer service is horrid. just look at the forums. reams of posts on the qr patch being laggy and riddled with game-breaking bugs. a week after this patch, and nothing ... no response, paying customers gettting more ****ed each day. and they are logging off. how many won't come back?do you know that issues, workarounds & localization section, where players are *****ing 24/7 about qr bugs has yet to be updated with any current bug info? \"known issue page updated: empyrean age 1.1\" (last thread sticky)the known issues page hasn't been updated since 9/1. seriously, what in the hell.literally, even their facebok page has issues about qr lag and crap gameplay. and i'm not even talking about the missile nerf.i honestly have come to the conclusion that ccp must not play the game. bug reports ignored, portraits not updated, bugs not even acknowledged. this company has 400 employees. what are they doing? drinking coffee and eating donuts all day? smoking weed?i have 4 accts, jarius. you get ccp to communicate and i will vote for you on every one. right now i'm too ****ed to even log in this bugged qr release. i'm more ****ed ccp has ignored thousands of their customers without so much as a response 'we are aware of the issues and a patch will be released soon to address xyz bug'fix it!"
"maybe you are unaware of this, but if you encounter issues with the client, this includes after a patch, you are way better off bug reporting the issue. gm's don't handle bugs, quality assurance does (ie. the people you send bug reports to).as for people being upset and logging off, look there is nothing anyone can do within the timeframe that you want, that will make you happy, it is simply unrealistic. however if you believe nothing is being done to address to various issues, then you are sorely mistaken.\"paying customer\" only equates to you being allowed to not pay if you are unsatisfied with the service provided, not that you can boss them around.i have to agree with you here that they need to update their material, but that still doesn't invalidate my point about filing bug reports.i don't know this for a fact, but i wouldn't imagine that the developers posting the material on the website, are the same people who actually work on the reported issues, it would be a waste of resources.bug reports are certainly not ignored, that's imperically proven time and time again, and i've played since 2004 so i've seen patchnotes that include things i've bug reported, many a times.as for what they are doing, most likely drinking coffee as you said, but for a reason. they work extremely hard - they may not pull it off that well all the time but i have only witnessed them improving over the years.back up your claims with hard data in regards to ccp ignoring thousands of their customers and i'll be more inclined to consider your words more than just mouth-diarreah."
"hi cardela, i didn't realize you were an alt of darius.let me give you an example or two of a couple dozen ****ed off customers who were ignored, some who have already canceled."
"i'm notbeing told when he \"can play the game\", which i believe to be an exaggeration at this point, because i for one *play* the game every day - maybe not as smoothly as i'd like it to be, but it's doable - is an impossible question to answer, as first there would have to be an existing deadline, secondly this deadline would need address the specific circumstances of the user, which is impossible. thirdly they'd have to agree with him that it's unplayable.i'm not saying i think it's cool that ccp aren't responding in a basic fashion, but chances are they have a good reason for it, and yelling from our side won't make it any better.if bugreports are being filed with the proper data (i'm not sure what that is exactly, but i'd venture a guess it's dxdiag files and logserver files), i dare say that it is being addressed, it's just a matter of time...however the cruel thing about software though is that problems are sometimes simple and takes a day or 2 to make a fix for, or, it's extremely elusive and you have to use several weeks to find out, testing, trying new methods, rewriting code and so on..i know this, as i'm a software developer myself.now i can easily imagine with a piece of software like eve, that an elusive issue might occur like, 20 times all at one time, with 20 different issues.oh i know what your point is, but that doesn't mean you've made it, or for that matter provided data to your claim about \"thousands of customers ignored\".frankly it's just more mouth diarreah.oh i already agreed with you that ccp could with communication improvement, i really did, and still do. however that doesn't lend credence to your other arguments."
"i believe that was one of the major points i've tried to drive home with them and i believe they're aware that it's something which needs to be remedied. we have seen an uptick in communication regarding certain necessary items, like updates from the lag team. i believe personally that they may very well need a team responsible for this communication. they may also be able to get away with just one or two people focusing on the need, or expressing in no uncertain terms to their staff that it's something they need to make a priority. one thing to keep in mind is that the playerbase itself also has some extremes and we need to be careful to temper what is feasible against unreasonable expectations. i honestly believe though that there is a happy medium which can be worked out that will leave the majority on both sides of the fence feeling more satisfied. it's a slippery slope but a necessary one to travel."
"you got my vote, i want to see the skill queue getting pushed forward."
"go post in c&p if you want to engage in trolling behavior. jetcans have a timer. this the mechanism intended to keep people from storing \"crap\" in space. anyways, i digress. stick to the topic next time.furthermore, it was a suggestion. an idea. something to be improved upon. in the spirit of the csm... for the improvement of eve for all."
"deployable containers are useless for mining purposes, they can hold 1-2 cycles of ore on a t2 fitted hulk.i think the \"huge\" and \"giant\" cans should be bigger as their names imply, and maybe more expensive also.can flipping is a way for wannabe pvpers to grief noob carebears. only thing it does, is people drop mining and do missions, zero risk and decent rewards.the only people mining in high sec is people running a macro script, more or less."
"jetcans were never meant to be used by miners as a method of storing vast amounts of ore in space. it was for this very reason why at one point taking from a can did not even trigger an aggression flag, and why at one point ccp said this would not change despite the protests of highsec miners.eventually ccp did change this and the situation became even worse for miners as they began not only losing their ore but their ships as well.as the complaints of jetcan miners continue even today i caution the complainers that not all change is good, nor does all change have the intended consequences. tens of thousands of mining vessels have been destroyed as a result of the changes stemming from the last batch of complaints.!khoda"
"i am on topic my friend, and i'll tell you where to take your 'trolling' comment. your idea is malformed, as it also nerfs the abilities of other non-corpmates from removing stuff from a jetcan without taking a sec hit. many corporations use non-corpmates for the transfer of materials from jetcans, and with your idea, you make that impossible.sure, you can throw out the 'gang mechanic' as a possible solution, but my point remains - jetcans are simply 'garbage cans in space'. they are not, and should not, be policed by anyone except the owner."
"i have quoted you and removed points not relevant to the dicussion at hand. for the improvement of all remains the point of this.you have a single point here, with a possible solution. anybody else want to suggest something constructive regarding can-flipping?"
"edit: for brevityi agree with having a sec status hit for taking loot. the aggression mechanic is weird as it stands today, and doesn't really work right. newbie miners should not be losing ships to pvp baiting, and players who repeatedly can-flip don't really belong in hi-sec space anyway."

"issler dainze - csm candiadate - \"let me be your voice when you scream in space!\"i wanted to say thank you to everyone that has contacted me to let me know they support my views and have voted for me. when i decided to run i expected very little support since i'm not part of one of the bigger alliances or particularly well known. i also worried my focus on the non-pvp parts of eve would reduce my support. this is one time i am happy to be wrong! so thank you all again!i also felt it was time for me to talk about another aspect of eve. so how about a ramble for the new pilots in eve. this won't be about game mechanics so much as some suggestions to new pilots.life in the 'verse is hard. i've seen many a pilot arrive, become quickly discouraged and leave for who knows where (i suspect some lame virtual forest with elves and orks... makes me shudder to think about it!!). so if you are a new arrival to eve a couple of words of advice and encouragement.1. finish the tutorials and initial missions. that simple first step will help you more than you could ever know.2. ask questions. there is a whole 'verse full of folk ready to point you in the right direction. local, the initial corporation channel, the other new pilots channels and the forums all can make something intitally impossible to figure crystal clear.3. that crazy internet thing is your friend. there are large numbers of resources out there to help you succeed.4. do not become discouraged! maybe this should be thing number one. everyone in eve has setbacks. it is part of the experience. it may hurt, you may ask yourself why waste your time but i assure you that you can recover. as a note, please keep that clone current! 5. consider a pilot run corporation. there are large numbers of corporations that can help you get a leg up. there are many ways to find one. the forums, the recruiting channel in game (that can be a challenge) or just keeping an eye out. look at the corporations that have recruiting ads in the area you operate. or keep an eye out in local, chances are you are going to see some corporations regularly operating where you are living. chat up someone that you see in the area regularly. when you contact a corp be sure to ask what their focus is, when they are active and what their expectations are from their members. if they seem like a match, give them a try. if not, there are plenty of others out there. finally, if you join and they aren't a good fit move on, there are others out there and i am sure there is a better fit to be found.6. let yourself try different things. eve is unique in that you really aren't locked into a career path. you owe it to yourself to try a broad range of things to make sure there isn't something you are missing. if at some time you find things feel stale, shake it up, change your focus for a while.7. it's a big 'verse, why not see some more of it! open that map up and just look at all those systems! get out once in a while, check out the eve gate or some of the other amazing locations.8. remember it is supposed to be fun! eve can get serious and intense. don't let yourself become so focused that you lose track of the fact you are supposed to be enjoying yourself! take a deep breath once in a while and make sure you are doing something you like doing.9. take a chance once in a while! eve is all about risk and reward! don't be afraid to take a chance once in a while! you might be surprised!hope that can help some of you \"fresh outs\" start you long careers in the 'verse! if you ever see me out and about be sure to say \"hi\"!remember, \"stuffs getting better! stuffs getting better every day! \"issler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord"

(at least that is what i did and i stopped at 1/3 of the list for 2 accounts ;) ) just delete the post pls if this has been discussed/pruposed already"
"i would like to veto this measure"
"i agree fully. using the same random list for everybody is a bad system - just look at the well-documented and large advantage you get in municipal politics from having a last name earlier in the alphabet. i can see some utility to having the ability to look at half of them, close the window, and come back to them in the same order, but there are better ways of doing that - alphabetical order, starting with number (accountid mod 42), say. much as i'm sure pattern is happy with the current system, it's not a good one. and no, i'm not just saying that because of my position on the list - i'm in the top third, it could be a lot worse. besides, if i win, i'd rather it be because i'm better than my opponents instead of just being luckier."
"i have a counter proposal, instead, we just flip the list.;)"

"roberts rules does not negate petty infighting. it formalizes a system by which people interact. this system reduces confusion when a large amount of people have to deal with one another. if people do not recognize the authority, no bureaucracy is going to change that and the petty infighting will be just as bad as it is with or without rro.the csm should be a sufficiently small body that it does not need a formalized bureaucracy in order to function, and as long as everyone accepts the administrator then there should be few conflicts.the problems of the first csm had nothing to do with a lack of bureaucracy and everything to do with the members not accepting authority claimed by the chair and the actions taken."
"i should clarify that sentence - i don't mean it as an insult, and i do include myself in that. \"geeks\" is fairly obvious - we're all people who not only play an internet spaceship game and spend goodly amounts of time on it, we like it enough to want to run for office inside the game and care enough about political processes to want to fight and win elections. \"egotistical\" is a bit more tenuous, but i think it's a fair generalization - i know quite a lot of politicians, and few are truly humble, even though a lot of them pretend. nobody would run for office unless they had a certain force of personality. you have to think you can do well in the job(better than your opponents, usually), and you have to think that you can win. some candidates are jokers or slackers, but they don't really count. the average candidate who gets elected has a strong vision, a strong commitment to seeing it enacted, and a strong belief in the merits of themselves and their ideas. those generally aren't bad things, but they do certainly lead to conflict. they don't negate it, they do channel it. and while large groups will always need rules of order, small groups will still usually need it - i've seen groups as small as five where dedication to the rules was critical to continued function. besides, 9-14 isn't especially small as groups go, especially when there's no clearcut groups to simplify interactions. as for everyone accepting the administrator, therein lies the biggest problem of the first term's discord - there was serious disagreement over the proper roles and powers of the chair last term. for that matter, those still haven't been solved, there's just been non-aggression on that front for the last few months. you say that there wouldn't be a problem if everyone agreed on what the chair did and how, and for that matter you're right. now when you tell me how to get jade constantine to agree with you on those issues, i'll think that your ideals are achievable. until then, i'd prefer to use rules rather than an assumption of agreement when no agreement exists. it's not ideal, but it's better than closing your eyes to reality."
"i would like to state for the record that i, garion avarr, am an egotistical geek.i do like to think that i'm not blindly egotistical, though. but egotistical enough to think that i have good ideas and would make a good csm member."
"larger i have no objection to, but it's a really minor change."
"no, but it does mean that they cannot be challenging and interesting in the same manner that humans can.yes.man what? since when, you've been suggesting decreasing the differences between low-sec and empire in terms of mining.i am not sure what dwarf fortress has to do with eve, but it is not analogous to eve, mining in eve, or anything that can be done. yes, if we delete the entire eve client and start from scratch as a god game we can make mining interesting by adding things entirely unrelated to the act of mining.it is a sandbox game, not a beach game. you can play within the confines of the system.the confines of eve are competition, competition in the markets, competition for space, competition for resources. if you don't want to compete, no, you don't get to play eve. too bad, that is outside the box, it cannot be modeled on the eve system without removing the planks that keep the sand from washing away.same thing, less time finding roids= less cost of mining = more profit in empire = the thing that we have been telling you is bad this entire time."
"so? i tend to prefer to play against good or challenging computers, specifically because they do not have to adhere to the same rules that players do and thus can provide different challenges, because computers can control multiple units a the same time, and because they keep their mouth shut.yes.really? how? i don't even have to be logged in to the game to progress in such manner.actually, not at all, as i've said i'm all for making low-sec more lucrative.surely the point went way over your head. we were discussing dynamic game content, and if it was possible. it certainly is. clients do not have anything to do with this, the underlying game mechanics have.i disagree that eve has to have any form of competition, and i refuse to compete, and i am playing eve. so you are wrong.you are just looking through your own glasses and fail to see from a different, objective perspective. playing without competition is a valid play style, just like solo play is. yes there might be some interaction with other people, but that does not mean it competes on any scale. deal with it.you're making a mountain out of a molehill, cutting down search times will only have a marginal effect on mineral production, but improve gameplay for many players."
"the risk is zero. or 1, however you want to define it.i am sorry, you're right, i should have said that we have to scrap the entire game of eve and start anew. whoops, my bad.you buy things on the market? you mine? you're competing. removing that competition would be antithetical to the game design goal.no, see their search times are already zero. you just go to any belt in 0.0 or lowsec and you're golden. it is not the search that they are looking for but the risk. lowering that search time is a flat profit boost to empire mining.the last thing we need is a flat profit boost to empire mining. how simple does it have to be before you get that?"
"quit being silly. if there are no factors that compose risk, then there is no risk. so there is no risk to training skills.these game mechanics are compeletely compatible with eve. it's not like i'm asking for a true physics engine or anything. hell, hobbyists (like me) even managed to build things in this direction into ultima online, when they built player-run towns, dynamic progressive spawning, and parametric ai that went beyond the simple finite state machines we originally had. there is no reason why eve should continue to have the static environment it has nowadays.no, no and no. and if i was mining i'd mine in my own private mission spawns. the ship i fly was given to me, and the fitting is my own loot. even in factional warfare i did not compete, if anyone warped into my complex, i'd leave and they could have it. since the complex would respawn somewhere immediately, i never consumed resources. i never even had to fire a shot, and the ships i flew were unfitted t1 frigs.lowsec and 0.0 is not an option to a large amount of players, and as i said lowering the search time is too marginal to influence profit that much. all it does is allow casual players, that do not have much time to play eve, to get into the 'action' when they log in."
"just quoting."
"if you were at the factional warfare roundtables, i told there, and i told ccp in the fw document, which is public by the way. also said it at the promotion thread.i still think that my ranks are well deserved, as it took me 3 months to capture all 523 required complexes, and at the end i spent 14 hours straight on a single day to get it all finished in time for the fanfest. i invest time, i get reward. that is completely fair. and in fact it cost me a lot of money and completely bankrupted me at the end, due to loss of ships and clones. definately deserve the rank now, i invest isk, and i get a shiny rank icon in return.people could, and sometimes would try to stop me.sometimes i had an entire fleet in the system and noone would bother with these plexes. not my problem, eh? my actions do not harm anyone, so there is no problem."
"you don't need to defend yourself, i was only quoting you."
"either way it's gone completely off topic.goumindong, i've been thinking about this on the way home, and i understand where you are coming from, but i do not think we can come to any productive agreement or solution on how mining could be improved. i'm worried that we will end up with bickering back and forth. we both agree that there should be more incentives for low-sec. i believe you are taking things i say out of context or inflate what you perceive as negative aspects of them.i do not like that you only quote parts of my posts, focussing on negative things and replying with more attacks, rather than working towards solutions and agreement by coming up with your own suggestions and improvements.i hope that if you become a csm, you learn that eve is more than your own playstyle, and you should be able to at least understand the concerns and motives of people other than your own, just like i understand people that do empire-building in 0.0, those that want to partake in small gang warfare, and the players that want to conduct piracy in lowsec.yes eve has competition, pretty tough competition too, which is good for some people. but there are also some that do not want to compete, or have entirely different views and interests when they play eve than both of us.either way i lost interest in competing with you in this thread. if you want to collaborate in the future, csm or not, you are more than welcome, though."
"i fail to understand the reason why you did that though, care to explain?"
"zero risk is risk. just as zero is still a number even though it is a number composed of nothing. training skills has zero risk because its expected return is always the same. that simply means its not a risky endeavor, that dies not mean that it does not account for risk.bull. top down single player god game mechanics are not compatible with eve. if you think they are, prove it. design the system, you don't have to code it, just design it.and i suppose you never bought anything from anyone, you never sold anything to anyone. you never had any friends who gave you anything[that is competition, though in a different structure than the same], you never built anything, never researched any blueprints, never undocked and warped to factional warfare complex which, if captured, would provide a shift in the strength of one faction over another. you only ever bought and sold to npcs? i call bs.not that any of that matters, because the rest of the game, which is to say, everyone else playing, is competing.if lowsec and 0.0 is not an \"option\" for a large amounts of players they are just going to have to figure out how they are going to get what they want in empire. the fact is that it is not that hard to be a casual player in low-sec or 0.0. corps want all the bodies they can get, even if their play time is not prodigious. the vast majority of reasons why people don't go into low-sec and 0.0 has nothing to do with some foolish notion that players \"simply can't do it\" and everything to do with costs and benefits. gf takes new players right out of creation and throws them into 0.0. these players have no skills, knowledge, or aptitude and they can make it out in lawless space. there is no reason why anyone would then be unable to make it in low-sec. except that the costs are too high, and the benefits too low when compared to less risky activities.decreasing the costs and/or increasing the benefits of those less risky activities then has precisely the opposite effect that is needed. it drives people too empire, and locks out the majority of the game, the actual fun game that is sitting there waiting to be played. but isn't because its not profitable to do so and the fun is esoteric. two people are sitting on a bench. one says to the other \"i agree we need to improve the cities water supply, that is why i propose that we dump large quantities of arsenic into the water supply\"the other says \"what? no, that will have exactly the opposite effect as what you want to happen\"you're the person proposing the arsenic."
"goumindong, i'm not replying anymore, it simply is not constructive and will only be childish \"is not!\" \"is so!\" between the two of us, which won't get either of us anywhere.so have fun doing your stuff in eve, i've already said what i wanted, and i'm sure you have made your points too."
"vily, szent/lexx is banned for 14 days; so these questions are coming from an alt.1. many people have asked you for a stance on the nano - nerf; as you are probably aware the thread for 'don't nerf nanos' went to around 70 pages, and yet they were still nerfed heavily (even without the refinements suggested by the players on sisi). from my point of view this provides a case - in - point on how ccp fail to listen to the established playerbase, if elected would you bring this specific point to them? because whether the nano changes were warrented or not it was clear what the player base wanted, would you question them directly on this and other such changes made in lieu of the player base's feeings (e.g. missile changes), and how it displays contradictory statements on their part to the extreme of ignoring their playerbase?2. with reference to viper's questions on kug, what is your view on meta - gaming in general?3. what would you do personally to bring current gtc prices down, and perhaps regulate them for the future?4. please suggest an adequate 'fix' for lowsec. 5. if you could replace pos warefare with another sovereignty mechanic, what would it be?6. currently 0.0 could arguably be defined as a 'no go zone' for smaller bands of players unwilling to pay rent to master alliances due to current sovereignty mechanics - could you suggest a fix to encourage more small corp participation in 0.0 on a meaningful level?7. what are your views on solo players, in particular the current state of solo - pvp?8. finally, motherships really have little usefullness or uniquness that justifies their price in todays large scale alliance warefare outside of protecting cynojammers; with the prices of supercaps coming down this issue has become more apparant as of late as more people hop in them. if you could suggest a unique bonus to motherships to make them more than a liability in fleets what would that bonus be? what niche would you put motherships in? do you agree with my view?"
"awesome ideas. suggestions in general...:-i'm not a fan of where it produces fuel for pos's, though im open to it. its been mention how it will have detrimental effects on the economy of high sec ice miners. a alternative --- maybe a source for t3 mats, or the non-ice fuel for pos's? -definitely needs to be for empire as well. though there should be some limits on what it can produce compared to its 0.0 counter-part.-this is a great opportunity for growth in small scale hauling missions, contracting out fuel transporting and delivering, or market trading.-to go with the above suggestion, maybe make some npc sub-stations for the \"grain/oxygen/cattle\" stuff to be sold or distributed from? (this is where the missions would come in, bringing supplies to other npc colonies or some such)-substations only have a fitting changing ability, plus the ability to move the input and output items around. maybe a limited personal hanger size for docking peoples? this would allow some mod changing, but its main purpose is one thing... picking up/dropping off fuel.-for the sub-station in orbit,(im not sure if this is already said or not) they should be able to be sieged(have enough hp that this is required) with caps (or big bs fleets)and have no timer so that it can be destroyed right then and then. and the only loss would be the sub-station(so basically isk), and it would drop some portion of whatever was in it(input/output fuels and mats)-people were discussing that the longer colonies exist, the less fuel it requires to run and maybe instead produces colony fuel after long periods. but for colony destruction, after a colony is setup on a planet, i think that it should 1. not be reset after destruction as if it was a new colony. 2. start fresh after destruction, but at a accelerated rate of requiring less fuel. 3. have a timer. otherwise a hostile force could come in, and pop the colonies before a defense force could form, or if it was a different tz, etc and move to intercept the attackers. these options allow a quick return to normal operations in colony food/mat production after a colony was destroyed. there would still be the isk loss, but it wouldn't soak up even more money through food/fuel.-sub-station must be destroyed before colony.sry if these are repeat ideas.ps. love the pirating/raiding idea to steal fuel/output"

"so heres the thing, it may be according to eft but ingame there is no major change as tested on my gallente character ie just so you get it! not a butt load of difference, compared to my caldari character which is noticably less than what it was, which was less than my gallente character in the first place before the patch....is that clear enough or do i have to draw you a picture. im not talking about eft comparisons, im talking ingame.basically although i have t2 siege missiles trained i may as well use faction or standard torps because there is now no real benefit of using rage at all, and precision....yeah righti am not talking about soloing a raven, i have never bothered to try soloing a raven for a long long time....does void ammo need looking at yes it does, but this thread isnt about void ammothats a thought maybe i can bribe someone with a picture of a spider.and quite frankly i am not your bud, i am well aware of the ingame capabilities of both ships as i fly both types on different characters and my caldari pilot is better specced than my gallente one for those specific ships. and it isnt just torpedoes that are suffering from problems either, but i am not directly comparing them atm to my other characters"
"signed..this is a stupid nerf, everyone know's that missile boats are used by mission runners not pvp'ers.the only thing this nerf has done is to annoy mission runners just for the sake of creating a nerf.there's a saying \"dont fix what isnt broke\"maybe ccp should remember this when tweeking with things and consentrate on fixing existing bugs rather than nerfing stuff all day long."
"im sorry but i pvp in missile ships all the time, and they should be beter than they were and are for pvp, and shouldnt just be looked at by the masses as pve ships"
"this imo is a stupid idea...while i agree that the current wardecc'ing system needs looking at i still think that the agressed corp should have a choice too.all this does is allow pirate corps to wardecc carebears in highsec and create a \"surrender\" condition if an isk amount thus fueling more wardecc's and disbanding small corps.many corps in high sec dont want to participate in pew pew, thats why there in highsec and to force them to pew pew against their will is wrong imo.in comparison to the small area of empire and the rest of the eve universe there are hundreds/thousands of systems in lowsec and 0.0 were crazed trigger happy people can kill each other all day long why go into highsec and pick on small noob corps?.if i was to make a change to wardecc's my personal opinion would be to only allow pew pew in highsec if the agressed corp consents to the war."
"yes, because that's how real wars work."
"intriguing idea....."
"well smarty pants, what would you recomend????this is going to be an ongoing battle between the pvp comunity and the carebear comunity.ccp's official responce to ppl whining about wardecc's is : \" go join an npc corp\"but if they do that the pvp'er whine that they cannot wardecc all those lovely poor helpless carebears.atho i agree that pvp is an essential part of the eve uiniverse for the moment there is no resbite for the carebears in eve as ccp dont give a toss and pvp'er just wanna kill them all day long.let me ask you this...if yu was a caebear would you like to be shot at and wardecc'd every day of the year thus stopping yu from playing becouse someone wants to wave their e-peen around?.pvp is part of eve but so is being a carebear this is something that will always be the case, how far do you think your pew pew will get you if their was no carebears around to make your ships, ammo, fittings or rigs?and if your going to use the age old responce of \"i make all my own stuff so dont need any one\" then doesn't that make you a carebear too or do you already have every bpo/bpc in the game with maxed out refining and building skills?"
"people will point out that this falls along the same vain has the cost of the war dec. too cheap. 50 million a week is chicken feed to a 6 month old corp. heck, it's chicken feed for one person running level 4 missions.you want to pay for protection? the mechanism is already there. hire mercs."
"i recommend wow, where you can play 'intanced' pvp to your hearts' desire. (you expected something more mature to the 'smarty pants' comment?)actually, more often than not, carebears do not argue for \"permissions-based pvp\". they understand the mechanic, and take precautions against it. this can include hiring mercenaries to do their fighting, or they focus more on \"docked\" activities, such as market pvp.i believe the pvp community, as a whole, don't really care about it, since there's never a shortfall of targets in player-run corporations.true. working as intended. only the strong survive.hi. we haven't met, but i'm tchell dahhn, ceo of suddenly ninjas. we're a ninja salvaging corp, not a pvp-based corp, and we've been around for 6 months, and have been wardecced since our second week, when we only had twelve members. (that's consistently, my friend.) i created our corporation because i believe that ninja salvagers shouldn't hide out in an npc corp.has it been easy? no. hell, no. have we adapted? absolutely. have we been preyed upon by superior (see: epeen waving) foes? absolutely. did we disband? did we whine? no.the \"big guy\" preying on the \"little guy\" is inevitable, if you make yourself a big enough target.so, work on what you can do to make yourselves an unappealing target. don't smack in local. don't go out of your way to look tempting. get some help. find some friends who want to fight, who want to help you.there will always be carebears. there may not be whiny carebears, since a lot of them will emoragequit, or move to instanced pvp (see: wow) or evolve, but that's the way the game works.don't worry - most of our members are carebears. we've just adapted, and we're still around. and guess what? we enjoy the game more today than we did when we started.that's the way it goes."
"skill queue is a must now with all the nerfing going on."

"let us retain control of our drones/fighters/scan probes when we log back, please.and make the the drones going back the deadspace's first pocket entry poiny when in a deadspace, or allow us to come back right into the deadspace after a disconnection."
"yes.though i'd settle for those rats not already aggressed onto the drones going to a neutral stance once the controlling player warps off."
"thumbs downccp please, for the love of god, do not make any of the changes suggested in this thread. make a new class of ships which are gimpy logistic covert bridging ships with cov ops cloaks, no tanks, no dps, and 50% recon ewar bonuses, for all the people asking for that.for black ops, please add the seperate fuel bay, allow covert cyno's into cynojammed systems, increase the base stats a bit up closer to their t1 counterparts/give it t2 resists, give it a role bonus in addition to the 125% speed while cloaked, -20% scan res penalty/-20% cpu cost per level as well. black ops level 5 = 0 scan res penalty, 0 cpu cost from any cloak (you still can fit t2/faction/etc higher meta level cloaks to increase your speed while cloaked, but can fit any cloak without losing scan res or taking up all of your cpu).other than that, increase range to 3ly from 2ly? would be very happy with blackops with these changes :)"

"serious thumbs up for this one. it's time we dragged the eve mail client kicking and screaming into... well, the nineties would be a nice start."
"i know that ccp is in negotiation with intel for new servers, but maybe they should look elsewhere for system improvements. talk with opera/firefox for an improved igb, talk with ipswitch or somebody like that for an evemail server, talk to any one of the numerous forum softwares (such as the free ones for websites).admittedly, these are not absolutely critical changes, but they go a long way towards qol upgrades. i mean, how many times do you have to log into the forums just to post a stinking message?!?"
"totally agree with all of the above posts."
"we already discussed a new evemail system. it will be a part of the cosmos project which ccp showed off a bit at fanfest.you should read the minutes of our meetings with ccp. but i assume you did that seeing as you are a candidate .the changes to how many mails there can be shown was obivously also something ccp did based on csm's issue raised about too many mails in one's inbox making your evemail unfunctional. but there is too many problems with the proposed way."
"if they discuss improvements and then implement feature removals, i feel wholly justified in attacking them. i'm judging what they're doing, not what they've said."
"i'm aware that the csm has raised the issue about the evemail system with ccp -- but the current changes ccp has said are planned suggests to me that the csm might need to raise it again and insist that it be dealt with in a sane way."

"in the eve universe it makes sense that you should be able to pay off the interstellar cops to raise your sec status. i had heard in another post i put on this topic that it was in the eve beta, and they took it out. i think this would be a great time to bring it back.you should have another option other then ratting to raise sec status. having to rat doesn't make sense in both eve as a self contained narrative and as a game. you should be able to throw some iskies at concord to raise sec status. you make the cost a little prohibitive, and you now have an alternative from spending a week ratting in 0.0."
"afaik there's nobody in the csm who does trading a lot. first of all, we need to streamline the market. it's been untouched for a long time.first, i think you shouldnt have to go to 'my orders' page to modify your own orders.i also think you should be able to spot your own orders (it could be differently coloured)"
"i do trading.what is the problem with having to go to my orders? i open my wallet with my orders and then use the market order to spot if i'm the top bidder.as for the colour coding, there's the issue that we do have colour-blind people. but i quit elike the idea. but i don't think it's all the viable."
"good!!! so if you get to be a csm again you could drive our intrests! imo market hasn't been taking into consideration much. only thing we have now is economist and he has a good vision but its not enough. and if they make colour stuff it wont take anything away from the colour-blinded do they?"
"no need with colision damage (background explain very well why)but a tiny frig size should not be able to make a battle ship moving even a milimeter.same for bs on titans.drones sould never be allowed to bump any ship."
"motorcycle going 75 on the highway runs into a stopped semi-truck at an intersection. the truck realigns slightly and the motorcyclist is likely dead, careening off in a wild direction.now replace motorcycle with kamikaze airplane or frigate and semi-truck with aircraft carrier or battleship and the basic relationship should still hold.enter eve now, and the semi-truck is careening off.should the semi-truck be \"afraid\" of the frigate and \"emergency realign with super springs\"? no, it'll take the hit and damage as it continues in its normal direction. this damage could eventually destroy it (aka \"the massacre at jita 4-4\"), but at a minimum, the conservation of momentum should properly hold.a crow has mass of 1,000,000 kg. at 8,000 m/s, that's a momentum of 8x10^9 kgm/s.a megathron has a mass of 102,500,000 kg. if all that momentum were transfered to the megathron causing the crow to come to an instantaneous dead stop, that should give the megathron a velocity of ~80 m/s. the collision shouldn't be completely elastic, however. assuming a coefficient of restitution of .12 (which is an approximation for auto vehicle crashes), then the megathron should only be accelerated to 9.6 m/s.bring bumping more in line with reality. bumping in the current manner does not follow the principle of least surprise. you must be \"indoctrinated\" to the way in which bumping works in eve; it does not make intuitive sense."

"i don't want local to be nerfed."
"i'm for a local nerf, on the condition that it doesn't nerf the ability of players to gather intelligence on the system that they're in. in fact, i want to see intel capacity be improved when local is taken out, at least for those willing to invest a bit of time and effort. a blind nerf is not the goal here, a proper intel system is. chat channels have no place in a proper intel system, and as such they ought to be taken out. i don't know if that's the answer you want or not, but it's what i think."
"i like to have several ships around with basically the same fittings, but i hate the time i actually spend fitting ships.consequently, i'd like to be able to buy the stuff i need to fit x ships, fit the first, rightclick on the second (or the remaining stack of ships even) and choose \"fit by template\" and choose the first. all ships would then be fitted similarly (provided of course i have the required modules) and ready to go.i would even like to be able to save the fittings in some kind of \"fitting bpc\" and move them between stations, contract them to other people or whatever.this change would have no impact on in space gameplay whatsoever, but it would make fitting ships a lot easier if you are simply going for some standard fittings.you could also use it to prefit tacklers for instance and then setting them up for sale using contracts - it can be done today, but it is soooo boring fitting 10 ships one by one and i just couldn't be bothered.or how about fitting 25 arbies with tech i junk and then calling \"free drunken arbi op, x up\" in alliance and then going to waste it all?"
"supported, 100%."
"ack"
"i think this is a great idea. my personal view would be along the lines of a fitting bpc container for t1.it would be a container print that you place the bpo's of a ship and the components you want on it.the container would then have a rollup of all the minerals needed for production and the time it would take.you would then just install the whole set and when you diliver the production job it would be a fitted ship.t2 and beyond would need a lot more prints for production, component, invented prints."

"uhm... do you mean 'tier 2' as in 'not base, but just slightly better and still t1'? like named loot?or do you mean tech 2, the stuff with the pretty yellow icon in the upper corner?if so... yes, there are a lot of modules that could be much improved by t2 (such as the range on tractor beams), or even the implementation of diferent sizes (medium & large tractor beams)."
"thank you for pointing that out. that would explain why this thread wasn't getting the traffic i expected, or had hoped for. op edited."
"i had an idea about that a while ago. just delete the characters with less than 2m sp and whose accounts are inactive for 6 or more months. this would do nothing against those people with accounts that have been deactivated for a while due to rl issues, but only affect those who created a trial account and decided not to make it a full account."
"why even look at the sp ?i say that if the account was never upgraded from a trial account and has gone a year since the trial ended, then the account should be deleted. if they managed to somehow get a high sp character transferred to it, then it it also deleted."
"if they just did it to the trial accounts that were never turned into paid accounts i can't see a problem."

"you missed the obvious from my posts.1.) working as intended.2.) get over it.3.) these aren't the droids you're looking for. move along. move along."
"i'd like to see the jet-can mining issues solved along these lines:create a new can type ('protected mining can') that can be carried packaged by most ships, and when launched unpackages itself into a semi-secure can that can hold an amount similar to a jet-can. like the existing secure cans, the owner can set a password to limit access; unlike current secure cans, these cans are vulnerable to those with hacking skill. they should be a challenge to hack, so that hacking takes some time but is not impossible. any attempt to hack the can (successful or not) counts as aggression. furthermore, once hacking starts, the can's security system locks down the can completely, so that nobody can access the can while hacking is occuring. (this prevents the owner from just transferring the can's contents to another can to prevent the theft.) successfully hacking the can clears the password for fifteen minutes, allowing free access to the contents (though the can's ownership does not change).this would create a situation where ore-thieves can still engage in ore theft (albeit with a higher skill training requirement, thus eliminating newly-created and disposable alts from the profession), yet miners have the opportunity to defend their property, either by calling in reinforcements, switching to a combat ship, or racing against the thief to unload the can once it's hacked."
"interesting idea. perhaps our soon to be appointed csm candidates can use the ideas set forth for discussion."
"now that is an interesting solution. not sure it'd work, but it's the first quasi-sensible replacement for the jetcan system i've ever heard."
"i like your idea, and see it in a similar vein as salvaging, in the fact that it will receive a huge number of complaints by both sides. this, of course, makes it a smart and viable solution, since the ones that 'work' always seem to get an increased number of people angry.it takes skill, and there is an element of risk to all parties, and i like your idea."
"can flipping is fine as it is.if someone steals from you, one cant just go and steal it back without consequences, both in game as in life."
"can flipping is a valid part of the game, a basic introduction to players regarding theft and pvp. yes it is slightly lame to do it, however it can be easy to defend against and lowers empire becoming easy life carebear land."

"this is silly. there is no such thing as an 'anti-goon' or 'pro-goon' csm - any changes made to the game, with csm input or not, will help out some goons and screw over some others.the reality of having the largest numerical alliance in eve is that goons are involved in every aspect of this game. there are goons in t1 frigates, goons in nano-hacs, goons in covert ops ships, sniping battleships and trimarked blasterboats. there are goons in carriers, dreads, motherships, titans, rorquals and jump freighters. there are goons manufacturing with t2 bpos and goons inventing with datacores. there are goons who x up for 200-man fleetfights and goons that only fight in small gangs. there are goons that roam lowsec solo and goons that roam in highsec solo. there are goons who make their isk playing the market, goons selling timecards, goons running missions on highsec alts, goons picking through asteroids belts for unwanted salvage, goons multi-boxing half a dozen hulk pilots and goons scamming pubbies. there are goons with 1m skillpoints and goons with 60m skillpoints.so what exactly do you mean by 'anti-goon'?"
"ok will be a first time voter ;)but my question to the delegates...if you could remove a single aspect or function from the game which would it be?as an example mine would be the can baiters who sit in 1.0 & 0.9 with cans like \"great free gear for noobs\" written on them in the hope of killing a 3 day character. yes its against the rules in the starter system but not 1 jump out. thats my example can you offer yours.thanks and good luck to all the candidates for friday"
"i would probably remove jump bridges.they amplify blobbing and they make it almost risk-less to move across space."
"thanks for the quick response, and as a side note love the corp name *wonders is it named after the uk conservative party*"
"i would personally like to see eve without alts, as people avoid consequences by using alts for criminal actions or as an anonymous income source for other activities.and i'd like to see eve without smacktalkers and other childish people, and i suppose people that canbait noobs fall into that catagory as well.but neither of the two are realistic, unfortunately.i agree with lavista that jumpbridges are a plague in 0.0, and makes it too easy for large alliances to hold space without having vulnerable supply lines. it also invalidates small gang pvp.bah. i rather add things to eve than remove things..."
"a single thing to be removed? the first thing that comes to mind is doomsdays in their present form - switch them to either targeted damage or ewar, or maybe both(give people a choice). it's not as important as some other changes, but it's the top thing on my list that would qualify as a removal. removing jump-based transportation might be cool, but it will never happen, especially not now that jump freighters have been introduced. and the idea of removing alts is madness. as for can baiting, the warning messages should be written in such a way that what happens is made obvious to the 3-day noob, since they still actually read warning messages. the people who do it are pathetic, but they don't need to be nerfed explicitly."

"for me, i'd have to say the t1 meta 0 loot drops from npcs. they're depleting the market for the creation of t1 items, and they're flooding the market with minerals - sometimes even gaining more minerals per time period than mining would. meta 1 or higher items will remain in rat droppings, but get rid of the meta 0."
"if i could remove one thing from eve, i would remove npcs.now you can regret not paying me to run for csm, eh."
"i'd remove the \"emergency warp\" ability of all ships, so that the 'logoffski' trick would no longer work.if your internet connection goes down, your kid flips the power switch, your wife pulls the plug, you have a brownout, a blackout, you spill coffee on your computer, you have a flash flood, your water breaks, what have you, your ship stays in space... ...exactly where it is... until you log back on.it's all part of the experience, imho. for rp purposes, during the time you were away from the game, your ship's systems had a catastrophic failure, and scotty was busy rerouting power from the bridge controls to main engineering. if you get back in time to save your ship, fine. if not, you're in your pod, or you're in your clone bay.now, aren't you glad i'm not a candidate?

"aoe doomsdayssov and bridges just need some tweaking, the complains of the above are totally unfounded, we \"blobbed\" just as much before they were implemented."

"security status restrictions and responses in below .8 systems :)gates have responses (dwindling as sec gets lower), all other areas are a little wild...this is a 'wish', not something i'll be advocating!arithron"
"completely untrue and off base. whilst \"blobbing\" obviously occured before the deployment of jump bridges and cyno jammers - it was something that both sides could do. now only the defender can blob capitals via jump bridge into a cyno jammed system with inpunity and that throws out the balance and chances for a decent engagement.most people now see that the balance in 0.0 warfare is wrong and its certainly the case that over-proliferatiion of jump-bridges and cyno-jammers have removed a critical element from the game of eve online that we can call \"fun\". jump bridges promote threat-free logistics and make it easier to build vast space holding alliances that nobody has the patience to remove. cyno-jammers are single module that ensure overwhelming capital ship superiority for the defender and act as a massive disincentive to aggressive warfare. but combine the two modules together and you have the root-cause of many of the ills in the 0.0 game. i can understand why you are pro status quo on this issue goumindong because you come from an organisation with a vast jump bridge network that holds space protected by cyno-jammers (that you would not be able to hold in their absense) but as a csm delegate you need to learn to see the bigger picture and appreciate the future health of the game beyond your personal biased view of status quo maintenance. fortunately i'm pretty convinced that ccp are already convinced that 0.0 need to change urgently and there is limit to the damage you could do on the csm panel - but its useful for the electorate to see your gut instinct on the sovereignty tool issue is to slightly move around the deckchairs on the titanic rather than make an honest attempt to actually avoid the iceburg altogether."
"so, what you're saying is that i am right and that you have no clue what we are talking about? gotcha.1. yes, there are issues with sov and bridges, they need some tweaking. you would notice that i said \"they need some tweaking\". 2. no, they do not cause people to blob any more than they did, it just changes how those blobs got into the system. you will notice that the claim had nothing to do with logistics, creating empires, or capital ships. it simply has to do with a simple claim that the bridges cause \"blobbing\". this is false. hell, you just admitted it was false.3. the statements made earlier said that these needed to be completely rewritten and, in the case of jump bridges, removed. this is simply not true. a number of tweaks, like not allowing jump capable capitals to use jump bridges, and tweaking pos so that strategic modules are easier to disable with small gangs entirely solves the complaints regarding jump bridges.now stop lying about me, my goals, and how the game works and do something productive with your time."
"if i could remove one thing in eve it would be....low sec gate camps. the guns at the gates should be enough to keep those gates safe. i don't believe ccp intended folks to be able to sit and tank them all day. otherwise they wouldn't have put them there in the first place.issler"

"i'd like to know if there are any candidates who actually have improvements in the igb and/or api on their list of things to address. more and more web tool developers and corps are creating websites that they'd like to be able to access from in-game using the igb, but with the current igb implementation it's very impractical for a lot of things due to speed issues and lack of support for some basic features(and that's ignoring the fact that it's been nerfed in the qr release so far and just going on past performance).likewise, while the api has been a great addition, there are still some \"oddities\" here and there which seem to be very low priority for sorting out (for example, passing the player-designated names of items in the asset export), but which could lead to a whole new range of tools we could all potentially benefit from.essentially, i'm curious to know if there are any candidates who plan on bringing these sorts of issues to the table in addition to the usual \"game-play-related\" stuff (for which a policy of fixing what's there rather than adding loads of new stuff would get my vote! - it's time to consolidate ccp, not concentrate on new bits which will introduce new bugs)/my 2 cents"
"yes. that would be me.i have raised issues about the api and we discussed the igb with ccp in iceland.eventually we will see the igb replaced. at least ccp said so :)"
"what lavista said. we brought it up, as well as improvements to the email system, but ccp will not make improvements to the current one, but instead will replace it with a whole new thing in the future."
"the three most obvious and egregious problem with the game's support structures are the igb, evemail, and the forums. all three were embarrassments in 2003 and have gotten no better since, and any of them could be trivially upgraded within the space of five clicks on sourceforge. you'll also note that those are about the only three times my usual position of granting the devs as much leeway as possible falls by the wayside, because while their other mistakes are excusable, these ones simply are not. i've submitted 8-10 threads on the assembly hall, and still mentioned all three of those, because they really do matter to me(and aggravate me to no end). i don't know what the current api structures are in detail, so i can't comment as intelligently on what needs to be fixed there, but going by what others have said it's another thing that needs some work. i'm all ears when it comes to suggestions, and i'd like to build on past suggestions from the csm about possible upgrades. i know those aren't explicitly listed in my platform, but i put them under the header of ui improvements, which i've repeatedly stated is the most important issue in this game that the csm can have an impact on. so yes, i care."
"i am also quite ready to champion eve api and the igb myself, as i have been developed quite a few eve related tools (mostly web-based) myself. if you want a web developer in the csm, just vote for me."

"the fact alone that a majority of eve consider missiles to be for pve purposes only, detracts to the basic idea that they(missiles) aren't sufficent enough to pvp in. that alone would raise most concerns with the fact that an entire weapon system is gimped against others. this being before qr... and now after the patch, with missiles being worse, your justification is that missiles are for pve only.sadly i believe this was not so much an aim at missile nerf, as it was a stealth reliance on bringing target painters back as a legit form of acceptable ewar, just as rsd and ecm. honestly i dont have a problem with it the nerf as much, had they come out and stated that. but for god sake, bs vs bs warfare shouldnt require something to increase the sig of a 1m/s bs just so it can hit for full dmg, let alone if that bs is moving full speed without any propulsion mods. just as guns are different from missiles, sometimes they get their excellent blows, sometimes they get glancing blows. where as missiles have a cliff, before the cliff you can only do max dmg w/ multiple painters or a 0m/s bs, after the cliff they do exactly 0dmg. but this discussion shouldnt delve back into missiles vs guns. the fact these arguments exsisted before this missile nerf, they still are the same exact arguements after. earlier i already showed how the shield tanking bs's that are a 6mid 5low layout are pvp gimped in most instances requiring 3 pvp mods(1.ab/mwd 2. point 3. painter/web) but only having 2 slots in which to pull it off.where as the majority of bs's are armor tankers, which are also a majority of gun ships, that are a 7 low 4 mid setup, which allows for the 3 pvp mods plus 1 extra slot (cap, eccm, second web, sensor booster, second cap booster)both the 6/5 shield bs's and the 4/7 armor tank bs's in most instances can do their tank w/ 2 dmg mods sometimes only 1. the problem is if you give the raven that 7 mid, you seriously give it a chance of an amazing tank beyond almost every other bs in the game, including the teir 3's, if it wasnt given a pvp focus, or didnt have to worry about fitting the needed pvp mods due to a support fleet. that would create an imbalance. thats the basic problem at hand - ccp wants you to use a support fleet for pvping, maybe even for pve. coincidence that this lines up with a new power of 2 advert?... just after receiving the harsh backlash of retired/canceled accounts due to ghost training gankage. solo bs pvp is a dying art, let alone other solo work except for a small portion of ships they havent nerfed yet.i cant wait till t3 bs's come out, i want a 1 highslot bs, called the \"nerf bat\" - the dmg output of this ship well surpasses any other ship in this game"
"signedive played this game for a while now. call me boring but i get my kicks from sitting there blasting npcs with my caldari character and zipping around at daft m/s in my inty. thanks ccp u just destroyed most of that fun. for over 2 years i have honed this character in on caldari missiles and boats and as far as i can tell you have just decimated a lot of that training.when i think of the amount of money i have piled into this, like many others will have done (some more so) the prospect of retraining this character to get back where i was is stupid economy.i can understand some of the aspects to the inty and tackling patches, the missiles i do not and this is getting perilously close to being canceled (if i hadnt already put 6 months on 3 alts) and i assure i have played little else all year long. ccp sort this stupid missile nerf out or refund my money or give me the 10mil skill points (approx) to redistribute into useful skills.this nerf is so poorly thought out, as people have said guns have many advantages pre-patch compared to missiles, so if the angle is pvp is it not the guns that need reducing? you can say that i should use drones more, maybe, so make the drone bays bigger (myrm 150m3 drake 25m3?!). ok screw the explosion velocity stuff up, so make the target painters work more effectively so i dont have to swap all my lows for bcu's to get to where i was. sry im going on, but this has seriously narked me off like no other unnecessary nerf before. you have wasted my time and money, thanks"
"/signed"
"i believe the nerf was long over due but not to this level. the explosion radius should be set at a minimum to the highest base speed of that class of ship. a good place imo would be at base speed plus l2 speed skills. this will allow the computation to work a lot better at adjusting speed to damage. thank you for your time."
"the mentioned caps do need a look into, but how about a less drastic one for the nag:one more low, one less high, 3/3 guns/launchers"
"there are some serious clunks in this thread.it's quite unbelievable that there are some who expect in eve's \"harsh brutal world\" that living in empire equates to guaranteed safety. it quite simply isn't, it's just safer, it just means there are some safeguards, it doesn't mean a nursemaid will be at hand at all times.people need to look past the \"i don't want to fight\" mentality and accept that whether you like it or not, in this game, someone can war dec you under certain conditions. the game should not be bent to favour the mistaken preconceptions that they inadvertently brought to the game. it's always been this way in eve and it should remains so as it is a small minority's mistake.the initial post is unworkable, \"victory conditions\" and associated penalties for the losing party are so open to exploit it should never have been even brought up in its current form. though i think the op is well aware of this and quite frankly i suspect his motives.one thing that i don't believe has been suggested yet taps into the mentality of some eve players. some corps are 'ransomed' usually the player on the other end will flatly refuse point blank on principle never to hand over isk, however a mechanic to ensure that if a fiscal agreement by both parties were met then it was held to would be beneficial to the game. by this i mean, if through the war dec interface a demand for a sum of x isk was placed and the dec'd party agreed on condition that they would not receive another war dec for y weeks from the same attacker then this may give players more confidence than just trusting the word of the attackers ceo as it could be enforced by the system. naturally if those people attacking were to leave and reform under another corp to make another war dec then this is a clear and easily identified exploit that no-one would be stupid enough even to try. this wouldn't help people who would never hand over isk out of principle, but then neither do they defend themselves out of principle. this is their choice, if they suffer needlessly or have restricted play as a result then that is the consequence that they have brought largely upon themselves. i would have the members of the csm would remember that consequences are a key part of the game and would not act in a way that allows people to evade it.that said, it's all academic as i believe no action was ever taken regarding the ivy leagues exploit to evade a war dec and consequently this route is still open to all alliances that would like to shake of a war - although the alliance may need a player on the csm to pull it off captain thunk"

"it came up in a topic in general discussion that it really cuts into our time we have to spend on eve to stop and load up the log server and go bug hunting. most players displayed a reluctance to even consider it, yet they still complain that ccp isn't fixing the problem(s) affecting them.these same players, including myself i admit, displayed greatly increased motivation to run logserver and form detailed bug reports if some sort of in-game incentives were applied to reports that were used to successfully squash a bug.suggestions i've seen and devised are as follows:isk (the old standby)ships (had to be said)ccp community service medals (perhaps a series? helpful pilot, forum warrior, bug master, etc...)game timecredits (like somewhere in the patch notes you can click on a bugfix bullet and get a list of the pilots who aided with good bug reports)eve store goodiesitems (nothing ultra rare, more like a random t2 bpc or something)the list can go on...so, what we, the undersigned, would like the csm to propose to ccp is to provide some sort of simple, yet meaningful, incentive(s) for providing quality bug reports. the result of which, we hope, will be a much greater volume of good bug reports and far fewer \"it's borked!! fix it!!\" reports and faster bug squashing."
"having to reply to my own proposal to show support...4tl"
"it seems a good idea... so i'll support it."
"/signedhere's the thread in gd if any1 want to have a look:"
"yeah good idea. personally, i'd like to see medals as this could be expanded to include such things as rewards for participating in load tests on sisi."
"i can get behind that - use the new medal system to give players a visible token of thanks for helping out. game goods seem dangerous, but purely symbolic thanks are a good idea. there's a possible downside of people getting too obsessed with them, but it'd probably be well worth it."
"if this will make it, there would be a certain need of balancing the rewards, when it comes to terms of items or isk.otherwise people could get the idea of bug reporting every tiny bit they find, just to \"rank up\" and gather the rewards.first thought would be \"keep track of all players reporting the same bug, only reward these pilots if that bug gets confirmed / resolved\".\"only\" having these pilots a medal would be ok (as there isn't *anything* yet ) - but giving them at least one or a few low tier items would be more desireable.doing a freighter run currently, i thought of something like this maybe:(i combined commodities with low tier items - for example. there should be no chance to get some ridiculous valueable item.)- 1 bug report: \"concord technical assistance recruit\"- medal comes with 1x quafe, 1x random t1 frigate bpc (maxrun)- 3 bug reports: \"concord technical assistance officer\"- medal comes with 3x quafe ultra, 3x random t1 cruiser bpc (maxrun as well? maybe less)- 5 bug reports: \"concord technical assistance general\"- medal comes with 5x quafe ultra special editition, 1x random \"consumables\" bpos (ammo, drones, ?)- 10 bug reports: \"concord technical supervisory manager\"- medal comes with 10x test dummies, 2x random \"consumables\" bpos- 15 bug reports: \"concord technical supervisory executive\"- medal comes with 15x synthetic coffee (does it even exist?), 5x random t1 battleship bpc (maxrun)- 20 bug reports: \"concord cluster integrity consultant\"- medal comes with 20x exotic dancers, 5x random t2 bpc (runs to be defined by item type), 10 days of gametime (when you filed 20 good/confirmed/resolved brs, that was presumably quite a bit of work)everything just out of mind - feel free to flame, rant, whine, change, remove, double, triple or eat contents of this post"
"like the idea of consecutive useful reports increasing rewards.the original idea, might not have worded it well, included the provision for no incentive rewards unless the bug report was deemed useful in eliminating a bug."
"the recognition is a benefit that is tiny in cost and great in its impact. i support this."
"as an avid industrialist seeking to mine and refine out of a pos, i find it extremely odd that a player's skills do not influence the yield from a refining array as they would at an outpost refinery. if a outpost's refinery gives a base yield of 35% and my skills make that a net yield of 100%, surely my skills should allow 100% refines from a 35% base refining array."
"yay for cheaper items in 0.0i did not realize that pos arrays were like this as i dont use them however i do agree with this."
"true, the use of evemail for many of these notifications is a bad workaround, and it badly punishes people who run big corps. i don't think there's more than a handful of people in the game who want to save their pos fuel evemails. it's the fact that they're doing it blindly and on a massive scale that annoys me."
"imo i think that ccp should look at the possibility of setting a page up through www.eve-online.com to operate as a killboard. they've given us api keys to transfer our information to different programs, so on and so fourth. would it really be so hard for them to add a little tab that for \"player kills\" and when you log on it brings up your entire combat history? a kill board made by ccp for players who pay to play their game? since a majority of eve reverts back to player versus player combat at some point doesn't it strike you odd that they're not already doing this???anyways, signed!!! i earned them kill mails, they should be mine until i stop paying for my account!"

"not needed imho"
"last idea, i gave this one to ccp at game dev 2 years ago, but never heard it mentioned. like pos fuel savings your 0 space sov level would boost everyone in your alliances training times when they were in that space owned by that alliance, so if you had sov level 4 you would train 5% faster then any other part of the game.sov 4 = 5%sov 3 = 3.5%sov 2 = 2.5%sov 1 = 1.0%simple an easy makes 0 space more valuable, and will motivate people to move from empire to 0, gives players something nice for being good at eve."
"and completing the trifecta, this one is actually even worse than your other two - technically infeasible, public relations kryptonite, and a terrible game mechanic, all rolled into one."
"i dont expect this idea to carry a lot of love but you never know.so change the system to this idea and everyone will be happy, your character account expires, let everyone keep training what ever skill they had going, to reactivate your account you have to pay for every month it was training so if you set a long skill like cap ship 5 which can take up to 60 days, and you account expired in on day 5 of the 60 the account owner would have to pay for the 55 days worth of subscriptions to reactivate the account if you are paying with gtc's this would be 1 x 60 day gtc, ccp is basically loaning you the money to keep training and gets paid back when you need your character back, they dont lose anything you keep training if you cant log in for awhile. if you had a 6 day skill training, and your didn't come back for 30 days so 25 days of not training you would still have to buy a 30 gtc or pay for your account to go, no loan from ccp, they are getting the benefit."
"so make players who already quit once pay extra to resubscribe if they're inclined to come back? um, no."
"another idea for the people with real world money, super charger game time card you can pay 60 dollars for a 30 day play card and your skill points train twice as fast as normal, so you can pay ccp to train faster, with a limit of 6 scgtc's per year per account, help you get into pvp faster, etc."
"that's absurd. no."
"if you don't like the region, move."
"now this is just silly. almost as silly as saying \"if you can't kill nano's, fly one yourself.\", or how about \"remove 0.0, because anyone who disagrees can go play wow\".yes, there should be differences in the quality of regions, but there shouldn't be multiple regions where a whole game-play element is basically non-existent. how about a region where there are almost no asteroids, or one where the market is limited to t1 items. both of these seem ridiculous concepts, but they are only slightly worse than the idea of a region with hardly any exploration content.i'm all for fighting for the best space, but considering that in the coming update ccp are placing the main focus on t3 and improved exploration, it would be nice if we could at least get some meaningful exploration content in all regions."
"i've never even been there but i'm going to support this. i can't imagine living where i do without the occasional 1 billion isk bpc from exploration among other things."
"yep"
"proposing to nerf the minimum npc standings required for all mission levels except l5.my account is barely one month old, yet i've outgrown level 1 missions about a week after i started. the only problem is i still don't have enough standing to start level 2's.i'm currently flying all levels of cruisers w/ proper skills and weapons and am about to start flying bc's soon. but i'm still stuck grinding away on those horridly easy l1 missions. stuck until i've ground up enough standing for l2's.i'm willing to bet this is a common problem for everyone. required mission level standings need to be reduced by a significant amount. i propose at least a 30% reduction.what do you guys think?"
"if you spent just a fraction of your training time working on social skills, instead of the other skills you have been working the last month, you would already be in lvl3s."
"i can't say i had a problem personally - l1s flew by, and i got a cruiser, cruiser skills, and l2 standings all at about the same time. the same goes for most of my other friends who climb the mission tree. if it isn't working for you in that fashion, train connections(to up your standings) or advanced learning skills(to leech off your money and training time until you grind your standing up)."
"eve is a game where it takes time and investment of that time into skills etc in order to access the higher income streams. it's not wow or other type of similar game where players quickly climb to high levels and then compete directly with each other.this, imo, is how it should be...social skills, cosmos mission sets, and storyline missions raise standings a little faster and allow access to higher lvl missions. however, accessing these missions without the ability to fly correct type of suitable ship (or use decent mods etc) will quickly drain your wallet of any isk you have...take care,arithron"
"this. i'll even be helpful and point out the specific skill you should train: connections (which requires social 3). my guess is that you're well under a day of training from l2s, and perhaps even a few days from l3s."
"get a cruiser and blitz them, missions will take all of 5 minutes. standing requirements for l2s are already low. standing gain also increases with the level of missions you run making it actually rather quick to get to a l4 agent."
"nothing wrong with missions, m8. they scale rather well with ship sizes and skills. if you're doing level4s before 6 months in game, something is seriously out of balance...oh wait, it was, and they nerfed ravens."
"without the connections skill there is a big gap between l1 and l2 missions. since standing gains work of a percentage system. (if what i see on the standings screen is correct) at the lower levels you already have low standings so it takes a lot longer to improve your standings from level 1 -2 than it does for level 2 - 3 or level 3 - 4. so i am recommending that they increase the percentage gain from l1 missions."
"you know what, that's a great idea. raise the percentage gains from level 1 missions so everyone goes and spams them to death for very speedy standings gain."
"1. if they are running l1 missions they are getting crap for isk and lp2. add a system so that after you are eligible for the next level agent it reduces the amount of standings gain."
"you've got that entirely backwards. the percentage standing change is a percentage of the difference between your current standing and 10.0(for positive changes) or -10.0(for negative changes). if you're at 0.0(l1q0), getting to 2.0(l2q0) is a 20% change. if you're at 4.0(l3q0), getting to 6.0(l4q0) is a 33% change. that same 20% boost will only get you to 5.2 standings. you gain standing faster at low levels - otherwise, 10.0 would be easy instead of near-impossible."
"you guys do know that t2 transports were changed in qr?"
"oh god yes"
"that would make eve (even more) a game where the wealthy(be it in-game or real life) can do whatever they want while the poor have to suffer.iow: go on rampage, buy gtc, bribe concord. repeat ad nauseam.--i agree that there should be ways beside ratting to re-gain sec status. but it should be nothing so trivial as \"throwing some iskies at concord\".sec status is there for a reason."
"i propose an idea where you can bribe concord for a set period of time to access high sec space. it's part of some ideas i had for improving the life of low sec players walking the darker paths in low sec and 0.0. low sec needs work, i'll be looking out for good ideas to support if i get onto the csm this round. bribery of concord to allow dash and thrash runs into high sec would be interesting ....take care,arithron"
"i'm a pirate. concord doesn't like me.but i think it's a really poor idea. eve has consequences. if you start killing somebody, you take the consequences. you have to prove your worth to them, not just pay some isk."
"you still have negative sec standings with concord, so there are still consequences. docking at stations etc would be difficult (or could be made difficult). plus, aggressive actions could just result in normal responses...bribery levels could be set against sec status: lower the sec status, the more isk it costs.imagine you could slip beneath the radar of concord for a bit, eye up a juicy target and surprise them...there would be consequences, but it would make empire a more interesting place to live...arithron"
"i'd be inclined to entertain reasonable proposals for altering the way sec status is recovered, but simply buying it off (most likely through gtc sales) doesn't make the cut."
"consequences such as? you already lose your ship if you shoot things without reason, what reasonable consequence could there be when surprising things after sneaking into highsec?i.e. getting your pod zapped would be unreasonable. having it arrested, so you can't do anything during your gametime would also be unreasonable. so what would be reasonable?"
"i was referring to losing your ship, and taking a sec loss hit (thus making it more expensive to bribe into high sec again). currently there is no way, other than using an alt, for a low sec player to enter high sec to target juicier, unsuspecting prey...bribery for a certain time would enable pirate gangs to make forays into empire. it at least keeps the local on their toes...arithron"
"when did they drop the tournament anyway?"
"i don't want to be disrespectful here, but i don't think you can really satisfy someone visually impaired using a gui.that said, did you know that the market automatically sells you the item from the person who has the lowest price listed, however it sells it at the price listed on the one you are selected as that is what is transfered to the buy order?in other words, undercutting, by even .01 isk will guarantee you sell the item. it does not matter if the buyer selected some other buy order, even worse, the difference between the selected price and the lowest listed price vanishes."
"where does the money come from? he gets items from x, gives money to x, and sells item to y getting money from y.so, y is somehow creating money?rightly so.after all, we are playing alt online, aren't we? the last thing this game needs is less alts!</sarcasm>"

"this thread, and the missile/nano nerfs are evidence that 99% of most gamer forums are full of people who have no idea what they want but will screech for it anyway (and then accuse the devs of being ****tards for allowing it to happen afterwards).let's say bumping is replaced with collisions.cheap t1 ship hulls. no need for modules. insurance scams. and concord doesn't pod pods. put all that together. i guarantee you the roaming kamikazie gangs invading high-sec space, bumping off haulers or transports or mission ships (looted by alts waiting in the wings) will light these forums up like a string of nuclear tests. or howabout expensive faction fit fleets popped by swarms of t1 frigates? cruisers? cheaper than fighters, i would think. goonfleet velator inconvenience op anyone? it'll certainly liven up eve, that's fer shure!"

"oh give me a break..you're actually debating whether or not the use of the word \"jihad\" is appropiate or not, because it exists in rl? seriously? slavery is soaked all over the amarr storyline, and the game itself. they make a point of mentioning it as often as they can, not to mention it's religious.slavery was, and is a very real thing that i'd argue is far worse than some miniscule dingbat word like \"jihad\" and it's connection to religion.we have plenty of people who rp amarr to the fullest (you guys are awesome btw), including the parts about slavery, and why shouldn't they? in fact, i would be sad if they didn't..you know its people like you, who advocate religious, political and racial sensitivity to the extremes like this, who are the ones partially at fault for problems existing around these kind of topics in the first place!as soon as you make it law or somehow proliferate the idea of a new 'word badness' or some other thing from the previously mentioned topics, onto people as it being a taboo, then you can demonize genuine good people who are nothing close to what you accuse them of being, just because you have an ignorant superstitious way of thinking.if, pure hypothetically, i wanted to play a zealous amarr who not only advocated prejudice, religious doctrine, slavery, holy wars, torture and all manners of religious utterings to justify my bombings of a defenseless mining operation, including jihad! i declare \"holy war\" or \"struggle\" on your mining operation, so there! but also was quite active in utilizing various slang to degrade the minmatars - then dangit, i want to be able to, and if you can't tolerate that, then either block me, go to a different topic on the forum, a different system in the game, declare war on me, or simply get the hell out of my pretend spaceship universe!i'm not saying common decency towards each other is bad, not at all. of course we should respect each other and try to get along and we do - it is in our nature as humans! we to tend to want to work together to achieve various goals, and to do that it is in each other's best interest to get along, but see what happens when you turn the act of kindness and tolerance into a mode that equates to a witchhunt of fanatical proportions the second you spot the latest fashion in \"words the can't be used\".it's a game..and many years ago, the word \"breast\" was highly improper which is also why the terms \"white meat\" and \"dark meat\" came to be. think about it.<3edit: i...i just realised ...i'm def...i'm defe, man this is hard to say, it's so unreal. i'm defending goons..oh god..this is it..the world is ending...*faints* x_x"
"military experts are calling this a 'clueless rant'."
"i normally don't have a snipe at whatever csm candidates feel like they want to do, it's their business, but i feel i just have to give my 2 cents here, sorry.unrealistic as you said, it is entirely counter productive, business wise and community wise, to one way or the other force alts out of the game. if anyone, for any reason wish to have an alter ego as far as ingame characters go, they should be allowed to.since before 2008, i didn't have any alts whatsoever, but today i have 2..each one of them disconnected from the other 2 in terms of what they do, what corporation they are in, and only i, and a small handful of close friends know who they are, and i prefer to keep it that way.no disrespect intended, but i will would a point out of opposing you and this idea if you ever tried to run with it. i want to keep my privacy thank you.well, this one is a no brainer..will never happen in any shape or form, as you said, unrealistic.*blush* you know i wish i had read this before i started replying to the post, but to tell you the truth i had already written half this post before i noticed this little gold nugget, and so i figured i might as well finish the posthonestly the way i see it, if you have the finances, the resources, infrastructure and dedication, why shouldn't you have benefits like this?pos'es are a pain to maintain, and this is proportional to how many pos'es you have over large areas of space.if you put in the effort, i say you deserve a little comfort imho.wait..you're an eve player...and you want to add things as opposed to the usual \"fix stuffz befoar u add moar!\" crap???..i'm confused"
"i would remove the solar system jita from the game i think."
"all i can add to this;without clearly demarcated rules in place to direct behavior, it takes a very disciplined group not to break down into infighting.the last csm (from internal and external influences) had a lot of infighting...i would like to see this not happen this time.thanks for being patient.ak"
"exactly my point with making csm fixing a big priority. rules of order don't tend to reduce the amount of infighting(nothing but having people actually get along can do that, and there's no procedural change that will do that), but it does reduce the severity of infighting. and while that's not perfect, it would be a distinct improvement."
"all this talk of rules of order is distracting; while it obviously inevitably consumed wasted a great deal of the 1st csms time, it didn't stop getting on with the issues at hand. it is interesting therefore, that this is such a high issue on the 2nd csm candidate debate, when the 1st csm found a working method for a group of philosophically opposed individuals to still bring the 5 year back-log of relatively small player issues to the table. imo it was explicitly through too much focus on \"rules\" and not enough \"get on with it\" pragmatic approach that the rules became so important. as such, for 2nd csm candidates, jostling for position on \"i am holier than thou\" debates on \"would you step down?\"? is misguided. you can step down if that is a wise thing to do, that has already been set in place. as a second csm, you will need to focus on what are the big issues facing the eve universe's players, and what effort you can put into defining and shaping those issues in preparation for your term."
"yes, you guys cleaned up a good deal of a 5-year backlog despite your differences. i don't think anyone here is trying to disparage that achievement. but i'm not running for the first csm, i'm running for the second csm. cleaning up old issues isn't going to be the defining characteristic of the second csm the way it was for the first. if this project is going to succeed in the long term, it needs some structure - force of personality is great when everything is new, and the process is being run by eager folk full of p+v, but it doesn't sustain things over the long term. furthermore, given that you have cleared up a lot of the big-ticket items, we actually have the time to sit back and come up with procedures instead of just taking whichever course gets us into the meaty topics fastest. while your results were good last time, your methods sucked utterly. there was no real documentation, no easy way for new players to understand what was going on, internal governance based entirely on how the chair felt like doing things today, meetings that stretched on endlessly because nobody prepared much of anything, an assembly hall that looked like eve general with thumbs, and inexplicable month-long gaps between meetings. and let's not even get into your(personal, not collective) bait-and-switch on reference materials. that's why i focus so heavily on internal procedures - there's as much room for improvement there as there is in the forums and igb combined(even if it's have less effect, it's just as badly broken), and it's something we don't need to wait on ccp to implement. we can fix it ourselves, nearly instantly, and make everything else thereafter work in better fashion. it's not the most important thing the csm can do, but because it's both relevant and easy to actually accomplish, it's one of the highest priorities now that the first wave of ancient grudges is largely off the table."
"new blog post is up! finally!will copy it over tomorrow morning as we head into the final day of voting.to all my supporters out there: thank you, your support and confidence has meant a great deal to me. regardless of the outcome of the election, you have insured that i will leave this election process more inspired than ever about working to improve our wonderful game, and if i am on the csm or not, i hope to do my best to work for your concerns in the days and months ahead. thank you.to all those who have not yet voted and are reading this: what are you waiting for, read up on the candidates, ask them questions, ask me questions, and whether you decide that i am the person you want to support of not, vote and make your voice heard!"
"had a look around and you got my vote, if i can ever get good enough to get out to null sec"
"crossposting:please visit your user settings to re-enable images.and were back from a bit of a break in blog posts.lets talk about lowsec. now, the general consensus is that it somewhat sucks. living in lowsec a good bit of the time as i do, i have to agree  in fact, it sucking is why i dont live in lowsec more than i do. id love to spend most all of my time in lowsec, i think it could be a really cool place to try and build a mid sized cartel, not quite like the big 0.0 alliances, but a group that still manages to control the area through economic, military, and political influence, even though the sovereignty mechanisms of 0.0 dont exist. i personally think that has the potential to be a cooler endgame than 0.0 pos warfare and lagfests. not that i have anything against 0.0, i just personally think i might find lowsec more interesting.except for that one little thing about lowsec sucking. its not worth the effort of all that right now. so, being enough of a pragmatist to realize when it would just be plain silly and dumb to totally devote my energy to that, and waste corporate and alliance resources for little gain, my dream remains largely unfulfilled.oh, sure, i <i>do</i> run a coalition of alliances and corporations that have all signed naps with each other and try to work together in a small area of lowsec. but thats really just a taste of what i wish i could accomplish in lowsec, and the reward so often doesnt justify the effort that its only my devotion to the idea that has kept me going with it as often as not.so lets identify a few specific things that could be done.first, i think we need to promote rewards for industrial efforts in lowsec. lowsec needs to be worth it in terms of industry, or else the only reason people will go there, for the most part, is for combat, maybe to get to 0.0 or to take a shortcut, and once a month to fuel their pos. and that doesnt really give the pirates enough to shoot at. mission runners and ratters have some reason to go to lowsec, and people that want to run a pos, but miners? lowsec ores are a joke, and this is in urgent need of attention.researchers do have some reason to take shuttles in once every so often to get shorter waiting times on me research slots, but there currently exists no reason for industrialists to do the same with manufacturing slots. now, im normally the last to advocate a nerf, but i think we need to consider all options here when it comes to making lowsec manufacturing slots advantageous over highsec ones, and advantageous enough to be worth the effort of securing a supply line. if this were done, we might see industry corps start to try to use lowsec a bit more  the clever ones would prosper over both ones that were not so clever and fell prey to pirates, and over those who remain in highsec  which is as it should be. and certain friends of mine who operate on the other side of the law tell me that this would make things much more fun for them, too.see? improve industry, and everyone profits!while improving industry and mining, i think it might be a good idea to look at a few other things in lowsec as well. missions are better in lowsec than highsec, yes  but still most people choose to do them in highsec, rather than lowsec (despite it being a <i>relatively</i> safe activity to engage in in lowsec). perhaps we should look at farther boosts to lowsec missions  though this is purely speculative, of course. any changes need to be carefully considered.(continued)"
"now, if highsec is considered the home of the carebears, and 0.0 the home of the great alliances, lowsec is generally considered the home of pirates. while i would like it to be home to clever industrial groups as well, im not adverse to it maintaining something of a reputation for shadiness  in fact, im very much for this reputation for shadiness, and think it would be great if some of the industry groups that become successful in lowsec acquired a similar reputation for perhaps bending the law every so often. so perhaps we should put more (or any?) pirate agents in lowsec, so that people can run mission for them there, and gain standings. and then lets make those standings mean something, like standings to the empires do  say, if you have positive standings, or standings over a certain amount with a pirate group, rats of that faction wont shoot at you. this might be of some interest to miners if they cant get someone to tank the rats for them. . . .lets also give traders a little something, and make npc buy and sell orders for various illegal commodities  drugs and the like  in lowsec. arrange things so that long risky journeys through lowsec to trade these goods will be very profitable, as will trips that require smuggling through highsec to reach an isolated pocket of lowsec. traders will have fun with this, and pirates who prey on them will as well.now, simply improving reasons to go to lowsec isnt the only thing that needs to be done. its very hard to control and defend, unlike 0.0, or at least so i understand. while i think this is part of its charm, and i would never want lowsec to be as easy to control as 0.0 is, or as broken up into power blocks, i do believe it should be a bit easier than it is now  and that their should be rewards for managing such a difficult feat (besides the fame of course). how? well, ill be honest with you here  im not sure. this part of the plan needs a bit of work. i know at least one of my fellow csm candidates has some plans regarding this, and i hope that this is something we will have the chance to work on together. and you can be assured that im thinking carefully about this. but i also want your thoughts and opinions on this. so tell me:lowsec sucks. how can we make it better?"
"i have cast my vote today. it went to you."
"whilst i'm still small i've found killing rats and salvaging quite lucrative (better than mining). the problem i have is the one you've hinted at and that is who owns the wrecks. one time i was salvaging wrecks that somebody else killed and they were ok with that and actually apologised that they had killed the rats as they had only done it out of boredom. another time i was killing rats near some miners in highsec and they moaned about new rats spawning even though they were fully tanked for 0.0. and yet another time miners were killing rats as they came in using drones, so i had no chance to kill them, and then moaned when i salvaged them even though it was obvious they were only interested in mining. it should be noted at no time do i take the cargo. what is the deal with salvaging, i know concord has no problem but there seems to be no consistency within the eve community?javascript:insertsmilie('','webpost','text');"
"it would make sense to be able to probe out wrecks in addition to ships. the chances of probing wrecks inside deadspace should be reduced as currently happens with missioners in deadspace. those that moan about salvagers (and ninja salvagers) are missing the point about wrecks...they are available, floating about in the vast tracts of space, for salvaging. they don't belong to anyone. the loot inside them has ownership currently to the person that killed the rat/character. stealing this ensures some flagging and a little bit of extra fun for the salvager and mission runner...arithron"
"i do believe that wrecks should be able to be probed, yes."
"this is really a key that mission runners have been missing. considering the number of missions that are 'turned in' that still exist in deadspace when a mission runner leaves, adding the ability to scan for wrecks would, inevitably, allow us to clean them up and reduce lag on the system.there's a greater chance for the ninja salvager to target a field of wrecks that have been abandoned, especially if they're searching out for a specific type, and ignore the mission runners found on scan completely.consider this. with the current mechanic, you scan out an area, and find 5 ships on scan. you warp to each one, and out of that, 3 are still active, while the other 2 hits were 'ghost' hits, possibly a ship warping to/from a location. you now have 3 viable locations to ninja salvage.in the proposed change, using the same 5 hits and 3 viable locations as above, you also find an additional 5 wreck fields. upon warping to each wreck field, you find that some have mission runners return, but some do not.the key to the above change is that you now have more targets than before, and for those who are only in it for the salvage, they are more likely to go to the empty wreck fields first, and for those running missions, you are decreasing the chance that they're coming back to your mission!frankly, thinking this way, it's a win-win."
"i as well would like the evemail, igb, and forums to have a major overhaul, and perhaps a rewrite. the systems do work, but they're a pita to use and could definitely see some improvements.evemail: sent items folder, new items first, expanded text space.igb: talk with somebody in the browsing industry, and they'll be happy to help. most browsers are freeware, so all it would require is a little bit of code adaptation.forums: how many times do they expect you to log in to post a reply? 3? 4? the webservers and forum server could use a little bit of communication between eachother, along with other upgrades."
"currently you can change your character's face. i would like the option to change the character name. could charge a fee, could be part of buying a character, could be free.i feel it would be nice for someone who bought a character to change the characters identity, remove former associations.someone who wanted a specific character name, that wasn't available at the time of creation is now available (biomass processing).anyone who would change the picture of their character would surely be interested in changing the name.an argument:you can already do this. simply by buying a new character. now money is transferred directly to the character being sold, so there isn't necessary a post to track who bought it. and an alt could have been used anyway. was the buddy list an intended intel tool, like local? if this was tied to the character name rather than some other value associated with the character, it could be a problem. easy fix would be require that the character doesn't have any kill rights."
"when a jaguar can own an assault launcher equiped cerberus that is flown by a pilot with more or less maxed skills for missiles and shield tanking then something isn't right."
"meh, just repeal the whole patch. turret boats got hit hard too, deal with it."
"you must have been doing something very wrong for this to have happened."
"i did nothing wrong as i was the jag pilot and it was with repeated testing on sisi.the cerb pilot is one of the best i have known and he even tried kinetic precisions as well as cn bloodclaws.it's not just us that have found this to be the case either!"
"i find the missle nerf excellent. i can now tank guristas rats in a bc on the same level as i tank gun-based rats. adittionally, from everything i've seen (and i've been out ratting with some mates in a raven) they can instapop the frigs moving at full speed no problem. sure he fits a target painter.what this has done is put caldari ships in line with the ability of galente and minmatar ships when it comes to ratting and pvp, where the ability for torps to hit frigates for full damage was ending the usefullness of ships that were smaller than cruisers and not speed tanked. this nerf did more to end nano fleets than the nano nerf."
"/signed"
"getting in range of the jag = doing it wrong, tbh. from my experience, aml cerb casually slaughters all frigates.but even in a straight slugfest at point-blank range, with an unwebbed abing jag (which can't actually close on a mwd-fit cerberus, and if it uses mwd to do so then it just dies), i'm having difficulty modelling a sensible jag fit than can survive for more than a couple of minutes of kinetic aml fire - which just isn't long enough to deal enough damage to cut through any kind of tanked cerb's tank. so i'd like to know the fits, tbh."
"signed. i have had to hang up my mission hat for perma mining. i dont wanna retrain new skills just so i can friggin do missions. ccp please revert (or find a medium) for this please."
"wait a minute, i think you might be on to something, here!anyway, i'm still in suspense for the big changes alluded to by bane glorious on scrapheap, i'm sure they're coming any moment now."
"god that's a terrible change.the worst thing about the nagflar is it's terrible cpu. if you're going to fix anything give it more cpu. the next thing is it's dps, make it so both guns and launchers have 2 bonuses applied from the hull. don't take away 1/4th of it's dps.finally it doesn't really need 6 low slots with fixed cpu, so drop a low slot and add at least 1 (preferably 2) mid slots so the shield tank doesn't suck horribly.tl;dr: shut up stupid alt troll."
"but haven't you heard, minmatar ships are supposed to speed tank!nah, i'd like to at least see some investigation into this."
"now come on, it's just a suggestion. this is my main (forum main, but it does not matter) for this task and i will not use another just to give others more ammo against me like \"you fascist bob!\" or \"you dumb goon\" (please, don't take this personally it's just an example)giving 4 bonuses from the hull seems a bit much. a third non weapon related would be much more minmatar style imho. admittedly i don't fly a nag myself, but i saw action alongside them. if you feel like the master of all things, sure, go ahead, see if more cpu alone makes the nag better.i should also add that ccp seems to balance across races, not ship classes. so minmatar end up having overall above average small ships and overall underperforming capitals."
"this game has the special feature of training your character while you are not online. we all know it's a really unique feature compared to most (if not all) mmorpgs out there. i support having some kind of queue feature for this game. since ghost training was nerfed it would be good to have a long queue list ready to train as long as your account is paid. i suggest a long queue because of all the possible reasons why a player might not be able to log in (like mentioned on some of the previous replies on this topic). i strongly believe that it will only beef up this game's reputation and add to the unique qualities this mmorpg already has. i love this game!!!"
"hmmm, posted the exact same idea in the \"features and ideas discussion\" here:"
"yep."
"the it idiots at work are blocking ports. i cannot switch while at work anymore. getting ready to take a trip for work too in brazil. no internet down there. skill queue please!!!!"
"my second paying account supports this idea too."
"imo the key role of the bo so far is the portal gen. now: portalling 1 stupid hauler i used up 2k nitro iso, holding 2.6k nitro iso in totla + a few missiles in my cargo. that means the boat itself was not able to do the jump to the same cyno afterwards cos the bo itself would have used 900 nitro (jfc lvl 4 btw).cant be true that u r not able to jump a single hauler + urself! how the hell should the bo be able to move small recon gangs around, which was announced to be their role? ccp wake up...imo the usage of a ship jumping trhough a portal should be about the same ammount as if using a bridge (like around 25units for a cruiser; no cargoincrease, fuel bay, fuel bay mod needed)...?!though, ll gladly drop one launcher if there was to fit a fuel bay module for example, i dont fly a bo (widow) for dps..i like the idea of creating an additional role for the bo (cyno jammer takedown).imo the ship is pure support, but the main role still is the portal of which the fuel consumption is absolutely ridiculous!"
"yes!!!11 i support!"
"i don't understand ccp's view on this. used to be able to put fully fitted out ships in carriers with their cargo in them. ccp made a change and still not sure why they did it. just seemed designed to give pilots a headache. so sure this has my support."
"oh for the love of god.this doesn't require consideration.only one thing needs to be done. add an option to the right click menu of a skill \"set as backup skill\".when ever your current skill training finishes, the backup starts. if no backup is set, it stops.when a backup starts, the backup queue is reset (so you can only ever queue up 1 skill after your current.)this fixes the 6 hours skills by allowing you to group two of them together to cover overnight or pick a 6 hour skill + battleships 5 and each night nock off another 6-10 hour skill and then return to battleships 5. its super simple super easy to implemement. 1 extra value on a charactor record with the id of a skill to train upon skill training completion or $null if there is not one set.seriously. why has this not been done yet? *single worst thing about eve is the lack of ______any_____ form of queueing."
"this"
"well, i often leave my eve client running in the background when i'm training the shorter skills cause i find the logging in process tedious, while doing some other stuff. i think i'm not the only one, so ccp might mistake that for me \"playing\". had another nice run in with the downside of having no skill queue just this week. my connection went to hell... connection was down for bout 20 hours and according to the helpdesk of my isp i should be lucky it was only 20 hours as they gave me an estimated time of 5 work days. so i 'just' missed about 18 hours of training. next time, who knows, might be a week...."
"incorrect, the codes to make a 1 skill queue is not easier then a 10-100 skill queue, or atleast it is such a little effect that it doesn't matter."
"well that's nice and everything, but haven't this been on the workbanch for like 4-5 years?and wouldn't you imagine that after x months without any real replies it starts to be kind of a joke that you ain't saying or replying about anything that have to do with this?.kind of like the speed nerf, how could it take you x years too fix something that needed it that badly :pbut well you fixed it hmm"
"i prefer the second option, the dual training mechanic. because if you can connect in too many hours, the short skills, is a real problem. but with this system you dont have the problem, you put a very lonk skill and the shot skill, and you ensure that you dont lost time."
"well, it's the difference of single pointer vs single pointer wrapped in linked list object. trivial, but the single pointer is harder to screw up =panyway, support!"

"i have only used bombs on the test server. i can cloak immediately after deploying bomb and it will still explode. is it not the same on tranquility?"
"battleships got phased out of rl naval warfare because aircraft carriers gained the ability to generate useful levels of firepower at far longer ranges. given the nature of naval detection systems(i.e., you can't hide a capital ship), this meant that the battleship was sunk without those big guns ever coming to bear. they still have roles, even on the modern field of battle, but they don't have a big enough role to justify spending several billion on one. besides, the only nation with a serious navy already has two in commission, they don't really need any more of them. that said, the comparison of rl naval warfare to eve warfare is problematic. ship losses don't matter so much in eve - really, the comparison is pt boats(battleships), destroyers(carriers), cruisers(dreadnoughts), and the world's most expensive b-29 dropping a nuke(titans). that changes tactics pretty fundamentally when losses are nearly irrelevant."
"dear csm, i feel that the current situation of character-based posting on these forums is not a good thing. if you have a look at general discussion, for example, you see a vast amount of trolling, swearing, and general effing and blinging. this is frequently down to people realising the following: 1) they don't lose anything by trolling, as they can alt. 2) trolling can be very hard to detect, as alts can switch between trolling so as not to be rumbled. 3) you can say pretty much anything on the forums with an alt. as such, i propose the following system for the forums. 1) the current system of alt-posting is suspended. 2) your game account is linked to the forums directly, not via your characters. 3) instead of one of your characters, you instead get a \"display name\". your avatar remains the same as today - you can chose between the faces of all three of your characters. this would counter several problems: 1)see that chap with the stupidly long name? imagine if ccp could just shorten his forum name without affecting his characters. 2)it would promote the community, as people are less able to troll-alt. 3)an effective moderation system can be implemented on the forums. of course, this would not stop all alt-posting. if somebody has more than one game account, he'll have 2 forum names. as a moderator of other forums, i feel that this system - which would be similar to most other forums - would help improve the forums. yours, doctor penguin (and this is my main, fyi) ps: don't forget to tick that thumbs-up checkbox if you like this idea!"
"because you'd set a permanent display name. you'd have your username, yes. that would not be displayed on the forums. for example... bob's username is bob. he logs in on his account. bob currently has three characters - bill, jack and irene. he can post as all three of them. he could be the essence of a great forumgoer on bill, but he could troll all he likes as jack and irene. with is proposal, bob logs in. a page comes up telling him about the changes and prompting him to give his bob usernamed account a display name. because he's well loved as bill, he chooses bill. he may only post as \"bill\" but he could use any of bob, jack and irene's character portraits."
"i support this 100% transparency is a great thing."
"death to the trolls!!!! or at least better accountability for forum users fully supported."
"this wouldn't stop people from making new accounts then shutting them off... but if anything it would make it \"harder\"so yeah... i'm all for this... makes it a bit more challenging to sneak around... but hey... would make these boards a bit more readable./me thumbs upps: of course this also puts a lot of \"multi-corp'ers\" on the spot... but if anyhting it will make it \"interesting\""

"this would be sweet... but for rewards.. how about doing them through the lp store under concord.^_^/me thumbs up"
"definitely a great idea, wouldn't even have to be that much of a reward. maybe just make there like a monthly raffle for a prize and for every good bug report you file you get one ticket for it or something. medals would be nifty too, something that we could toggle to appear below our portraits to 'pimp' them out"
"hello all, i was going through some of the non-public skills and i saw a skill called \"reverse engineering\" (which will be re from here on out) and i was wondering what the community thought about asking to bring it back. for those who haven't seen this skill it basically lets you take an item and take it apart to get a bpc from it. obviously there would have to be limits and restrictions like you can't re deadspace/officer gear. maybe the number of runs for the bpc you recieve will be ralated to the lvl of the re skill, like re lvl 1 would give you 1 or 2 runs on a bpc that makes 1 or 2 of the item. since this skill is already in the database, all ccp would have to do is open it up to the public and populate it, they could also use research slots to do the re jobs since it still counts as research. i also think that maybe ccp should make it so you have to use up more then one of the item when you re it, with the possibility of you getting the item back growing percentage wise as your re lvl increases. please let me know what you guys think, if you support please don't forget to check the box, thanks."
"well... i can't see why it wouldn't be a good idea.bpc's and bpo's are such an expensive and massive (yet scammed as well) industry... this just add's a new twist to it....heck.. why not./me thumbs up"

"yes....i finally have drake's supporting vote on one of my posts :-) just messin with you drake, i do agree with you that bpo/bpc's are an area that people get scammed in a good bit and i hope that ccp will do something in the future to help remedy this, but that was another thread. maybe ccp already has a system in place that would let players distinguish re bpc's from regular ones, this was a non-public skill which means it has been in the db for a while....its a possibility. thanks for the supporting votes so far and the comments/suggestions made. please, feel free to add your own comments/suggestions and your support if that is the case, fly safe.p.s. supporting my own topic because i like the idea of taking stuff apart"

"the purpose behind a war dec is so that two corps/alliances can fight in high and low security space without concord interference. this is all well and good, and should be kept.however, this latest trend of war deccing people and essentially not bothering to show up kind of makes the whole thing pointless. so here's what i propose:1. the corp/alliance that initiates the war dec is required to get at least -1- kill per day of the war dec.2. failure to get a kill for a day would mean that the corp/alliance that declared war pays a penalty for wasting concords time with their lack of actually fighting.3. the penalty payment could either be done as the dec fees are or paid to the members of the corp/alliance that was decced.4. penalty payment should be 5 million isk per member of the corp/alliance that was decced.this will ensure that corps and alliances declaring war actually come out to fight, lest they get hit with massive penalty payments. i suppose an alternative would be that if the corp deccing fails to get a kill for a day, you shorten or end the war. now, while some would say that this encourages people not to undock, from what i have seen that's not actually the case with many dec's. on the contrary, we've always had the problem of finding the wt's who dec us and then immediately seem to run away or hide from us. if you are going to declare war, then you should be made to actually fight or suffer for it."
"i agree with punishing people who declare a war but don't turn up. but i'm not sure about the specific trigger for 'not turning up' because if you force a trading corp to stay docked up, that still hurts them because they can't haul.maybe require the corp declaring war to either get one kill a day, or spend a specific length of time uncloaked in space in a system having war targets online in it (for example, camping the station they are docked up in)."
"at the risk of seeing people not read this post carefully and make assumptions.. let me be clear on whats being said here.1: corp a war dec's corp b2: corp a doesn't show up to fight at all3: corp a gets slapped with fines from concord/me thumbs up1: corp a war dec's corp b2: corp b dosen't show up to fight at all3: corp b gets slapped with fines from concord/me thumbs downget it? got it? good.but only in that case... otherwise forget about it.punish the war dec'er... not the recipent.as the recipent has no choice in the matter... the declarer of wars does have a choice."
"if someone launches a dec and doesn't show up, there already is a penalty - 2 million isk per week. that's not huge, but a lot of wars are small, so a flat rate would have to be set around that level. this isn't necessarily a perfect system, and i'd be willing to listen if you had a concrete suggestion for change, but the status quo isn't terrible enough that i'll advocate blind change."
"the whole war dec mechanic needs reworked.i don't really see why this is an issue? if i dec you and change my mind, i paid for the right to kill you if i want to. i don't see why it should be mandatory.what if we try to kill you, but you kill us all and we don't get a kill? do we still have to pay?as for the \"rp\" of wasting concords' time, they took the payment. now you're also wanting them to keep track of kills?instead make this part of the revamp. one of the win conditions is getting a kill. if we go three days without killing anyone, the war is retracted due to lack of interest or everyone being dead."
"i think the time to online is a useful balance, because it allows opponents a chance to prevent/obstruct the construction of the pos. however, it would be nice if you could set up an onlining script so that you could place the modules, then have them automatically online themselves one at a time as occurs now -- but without the need for someone sitting there clicking a button every so often. unattended construction would, of course, be done at the owner's risk."
"allright... then at least consider the off lining time being shorter : o p"
"train more skills, so your 20m powergrid implant is the same as my 20m cpu implant on my gallente character to fit t2 blasters on the hyperion."
"ok try fittin t2 arty and mwd on tempest without multiple rcu :d"
"tempest is cheaper,and hyperion is gallente, so it should be crap."
"some very good feed back, i do agree that the programming and scripting would be a nightmare and everyone changing skills would make the db a bit messy.drake, i agree with you, i like the changes, i wouldnt change any of the patches they have released even though i am a caldari pilot, spec'd comletely in missiles :-p i always enjoy new challenges, its what makes a game that is worth playing, not to mention the sexy graphics :-)just a thought i wanted to share, not really supported so i withdraw my proposal :-) maybe i will find something else to suggest that may rally more support, something useful. thank you all for your comments and fly safe :-)."
"o7 @ non-bitter caldari pilot.if anything this has made it more challenging and not so easy to \"gank raven\" someone.adapt....or die.... that's what eve is very much like.time to move on...there's always something new around the corner.^_^ps: i'm only semi-content... i'm quickly realizing that minmatar ships are in need of much loving...."
"at least this one has a somewhat decent rationale. while i don't think it's a necessity, nor do i think this is the best idea, some real incentive for participating in sovereignty warfare would be a good thing for this game. most people play it either because they have friends or simply over old grudges. other than resource rights there really isn't any payout for the individual pilot."
"no"
"i will take anything good for free, so this is good too!"
"wouldn't this play a lot of havoc with skill training plans as you can't predict when a skill will finish unless you know when you will be outside your alliances space ?what about people who refuse to take part in alliance ops outside of alliance systems because they don't want to lose training time ?or people who only defend the high sov system ?so your saying that your alliance will be happy letting you use the rewards of holding systems even though you don't help hold them ?"
"bad idea."
"is the op on drugs?oh and this is a no on my part.: o p"
"no"
"/signed i like it!"
"so after you have ghost trained a realy long skill and don't want to pay for like 3 months to reactivate; can i have your stuff?"
"so if this training change is here to stay, i wouldn't mind some sort of micro transaction method set up so i can continue training without having to subscribe."
"well hell then... lets make eve online free!no!"
"keep your account active if you want to progress."
"eventhough i am pretty sure this idea will be found to be not feasable, just giving my 2 cents... there are still plenty of people with dynamic ip's and eventhough i have a static one, i am in hotels and the like during weekdays quite a lot, so logging on with a different ip then."
"i wouldn't support the idea of locked ip's for accounts, as you said people who travel alot and use local wireless in hotels and such would not be happy at all. it would also effect people who travel overseas, for instance i am currently deployed to afghanistan and my internet is run through a satellite isp which is in italy or some crazy thing like that, so i wouldn't be able to login and change skills. i would have canceled my account so i don't waste money and i would miss out on a year or more of training. i really hope that ccp doesn't implement something like this, because there will be alot of unhappy people. just my 2 cents"
"make it optional and sure!static ip's 4tw"
"you must have misheard or not understood what was being said.for ccp to even think of such a thing would either have to be optional or just downright hilariously stupid.even broadband connections migrate ip's over time.even if you knew nothing about the nature of tcp/ip structure when it comes to internet connections.... its nigh impossible.i mean... i'm sure people who are on dial up even play this game.. granted not really playable..but what about those people too?"
"no."
"no"
"like this one too, two for 2"
"strange how those against it don't post any reason why it is a bad idea."
"your internet has been revoked op. now please leave."
"no. don't think so...."
"this ive said 4 many years!"
"stop posting already."
"why this idea is awesomeness wrapped in bacon! i have a job, i can afford 6x60 a year per account! love me poor person, love me! jk..."
"nej."

"dont like the topic, leave the discussion"
"i would check the quality of your agents that you are using and go to the highest level agent you can use, keep checking when your standings are increasing as well, train your social skill depending on what agents you are using, stick with the same corporation as much as possible. i can do level 2's in high sec after a fortnight running missions for a couple of hours a day."
"they probably dont, i mean one day they may realise they can use covertops cloaks and jump portals on blockade runners, and werent designed to have cruiser sized mwd's on them"
"yeah. you probably dont want to vote for me. i like the other stuff more. not that i have anything against the pvp or that it would stop me doing my job if elected. its simply not where my interests lie."
"in life, you usually contact the police if your property is stolen. in eve theft isnt a crime, so you have to deal with it yourself.as i see it, the problem arises, when people in big ships like battlecruisers for an example, steals from a miner in a retriever as an example. the bc pilot has alot of skills in gunnery, the retriever pilot has alot of skills in the industry department.that makes it an easy gank, its not as easy as some people portray it, for a miner to retrieve his lost property, from a high skilled pvper."
"get out your hauler, align to station, drag the stuff from a can to your hold half a second before you warp, and stay docked for 15 minutes. if you're stealing to steal, and your timing is good, it's pretty close to safe. and if you blow it, hey, haulers are cheap."
"its definately a possibility. but if the jetcan is full, you need cargo expanders to move a full can into cargo bay or you have to do two trips which is ofcourse impossible in this case. so you have to risk some expanded cargo iis. i would say you got a decent 50% chance here, since pvpers aint stupid, they will most likely try to bump you, when you do the transfer / theft, and web, scramble and shoot you. so the timing has to be perfect (lucky). if its a can of veld, most miners would probably shrug, leave the stolen ore, and consider the time and effort a waste."
"the smartest ones will already have you targeted, and even if you're aligned to warp, a point will stop that move quickly. without the targeting, the odds are severely stacked in the competent thief's favour.three words. \"ice miners\" and \"angymonne\". easy pickings, but bring your cargo expanders."
"can we get some response real quick?what do csm think about mission rewards in high sec and various aspects about it like loot from mission causing problem, people not going to low sec and not giving pirates a chance to kill them and things like that...real quick before the voting...."
"missions are an issue in that the rewards due not scale well with the risks associated with various security ratings of systems. more needs to be done to increase profitability of lower security status areas in general. loot is a more complex issue that really deserves its own thread. the long and short of it is that tech 1 item production is going to have a problem no matter what you do with loot from missions so long as it exists. what should be done is another matter."
"the higher missions in empire (lvl 3 and 4) give decent returns for relatively low risk. loot and salvage make up a good chunk of the reward for missions, and i've stated elsewhere that this side of things should be freed up a little to allow more access to salvagers and looters (essentially, making mission deadspace a little easier to find). gates within deadspace will need to be locked to the mission-runner (and any associated gang) to prevent mission griefing. however, at all stages the mission runner should be able to be probed out.the effects of t1 loot on markets (eg, minerals) is essentially a guess atm. without firm figures, it's hard to calculate what deflationary pressure loot reprocessing and mineral sales have. you also have to consider what happens when you stop such mineral streams....prices go upwards, modules and ships become more expensive etc. for newer players, ships and modules have been getting cheaper the past year or two. invention has certainly helped bring down t2 gear etc.named gear allows newer players to have better modules and weaponry at lower skill reqs. getting rid of this would make the skill divide all the greater. it's interesting how all the calls seem to be to get rid of plain ol' t1 loot alone...i'm all for making more missions (essentially a percentage of lvl 3 and a bigger number lvl 4) go into low sec at times. for such missions, risks increase so the rewards should be the incentive to do such missions.take care,arithron"
"eve resources are generally distributed widely.with the coming of the salvage, and some \"shelves\" (exemple the bonus rooms of some lvl 4 missions) which allow wide quantities of \"uber\" items through highsec and highsec only, i see no point in getting any kind of high end minerals also in highsec missions.its not a \"risk vs reward\" thing, but splitting resources totally would be a way to force players to spread. everything where you dont need anyone else to get, (be it market or 0.0 space) is imo bad for the game.without the market and the fact that i need to get to some other place to finalize my items/fittings eve loses a lot of its \"spice\"."
"i firmly believe that we need to encourage more people to go to lowsec, indeed, that's one of the main points of my campaign. missions are indeed more profitable in lowsec already, but perhaps not enough to convince many people the risk is worth it -- so yes, we should look at possibly making lowsec missions more profitable. possibly people may simply need to be made aware of the greater rewards in lowsec as well, but definitely we should consider if those rewards are currently great enough to justify the risk (though of course the risk is far less than many think).as for loot from missions: yes, the t1 loot at least does cause problems, anyone that's tried to manufacture and sell t1 items knows that. unless it's popular or doesn't drop much, you have a hard time selling it. and yes, this is a problem. however, i'm not sure simply stopping t1 loot is the answer -- if player ships drop their modules as loot, then in my opinion npc ships should drop modules as loot -- but only modules that one would expect them to have used. none of this nonsense with npc pirate ships dropping mining modules. but balance is the most important thing here, though hopefully it can be balanced while still maintaining a high level of similarity with what happens when you destroy a player ship. we'll see. either way, it needs to be looked at very hard and very carefully."
"- lowsec missions need to be buffed somehow - they aren't good enough to draw anyone out of santenpaa at present. i'd suggest a serious bonus to overall rewards from doing missions in lower sec statuses, among other things. there is a progression at prese"
"click here to download the issue document i submitted to ccp while i was on the csm.index:1) missions need to be made more dynamic and unpredictable2) mission pay-out in low-sec and 0.0 needs improvement3) module loot may have a negative impact on the economy by making t1 production obsolete and injecting too many minerals into the economy4) missions in factional warfare require improvements5) mining missions require improvements6) level 4 missions in their current form do not belong in high-security space7) standing is being monopolized by missions (no ways to get standing outside of mission running, with the exception of fw standing)8) less ships, but higher difficulty"
"i think the mission rewards need to be skewed to make running missions in low sec clearly more rewarding. this would be just one of many things ccp could do to make low sec more compelling.issler"

"thanks for the support!"
"agreed. there is a common belief that something large can be brought down by a multitude of (singularly) weak attackers. \"it's like being pecked to death by ducks\" is one way of putting it. sadly, in eve, this only affects ships... not corporations or alliances. logistics of the 0.0 alliances are kept hidden and safe... and have been since capitals were introduced.that's the way the 0.0 alliances want things to be, and ccp will bow before their whims. the proposed carrier-nerf was halted in its tracks by the massive outrage of 0.0 players... and, unbelievingly, ccp backed down. so i have little doubt that the \"new sovereignty mechanics\" will continue the proud tradition of allowing the powerful to claim vast tracts of space without being bothered by troublesome logistical concerns... such as defending their territory from lone attackers or small groups... or actually working (i.e., mining fuel) to sustain their empire. players out in 0.0 refuse to do things they find unpleasant or which might impose a vulnerability upon them; the the game should reflect that. the only place these days for the solo fighter looking for a challenge is low-sec. there is no point in his going to 0.0 to take on the biggest, baddest boys in the game, since he can affect no damage on their logistics.to that end i'm merging my two accounts into a single one. while i'd be happy to support ccp if they had plans to change things, i can't really say i believe they will. and, quite honestly, if there is no means for a single player to harm a 0.0 alliance, then there's no reason for me to go. therefore, there is no need of a second account for scouting/field-repair.maybe i'm getting too old for these games. in my youth (and to this day) i always sought out the toughest challenges i could find. i've modded pc games to become nearly impossible, and still beat them.but these days people are more interested in the easy way."
"not in the slightest. logistics chains that are easier to attack mean that alliances can do more attacking of logistics chains. if you want to kill someone, this is a boon to you. the issue as it relates to this thread, is that even then, these are not \"solo\" actions. because if they were, than any decent coordinated effort would make these logistics impossible. alliances already do that, having dedicated people that exist simply to make production for the other side difficult*. can you imagine what it would look like if the actions were made easy enough that a single player acting alone could have such an effect?there needs to be a balance between the difficulty in maintaining infrastructure and the difficulty in taking it down.currently, one of the largest barriers to that is fueling. pos are big, expensive and continue to be expensive over their entire life, they are also a pain to keep working. if you make them too easy to destroy, holding space suddenly becomes unprofitable whenever anyone sneezes in your general direction. since we want corporations to fight over space, making space unprofitable is bad, no one will go there and set up shop.it is ironic then, that you rail against people not mining, because it is actually the time, effort and cost[note: whether or not it is mined by the alliance is irrelevant, the market has determined a measure of equivalence between the actions that generate the income for the fuel and the actions that generate the fuel itself] of fueling that enforces that infrastructure be so hard to effect. if it is not hard to effect, then the benefit of owning space would drop while the cost of owning space would stay the same or increase. we already have problems with 0.0 space not being profitable enough on an individual level, we do not need to deal with the prospect of it not being profitable on a corporate level.in any fair game between three people, if two of the people gang up, the third person will lose. it is not a fair game if the third person can win against the other two. it seems that this unfair game is what you want to play, this may not be true, it may be that you have legitimate gripes that stem from an inability to catch ratters and cloakers. but on the surface, you seem to be saying \"i want to be able to hurt hundreds of players in an alliance disproportionately to the amount that they can hurt me, and i want to be able to do it without expending the effort that they have taken in order to secure themselves\"that isn't to say that there isn't a lot to be done on the issue of making space easier to take. but it is to say that your specific complaints are unwarranted and may even be impossible to implement**.* don't believe me? go find rise on the political map. they were dead before we got there, and it had nothing to do with the pos that were on their way, but everything to do with a group of people simply making production on an individual level impossible. soon enough they could not afford to fly battleships in fleet ops and by the time that gs and allies got there they were a skeleton crew in poorly fit, ineffectual ships.** this is a whole other post dealing with hybrid[cooperative/competitive] games and the optimal play choices that evolve from them, and is a little bit too complicated to get into right now."
"i appreciate the reply... i really do. but come on! i wish to see what damage i can inflict upon a 0.0 alliance logistics (assuming they ever hit the belts in mining ships... which is not likely to happen). because i'm solo, let's face it, i really don't have the means to take out jump freighters. let's say i target gs. me and my rifter (or stabber or even rapier) and an alt in a covert ops with a small armor rep drone and a remote hull repairer against 5000 combat players. who control their space, share intelligence channels, and work in coordinated groups.and you say:dude! the odds couldn't be slanted any further in the alliance's defense. one against 5000 is unfair? to the 5000? everyone glosses over the truth. a.) 0.0 alliances do not care to mine. it's boring and opens up weaknesses if they are forced to do it (instead of buying fuel from empire and jumping it back). and, of course, morale doesn't exactly go through the roof when the call for group mining goes out. b.) you're not worried about me and my rifter. i can tell you that right now. saying my one-man crusade would be a challenge for gs is just silly. but it would create a new breed of player, wouldn't it? the deep space pirate. who operates solo or in small groups, and only cares about pulling down a target alliance (assuming they had to pull their fuel from their own space).this is just idle conjecture. i cannot envision ccp moving ice to low-sec and 0.0. the outcry would be worse than the aborted carrier-nerf. but the truth is, 0.0 alliances are insulated from individual attack by the sovereignty mechanics... and they're quite happy that way. otherwise, all of eve really would drag down bob.can you imagine what would occur if the individual (not to mention pilots of rival alliances) was able to slip into an alliance's space and begin disrupting operations to fuel towers?"
"no, 1 against 5000 is fair when they're playing on even ground.you see, eve is a hybrid game, all player have roughly the same starting resources and ability to take actions. but they can choose to ally themselves with others.the system means that, so long as the person you are working with has the same goals as you, its impossible to create a situation where aligning is not the optimal play choice. such, in any system where all the players have a standardized starting point, the players that align themselves with others are going to do better than the players who do not.what this means for you is that you have deliberately chosen a path through the game that is the most difficult path that anyone could choose. the odds are not stacked against you because the game is unfair, but because you have chosen that they be. that is your problem, you could also choose to only fly merlins and wonder why you were unable to compete with the rest of eve, and it would be just as fitting to tell you that only flying merlins is a bad choice and is going to be very hard, in any fair system, for you to get ahead.i mine. do not be so assured about your ability to stop people from mining.yes, which is why i told you it was a stupid idea to be able to challenge infrastructure directly, it would end the ability of any alliance to do anything."
"relax. this is just a theoretical discussion. we might as well be arguing how many angels can dance upon the head of a pin.yes. you understand my position. or not. freighters were good. you ended up with massive freighter runs to get goods to/from empire. at least someone could hit them... or nip at their heels. but jump freighters made logistics very easy, and was not a good decision in a game where points of contention are sought. neither was cyno-jammers... but let's not go down that particular tangent. and it's not just that the jump freighters are bad. it's the jump freighters combined with the macro-miners in empire which have caused (again, imo) and imbalance.interesting. given the gs-jihad history, i may be reading more into that comment than i should. was the jihad against empire miners an attempt to drive up fuel/ore prices in specific areas? given the proclaimation that miners could operate freely in minmatar space (which was closest to gs's territory at the time) i'd always assumed it was an experiment to control a heavily insulated market and put pressure on one's rivals.though i'd only followed the massive whine threads about it on the forums and have no direct experience.question: is it probable, under the current mechanics, to strangle off an alliance's ability to gather fuel for their towers? you mentioned rise, but from my understanding, that operation was directed at keeping people from ratting, and had no effect upon claims of sovereignty. it was to break their will. but i may be misinformed."
"it was two things1. it was a diversion for our players2. it was a pressure to mine ice that we used more heavily.there is a lot of ice mining that goes on in various areas to supply moons. regional ice meant that we had an easier time[at the time] fueling and running minmatar towers. our ratters produced domination pos bpcs which use minmatar fuel. bob was running amarr towers due to their regional ice. such any pressure to increase the costs of amarr ice and lower minmatar ice would put pressure on them.which was a massive increase in cost for alliances. when the shift went from owning space as production in isk and faction items from static complexes to production in tech 2 moons the methods of moving the massive amount of stuff back to empire had to change.that being said, even then, carrier jumps and cargo expanded dreadnoughts made hauling large amounts of goods to 0.0 relatively easy. especially with tractor beam compression ratios. jump freighters actually represented an increased cost in moving goods for empires since they were coupled with massive reduction in the ability to compress ores and a large increase in the types of goods that were being sent back out.yes, its probable. its not easy, but its probable.remember, that removing the ability of individual members to produce is the same as removing the alliances ability to produce. alliances are simply a group of people working towards the same goal. fuel doesn't get paid for by magic, pos don't get defended solely by guns. ships don't buy and make themselves.the effect is just not seen over an quick time period."
"love that stuff like this is possible in eve. i'm curious: did it succeed in modifying the prices? i watched the stats pile up on the killboard, but couldn't shake the feeling that the operation was 'trying to empty the ocean with a bucket.' it is a heavily insulated market."
"not sure, i didn't pay much attention to it. even if it did, the fact that an alliance was using regional specific towers hints that they might have their own production capacity.edit: it could also be that we wanted to sell hulks and the suppliers were influencing domestic policies to increase demand. i know one of our guys had a symbiotic relationship selling ravens in that manner [step 1: put ravens on the market, step 2: wait for friend to blow said raven out of space, step 3: put more ravens on the market]"
"solo play in eve imo doesnt need more love. you can do almost everything solo nowi didnt say it needed to be nerfed! i just say imo this area is rather well developped and other areas of the game might need more urgent work, for now at least.edit : and about my \"views\" eve is a sandbox, solo is part of it and fine"
"i've been leaning towards goumindong, ankhe and scagga. but i'd like to ask, in this eleventh hour, for any last thoughts on who has the strongest platform to improve faction warfare. from sovereignty meaning something, modest rewards for plexing and pvping, wardec mechanics and alliance involvement, who has the best ideas to get some changes done right away?ship balancing, skill queues and changing the sov mechanics in 0.0 all have some importance to me, but fw is what i love and i want my vote to go to the candidate who is best positioned to save it and make it better."
"thank you for considering me for your vote.i would suggest, when you consider someone's ideas on improving factional warfare, to not treat it as an isolated case - i.e. just their ideas for factional warfare. many of the problems inherent in factional warfare will also colaterally benefit from improvements to other areas of eve; for example - small gang and fleet warfare mechanics (for which i have made proposals), non-linear objectives (e.g introducing pirates to factional warfare) and improvements to the economy and agents (both fw and non-fw). the other comment i would make, please don't hope for changes that can be done 'right away'."
"unfortunately, nothing is going to get done \"right away\" and for the rest i mainly agree with scagga regarding what it takes to solve the problem. which i suppose doesn't help you out all that much.with regards to the specific problems in factional warfare, i see them as:1. problems relating to the spawning of complexes to be taken.2. problems in the types of npc's present3. a lack of incentive to complete objectivesi have been working on some ideas that i will be posting in the assembly hall forum some time after the election with regards to mission based pvp and how we can implement it. which includes simple and easy fixes to npc's in order to achieve missions that can and/or must be completed in pvp fits, which can be used to make fw missions better.but in the end, what its going to come down to financial rewards in the form of flat payment, or loyalty points for completing fw objectives that get people interested in the system. part of the problem, i think, stems from the fact that it is a pve originating system that ccp wanted to be based on pvp. i say it originates from a pve style because with typical pvp you have an organic objective based on some incentive. the aggressor wants to prevent an action from happening and the defender wants to make it happen. the aggressor wants to reap rewards from the destruction and the defender wants to secure their rewards.with no real rewards worth fighting over, fw doesn't become an interesting system, it become and isk sink that you participate in for kicks. fixing the incentives are the first thing you need to do before fixing the system. now, i will say that i do not have any specific experience on tq in fw. my experience comes in sov based warfare. this affords me the ability to distinguish what works in sov warfare and what doesn't and apply those things to fw and make sure the things that don't are not included.specifically, we're looking at formalizing objectives and rewards. if you make plexes into specific types, then have those plexes correspond to a specific benefit. then players can make informed decisions about what they want to take. e.g. you could have the largest of plexes correspond to low-sec jump bridges. where whomever controlled the largest number of plexes was afforded the right to anchor jump bridge networks within the system. you could have the medium sizes plexes correspond to agents. where owning the medium plexes in a system opened up factional agents of increasing quality. etc etc etc. now, these are just ideas thrown out there, but it should give you an idea of what i think needs to happen to make fw \"profitable\" to the people involved. rather than just adding up points and flipping systems, there needs to be a real monetary or infrastructure benefit to having your faction control the space."
"well, it was asked today in the csm public chat what the 2 or 3 items were that were highest on my to-do list, and i named factional warfare, the skill queue, and 0.0 sov mechanics (and ways to 'develop' space in 0.0 to make it more meaningful). i would personally not focus that much on ship balancing, because i think that ship rebalancing should be done in a big patch that affects all the problematic ones at the same time, not one tiny individual change at a time, and the csm can only bring up these individual changes. when it comes to black ops boosts and such i agree that there is a role for the csm.i have been at the roundtables and spoke with the designers about factional warfare, and did my best to relay the problems that plague factional warfare currently:* unsustainability, people being forced to run missions for money to expend on fw* lack of meaningful consequences, player actions do not influence the world. even after conquering systems everything is still the same save for a little nametag change.* lack of rewards, there is nothing gained from factional warfare except one-time standing boosts through promotion, thus no incentives to keep participating and nothing to work towards.* no diverse objectives. when factional warfare was announced, i expected that we could get missions such as \"smuggle these weapons to the rebels at this planet\", and there would be enemy players scanning people at the gates to prevent them smuggling stuff... people don't want to sit at a complex for 10-20 minutes over and over and over again...* missions not influencing system contestation. mission runners are better off running highsec missions, as mission runners are not beneficial to their faction in fw.* no indication of progression in the system contestation. i know a flat number is not desirable, but at least give an indication exactly how contested a system is.i'd say the thing we need to get in there right now is rewards. remove those standing gains from complexes, and instead have a loyalty point shop like thing that is paid with victory points. when missions contest systems, give some victory points from missions as well. victory points are awarded from kills already, so just make sure that the amount of vp is based on the ship class that is destroyed so people wont blow up their alts. anyway, with these vp players should be able to buy items from a special shop, which has some militia-exclusive things. i personally think that standing and thus promotion should be bought through this as well, so people can choose to be guns-for-hire and take the money or join for more idealogical reasons and thus rank up. for either type of player factional warfare will have something (i'd personally take useless rank icons over items though!)next, meaningful consequence to system contestation. ccp said they can't make stations deny docking, but they will look into rendering station services unusable for opposing militia. i don't think that goes far enough, as i'd like to see more of an impact on the game world. i suggested having cosmos-like agents in the systems, and their appearance is based on the faction that controls the area of space, and for how long they have been the owners. thus to get the minmatar agent that rewards you for handing over liberated slaves, the minmatar would have to capture and hold system x for a week, but if the amarr hold it they'd get an agent that looks for some new manpower... then it would matter which faction you fight for, and which systems you own. i'd even go as far as saying that after a while a special agent should appear that gives a difficult mission which can make the players earn specific medals. but hey, that's the achiever personality of me popping up again!as for alliances participating, we already brought that up in the current csm and ccp's answer was: yes, but with a standing requirement."
"i have already sent in some documents while on the current csm, but ccp will review them as part of the next csm because they ran out of time, so i better get re-elected or else some random dude will have to advocate my stuff!!! you can download them here:lack of focus and goals in factional warfareproblems with complex spawninginitial reaction (relatively old document from right after fw introduction):factional warfare by eva jobseso, who has the strongest platform? seems like i've already got it in the pipeline! oh and hands-on experience?please visit your user settings to re-enable images.how is this for credentials?"
"/me chucklesi didn't know i was supposed to repost my entire manifesto on fw here to answer the op's question well, i don't think the problem with fw stops at rewards/progression. unlike some people who've decided to solo their way through factional warfare, i've been a commander in the amarr militia and been in touch with a large number of combatants and mission runners - i'm a bit more in touch with the reasons 'on the ground' as to why many people feel they could enjoy factional warfare more.it can get damn boring.i wouldn't enjoy running complexes even if they paid me better. the objective isn't just to make factional warfare a 'little' more financially rewarding that it at the moment. making fw profitable to the extent that the numbers skyrocket - if you think about it - is not what people want. if it becomes the next best way to make isk, it will become the domain of the most powerful. the objective should be to make it fun, first. profitability is not as important. it's a god-damned grind at the moment, if you didn't notice.i find the aforementioned notion disturbingly lacking in many of people's ideas...to save creating an eyesore, i'll link some of my ideas here:integrating piracy with fwintegrating fw with roleplayingstreamlining fleet warfare, i.e. improving fw by proxymaking rank matter in fwintegrating pvp with fw via agents: remains to be written up formally, but the gist of this is that agents could give people reasons to kill high ranking enemy members."
"i don't think so.you did a bunch of complexes, solo."
"ankh flew with our corporation during her time in the gallente federation. during that period we fitted her out with top-of-the line faction gear and got her in an interceptor and taught her how to use the directional scanner, how to tackle and how to avoid potentially dangerous situations.she was a lot of fun to fly with, even if she was constantly trying to get us to fly into plexes with her. :)"
"no, we noticed. but its not going to change without removing the primary concept that ccp had for it, which was to make capturing independent of gang size. there are certainly ways that you can reduce the amount of \"sitting around\" in complexes, but they aren't going to make a difference if no one is there to contest it. instead of sitting around, you will shoot some static object and leave.if you increase the density of players and add reward to attack and defend sites then that time spent \"sitting around\" is more likely to be filled with real combat which is exciting and isn't grinding.you have the same effect when you add real infrastructure results to the plexes. then its not a grind, since you have a concrete goal to achieve rather than some unknown number of captures that might get you the system, maybe.in short, i am trying to answer the question of \"how do you make it fun\". is it fun because there is pvp? is it fun to shoot npcs? if its fun because there is pvp, which is, what i suspect is fun, then the way to make it more fun it to make more pvp happen and the way to make more pvp happen is to increase incentives for taking the actions on each side, that will bring ships into proximity with competing goals."
"this is too simplistic. i've been involved in factional warfare for months and interacted with a large number of players. pvp (edit: read quantity) and isk are not the main problems. these are more commonly stated problems:- pvp: i can't lead fleets these 'noobs'/ people from other corps. fleets are too difficult to form/lead because at times there aren't leaders. this is why i proposed ways of making leading fleets easier.blobbing is another problem. what you said about making site capture dependent on gang-size is the opposite of what should be done. that aspect at least allows gangs to spread out. last week i led such a gang, splitting up into twos and threes to achieve objectives in 3-4 different systems at once.- spies - there are no counters (i've previously proposed ways of tracing spies via agents to find isk sources)- pointlessness. why should we bother to take that system? the minnies will just get it back. it's not isk that will change this, nor a few fancy game mechanics. the time invested needs to be rewarded with something memorable, more memorable than implicit pats on the back through ingame news announcements. i have proposed this to be a place where live events can interact with fw, giving rewards that can't be matched by mission running or more pvp.edit: if there was more of a point to factional warfare, people wouldn't see it as much as an isk sink, but a worthwhile investment for the chance to take partthere is a lot more to be mentioned, but rl demands my attention. speak to you soon :p"
"something to say about you, to immediately start mud flinging at another candidate. especially since it immediately gets proven that you are taking a quote out of context for your own supposed benefit. if you care about factional warfare and had read the threads(*) where i publicised my findings on the rank structures, you would have found that i flew with the aduro protocol as well as some nice people of pie.*(1)"
"it's your own words, and it's true.and i have personal experience of you when you were in the amarr militia. you refused to join gangs and cooperate, as well as leaving plexes at the first sign of an enemy, even though they could have been defended."
"ha.dis-proven.give it up already."
"this is a problem that cannot be solved via game mechanics.i didn't say it should be done, i said that in order to get away from the \"grind\" as you see it, that would be necessary.incentives are the point. you want people to come and fight you need to give them the incentives to do so."
"only one of these things can be true.either way, it you who is not telling the truth."
"without pages of text :with what i suggested on my candidate first post, which is to vastly improve the gm/\"game organizers\" events, faction warfare could be made so much more dynamic...on the \"npc generated\" events, minmatar space entering widely into amarr space could make amarr need to ally \"more\" with caldari. cheaper faction ships, or some npc delivery of some random gallente faction items to help the fighters defend.on the attacker side, minmatar empire could provide some extra logistics, which could really be npc haulers(like the convoys you see on many npc stations, which are worthless). attackers would have to protect their logistics, slowing down their attack, but wiht the possible benefits of, for example, t2 items in their new conquered places, or hand out free loot to defenders if they dont defend.just brainstorming there, but actually all those ideas are spread over all forums.just type faction warfare on eve search !"
"so, now there's two of you that want to make personal attacks against me? how gallant. i'm sure you'd make excellent csm's, we didn't have enough bickering during the first csm, eh?perhaps you could have considered that both things are the truth. you were looking for things to rip out of context to use against me in political slander, and read what you wanted to read.yes i said i never *had* to fire a shot to obtain maximum rank, that does not mean that i never did, and that also means that people can obtain maximum rank in factional warfare solo and without competition. do you really think that there is any gang around that wants to capture 523 complexes? not really. so that rank part is indeed mostly a solo endeavour. that does not mean i haven't been in gangs and captured plexes though. maybe you'd consider that i have two maximum ranks. perhaps i used different strategies in obtaining both ranks. after all, capturing 111 plexes back in those days is a lot less than today's 523, is it not?"
"i think it can be solved by game mechanics - but not easily nor instantaneously. the problem partially lies in the barriers to becoming an fc - i.e. being a fleet commander for a normal fleet isn't easy, and one must appreciate that commanding an 'open' militia fleet is even more difficult - hell, it took top class fc's to get those kind of gangs operating in a coherent manner. i recall there being fewer of those kind of fcs in the amarr militia than i could count on my fingers - there are even fewer now.so the approach i'd take in that respect is to make fc'ing easier. these are some of the minor changes i've proposed:- enable motds for standing orders, which helps reduce the need to repeat orders if you are reconnecting / joining late- allow fleet/wing/squad commanders to have a differently coloured text- create a 'merge fleet' option to automate the unifying of different gangs- supporting the 'automatic continuation of fire after reloading'- allow the fc to know the shiptypes of his gangmembers automatically from his watchlist, or another ui option, allowing him to assess the situation more accurately- allow the fc to label aforementioned list with 'roles' if necessaryi think that the cons outweigh the pros here, honestly.yes, goum, incentives. but as you can see, i don't think that it is isk and pvp that people want most. they want a reason to fight. factional warfare is a long-term project. the end-game of 'win a system' or 'win a fight' is not satisfying. if people's objective is to make money, there are better ways. if people want to get the best quality pvp, there are better ways.therefore i mentioned the integration of live events with factional warfare. it needs an incentive that sets it in a different class from suboptimal missions, endless f1-f8 keypunching and killboard wh*ring....otherwise...it's just a rehash of existing mechanics imo. what i'm saying is, even if you give people isk and more pvp, it won't necessarily make fw better. i know many who wouldn't see it any differently if that was the endpoint of our scope of the problem."
"those are good, but its not going to make any more fc's. that can only be achieved by a willingness to lose shipsvery possibly. but the \"sitting around\" problem as expressed can't be solved in any other way.i don't think that these alone would make the experience gratifying. but in the end, you need to feed the system so that players continually take part. its the first thing you need to fix, before you can start thinking about an integrating it in with the lore"
"they are not personal attacks if they are true and not against you as a person. we have both found fault with your credentials. it is your own fault for painting a false picture of yourself.ok, i'll assume they were both true. you ran complexes in factional warfare when the gains were out of proportion, and refused to cooperate with other militia members. i personally witnessed you abandoned positions at the first sight of the enemy when you were in the amarr militia, only interested in raising your own standings. that's nothing to be proud of, nor to use as proof of good experience of the problems facing fw.then, you met up with a corp in the gallente militia while you were a csm member, that gave you free faction fitted interceptors and combat training. i don't know whether every corp gives someone who they consider in need of combat training free faction fitted interceptors to train on. is that what the fw joe the plumber experienced? () what do you think?the stories told of your time in fw are not representative of any norm, thus you can't come here boasting 'credentials' without expecting people to point this out. also, jumping to the conclusion that every criticism is a personal attack says something about you, as nobody here has attacked you as a person."
"too bad both of your so called 'faults' have been disproven with factual evidence.funny, as those scribblings on the killboard clearly say 24th imperial crusade, and i was flying with a bunch of other guys at the time. i also flew with pie, ask laerise. if you had read the thread i posted, there's a list of names i worked together with so we would all get standings.i think they were convinced that i could improve factional warfare as a csm and they found me a likeable person.you know what the norm is? the norm is that people join fw, lose a few ships, and think \"what the hell am i doing this for?!\" and go do other things.so instead of debating my credentials, how about we stop this **** right here and work together to make sure the above is no longer the norm?"
"so, to get back into the discussion that really matters, i'd like to start with this.you are right here. but i still think that rewards should be implemented to make factional warfare sustainable.sustainable does not have to mean it has to be ludicrously profitable, it just needs to give a little incentive to fight for as well as a means to cover some expenses that are caused by ship losses.if fw would be too profitable, it would attract the wrong kind of people, imo.when i discussed fw at the fanfest, they indicated that they are working on this aspect of incorporating live events into factional warfare, as well as influencing the storyline. so there's hoping!"
"they haven't, but i can prove them later. showing up on a killboard doesn't mean what i said didn't happen. why should i bother bringing up logs though?ankh, i'm happy to let us change the subject. however, if you really want us to stop debating your doubted credentials, please don't add fuel to the debate before saying that."
"many thanks to everyone for giving me their trust and votes.voting almost closed and i have no idea how smashing the results will be /extreme"
"good luck, extreme!"
"well, to be point here, a lot of the people who claimed it would be offensive, wouldn't have found it offensive themselves. i am a muslim player, and i know a fair few others, we all found it hilarious, people seriously need to learn to lighten up. it is a game, not real life, we play games generally to enjoy ourselves and escape real life, the goons were enjoying themselves evidently, good for them! if people are going to whine about something that needs to be taken as a joke. then they should seriously just leave the game.it isn't offensive to islam at all. the whole spin on suicide bombings and 'terrorism' is largely bull**** to the masses. what is really terror? someone who is prepared to wipe themselves out in the name of something they believe in? or a nation that declares war on a much more inferior one and crushes it. which is really the terrorist?let's avoid the last bit and not get involved in a political debate. i enjoy a lot of politics irl and i don't want to completely bring it over here aswell. tl;dr - i'm a muslim, i know a few others, we found it funny, people need to lighten up.as for the topic at hand, the news-worthy events that goonswarm does gives them credit, as pointed out prior in the thread, it makes eve exciting a lot more interesting than a lot of other mmo's. it generated a lot of buzz ingame, so what? some people lost some ships? that goes hand-in-hand with the entire risk concept of eve. just because some more goons may get into the council, that doesn't really transfer anything into their favour. i remember someone pointing it out before (may have been lvv) that csm really doesn't hold that much power when you get right into it. so they wouldn't really turn eve into a sour apple anytime soon by getting hold of csm.plus, any alliance in theory can blob out csm with their members, the goons may not be the only ones. edit: besides, you shouldn't really just be against a csm member just because he/she is a member of goonswarm alliance, that just proves you can't even make your own opinion of someone."

"i don't like mmorpgs much. \"ghost training\" feature, which is now called a bug, was a reason why i started playing eve. if ccp has money troubles, they'd better fire financial advisers, who come up with such *great* ideas. and pr managers clever enough to turn features into bugs. so i'm voting for returning ghost training."

"being able to jump one day, and jump back on login the next would be very very hot. the 24 hour delay as it stands tends to mean that i have to wait through a fair bit of my available game time just to be able to jump back."
"a very good point indeed however the assumption is being made here that the skill requirements for tech iii is going to follow the logical path of tech i > tech ii > tech iii and frankly there isn't any reason really that i can see that the skill requirements have to follow this path.lets work on the assumption that these ships are cruiser sized (though my prediction is that the size of ship will depend on the components you use to build it). with just racial cruiser level i and the most beginning of tech iii skills, you would have available the most basic of tech iii components to build your ship. by training cruiser up a few more levels and the tech iii skills, you open up more advanced components and maxing out both area's of skills allows to use the best components available. by doing the skill training in this way, it would open up this to the availability of even the newer players while at the same time giving players a branch of skill training which they may feel a good goal to aim for meaning that people that spend the time and isk training up get better components to build there ships.using this branched version of skill requirements would also be very easy to explain away from a roleplaying point of view (if you care about such things ) with the simple statement\"tech 3 is completely different technology to tech 2 and therefore does not require knowledge of tech 2 to use\""

"i too would like to see the bombs become fire and forget, but i don't think they should automatically hit their target if you cloak (plus i don't think it will work within the game mechanics). it would make the bomber way to powerful. if anything a bomb should simple run out its remaining flight time and then explode from the moment the launching bomber either is destroyed, cloaks, warps, or docks.it would be nice touch if you could set the \"fuse\" on your bomb so you could control its flight time.(zero would become the new suicide gank.)if they want to make it more challenging, because eventually good pilots will learn how to fire them this way, they could add some wobble into the flight path, as missiles do now when lock is broken.also they really need to revamp the explosion graphics and what the bomb looks like. it should be pretty obvious someone just let loose something destructive verses the little fire cracker pop we have now.to keep from getting insta-popped make sure your target is one that is pre-occupied. an alert gate camp makes for a poor target (you will die).good targets:a friendly carrier besieged by drones and fighters.a tight blob of enemies remote repping one another during a pos/fleet fight.interrupting two other groups fighting with a well placed bomb in the middle is good fun.with the current mechanics the trick is you need to be shooting at someone who is already invested at shooting at someone else if you want to live to launch your second bomb.range is not much of an issue with bombs if you train up your skills. train up missile bombardment for a 50% range bonus and missile projection for 50% velocity increase. with mb 5 and mp 3 i can launch around 35kms from the target.the cost of the indivdual bombs will eventually drop once the market starts adapting to the 50% reduction in manufacturing costs that occurred with the last patch."

"dear csm,for australia/nz players, every day's regular dt comes right in the middle of peak playing time - 9pm aest (brisbane/sydney/canberra/melbourne) or 10 pm aedst. as such anzac players feel a little discriminated against, and gameplay style gets cramped.yes, being a one-server global game, dt runs a chance of being inconvenient for someone, and i fully understand that in terms of volume, anzacs don't compare to europe and northern america. i ask only that the issue be discussed to see if there is a time slot that would not create issues for europe/na and remove the issue for anzacs.assuming that no-one would stand for dt in their local 8:00 pm to midnight slot, and that ccp need staff on deck during gmt daylight for dt maintenance, then a quick and rough calculation says to me that some time around 15:00-17:00 gmt could achieve this. that's around 2:00 to 4:00 australian, 9:00-11:00 us east coast, 6:00-8:00 us west coast.i don't know what the player presence online is from europe at that time however - could be that is a moderately heavy period there and thus not an option.to progress this it would be good to initially ask ccp to provide figures on the number of players online from each geographical area over a typical 24-hr period, if that's possible. analysis of that may show that the \"win\" criteria i outlined above isn't achieveable. or it may show there are options that haven't been considered.respectfully submitted for your consideration."

"yes i fully support this."
"this sounds like it would reduced lag and streamline pvp much more, as well as make pvp more fluent, as realism in the game dictates it should"
"i really hope eve becomes 18+ rated.ccp, include gambling!"
"meh. that's what i have to say because this thread has no point in existing to many arguments and people trying to make there own facts. since were on the whole 18+ theme we might also want to start bringing up trading on the market because its a great way to make or loose a lot of isk, just like gambling. also like gambling if your doing your own trading through sites like e-trade you have to be 18+ oes noes!! how could they overlook this"
"no gray area at all you paid rl money for in game time that you can buy isk with which is just more ingame stuff at no point can you turn it back into rl money without breaking ula. which frees ccp from any legal action that could be taken against people trying to do it such as an isk farmer \o/"
"isn't the incentive to bug reporting that its much more likely to be fixed if you do so than if you just complain about it on the forum?i agree the process is a bit convoluted. i currently have a crash issue that can happen either 2 minutes into the game, or not at all over a 4 hour session, which makes it horrific to try and log.i think a better suggestion would be to streamline the bug reporting process somehow. maybe a small memory dump directly from the client upon crash. especially helpful for those really-hard-to-replicate bugs. though not sure how this would help non-crashing bugs.anyway, i'm not supporting this idea, because i believe the fixing of the oh-so-annoying bug is the reward for reporting it properly"

"1. able to use gang mods in warp.2. scripted gangmods. there should be only 1 type of gangmod and it should use scripts. these scripts should use the current gangmods names and ability. or there will be siege, skirmish, inform, armor warfare gangmoduls like atm, and for example a skirmish modul should use only skrimish scripts.3. all fleet and field cs should have a base 2% bonus to all gangmods. so for example a field type of cs will be better then a simple bc with a gangmod, and at the fleet side you dont have to learn all the cs types to use all the gangmods on high efficiency. of course every the racespec ship 3% bonus at the fleet cs wont gone.4. you have starbase defence managment skill and you are in a cs under a pos forcefield. cs pilots should be able to use gangmods and pos turrets at the same time. it would be useful at pos defence.5. vulture balance. vultures should have an extra hislot to compare with the total slot number of claymore and to be able to fit 5 turrets and 3 gangmods at the same time. 5% or 3% or 2% of damage bonus per level to reach the damage of a 6 turreted ferox.

"you know that just about every candidate running was pro-queue, right?oh, and i voted for this crazy-awesome guy with a name eerily like my own. all the cool kids were doing it."
"voted ank because she is clearly the best of the returning csm candidates for continuity purposes, she served admirably as secretary in the first session and would make a good chair for the 2nd in my opinion. enthusiastic, dedicated and willing to learn. all in all a very good candidate. voted pattern because of all the candidates he seems to have the greatest understanding of what needs to be done to preserve small unit pvp in eve online at the moment. he's a pvp'er in a small roving alliance not a blob-fighter, and his posts on shc have a decent level of vision and insight. voted omber zombie because he's a guy of great character and long experience in eve online and is the single \"process reformer\" candidate that i would trust to do the job. he also steped up as a replacement alternate in the first session and performed very well with good attendance and insightful decisions (even though he often disagreed with me!). i'd love these 3 candidates to make it onto the council."
"voted for lavista vista because everytime i've read his posts they have made sense, at least the vast majority of the time sadly the same couldn't be said for some of the other csm's, but then that's why i didn't vote for them."
"i would have voted for ankh and vuk lau, split, if i had not been running. ankh, because she is really dedicated to this game and the csm, and while in some areas completely noob, at least convincable. and vuk, because he is the only one among the candidates i have ever been flying with, and also because despite being a titan pilot, he wanna see titans nerfed. thats exactly the kind of mentality we need in the council, people with perspective who do not only care about their own virtual life. i hope both of them make it into the next council."
"i voted for me... but i probably would have voted for tusko or herschel if i wasn't running. tusko because after a fair few discussions with him he seems to have the game's welfare at heart (and we both like his homeland's cooking) and herschel because he seems as insane as me :)"
"same, i voted for lvv too. same reasons as the first election."
"i voted for myself because i want to represent all these lovely people who voted for me"
"i voted garion avarr because i want someone on the csm who cares about the rpg in mmorpg and he was most visible in supporting the roleplaying side."
"i didnt vote because when i voted the first time csm was made it pretty much did fek all so i thought y waist my time again ^^"
"huzzah to all the candidates!ragu"
"i voted vuk simply cause he's a awsome guy and when a titan pilot wants titan nerfed it showes that he actually care more about the gameplay for others then for himself"
"i figured that if i was asking all my friends to vote for me, i should set the example by voting for myself too.if i wasn't running . . . well, i'd have had some hard choices to make, though there's one candidate that would have gotten at least one of my votes no question, my only decision would have been if i'd give all my votes to him or spread them. probably at least partially spread them, there are a number of candidates i like. i'm not going to name names, though, as i don't want to prejudice my relationship with anyone i might be working with on the csm."

"jetcan mining should continue to be allowed - where's the fun without the risk?personally i don't jetcan. it would be interesting on putting a bit more risk the can-flippers way though. it's a little too easy to pick on a new player who's trying to earn his way rather than begging. sure, join a corp and get corp protection is one way but in your first weeks you're probably learning to play and not looking at joining a corp. another way is to allow players in a fleet to look out for each other. add a jettison for fleet option, where aggro is against every member of your fleet when you flip.benefits..adds the risk -vs- payoff for flippers.promotes player interaction.good introduction to pvp for new players aside from fw.more fun. some group action is always better than solo. you guys chip in with the drawbacks that i can't think of..."

"i found that to be a fascinating question! so i hired a large staff of research assistants and yes, strangely, it is just you!i would not have suspected that, my guess was at least one other pilot in eve thought the same thing, but statistics never lie!you are the only one that thinks that!issler"

"kinda concerned. when given the chance to vote for changes, the same ol people retain power unless they **** up in a huge way. even if they completely under-perform, you can just use the same ol gimmick that got you elected the previous term and multiply it by your tenure for what i like to call an electorate oligarchy.happens irl all the damn time. im american and thank god our presidents have to retire after 2 terms. not all elected offices have such guidelines though. there are certainly no such restrictions for the csm.food for thought."

"viva el presidente!"
"great candidate, got both of my votes.goumin what do you think about personal feat content, aka bragging rights?there are a lot of playstyles in eve and it is only natural that people want to share their accomplishments with others. in fantasy mmos they have gear, trophies, titles, etc that show off something of a player.in eve the most you usually see of another player are their corp, alliance, sec rating, bio, and bounty. that tells players so very little about what yourself. in wow if you saw a player with the arathi basin tabard on you knew they were experienced. in daoc if you saw someone with the lord/lady/fru/emerald ridier title you knew you were in for a fight.in eve you fly by and see a bunch of squares on screen, a bunch of ships that all look the same, and a jumbled list of names in your overview.imo eve needs an overhaul in player accomplishment recognition."
"medals have just been added so that corporations can decorate their players, and certificates can be made public to show competency in general areas.while it would be nice to have a system that had such achievements, the first step in doing so is figuring out what we want to make an achievement. it seems to me, that if medals could be awarded by third party entities, that might allow players to fill in the blanks.all in all, i am not sure how something like that would be implemented, but it would be a handy feature."
"if this were even possible, yeah i think eve would be fixed at that point and wouldn't need a csm."
"what is the difference between buying a new character and changing your character's name?maybe include name changes in corp history?and i support this."
"while i have an awesome name it doesn't really fit when i want to rpand yea there should just be a history like corp history."
"added idea to the features and ideas forum. for suggestions to the proposal."
"its obvious that ccp wants us to adapt and have to fit target painters to do full dmg for caldari. they made a reason to require it, not just make it easier.on that note... training amarr bs lvl 5. since everything else is basically nerfsd to hell. seeing as i have already laid out the problem with caldari and the midpoints for pvp"
"this is your nano nerf, you guys brought it on your self"
"how is that, obviously you think that its only missile users that were only complaining about nanoing, not the capitals, not amarr ships, not gallente ships, yes thats right it must have been those rotten caldari pvp missiles ships that apparently are (so ive been told only good for pve), and of course we should have all apparently gone and trained so that we could nano our ships because yes you guessed it, we should all be flying only ships that can be effectively nanoed, and everyone who doesnt do it must be a loser cause they dont want to.in actual fact you got nano nerfed cause it is actually a fact that you guys bought it upon yourselves, 1 or 2 nano ships wasnt the problem its just the fact that it was becoming the only viable ship to fly, and i am quite sure that ccp on its own are quite able to realise that they dont want eve to go in that direction.not everyone who uses missiles is *****ing about the fact that we have trouble hitting frigates with torpedo's"
"i just post my message to say that i do not like this nerf. and that i'm considering to stop playing eve when my gametime expires."
"exactly there are different groups of missile users that want missiles retweaked. some want the whole patch put back, others just want some numbers redone.1. tears that my bs guns dont hit frigs/interceptors2. group that says as yes 1 more pvp midslot mod needed on missile ships, now where to put it3. bs vs bs warfare just gimped missiles even more so. even w/ the web nerf, missile boats fail next to gunnery boats fit for pvp most of the time.i have no problem w/ speed and sig radius coming into effect for missile damage, it should of been that way in the first place.... its so many other issues surrounding it and some of the base values they choose for missile explosion radius and velocity. where is the missile users lowslot version of a tracking enhancer?my adapt and overcome for this is fine, it just killed one of the ways i loved to fly - solo in a bs w/ missiles and actually have a good chance of surviving. now its back to flying my wetpaper dps vulture and nighthawks, or fly blaster/gun ships... and im leaning more towards guns neways. whats sad is the amount of idiot carebear n00bs that fill these threads, or make new threads, full of whine that their missiles do crap dmg against mission frigs and somehow think the pvp missile community agrees with them."
"a last bump before my account expires (even if it seems to be schizophrenic taking the fact that i dont know if i will return to eve)gl and fun too u all - and gl to ccp, perhaps you reconsider your crm strategy :p"
"you probably got a ore standing that is higher than -2. then you can run missios for ore, this results in higher syndicate standing, then you can run missions for them. next you can run missions for serpentis, and i think angels like serpentis/syndicate, but not sure about that one.but yeah there should be a bit more straightforward method, but it shouldnt be easy."
"sorry, figured you were just another alt troll. pretty much all of your suggestions are a complete nerf to the naglfar.losing a high slot means you lose more dps on it's already sub-par dps, gaining a lowslot is completely worthless because you're starved for cpu as is and can't do anything with it.i honestly don't know why this hasn't been brought up sooner. people use to love nags, i would imagine it was because they saw 4 high slots and figured they did 25% more damage than other dreads (maybe the incredibly strong tempest had something to do with it too). most of these were armor tanked too so they did even less damage than the other race's counterparts.the whole \"they have good small ships so the big ships should suck\" thing is really old. take amarr for example, they have decent inties, probably the best hacs right now (maybe the vaga is still king with the sac / zealot coming in 2nd and third), they have good cruisers, good bc's, good command ships, the recons are still pretty meh but better thanks to the nano nerf, they have amazing battleships, the best supercaps (both titans and motherships), the best dread, and all the carriers are pretty much the same. in every place apart from carriers and dictors (which all 4 races pretty much perform the same role) they are in the top or at very least can compete (recons), minmatar battleships and dread / supercaps are really sub par in every way right now (and i'd still probably fly a falcon over any other recon, and a zealot over any hac maybe that's just me though)."
"im tired of making petitions of macrominers and im still looking at them in local how they strip the belts and they are never in front of the pc.how the ppl needs to ask in the petitions to make the damm gms ban this damm ****ers? u make a petition and in less than 5 seconds they send u a response that are all the same! i send more than 6 petitions of 6 diferent macrominers and the answers are all the same!!! they do copy paste or what?!let me explain how u know when someone is a macrominer, so u guys can see how u need to ban:1st case:they go to a random (or not) belt, they set the drones out and 20 secs later they start to mine... if u see this guy 3 mins later (strip miner cicle), and 1 of the lasers goes oflline, takes another 3 min to start it again. macrominer number 12nd case: they are 23h! all the days, 365 days of the year on, in the same system, they got convos off, they dont talk in local, and they are allways minning ice or common ore. come on! u cant tell me thats not a macro !!3rd case:they mine ice in \"macks\", do a cicle and dock!!! come on!!! even if u are a noob, and u doing that kind of minning, u do better whi hulk because has more cargo!!! and ofcourse: they are allways in the same spot 23h!!!4th case:they orbit the asteroid!! thats the most common macro! and the cheaper! and some ppl thinks we are stupid or the gm too (i hope they are wrong because if it is we are in a big problem).in all 4 cases there is allways some common thigns:1 - they got auto reject convos.2 - they set a shield booster on, or set drones out (they even are stupid enough to leave drones when u can tank the rats).3 - they dont reply in local.4 - they go to the same spot all the time (even when there are not asteroids, thats pretty funny when u see it), or, they go to a dif asteroid every ****ing time they undock.5 - they allways stay a certain ammount of time (lets say 20 min) and is all the time like that.and to let u guys now too, i will explain what is a macro (in eve case):the guys that use macro for minning is simple: there are 2 kinds:1<U+FFFD> --> is a mouse recorder that records the movements of the mouse and clicks, and the player that is gona macromine, do a single minning to record the moves of the mouse and after he finish, he replay it over and over again. how to see that is this kind? they do allways the same, whit a exact ammount of time, in the same place.2<U+FFFD> --> ui macros. this ones are more easier to see what kind of macros they are. ppl create this amcros like programs specially for eve minning, farming, etc. how to detect it? easy: the playe is allways on, it automaticly log in after downtime or after a reboot, they warp to dif belts (or not), they are allways an exact ammount of time in a belt, but some ppl think we are noobs and they configure it that the ship stay the first time 20 min (for example) and the second 25min, and then repeat the cicle.so pls, im ****ing tired that this ****ers ruin the market when i do it like a true miner does: sit in front of the computer and mine while u chat etc.fast way to see if it is macro miner? convo him, if it replay, is not a macro (or maiby it is, but his at the pc). if u get refused, locate the miner and look at him 3 times, and if u can check times. if u see is a macro miner is easy: ban him for god sake!!! is not so hard!!! right click and set ban! end of bussniss one fuker less!!im tired of this, so do something! damm so many new thigns on the game mechanics! thx for the orca! but this problem comes from long ago and still not being solved!!!sry if i got bad writing, im from argentina and i do my best to write a good english.pichonsita.edit: there was a thread aobut macro, but had 90 days old, so making this one. plus it was very incomplete."
"something definatley must be done against mm.it seems there are getting more and more over the last few months....fact is if the game-owner (ccp) doesnt do anything against it - people start to resign at some point and use macros themselves...ccp do something !"
"the problem is acceptance.they are accepted not just by ccp by large sections of the playerbase (when it suits them)the biggest alliances are happy to harbour corps (alebit often through a 'pet' alliance for plausible deniability) that are clearly macro mining. it's a symbiotic relationship where the protector gets a slice of the profits and the macro miners get an aura of legitimacy as well as access to higher end mining materials.until this is broken not much headway against macro miners is possible and to do so means going up against the biggest alliances in the game. consequently, while i would like to see them removed, i don't see it happening myself. token bannings of empire macro miners maybe, but the underlying problem is unlikely to be tackled directly because it's a big can of worms that most don't really want to know about.captain thunk"

"i am with you guys on this one, i might start suicide ganking macros for the fun of it some other things i have noticed, alot of macros mine in covetors and work in teams of 4....3 miners and 1 hauler, i also noticed macros usually have some name that doesn't make any sense."

"as we all know the target painter is the worst/less used ewar module in game. with the recent nerf to missiles and webs many ships were penalised. mostly the caldari but also the minmatar ship line due to the fact that their reckons for example have a bonus to web. now that web is nerfed they have target painter bonus but... wait.. that sucks too :-(anyway my point is that as it is the target painter importance is little. it would be good to encourage people in it's use by increasing it's effectivness. so my idea on how to do this is the following:the tps could be improved without touching the module base efficiencies 'per se' but just by give the player double the effect of what the current tp related skill \"signature focusing\" is giving now. so whereareas signature focusing gives today a 5% bonus to module strength make it 10% so it would change like this:signature focusingadvanced understanding of target painting technology. 10% bonus to target painter modules' signature radius multiplier per skill level.with this implemented the overall tp stregth would rise from todays 36% (30 base for techii tp + max skills) with max skills to the still modest but more significant 45% (30 base for techii tp + max skills)this way the game will have more variety in the fittings and useless ships like belicose will gain some trust.so what do you think?"

"ya there's a bunch of alt corps around right now so mercs can wardec people for 2mil each war. they just have to corpjump around to get to the war they want to play in.2mil to wardec a corp is such a waste of time. oftentimes you can park a cloaked ship in their home system and jam up the game for many people. that's no fun at all."
"you only need to do it once and it's not like you have to sit at the pos while doing it.obvious easy fix is simply...anchoring 1 -manages 1 action at a time.anchoring 2 -manages 2 actions at a time.that way anchoring 5 could be onlining 5 guns at a time for example."
"seems poses count towards sov, having them anchor/online quicker is only going to promote pos spamming and make sov warfare even worse than it already is. i do however think its unreasonable to expect players to sit at towers for hours at a time onlining structures. with this in mind i think a much better option would be the ability to place all the structures and then queue the anchoring/onlining process... then simply run and go do something more enjoyable and all your structures would online/anchor one by one while your away"
"not being able to tell what is camped 100 yards off the station undock without fannying about getting confirmation from other players in system is neither fun nor interesting. isn't it about time the station managers fitted some frigging windows?in leiu of that, overview working in station would be fine."

"hello all, i have been watching the fanfest 2008 videos since i was not fortunate enough to make it this year and i am really excited about the walking in stations and everything that goes with it. i was however surprised about the hanger area being pushed down the list since ccp thinks it will not be used enough to warrant more attention. i would like to ask csm members, the player base, and ccp about moving the captains quarters from the station to being on whatever ship they are currently flying. players would only be able to go to their quarters on board while docked since you have to be in your pod while flying the ship. but, once docked you can exit your pod to your quarters, put on a fresh set of cloths and take an elevator to the airlock on your ship, go through the airlock and into the hanger. once in the hanger you will be able to take a moving walkway to the station elevator to go whever it is you were going, but while you are traveling, all pilots will be able to look at their magnificent starship in all its glory :-) now, different class ships could also be fitted with different size quarters, on frigates the quarters could be sort of small where as quarters on say a carrier could be quite lavish, but this is an extra that isn't really required. i know some of you are thinking \"this guy is freaking crazy, thats alot of graphics work if you have different quarters for each ship\". to help the guys developing this, here is an example, the devs build an enviroment for the caldari frigate quarters, instead of changing it for each caldari frigate, just make all the caldari frigates use the same enviroment, which could also be used in the t2 ships of that class. just an idea i wanted to present to everyone, i figure since they are doing all this work to get walking in stations to be as magnificent as it looks, might as well go all the way :-) fly safe all and i look forward to your comments and suggestions.inf"
"good idea except for the fact you'd have more than one ship... it would be too easy to set up your quarters on the station... or something to that effect."
"from what i have heard it was originally intended that it was to be aboard your ship, but for some reason they had to change it."
"i don't see the difference between different ships and different stations, the only thing i could see is with the stations you would only have to make quarters for each race of station. but if you change the quarters per type of station there are still a ton of quarters enviroments to put together considering all the different factions.it was just a thought that would still let us get a hanger enviroment to admire our ships. what do you guys think of ccp adding a window to the station's captain quarters to let us look out and see our ship?i guess i just want to see ships in all of their glory :-p let me know what you guys think."
"i would be satisfied with a ship viewer. for example, you could have a ship database module that you could place in a bar or storefront that would let you view different ships as if they were in your hanger. as an empire-hugging carebear, i wouldn't mind seeing what all the cap ships look like without getting blown up for my curiosity."
"pg is okish. if you must boost something boost rokh's cap that sucks badly even with perfect cap skills and hardwiring"
"i'll be recording the names of everyone that thinks there should be an age limit."
"i voted for sophie daigneau because i figure having an economy-focused rep from 0.0 could add value and perspective that empire-based carebear production/mining/etc reps may not have."
"aww, thank you and yet, not only did you think it worth your time to read this board, you thought it worth your time to post on it. you realize that for the same time investment as keeping up to date on this forum, you could have researched the candidates and voted accordingly, right?"
"1) eve is a sandbox game.2) the game mechanics of factional warfare do not offer any rewards for kills, thus there is no point.3) i plan to fix point 2."
"i haven't flown all the afs, but for the ones i have flown, here's my opinion on them.jaguar: it's built to be a high-as shield tanker, so it performs admirably in that role with the potential +50% damage.wolf: one more turret slot, but only +25% damage, which equals out. it's the armor tanker of the mini afs.ishkur: agreed. they've underperformed ever since the bandwidth nerf, and they could stand to lose a turret or two."
"i know the voting is over, but i would like to say that missions was the crux of my platform when running for csm. we'll have to see how the voting turns out soon though."
"i love it when people say that the best way to improve missions is to 'make them better'. it really puts me at ease...as your question included the word 'various aspects', i'll widen my license on aspects to cover . some proposals i'm writing up regarding missions include:increase the gradientlow sec l4 agents require a higher margin of increased profitability compared to high sec l4 agents to be worth doing in a hostile environment(i say this from personal experience). i don't like the idea of directly reducing rewards of missions in high sec arbitrarily, until i've seen more information on the potential income.new agent functions: information disclosureadd interesting functions to level 5 agents: enhanced information disclosure. examples of this include ways to trace alts, such as being able to reveal a pilot's wallet transactions in case one suspects a 'generous donor' main, for instance. this makes sense in the context of eve, where you rarely have reason to trust the legitimacy of certain pilots, and want at least the assurance that the pilot is earning his own isk.other advanced information disclosure items may include revealing the contents of someone else's hangar, if it is in a station of the same faction. this may allow a war target to know what his enemy might bring to the field. in my opinion, this is a logical progression from the under-developed agent 'perks' of the current locator agents.pirate agents in low sec spacepirate agents for their respective factions could be introduced in low sec space, in ships hidden at planets for pilots to discover. also, their location could change every few weeks to add a bit of realism and work against promoting agent hoarding.pvp missions for factional warfare: assassination missions and variable ranksi've always felt that factional warfare should be more than just a rehash of existing mechanics. one idea i've been working on is assassination missions, whereby an agent asks a pilot to kill an enemy militia pilot of a certain rank (i'm not sure a podding is necessary, that is being decided upon). rank as it stands is only a slowly rising matter. one cannot be demoted in factional warfare. this means, to a great extent, that your fw rank does not correlate with your actual ability as a pilot, which means that people can sneak into unoccupied complexes for extended periods, get a high rank and claim that they are amazing pilots. being successfully taken down in an assassination mission should lead to a loss in rank. i also think that killing high ranking enemy pilots should improve your rank - and that it should possible to show rank in the overview. can you imagine how fleet warfare would be in that case? imagine people shooting the 'officers first'. it adds a touch of realism imo.(continued)"
"mission lootas for the actual loot that missions drop, i am aware that people have pointed out that substantial module drops lead to a glut of the modules themselves, and the minerals they refine to. before saying whether this is a 'problem' or not, or whether intervention is necessary, i'd be curious to know exactly how much in the way of modules/minerals are being produced, and what fraction of the market this makes up. from my experience it is not the norm for every single mission runner to always loot every single wreck in their mission. to conclude this point, i'd like to request figures and compare this to market volume, as i have never read a proposal that has included this. if mission loot meltdown only accounts for e.g. 1-5% of the mineral market, why should intervention be considered necessary?also, we have to take into account that there is a niche market based around buying up minerals and loot from mission runners. it is important to realise this things before deciding to accidentally destroy gamestyles we are not familiar with."
"finally got some of the agents and missions ideas jotted. see here."
"there are many historical analogues for this.the blockade runners of the american civil war. gun runners to many countries. commerce raiders of all sorts including most of the dreaded real world pirates of the carribean, u-boats in the two world wars.logistics chains, in any real world sense, are generally extremely fragile and quite susceptible to individual or small unit attacks. witness the somali pirates we're hearing so much about today. witness the pinprick insurgent attacks with ieds etc. on modern militaries in the middle east and afghanistan. the viet cong. the french resistance.small groups and individual units (ships in eve which are, after all, not a single person) have always been able to make a dent by using insurgent style hit and fade tactics against large and unwieldy empires and nations.right now - insurgent style tactics cannot work in 0.0. that needs to change. and on the day that it does many of eve's 0.0 issues are likely to change for the better. blobbing will no longer be the only way to take territory. suddenly those blobs will need to be spread out to protect the logistics and, voila, less and less blobbage.suddenly, small gang raiding forces will be able to really make an impact instead of being done now for lulz. even in areas constantly raided by the gbc in morsus mihi space the effect of the raids is only on individual players. the poses still get their gas and the overall affect on sovreignty is neglible to non-existent (tending toward the latter). if you cannot get a blob to deal with the pos, all you're doing is glorified griefing as the tactics don't do anything other than annoy people and make their game miserable.i'm sorry, but i feel you're very wrong. the game needs to have more sensible, vulnerable and realistic supply and logistics chains. this will create a great many benefits across the board for everyone. well, everyone except those who like the status quo i guess."
"ok jarvis, i'm going to call you on what you're claiming.ok, have you read previous proposals regarding how to do this? if you haven't, i suggest you do. a lot of people are trying to solve this problem. it's very easy to jump into a discussion without any background reading and say \"things must get better so things get better and none of you have thought about this\" kind of posts. do you have any of your own suggestions as to how to solve this problem? i'm not talking about vague ideas, i mean something tangible that people can actually use to find a solution. if you aren't part of the solution... i request substantiation.how vulnerable and realistic are they now, that they need to be made more vulnerable and realistic? can you elaborate on this? do you maintain any pos's in deep 0.0. to know whether this is truly the case? what benefits are you talking about? there is too little content to work with in your post."
"1. just because it happened in real life doesn't mean it can or should happen in eve.2. your historical examples are all wrong. logitics chains have always been the number one priority of any successful marching army. u-boats were a massive coordinated effort and it still failed. the french resistance provided no real pain to the germans and only served as a network for downed pilots, it might have provided intelligence, but it sure as hell didn't liberate anyone. ieds are not a military deterrent in iraq. somali pirates only exist because the u.n. hasn't decided how it wants to fix the problem. you have listed only one successful instance, and that is the viet cong. then again, if you actually look at what the viet cong did and why it succeeded, you would notice that it had nothing to do with \"guerrilla attacks\" and everything to do with the fact that the entire damn country wanted the u.s. out, or and the conventional army didn't hurt either.3. insurgent =/= guerrilla. insurgencies are where the fighters integrate in with the population. insurgencies are possible in eve, you just have to join the corp you want to kick out, and then actively work against their goals. no, see here is the thing. it already does. but just like guerrilla attacks you1. don't see it immediately2. don't have wide spread effects3. have to work very hard at it to make a difference.look, if you want some modern day examples, lets give you some. farc has been fighting in colombia for 48 years. the insurgency in iraq has been going on for 6. it took the viet cong 25 years before the fall of saigonthere are groups that effectively deny space to the people who live there right now, live on tq. but it is hard to do, doesn't always work, and takes time to see results.its not about \"status quo\", its about understanding how the game works, how people interact, and what is likely to happen if you make changes. its about not implementing bad ideas. edit: now, there are some things that ought to be done, but its not because \"the small guy can't compete\" its because there are real balance problems and objectives that can be achieved my making them."
"i have to say i wholeheartedly agree on that point."
"by all means - but be advised that what i can add is somewhat limited. i can guarantee that there are people much better qualified to enact a design concept like this than me. fortunately some of them work for ccp.i do a fair bit of forum reading but it's easy to miss things on these forums, particularly if they're not recent. i haven't seen any previous proposals of this nature, but that certainly doesn't mean that there haven't been any. it's a bit of an obvious place to go for anyone with a military and or military history background. really solid detailed ones? no. i'm not a jump capable pilot so my experience with jump ops is limited. the problem definitely lies with being able to use various cynosural capable ships to re-supply poses, however. whether the solution is to change how jump ships work to make them more vulnerable to attack, make certain types of pos fuel something that cannot be jumped (perhaps too unstable or some such) or some other solution i don't know. i don't have the experience to give you detailed solutions. what's more there are lots of variables that touch into sovreignity issues etc. the people best qualified to look at these issues are those with access to the databases at ccp.i'm not trying to dodge you - but trying to claim that because someone hasn't a detailed plan to fix something means they can't see a problem accurately (which you implied) isn't wise. you don't need a mechanic to tell you that a car won't go because the wheel is lying next to it on the side of the road, but you probably will need one to rebuild the suspension so you can put the wheel back on.yes, i've helped maintain some of our poses although i've had to fly fuel to them the hard way in a hauler.as to how vulnerable? they have impervious shields and even when coming out of reinforce large ones can take huge fleets a rather long time to kill. their guns can kill even large battleships before they can get away without the owners evening knowing it (this has happened when one of our poses blew apart one of our allies and we've lost hacs and bses to friendly pos fire - it's fast). they are virtually invulnerable except to a sizeable force. this is true even for a small pos.as to fueling them - jump in a ship to just outside the shields, fly inside and fuel it. leave the shields and jump away. unless the pos is under continuous siege this is simplicity itself. many/most cyno ships are cloakers (certainly mine are) and they won't light a cyno with reds in local unless there are only a couple. generally you can afford to wait.currently poses give sov, impervious places to hide ships and work and other benefits like moon miners, jump bridges etc. they are fairly simple to keep supplied unless actively sieged by a large blob. in short, they're too good. the need to have some weakness and right now the blob is the only one they really have.more difficult logistics and/or a requirement to protect them in order to preserve their benefits isn't rocket science. nor is it hard to wrap one's head around the idea that if you have multiple requirements to keep them running then the ships doing/protecting those operations aren't available to blob up."
"spoken like someone who entirely doesn't understand the primary rule of any speculative fiction. that suspension of disbelief has to be maintained.put succinctly, rubbish.i agree. and in eve, at present, they are virtually impervious to attack unlike any other example you could give.to win the war? indeed. however hundreds of thousands of tons of material was sent to the bottom and a huge coordinated effort had to be put together to stop them including many new technologies. without any question they kept d-day from happening years earlier. well, aside from those pilots, naturally. oh, and the intelligence you so denigrate saved many thousands of lives on d-day and may have made the difference between success and failure. you need to study your history better.they are the weapon responsible for the most deaths in the entire conflict and have had a great deal of political impact on the american people. they were certainly far more effective than saddam's army.you seem to be fixated on trying to focus on examples of winning conflicts and ignoring things that you would prefer not to pay attention to or don't understand.the french resistance knew full well it wasn't operating in a vacuum and conducted itself that way. it was an extremely valuable element to the allies and was on the winning side. in that way, it could certainly be said to have been liberating.blockade runners kept the south supplied for years and required massive spending of men and material to stop. they postponed the confederacy's defeat for years.i suppose i could also mention the afghans against the russians too and unlike the viet cong they didn't take 25 years. of course neither did the viet cong, as the war was from 1959 to 1975. try 16 years. contd."
"more along the lines that if you haven't experienced what you're trying to change, you might not appreciate that things are not done the way you've described. in reality (correct me if i'm wrong), cyno-capable ships are not used to fuel a majority of pos's directly*. the only cyno-capable ships that can hold a substantial amount of pos fuel are the jump freighter and rorqual. the high price tag merits this. lighting a cyno in 0.0. can be a nerve-wracking experience if you aren't assured that you have substantial protection at the other end.working as intended, imo. a battleship/hac should be seriously at risk if it decides to warp to a defended pos. as for small pos, i've had my corp use 8 battleships to easily take down a moderately defended small pos. had it been more heavily defended my carrier would have been fine for tanking, or a single dreadnought. again, experience matters before trying to suggest changes to the game mechanics. try setting up a large pos in 0.0. and before you say you genuinely think the defences are too strong. consider this: making all examples relative to your own ingame capabilities can be misleading for others. i think you neglected to mention:- buy the fuel in empire, or mine the fuel (risky if you are at war or low sec/0.0.)- get the fuel to your pos (risky)you said \"unless your pos is under continuous siege this is simplicity itself\". i don't suppose we all can stay logged in for 23hrs a day to wait out a camp? please try spare a thought for the majority of players who may not devote such exuberant amounts of time to the game.you can afford to wait if you spend longer logged in than your opponent. again, please spare a thought for people who can't spend all day logged in.they are not impervious. they are quite easy to take down, in fact dozens are taken down every day. unless you have the ability to field a capital fleet, you cannot do much to stop the many groups out there that do, and will (with impunity) knock over a lovely pos. while you say you didn't have any 'detailed' ideas, you don't have any non-detailed ideas either on a 'problem' in a field that you claim to have little experience in."
"the south vietnamese most certainly wanted nothing of the kind and it had everything to do with utilizing casualties and a hard to hit enemy to bleed out the will to fight of the nation - in the case of vietnam, quiet successfully.oh and as to the 'un doing something' about somali pirates, that's just funny. you mean like the 'did something' about rwanda? or darfur? or the congo?if anything gets done about the pirates it won't be the un that does it. it might try and take the credit later, but it'll be done by others.no, that's espionage and something entirely different. insurgents in iraq don't join the us military to accomplish their ends. you need better analogies.of course - because giving the defender the advantage they never have in real life, that of being able to pick the time and place of the battle, makes all kinds of sense.however we aren't talking about station ping pong. that's been tried and shown not to work. obviously you can defend your logistics - because you choose when your fleets will fly to supply your stations. but as it's an ongoing thing you're unlikely to be able to protect each one with a blob. therefore you have to spread out more thinly, therefore small(er) gangs can land attacks which cause a pos to be unsupplied, leaving it vulnerable. or perhaps several which means the blob needs to split to defend them until re-supply can take place.honestly - try thinking about new ideas rather than assuming i'm talking about the old ones that didn't work. no, see here is the thing. it already does. but just like guerrilla attacks you1. don't see it immediately2. don't have wide spread effects3. have to work very hard at it to make a difference.look, if you want some modern day examples, lets give you some. farc has been fighting in colombia for 48 years. the insurgency in iraq has been going on for 6. it took the viet cong 25 years before the fall of saigonyes, because i really want to play a game for decades in order to see any results. sorry, that doesn't sound like something i want to pay for and spend my leisure time and funds doing.in the real world, weaker attackers have very few advantages - but they do have some. in eve, as currently written, they have none.you may not like that, and that's fine. you may think it's a bad idea, but i don't see any from you at all which inclines me to believe you think it's fine as it is.the realities are simple, even for big alliances resources (people mostly) are finite. forcing them to spread thinner cannot but help to reduce blobbage."
"i obviously cannot speak to what bob and the goons do. ours are actually fueled by carriers and those are more than sufficient when run down about twice a month and they carry enough for several poses (a couple of which are small ones). a rorqual or jump freighter would be much better for the job as they would need to make fewer trips. we do not currently have either so we use carriers.every pos i've been involved with in my (admittedly limited) experience has been fueled directly by jump capable ships. this may not be done in more secure areas, but then it wouldn't need to be now would it?as to lighting a cyno in 0.0 - no it's not nerve wracking at all. if there are reds about, you don't do it. if there aren't, you do. if they still catch you unawares they still have to deal with the pos guns (and the carrier you've just cynoed in). i've done it many times and i'm doing it with my main, not even the entirely disposable cyno alt that most of my corp mates use.trying to discredit an argument by ignoring the point and using spurious logic is transparently an attempt to mislead others.also the devs have said clearly that the entire pos/sovreignity structure is not working as intended. indeed, the basis of some of my arguments has been taken from some of the things that have been said in the devblogs. straw argument of the worst kind. 1) buying fuel in empire is a no risk activity, obviously. anyone can do it quickly and easily. all you need is isk. if isk is in short supply for your alliance then you have bigger problems than supplying your pos.2) getting the fuel to the pos is risky? how? the entire argument that is being made is that it's virtually risk- free as it currently sits. now i'll demand an explanation of you. how is it risky? how can you possibly stop a pos being refueled that does not involve a blob besieging the station?cont."
"wow, that was pathetic in the extreme, trying to make a personal 'you obviously have no life' attack on someone with a family, a full time job, a long commute, two time consuming main hobbies that don't involve computers and who runs three conventions a year in three different cities all across the continent. sad.the point was that the camp can't be up 24 hours a day, nor can it be particularly close unless being fired on by the pos. besides i said the only way to stop a pos being refueled was to besiege (camp) it. if you aren't doing that, you just wait for the occasional red to go away and you're good to go. not to mention that if you are at all intelligent you don't wait until the last day to refuel the thing which gives you a wide window of opportunity in which to do your fueling op. it's hardly rocket science. i don't have to sit at a computer to wait out a camp. if there is one, i'll just log on tomorrow or the next day and do it then. hence the lack of risk.thank you for making my point for me. they are quite easy to take down - if you have resources that only a capital fleet can stop. some people see that fact as a problem. clearly you don't, but others do.thanks for your very illuminating post. i think you've made your position on what you would like to see out in 0.0 very very clear."
"i didn't say that you don't have a life, nor did i intend what i said to mean that. sorry if it looked like that. the point i made was that if the only recourse to a siege is to wait the enemy out (i.e. until they go), the ones who this favours (quite disproportionately) are those who can stay logged in for ridiculous amounts of time. this is not conducive to a edit: easy task (changed from fair game, that's not what i meant!).you know well that i didn't say it wasn't a problem at any point in my post. i was stating facts - this is the current status quo. we can ignore that at present pos are quite easy to take down by many people in the game, and then start saying they should be even easier...it is important to appreciate that making this even easier is a bad idea. imagine if it cost 1b to put up an outpost, for instance."
"re 1): you misread what i wrote. i said that mining the fuel yourself was risky if you are at war, in low sec or 0.0. i did not say that actually buying the fuel in empire was risky. freightering/hauling fuel around from high sec to jump points is a possible interception point as well, unless you have a jump freighter.re 2): your argument is that it is risk free, mine is that there is risk that you are neglecting to mention. it is risky if you have to transport bespoken fuel a long way, particularly if this involves passing through potentially hostile space. a cyno can easily be identified on the map by a nearby roving gang. there is risk, however small you decide to make it look."
"recognise this: the pos-sovereignty structure concept has little to nothing to do with how actual pos defences work. the devs has said clearly that the coupling of pos to sovereignty is a problem to focus on, i have not read anything to the tune of pos defences not working as intended."
"that's the point i was making. jump-capable ships do not fuel the majority of pos's directly.that's assuming it only takes one jump to get to your pos. what if you had to make 2 or 3 0.0. jumps? over the amount of time such a trip can take, the security situation can drastically change, or a hostile could easily just cyno/jump-bridge their own stuff to you if they see a cyno set up. your cyno will not disappear after you jump in, so they'll know where to find you and decloak you."
"spoken like someone who doesn't understand that first and foremost, we are playing a game, we are not playing a book.no, its not. you're asking for guerilla warfare to be a forceful solution to a problem. it never has been. it has always been a political solution to a problem. u-boats did not delay d-day by \"years\", it barely had any effect. \"tonnage sunk\" not withstanding, you have to look at percentages. the french did not achieve any military victories that bled the germans dry. ieds are, entirely, a political consideration. the fact that they are the number one killer doesn't matter. the question is, is it having a military impact. the south vietnamese absolutely wanted unification. it's government didn't, its people did. intervention against somali pirates requires a u.n. resolution before any member nations can take aggressive action without being provoked. there is no resolution[and the problem is tiny anyway]no, that is insurgency. they join, or simply are(in the case of iraq and south vietnam), \"the civilian population\". the occupying force who lives and produces in the area is \"the civilian population\" of the area. yes, it does, because if you don't all the \"fights\" happen when the defender is off line and aren't actually fights, but one side destroying all of the other sides infrastructure without recourse.you don't have to play for years to see results. but you might have to play for months. hell, we have entire full commitment wars that last longer than that. you expect, that you should be able to do what hundreds of people can't in the same amount of time?guerrilla warfare, being inherently an attack against the opponents will, is locked in the time it takes to succeed by the will of those people you are attacking.look, we are not playing a book, we are playing a game. games behave differently than how you want them to play out, your narrative is not the only one, there are other, competing narratives. i know it would be cool to be luke skywalker, but everyone can't be luke, even if everyone wants to be. the end result, if you make everyone luke, is that no one has fun. in eve, we are all zbigniew, and then we really can have fun."
"i wasn't discussing recourses to a siege, that's a different topic entirely. obviously those should include sending a fleet to break one up etc. we were talking about refueling poses that are not under siege and the level of risk entailed in doing so. you maintain that it is risky. i've repeatedly asked, \"how so?\"i was stating (pretty clearly i thought) that i am in agreement with cat that the status quo is not good and that poses are unbalanced as they currently are. fortunately the devs have already said, repeatedly, that they feel that this is true as well.i was merely suggesting one way in which they could alter things to give them a bit of an achilles heel - that being make the logistics more vulnerable."
"no, i understood what you wrote entirely. with metagaming (which a great many major alliances make extensive use of) this is simply not true. if npc corp alts are mining in empire they are not vulnerable to wardecs and are protected by concord. suicide ganks are the only option to deal with them, and those are limited, particularly now.the same is true for hauling in empire.oh come now - anyone who touches off a cyno with a roving gang of reds in system deserves what they get. simply sit in the pos or cloaked at a safespot and wait until they leave.nothing in eve is entirely risk free, no, but we assume even the most basic competency the risk currently is vanishingly low."
"the entire thing is connected, and keep in mind that i am keeping to cat's original point that alliances need to have more vulnerable supply points in order to create some actual weaknesses for others to exploit and for they themselves to defend.as such, all cards are on the table including the entire pos system, sovreignity, the works. leaving pos defense along and decoupling sov from them actually makes the problems worse unless the new sov relies upon some kind of logistics tail. while creating something like what is used in fw might reduce blobs some, alone it probably won't for the simple reason that fw has a lot of blobbage going on.it's all connected, and talking about one aspect of it involves examining them all if you want to ensure success in the aim of change."
"perhaps not where they are not needed, but if that is your point how is that relevant? those ships are being used because it's convenient in very safe areas. threaten them and they dock up and jump ships take up the role until the threat ends. a minor inconvenience at most. in no way does this present any significant threat to the logistics tail.even were you not to use the common practice of setting up a transfer pos at each jump system - and why wouldn't you? the only thing you might bag would be a little cyno frigate worth next to nothing and its equally valueless alt. so what? entirely expendable.the jump ship will have warped off to a safe spot and cloaked up seconds after the cyno is lit and long before any response could be made to its presence.honestly, i'm only making the reasonable assumption that long time players who can fly carriers et al know the basics of how to operate a ship in 0.0. if it's a jump freighter it can't cloak, obviously, so it wouldn't be used in a region where the danger level is as high as you describe. a carrier or rorqual does the job just fine in those cases.and of course we haven't even started discussing the use of covert ops cynos either..."
"thank you for reinforcing my point. take a look over there to the right. all those links to eve fiction, backstory etc. etc. the requirements for suspension of disbelief in any piece of speculative fiction in any media, whether game, book, play, movie or television show are all exactly the same.in the real world i have several published game modules and articles. i was a professional game writer for over a year. the rules are exactly the same. break them and you get moronic things like synnibar. <sigh> well i'm not bothering to argue this any further at it's clearly pointless. you may think what you wish but i have dozens of books by competent historians in my library which disagree with you. war is merely an extension of politics and intimately tied to economics. many enemies are 'spent' out of wars whether financially or through morale issues etc. you may choose not to believe that, i don't honestly much care, but when you start claiming that activities which respectable historians describe as critical or significant are meaningless then discussion has become pointless. your mind is made up, no point in confusing you with facts."
"\"gentlemen, you can't fight in here! this is the war room!\"eve isn't perfect... and never will be. there are as many viewpoints on balance as their are pilots. eve is also not rl; it's a simplified simulation of real world mechanics. methods which have historically worked cannot always achieve the same success in this simpler setting.i have slightly revised my standing on this issue. i still believe it would be more interesting if declaring ownership of space were made harder (i.e., removal of ice from empire), but am forced to agree with goumindong that any changes which open the door for small gangs to affect sovereignty will break the ability of large groups to have lasting effect. it was never my intention to devaluate strength in numbers... merely to provide an opening for the small guy.we're left either with megalithic powers that become locked in conflicts which cannot be won (gs/coalition vs. bob, bob vs. nc, etc.) or a system where no 0.0 entity can claim sovereignty for very long before being torn down by the multitudes. when you factor in that this is only a game and not something anyone should spend massive amounts of time on... or be forced to be online when their enemies attack... any changes to the system become somewhat unbearable.this game is too simple for a compromise between the two... the mechanics are just too crude for the balance we attempt to create. we'll see if ccp is able to manage some miracle solution in their sovereignty changes that we somehow missed. (if they manage to pull it off, i'll be impressed; i've got the feeling they've painted themselves into a corner in this area.) it's just a game, and while i did start this discussion, please understand that i will be content to stay in low-sec, and slug away at the targets there.cheers."
"ahh, yes the good old \"i wrote some stuff for some pen and paper rpg's therefore i know what i am talking about and you do not\" argument.mmo's are not pen and paper rpgs, the player interaction is significantly different. especially in pvp mmos like eve. hell its significantly different in pretty much any game with non-cooperative actions. pen and paper rpgs are about telling a story. when i want to tell a story, i go play dnd or wod. when i want to push someones **** in, i play eve.e.g. games that don't need \"suspension of disbelief\"chess, checkers, chinese chess, chinese checkers, go, any board game ever, real time strategy games, turn based strategy games, first person shooters, third person shooters, shumps, oh hell, any shooting game ever, if anyone made a second person shooter you wouldn't have to suspend disbelief for it, racing games...you're wrong, q.e.d.yes, now you're getting somewhere. unfortunately, you're forgetting that there is a distinct difference between political will and military will. you're asking for for military determination of an issue that has always been a political movement. do you think that the u.s.a would have any problems subduing iraq in the absence of political pressure to not simply wipe the place clean? do you think that the u.s.a. would have any problems taking and holding key resources if it didn't have to deal with people asking why it was slaughtering civilians? seriously?well in eve, we have the political will. we slaughter civilians, we simply don't give a ****. now, you can make a difference, you can do it already. you can sap the economic ability of a populace of people. its just difficult, its always difficult. there are aspects of the game that need changing, because they promote stagnation. but its not because we have to make room for the little guy militarily. making room for the little guy militarily means that the big guy will drive a mac truck through the opening. [that or conflict will die down from mutual \"don't shoot me i don't shoot you\" understandings, but that is unlikely since first strikes would negate your ability to fight back, neither situation is good though.]"

"i've filed hundreds of petitions about macro miners and none of themnot oneever got banned. when they switched from bs to barges they would get recycled, but none i ever petitioned disappeared. those that are still around are still mining, or autopiloting freighters, in npc corps as untouchable as they were 3 years ago.i just... gave up.ccp won't give us any tools, won't name & shame them, or make npc corps less lucrative for them. i had to give up trying."
"make it easier to highsec gank again ^^ seemed to see a lot less of them then, then people got what they and and also got more macro miners... honestly i dont care because i don't mine"
"heh, the bold-underline parts sound like me. i have been mining quite a bit of ice lately, and i don't talk in local, unless spoken to first. but, you can always convo me, and i will reply, and no cspa charges either! but, yeah, i agree, down with macro-miners! ab"
"mm miners should really die"
"yep ccp is allways \"looking into it\" but same macro characters are still mining even if you send few petition with screens and same macro lists. everyone knows where are biggest group of macros (its not so hard to find, just most of ice belts near trade hubs), everyone except ccp."
"i agree but i think the problem ccp has with macros that you can not be 100% sure if it's a mm or not. i'm a programmer and would say that i understand how macros generally work. an easy way to stop the mm would be to add a random variable to the gui itself. for example: you have 2 options to undock from a station: 1. the button in the lower left corner of the screen and 2. in the right click menu of the ship.now you could remove the one in the corner and randomize the position of the undock entry in the right click menu. this way the macro has a hard time to work correct.or randomize the pop up location of right click menu, sometimes it could pop up on the left side of the mouse sometimes on the other. the more you add of that small hardly noticeable random changes the harder it will be for the macro."
"nay, it's too practical this is generally not the philosophy of the great turning machine that is ccp.i remember when eve use to lag horrendously off of millions of book marking back-logs, imagine the devestation of millions of symultaneously queuing skills! this is blasphemy! i will not stand idley by whilst your band of hoodlems try and furthur degrade our lovely community into an unrecognizeable mess of lag and free democracy!"

"you got an hour of time to read the forums... an hour of dt every night.do it yourself.it will keep you busy : o p"
"that around 15:00-17:00 iceland and england too. so if there is a problem and the dt is extended the ccp staff will work overtime to resolve it instead of doing it in regular working hours.so the cost is higher. ccp should introduce a special overcharged subscription fee for anzac to cover for such a change?you are the one starting the same argument for the thousand time. but you don't even want to do a bit of work to see what where the arguments pro and against the other times it was shot down?lazy."
"this has been raised intermittently for as long as i've been playing, and was also discussed in my campaign thread six months ago. my position hasn't really changed, either. it didn't bother me personally then and it doesn't bother me personally now.go watch the fanfest 2008 presentation where they break down the player percentages from each country, and you'll see how many people you're proposing to negatively affect for the benefit of how many less.not supported.edit: i'm a kiwi, btw./ben"
"heh, your proposed downtime is during the period that i've seen 35k+ players on, so i doubt ccp would shut their servers down then. oh yeah, and right in the middle of my playing time.the only time that dt affects me is on weekends if i'm playing eve, or i am not at work. but, this is not the case every single time, as i don't play eve 23/7. i say keep dt as it is. i don't know why ccp chose that time, i would guess it's when the server load is low, and their staff are available.ab"
"how did you forget about europe ?"
"it is 11:00-12:00 in iceland and england. ccp main offices are in reykjavik (iceland) and the server is in london (england). so starting dt at 11:00 allow them to get at work at 8:00, do the preliminary work, start the dt at 11:00 and still go to eat at 13:00-13:30 even if there are troubles restarting the server, unless there are big problems. if there are big problems they still have time till 17:00 to fix them without doing overtime and working 8 hours in a day, so being still fully alert even at the end of the work time. so essentially the time was chosen to get the best performance from ccp staff and the lower cost for the corp. at the same time it is a part of the day where they will disturb the lowest number of costumers possible."
"dt on sisi many times was around 01:00am gmt when ccp staff 'should' sleep, so its doable to do dt on tq in other part of the day or night."
"i live in argentina, downtime for me is from 9am to 10 am if is not extended (before was from 8 am to 9 am, but the country change the time again -.-)and i have to wake up 7 am to change a skill in order to not loose 30 min of trianing lol, leave it as it is, is damm good, go watch tv an hour or do something else."
"if you look at the server usage graphs at coldfront, you'll find that tq downtime is always at the best time already - when nobody is playing. any other time of the day and at least someone is playing."
"dt is bad enough already, don't suggest an even worse time.the problem is dt itself, it should only really be necessary 1-2x/week."
"excellent idea, well worth my support, : )"
"for ships that sit in space or in a pos as a extra measure of security, right now it's like having a car the everyone has the keys for. or the ability to anchor them in space with a password, you could still target and destroy them, just not get in them."
"maybe if you allowed a skill to hack them, but even then, maybe. besides, if you don't trust those around you, or in your own corp or alliance, to be able to park them around your pos, maybe you have bigger issues."
"while this isnt really a concern for the player base, most people prob dont care, it is a issue that ccp will need to get thier lawers to check for every geopolitical zone they serve.if local anti gambling laws do not place a distinction between real assets and virtual assets in relation to gambling then ccp will be walking into a land mine of lawsuits, and class actions.just because some laws are ridiculous doesn't mean that there are not lawyers out there waiting to make a quick buck from exploiting them.i wonder what the ausie player base would do if eve became r18+, thier government would have no option but to block all access to it due to thier current policy of no r18 games."
"in the us, the law effectively works out to be you can't legaly sign up for most online communities without a parrent/guardian unless you're 13 or older. (if you're under 18, you probably still need a parent to be able to pay for it.)eve carries a \"t\" (teen) rating from the esrb. the step above it is \"m\" (mature) which is 17 and older. however, rating enforcement is the responsability of the store selling you the game. i'm also not sure how, or if, the rating enforcement is conducted for online/downloadable sales; i've never seen any data about it. self-published, downloadable games often ignore the esrb alltogether and do not submit their games for ratings (as it costs money to do).as for the op: before atari publishes eve for the retail boxes in march, they may have to submit the game to the esrb again for rating no mater what. however as has been pointed out, there are a lot of t rated games that have gambling minigams and the like. federal gambling regulations only apply if real money changes hands. (in second life, the $l to usd conversion is officialy sanctioned by the developer, linden lab; in eve that is not the case, which is why you're not likely to see the feds knocking at ccp atlanta's offices.)"
"so in a game setting that lets you kill thousands for ingame money, where you buy cruise missiles for ingame money, sell slaves for ingame money, sell drugs for ingame money you are concerned that gambling for ingame money may get you or ccp in trouble?snap out of it"

"freeing slaves addicted to vitoc gets you just that, nothing .. what did you think, that its all about unkeying the chain and send them on their way home while they praise your name?"

"i'd like that. especially with that vitoc part. you would not only have to \"liberate\" the slaves, but also, pay for healing their addiction (or smth.). in return you would get bonuses to minnie standings and an occasional reward. or it could be used for the forementioned planetary interaction mechnic.i'd surely like that. /signed"
"you think this is a universe built around being a good guy and an upstanding citizen? you get the satisfaction of a job well done. if you roleplay enough to care about whether bits in a database are actually enslaved or intoxicating, then surely you care about their freedom enough to do it out of the goodness of your heart."
"you could make it more like invention by having it use data cores, minerals, etc, as well as the original object."
"i'd like to discuss this further, there is a lot of potential here."
"it does not exist because it would unbalance the market in certain areas eg. if you could take apart a control tower and get a pos bpc , they contain almost no mins at all , and selling for 300 mil would fly off the shelfs at a profit of 100,000,000%there are various non seeded bpo's that if reversable would cause all kinds of issues (use it on a faction battleship ... ect)"
"common sense dictates that it wouldn't be made possible to reverse engineer things that do not have blueprints.."
"i like the idea of using datacores to re items. i also think that the base item you use should be used up, i know in my original post i suggested that the percentage of getting your item back should go up as your re lvl increases, but maybe the item should be used up completely.i also think that faction items shouldn't be allowed to be re'd except maybe for ammo, which could help out those of us who live out in 0.0 and don't make often trips to hisec....just a thought.since the market thing was brought up....i would like to suggest that the supporting science skill would be the same as invention but the skills need to be at lvl 4 for the required skills like laser science and nuclear science for instance. what do you guys think?"
"pos gunnery is continuing to be a logistical nightmare and detracting from gameplay. seeing as most people have gunnery skills on their main character and the pos network is probably being run by an alliance logistic corp it means that everyone needs to be in one corporation in order to effectively defend space using pos gunners. the solution to this problem will be the massive megacorp, which is really a step backwards. there should be an option to allow alliance members to use pos guns."
"i really would like to see this. i don't have any pos but when we had one we encountered this problem which would have been very usefull. they don't have to control like 5 guns but 2 guns would be good enough."
"indeed, members of the same alliance, if they have access to the pos, should be able to use the defense arrays if they have the skills to do so.doing this on an allance-wide scale, however, would be a double edged sword. for example, that annoying spy who sits at a pos and sets the guns to target the most indestructable or unstrikable of the enemy ships, thus wasting their function.imo more than just 5 arrays should be controllable, and that control should be removable at any time. how would this function to keep multiple defenders from vying for control of the same arrays?defense arrays should be grouped by default when controlled by someone with the appropriate skills. thus all of one weapon type, all of one defensive array type (web/neut/scram), would be a single group unless specifically unlinked by the operator.current defense mechanics, and pos logistics all around, are just nightmarish in complexity and need serious review (as stated repeatedly during the previous csm cycle)."
"well, thats a problem on a corp level as well. never actually happened to us though, we've usually satisfied the problem of too many gunners by having whoever is leading the defence on ts yell loudly \"everyone not on the list i'm about to read out can just log the **** off.\"to be honest this idea is excellent. i can understand the original ccp concept of it being a tactical issue that corps have a number of gunners in the right locations with pre-prepared bookmarks but with pos warfare being as it actually is having the ability to allow pos gunnery for all members of the alliance (the same way as it is for entering the shield, ie: you either set them to all allow, or make it password access)."
"oh yes"

"i would like to see it indeed back into the eve. i know its very expensive. but i prefere to see all those adds that i see on the web about eve removed and the money spend on the game itself. if the game is good the people will talk about it & come eventually anyway.ones again, i know its expensive, but i really would like to see it back in one way or another."

"125% per level = 625% overall+ 625% from seige module (and an extra 37.5% for the minnie one, too lol) and double hardpoints (6 over 3) compared to dreads.so instead of doing around 6000 dps in a gank fit, more like sixty thousand. and it has double mobility advantage being able to move tower-to-tower and/or de-seige to get remote repped within 5 minutes instead of 10. plus they have tank bonuses! you couldnt have picked more mental stats if you had tried.you also didnt bother to state why the ships need to exist, what role they fill (apart from the obvious 'overpowered killer of all large ships') and what balances them."
"i support this idea of using titans in this manner and modifying then to fill this role instead of creating a ter2 mothernought(i really like that word) of the dreadnought class of ships, but when i posted that idea it got shot down so i had to come back with something else and i takled it from another direction.alsoi wouldn't go so far as to say we need these ships. the fact of the matter is that blobs of dreads will get together to do the very same thing that this one ship would accomplished, so instead of building and blobbing caps, why not put the same amount of isk into one ship, less ships, less lag. same niche as current dreads field with a sorta twist. the 125% damage mod is there to make it so that this ship dose not need to siege do dreadnought damage. the ability to fit a siege mod is up in the air but i would rather see one ship on the field doing the damage of 30 dreads with 100 support ships then the latter of 30 dreads with 200 support. ccp can say lag is gone all they want. its bull and we all know lag is still there and what causes it. blobs of caps moar then any other form of ship in this game.current ships, like the dreadnought are alone in there class. some can say that titans are the ter2 dread but that's bull. carriers have mother ships as there ter2 and there nothing but 2 carriers welded together with the ability to field 3 times the fighters, fit the ecm thing, and fit the tri mod just like a standard carrier. it is unfair that the carrier class gets to have a super cap class of its self and not the dreadnought class."
"um, i see some one failed math class. amarr math as fallows.dual giga pulse laser idamage modifier x6rate of fire 11.81 sec 6+625%=43.5+625%=315.375*96damge(max damage ammo)=30276damage*6guns=170735damage per volly or 14469dpsas you can see, 14,469dps is not 60,000dps and is not much more then 3 or 4 dreads put together.yes, this is just as i would like to see it, its not a \"must have\" but would be useful and yet not over powered because of the added cost of stront.yes i could have, don't ever underestimate how insane i can be.now i have above this post."
"still waiting for a reply."
"and it was you .. you have a dread with +25% damage bonus at lvl 5 .. now take this one here.. you double its turrets and instead of 1.25 damage modifier from dreadnought lvl 5 you get 6.25 damage modifier from mothernaught.so you do 1.25 to 12,5 damage, comparing the dread to the mothernaught, and thus have 10 times the damage - whether that sieged dread was doing 5 or 6k, the other one will do its 50k to 60k"
"this part you got right, but you still need to go thru the math and post it if your going to try and convince anyone that you have a sound theory of the mechanics of the siege mod. and were do you people get dreads that do 6000k dps, because i want to buy one. there is no dread currently in game that dose 6000 dps, the most i've been able to pull out of a maxed toon with a pulse revy was 3.3kdpscurrent revy dps math with gun skills taken out of the mix.dual giga pulse laser idamage modifier x6rate of fire 11.81 secdamage modifier x6+625%=x43.5*96*3guns=12528rate of fire 11.81-25%=8.8575 secstock ship with seige mod and lvl5 dread skills dps =1423.63my amarr proposed ships math with gun skills taken out.dual giga pulse laser idamage modifier x6rate of fire 11.81 sec6+625%=43.5+625%=315.375*96damge(max damage ammo)=30276damage*6guns=170735damage per volly or 14469dpsnow i hope this is the last time i have to say this, no dread dose 6000dps out of the box and this flagship(mothernought) would not even come close to doing 60k dps. now i really would like to see or hear some constitutive augments about how else this ship might be able to be implemented because i firmly believe that dreads should get a super capital sized vessel to there ship class.also i do not feel that mother ships in any was have issues other then not being stronger then they are. titans, well i have mixed feelings about what needs to be done to titans but if this idea was implemented to the titan then i would make it my eve goal of getting one.the turrets on a titan never get used to any capacity, and that's just want i feel needs changing the most."
"you seam to forgot, that you are only allowed to launch 1 pos per system per day as a corp nad i think there is a limit of 5 per alliance.so shortening the online times will not change posspamming.btw doing something else, during onlining small modules, like silos, guns and so on, which only take 5-10 minutes, sounds easier then it is.onlining silos again after emptying or fueling, and then waiting 3 minutes, before you can online the next one, is just plain boring, nothing else.you can't do something in the 3 minutes, cause then you have to be back again.so a skill that reduces online-time by 10% per level would be really nice :-)"
"indeed. pos logistics are just... nightmarishly broken as it stands.anchoring towers, imo, should not be reduced in time until they move soverignty mechanics away from them (otherwise just faster tower spam), but the ability to set up tower infrastructure should be made considerably faster.allowing a pilot to anchor as many structures as their anchoring skill allows for simultaneously."
"after the new patch , the curry gods were amazed to understand that curry is not a trade item.considering that curry is really a building block to the life force of everything that exists in eve. they think its only right for it to be a trade item to give people a chance to acquire it.curry as a trade item would be a good pre-requisite to full blown curry houses in station when we get to walk around them.the curry gods would like to propose for curry to be a usable mod/script that for example can be use to upgrade a torpedo. imagine the destruction a prawn phal torp can do. that stuff can eat through anything, plus has the bonus of making the victim taste better.curried love,palu"

"perhaps with ambulation seeing the ships in the same way you do without your ui up (ctrl-tab style) would be kinda nice , but ffs dont give them overviews in the station, why dont you just give them an auto docking macro and a coloring book.... jeez make it easyer to hide in stations why dont you."
"while it would give players who wish to hide in a station an advantage, i have to agree because it just makes sense. even some of the ships have windows.make it a tax to flight control or something that gives access to the overview for a few minutes.either way, if somebody wants to hide, fine. you are still costing them time by keeping them pressed against the glass afraid."

"the easiest way to solve this problem is to stop jet can mining"
"i have an idea.to begin with don't change the current can flipping mechanic.give the orca (well make this possible for any ship) a tractor beam that works how i think a \"real\" tractor beam should. you can bring stuff to you and you should be able to move stuff away from you.the game mechanic could be something simple such as a right click context menu item for locked targets that tell the tractor beam mod to move its currently actively tractored target to \"this\" target location.add to that the ability for the orca to deploy/retrieve/take/give from a \"secure freighter can\" in space like any other size can.those three things would provide a reasonable way to deal with ore thieves and provide incentive for empire miners to band together and make use of the orca.note: if any of my peers deem this post to be off topic or trollish then complain through the proper channel and have it removed, edited, or otherwise dealt with properly."
"i dont understand the three words, you are talking about. i know ice mining, but the angymonne phrase i did not understand, could you please rephrase and clarify?i like this idea, but i bet the canflippers dont, that would be way too risky to flip cans, if you could have a merc corp in fleet with you at a planet or moon in system, and warp in and gank the flipper. that would be so unfair for the griefer. but as a miner i do like it :-)i suppose you are right, however with the current system in eve its the only way to transfer ore among people, so i bet even goonswarms industrialists use jetcans when mining. until ccp finds a valid way for miners to mine efficiently without the jetcan which is not intended for mining purposes, people will use the jetcans.i dont see how this benefits the solo miner.also a can has ownership, so you cannot move another persons can with a tractor beam unless in fleet.dont see what the tractor beam should do, that would stop the griefers from flipping cans.last but not least, the people who get griefed by can flippers are usually new players to eve, and do not have the skills or funds to fly an orca or even use a tractor beam.maybe all this can flipping will solve itself, ive heard rumours about mining will get some love in the next expansion, something about mining will be in deadspaces, that needs to be scanned out, so the average joe can flipper will have a hard time to enter theese dead spaces or dungeons if you prefer."

"now that there are two sets of results up, it is simple to analyse a correlation between position on the ballot page and number of votes received. then if there is, it's worth pursuing. iirc from the 1st election, there wasn't much correlation between the two."
"i'd like to slightly disagree here -- ee can be about both telling a story and blowing the other guy up, depending upon the circumstances and the person playing it. hell, for a number of people, it's about both at the same time.aside from that, i have to say i mostly agree with your points, though. while one person or a small group of people should be able to have some local effect, generally speaking they should not have a huge effect upon a group many times their size, nor is it realistic to expect them to."
"eve may be whatever you make of it. but that is a personal choice. i can tell a story with chess if i really want to. its more difficult. but it can be done.the underlying system has nothing to do with story. this is primarily different with a pen and paper rpg, where the system is necessarily designed around being able to tell that story, hell, there is a person whose entire job it is to tell that story.but it is not so in eve."
"perhaps not for you and i believe that's the fundamental difference in the points of view. i emphasize much more of the rpg part of the mmorpg. you go in more for the strategy game aspect.i'm still going to disagree with you - the reason i play eve is because of the universe, the backstory etc. not because i think it's fun to fly around in a digital spaceship and shoot at just any old thing. my character is particular about his targets, has morals and ethics (separate but similar to my own) and so on. perhaps it wouldn't bother you if ccp did something which utterly smashed suspension of disbelief like putting pink bunny ears on all spaceships permanently, but it would ruin the game for me.an extreme example, to be sure, but there you go.we shall have to agree to disagree."
"just because i'm bored waiting for my scans to finish i'll pipe up in here f2f rpg systems are designed to constrict the player to tell their own story within preveiling ip.eve (and mmo's in general) is quite different by necessity, it is designed as a framework for the players to build upon/adapt/distort so they can tell their own story within the preveiling ip.and it has to be this way because to run an mmo in the same way as you would run a f2f game would require perhaps about one gm per 10 players.so as such yes your both wrong!the underlying system has everything to do with the story.no how the story interacts with us isn't the point of the game.it's all about us leading the way and the game following rather than the us following the game."
"perhaps so! i'm not sure if you're right or not but that's a fascinating perspective."
"looking forward to the results coming out soon(tm).who is next up to bat?"
"i, too, am waiting for the results."
"more support?"
"maybe i am stupid or just fail at searching, can you point me to the minutes you are talking about ? thanks"
"you quoted me out of context. i have no idea which minutes i was refering to."
"oh sorry ... i thought you'll get it ... your replies to jinx barker always mention some meeting minutes that you are waiting to be published. i had a look at all the mms in the csm section but none mention the dead horse topic in their agenda list."
"well, it'd be nice if the new council perhaps put this slightly differently.we know that at some point, pos models will get an upgrade, as ccp slowly work through remodelling everything (starting with ships and stations in trinity patch and moving onto gates in latest).we also know that pos mechanics are bugged and sov mechanics are unsatisfactory to the vast majority of playersthis suggestion or something similar could be woven into a wider, much needed revamp of pos. it's the wider fixes that take the effort, but need to be done anywayedit: t3 ships would basically be exactly the same idea just with ships rather than pos structures"
"that's the best way to delay this even more :-)pos and related game content are soooo unfinished it is a real pain at times. however i guess you are right, nothing but a complete revamp can help here...imagine ccp implements this, all folks have to rearagne their poses (!) ... then they change sov mechanics and people have to tinker with things again.i mean i understand their hesitation to implement this. what i don't have an understanding for is the almost complete silence and ignorance."
"i think it's more that the way it's phrased in the minutes is as if it was tagged on the end of the meeting and dismissed out of hand by ccp"
"can you link me the meeting minutes where it is mentioned ? thanks"
"46. 0102-07-0077 funky pos recommendation"

"new csms, time to get another review of this subject."

"quoted for complete ignorance and incompetence. dearie dearie me, that's painfully wrong."
"it has been a while since qr released and in spite of the backlash from the missile nerf i have yet to see an official response from ccp. actually i haven't seen a single response at all, which leads me to believe ccp thinks their broken game mechanics aren't a problem, or they don't actually read their forums.if you have no intention of fixing this game imbalance will you at least let us know? it will help missile users to make intelligent decisions about what to train for next."
"i agree with this, however do not make it back to what it was like. just make them more useful. they are already nefd in gamgs due to flight time, nso maybe increase that?i have no idea tho, its not my job. my job is to notice problems."
"the way they were before was perfectly fine and reasonable. scale back the nano nerf (was an incredible overkill), and rollback the missile changes and you'll have a good game again."

"not spamming, just putting the topic up, this problem must be solved once for all. like the last reply say, there are diferent ways to do it.there was an idea of the afk notification after the mouse is inactive for 10 min (ice belt macro minning would be solved in some cases when they dont do the mining whit the mack).pls think in something for god sake, we are not asking nothing new! just a problem solved!i saw all the fanfest videos and not even 1 time they mention the macrominers."
"after watching a friend run a macro on a different game i feel this would not work as most macros are capable of moving a mouse. also alot of ppl (me included) run mining ships on a second char minimized behind their mission / pvp / whatever character, and as far as i know this is legalunfortunately there is really nothing you can do that will hit macro miners without hitting alt miners as well.macros and farmers are something to be expected in any mmorpg there is almost no way around it. i produce more minerals reprocessing stuff from my missions than i do from my hulk anyways so ***** at the mission loot and drone loot in particular before you worry about a much smaller problem."

"if the \"no man's land between highsec and lowsec\" were true, then how come there are highsec to nullsec systems? i don't think that rp reason is valid.i support this."
"edited: corrected null tracking penalty.due to a number of compounding factors large and medium blasters have been rendered almost totally ineffective in qr.a short list of *some* of the factors contributing to their ineffectiveness:increased agility of all ships allows for higher base transversal at tighter orbits than ever beforeweb effectiveness reduced by a factor of *four*, increasing relative transverse by over 400%blasters are forced to operate at *extremely* close range, forcing blaster pilots to give up any sort of advantage they have of reducing relative transversal by maintaining slightly longer ranges (10-14km)null ammunition (long range blaster ammo) has a 25% tracking penalty, negating any sort of transversal advantage attained through operating at longer rangesonly one blaster ship (hyperion) has enough mids to fit a second web, and due to it's lack of a tracking bonus still can't hit a double webbed bc that orbits at blaster optimal (~2500m for a max skilled t2 ion fit)battleships are not the only ships affected- all cruisers and battle cruisers are affected as well, as the optimal range of medium blasters is severely truncated compared to that of large blasters, and the increase in tracking of medium blasters doesn't compensate for the loss of optimal and hence the increased relative transverse velocity of a *webbed* target.the issue here isn't about not hitting frigs or afs or inties with your bs sized guns. it's about not being able to effectively hit targets of the same size, or maybe one class smaller, *at all*, once they attain a tight orbit around your ship. no, 'limiting transversal velocity' isn't an answer to this problem. most blaster ships simply don't have the agility to out fly an opposing ship due to speed and agility limitations imposed by armor plates and rigs.further more, blasters do *not* do enough damage relative to all other weapons. the concept is for blaster ships to do massive amounts of damage once they're in range, and hopefully they'll still be alive after burning up almost all their cap and using up almost all their armor to get into range and actually start fighting.right now most other weapon systems can achieve as good or better performance over a much wider range of distances than blasters can, particularly when factoring in comparable tanks for pvp fit ships. improve blasters."
"arf, new csm provokes spurt of people bringing up issues the last one ignored in the hope of change. how foolishly optimistic.nevertheless, agreed."
"i've been beating the dead horse about stupid t2 ammo nerfs for over a year now... and no response.yes, null is useless no matter its size. void isn't much better. t2 missiles are *slightly* more used now (javelin mostly) but still the nerfs obviate any and all bonuses to the point that t1 base is better.i've never used blasters because of the freakish short range, but i understand perfectly how you feel, and i support some drastic fixes to the heavy handed quantum fail changes."
"the way i figured, if a bunch of morons are bringing up useless self serving garbage 'issues', i might as well post something worthwhile in the off chance it might make a difference."
"i see you are still campaigning for this to be corrected. good."
"i just use fed navy antimatter. i'd like to see the t2 ammo fixed a bit, but i really don't have a problem in pvp with my blaster ships. in fact, my more recent kills were with a taranis with light neutrons. today i tried out my deimos against other cruisers and did just fine, winning most duels with my corpmates. only against a couple different hacs did i have any trouble, but that's more by racial design than a failing of blaster tracking.sorry folks. i'm a diehard blasterboat pilot, but i don't seem to have these problems."
"probably has something to do with the fact that you're not using larger ships. in my op i clearly stated that the issue is with larger ships and larger guns, not smaller ones.another point to clarify: i never, under any circumstances, use t2 ammo. ever. it's horrible and it's going to stay that way for a long while until ccp scraps it of fixes it. with faction lead/iridium/whatever you can get nearly the same range as null and similar damage, without the tracking penalty, and nobody in their right mind will use void.the above isn't to be construed as 'hey, just use faction lead/iridium ammo, your problems are solved!' the only ammunition suitable for use in blasters against like sized targets is antimatter, and lots of it."

"tush, could create a new item called fittings container in which you put your setup modules. r-click on the mod, and fit to active ship./+1"
"let's hope the new csm make an issue of this :p"
"on the topic of database stress:this would be no different from selecting a bunch of unpackaged modules, right clicking, and choosing \"fit to active ship\" which has the effect of fitting your ship all at once, and is usually low on lag.the disadvantage of what you can already do is that modules must already be unpackaged (ie seperate stacks), so you still have to browse your hangar to find the ones you want."
"i said that i would be posting this here after the election is over and as such, am doing so. the original features and ideas post can be found here.introductionone of the largest failures in eve is that there is no system by which constant effort is required to stay ahead of the game in production. once you have researched your blueprints and set up an invention cycle you can pretty much just sit back and produce. research is a one time thing with no progression.i think that its time we change this. so that producers need to continually research to stay ahead of the game. so that those that get to the top first get a significant advantage over others and then can fight to stay at that top spot.i feel that i have designed a way to do that which will not produce significant extra database load as can be expected in other solutions.typical problemsfirst i want to talk about typical problems that occur with an expanding research system, that is, a system that does not have an \"end\" point. these two problems are expanding database load and an increase difference between new and old players. the main problem that has to be solved when you have a research system is that the number of items produced will expand continually as people make modifications. the database needs to have an entry for each unique item and item type. as this progresses the amount of entries in the database expands, at the very least, linearly with research. this is unacceptable for a game whose primary asset is its database. the expansion of items that then become obsoleted would produce an increasing load for no discernible advantage.the secondary problem is that new players must progress up the same research tree. this leaves them always behind the older players in both research and often times combat. this is unacceptable in a game that has been designed to protect against hegemonies of the rich and old. at some point, there needs to be a limit to the advantage that old players gain over new ones. a lot of old players feel like they are entitled to this advantage, but said entitlement ruins games in the long run as no new players join the fray. you need to guard against an increasing gulf between the players while still having a continued fight for production advantage.we solve these with assimilation. assimilation assimilation, for us, is basically that as technology advances, the newer advances eventually get incorporated into the current systems. this is the system by which we can solve the problems talked about above. rather than continually progressing the old modules, we simulate this by regressing the newly researched modules. as the quota of highest level of researched blueprint is finished being researched, all highly researched items and blueprints regress one meta level. this occurs until they are tech 2 items and blueprints. at which point, full assimilation has occurred.the fight to research the highest level item will eventually bump everything down a tier. this means that if you get a high quality blueprint you will not be able to rest on your laurels. if you do, someone else will research the blueprints up and then bump yours down a notch. as well, with items, if they are also on the meta level dropping, then there is a \"use it or lose it\" value to these items. if you do not use the items then they will regress towards basic tech 2 modules as people do research in the area. this is, obviously not good, and provides more incentive to get your but out and use that advantage while you still have it."
"establishing a baselinewhen doing the above, we will have to establish a baseline where the assimilation ends and everything is normalized. this is your baseline, where everyone is, more or less equal. at the moment, the baseline is tech 1. but this produces, typically too large a differentiation between a tech 1 fit and tech 2 fit, its currently 20%. if we start modules at tech 2 and keep going above that into tech 3,4, and 5, we will have a 35% difference between a full tech 1 and tech 2 fit. clearly this is unacceptable. if we do not advance above tech 2, then we will be replacing the entire mechanism by which people produce items. as well, we would need to change every single item currently in the database. why would we need to do this? because if we are changing the meta value of items as people continue to research then we will have instances where someone logs on after a downtime in space where his modules do not fit as the decrease in meta level has increased the modules fitting. because of this, if items themselves are going to be reduced in meta level, then we would have to re-do the fittings of all items, something that is not ideal, and doesn't advance the game at all.i think tech 2 is a good level at which we can stabilize, with named items used mainly for refining, specialized fits that need more space, and when people need to fit very cheaply. to facilitate this we will have to remove all requirements to use tech 2 items. there would be no point at which players would be unable to reach the baseline. as well, this would mean that all generally used items would be player produced which would move us closer to a full player economy, one of the design goals of the game.moving on upo.k. so now we have our baseline, tech 2 items. then we have to have a method make the new items as well as a design regarding how good these new items are going to be. the design regarding the method is the first thing to discuss as there are many ways to do the design, but the method is the easiest.explorers find sites which produce item x.item x + tech 2 blueprint copy + time + research agent = tech 3 blueprint originalitem x + tech 3 blueprint copy + time + research agent = tech 4 blueprint originalitem x + tech 4 blueprint copy + time + research agent = tech 5 blueprint original once some number of tech 5 bpo's of the designated type[determined by what the price levels people want to do, probably around 50-200 bpo's of any type] have been created, then assimilation occurs. the tech 5 bpos become tech 4, the tech 4 bpo's become tech 3 and the tech 3 become new tech 2 bpos. this would kick out all jobs in production including research jobs when it occurred and would take place at downtime. this is to ensure that the turn-over time on the items is long enough to be valuable. tech 3 items would require level 1 in the relevant skill to use, tech 4 would require level 3 and tech 5 would require level 5."
"branches or pipesideally you would want a branching research structure, but this might introduce too many database entries. each branching research structure would increase one secondary aspect of the attribute and increase the meta level as it made the bp. the second option is a linear upgrade path, with only one way to upgrade an item per path and each subsequent item is a strictly better version of the one before it.ideally, to me, a linear path is going to look something like thistech 3 = tech 2 item stats + special secondary attribute overloading bonus or secondary bonustech 4 = tech 3 item stats + overloading heat reduction or secondary bonustech 5 = tech 4 item stats + secondary module bonus[i.e. a bonus to using some other module]but just what types of stats the items get is pretty mutable. ideally, they would not have many primary stat bonuses. 5% better heat sinks and 5% more dps on guns really starts to add up, and ideally you want these to be small bonuses not necessary bonuses. e.g. tech 3 webs could add an inertia bonus when overloading, and then the tech 5 bonus could give scramblers/disruptors an extra point[from 1 point to 2 or 2 points to 3]. lasers could increase the targets signature radius, and autocannons might reduce agility. i.e. add lots of cool stuff that happens when you overload.branching, while it would be very cool means a huge amount of database expansion, which is likely to not be good. tl;drwhat is it?1. research produces new and better modules and/or ships. tech 3, tech 4, and tech 52. research requires new items found in exploration in continuous amounts3. research produces a tech 3 then tech 4 then tech 5 bp in that order. blueprints are originals.4. only a limited number of blueprints can be created.5. when the last blueprint is created of a given type for tech 5. all of the tech 5 blueprints become tech 4 blueprints, all of the tech 4 blueprints become tech 3 blueprints, all of the tech 3 blueprints become tech 2 blueprints. this happens at downtime. 6. tech 2 becomes the new baseline and all requirements to use tech 2 items are removed.7. tech 3-5 items typically do not have primary attribute bonuses, but do have really cool bonuses dealing with overloading and/or giving bonuses to other fitted modules.8. (optional) when blueprints drop down a tech level, all items also drop down that tech level. this means that players have to use those high quality items or lose them, they can't stock up just as producers can't rest on their laurels once they researched the highest level item.why do it?to ensure that competition is continual in eve. that no producers can rest on their laurels and that there is no \"end game\" for production, you need to keep working to stay on top."
"dear vuk, reading your impressive opening pitch reminded me of something i suggested to my corp a few weeks ago about supercaps. ive brushed it up a little and posted it below. some ideas and suggestions for making motherships and titans more appropriate to the game. mothership. [that lives up to its name]key points. (numbers slightly adjustable by race) - 4990m3 drone bay. (cannot carry fighters but retains the ability to deploy up to 20 drones) - 60% native resists across the board to shield, hull and armour. - equipped with a capital push jump portalhas a native capability [using the capital navigation window] that allows it to jump 1 frigate sized ship, to any non cyno jammed system within its maximum jump distance (dictated by jdc) which can then scout, light a cyno for it to jump through to or surprise tackle a ship etc etc. [10 minute cooldown] (frigate will appear 10km away from a random stargate in the system]- 50,000m3 cargo bay- 20,000,000m3 ship maintenance bay [sub capitals only]with enough space for around 40 battleships or over 700 frigates, the mothership can support an extended fleet - mini stationnative docking with space for up to 100 pilots. their view is either station style or they can switch to an outside view of the mom they are in and they can chose when to undock. cloning, repair, fitting and insurance services. (jump clone capable) - 1,400,000m3 corp hangarcontinuing the moving station theme, the mothership has abilities for those docked to access shared \"corporation hangars\" as well as limited personal hangar space. - full controlthe pilot of the mothership will have full control over the resources within it. able to dictate how much corp hangar space is assigned to corps, himself, individuals etc, the pilot has the ability to move, take, view all items and ships in the mom, (similar to station security windows) as well as ejecting any pilot/ship at any time. the people \"docked\" in the mom are the ships \"fighters\" it is no longer a ship that you can take into combat solo, it has no mega dps of its own other than smartbombs and standard drones- it can fit remote rep, triage, neuts, remote ecm, tackle etc. with bonuses for ecm and repair drones, - can fit cloaking device but has a fixed 10 minute cooldown. (if you uncloak or are decloaked, you cannot recloak for 10 mins, decloaking also starts a 10 minute aggression timer, so logging off and on wont help) a \"forward mini base\" ship, if you let one of these into your home constellation, you have a thorn in your side that just won't quit hurting until you find and kill it. when it is killed, everything and everyone that was in the ship is lost. clones are destroyed, live or offline pilots are podded to their med clone (or corp hq if the med clone is the mom) and everything inside the ship is lost. additional insurance on ships will pay out as normal but to the last pilot of the ship if they were the insurer."
"titan aka the daddy shipkey points.

"hate to tell you, but ccp have said they docking inside capital ships wont happen.i did like some of your proposed changes to moms though"
"do you have a link for that? would be interesting to understand the reasoning behind it.. never say never i say :-)"
"honestly cant remember who of the devs posted it and in what thread.but part of the reason for it was the problems it would cause if the titan/mom would get a ctd while he had ships/players inside him"
"heh, yeah, i thought about that. i guess if the pilot ctd's the players in the ship get a 15 minute \"downtime style\" timer till the ship disappears, they undock, log out or the pilot comes back. if they don't log off or undock, or if someone logs on into an offline mothership they get the \"mothership station graphics but all they can do is chat in corp/alliance, chat in channels or jump clone out. basically doing everything but using the station services or undocking. same i guess goes for the titan."
"earning sp by actually playing the game.my opinions and percieved problems-ccp's pov on ingame interaction for training skills is boring and unsatisfying. ccp thinks that simply logging in and changing skills is sufficient skill training progression.-not everyone plays eve for the same reason, and for some simply progressing is the endgame. for this playstyle, gaining more and more isk may not be stimulating enough. these people want to experience eve, fly more ships, fly ships better, or try out the different activities that eve has to offer.-players should be encouraged, but not required, to play eve in order to progress. and gaining more and more isk isn't necessarily considered progress. for instance i've got more isk than i'll ever need for what i can currently do in eve. progress for me is waiting for my skills to allow me to do more or different things in eve. the only way i can achieve this is through skill training. my logging into eve and actually playing the game brings me no progress, thus the only progress that encourages me to log into eve is by skill training.-i am all for the skill queue idea, but i fear it is not enough by itself. sure logging in simply to skill train is boring and dull, but at least it got me to log in while waiting to meet certain requirements to <fly that ship> or whatever eve activity. with a skill queue there would be nothing encouraging me to even login in order to progress, unless ccp made actually playing eve a means of progress.goals-to have an additional way for players to gain skillpoints in eve by actually playing the game.-to not remove, nerf, or in anyway alter the current skill training system, but to introduce an additional source of sp accrual.rough idea-players accumulate potential at a rate of 1/1440% every minute of every day until their potential pool is full at 100%. (at the rate of 1/1440% per minute, 1day = 100% potential)-you can then earn sp by doing ingame actions until your potential pool is empty.-maximum potential pool i leave out as any value you or i provide would be arbitrary, should be decided by ccp what total % of sp should be earned by playing the game compared to normal skill training.-potential pool is limited this way to prevent too much sp coming from playing the game.-im keeping this the core of the idea and not including how the sp be spent as i cannot think of a slam-dunk winner way with which to spend it. the challenges listed would need to be solved by ccp.pictures are worth a wall of textplease visit your user settings to re-enable images."
"challenge: how to spend the sp-the challenge is then, how do your spend said earned sp? in the example provided that 5 sp can only be applied to those skills involved. you'd essentially need to track every source of sp earned as individual sp token objects and then spend them individually. or you could just pick a skill and select to spend all available sp tokens. there are major flaws in sp tracking and player confusion involved in this virtual pool approach. it could be great if there were a simple way to manage the sp.-another approach that would still reward the skills related to the rewarded activity would be to not pool up the earned sp, but to simply have the player select a skill in which to funnel earned sp into. then if the reward of the activity completed allows your selected skill to be rewarded, the sp is funneled into that skill. otherwise no sp is rewarded.-yet another much simpler idea for sp rewarding would be to simply store all of the earned sp into a pool that the player can then spend on any skill. this would by far be the simplest to implement and possibly the fairest, although not quite as neato or roleplayish as imagining the character gaining sp through putting those skills to use.challenge: rewarding actions-the rewarded actions would need to be indisputable/unexploitable measures of accomplishment. activating modules and going afk or something similar must not be rewarded.-not every accomplishment may be rewardable, as i don't pretend to know of every playstyle in eve. the major ones are rewardable however. ship combat resulting in a kill, production resulting in a ship/module/charge, mining asteroids resulting in ore in your cargohold, finding scan results. 0.0 starbase logistical stuff i don't know so much about though, plus they are corp/alliance level so rewarding that is a can of worms.despite the potential shortcomings of the idea, i believe that earning additional sp by actually playing the game is a good one. please support!"
"way to ruin the original concept of eve. no!"
"i just want to make it clear that this is an idea for additional sp earnings, not removal or nerfing of the current skill training system."
"gb2wow"
"erm.. no."
"absolutely not.this has been one of the key features of the game since its conception. students or other people with excess time on their hands aren't able to \"powerlevel\" themselves ahead at a rate not attainable by the rest of us. this should never be changed.captain thunk"
"lol drake, unfortuneately i have to agree with the nay sayers, i think this \"grinding\" idea would ruin eve."
"well clearly this proposal will flop so whatev~ **** it.i play daoc, gw, and eve.. and i won't deny i played wow.i like eve's skill training. its like wow's rest xp or daoc's /freelevel. a way for casual players to invest less time into the game over a longer period of time and achieve the same results.and i like that eve is for the casual side, don't get me wrong. i wouldn't play this damn game if it weren't.buuut eventually you are going to play the game a little bit, and its more fun when that time is rewarded. even casual gamers invest time into games.or don't tell me none of you have ever felt like you've just been logging in to skill train at times. :pnow that this has already clearly flopped, which im used to cause i suck at conveying what is in my head, i'd just like to say that what i had in mind was extremely casual. we're talking like a power-hour of gaming.the *potential pool*, like a rest xp bar that takes a day to fill up with x amount of sp.but, could take like a mission or 2 to exhausted. or produce a spaceships (however that works), or scan out a site, or mine 1 belt.my idea wasn't to encourage poop-socking, but just a little sum'in sum'in to reward people for actually playing eve now and then.or hell, maybe the potential pool could have built up over a whole week and you could spend sunday playing and feel more rewarded for playing.now that thats out, **** you guys for calling me a wowtard. go **** yourselves that hurt my feelings!"

"i used to play wow :-) but then i found the amazingly sexy graphics of eve and enjoyed the almost non-exsistance of millions of little kids asking me for gold every 5 minutes :-) i would like to see a skill queue and maybe another learning skill, i hate odd numbers so a new learning skill would bring it up to 12 :-) and i will be honest, sometimes i do feel like i am just loggin on to change skills, but i find myself signing on more for keeping up with my corp/alliance mates and making sure they are all doing good :-) that is enough of a reward for me ::::i know, a whole lot of sappy crap, but they are all good people :-p:::: i feel you on the posting in assmebly hall thing, i dont think i have had an idea yet that has had alot of support and/or interest :-) i will keep trying though. cheers mate and fly safe.edit: i am totally giving you an a+ for the graphics, i like pictures that go with ideas."
"i have to concur..... same thing here...a: when i log on... the teamwork of working with my \"incognito\" corp (soon to be restarted) is thrilling.... coordinating.. working hard to finish tough missions...etc..etc... when you play solo casually... you won't last long in this game unless your motivation is driven hard by persistence.b: posting in assembly hall and just shotgunning ideas really bugs me... and i'm starting to troll a bit too much these days but honestly... its so obvious you didn't even bother to research.so sorry if you took offense to that.... but at least bother to clean up your foul mouth and put more effort into your ideas.even i try to come up with ideas... but most of them i delete myself because i realize that there's consequences down the line that would make the game worse off than it is.try tackling the war-dec problem... and you'll catch on realll quick like."
"i drew a picture! that alone is reason enough for ccp to implement my idea by noon tomorrow afiak!but seriously i close most of the post i begin to write where im trying to be taken seriously. all ideas have potential flaws. most ideas can be flawed in the details. hell a good bit of the ideas that i am against have great potential if executed flawlessly.i actually did think about this one quite a bit, and recognize there are many ways it could hurt or ruin eve if the details aren't implemented well. but if done just right, people wouldn't feel they need to log in to advance, yet be pleasantly rewarded with a little extra when they do.its all about the details, much like speed tanking. good idea, tons of potential failure to be too strong or too weak, but if done just right then its both balanced and still worthwhile."
"grinding sucks, bad. this would introduce grinding to eve. therefore, it's bad."
"ingame actions used to generate sp for skills directly related to that action (mining for example would boost your mining skill) - it was removed because it was being exploited."
"wait, i can level up my gunnery skills by shooting asteroids for hours on end?! win! go back to ultima online."
"i have the same memories; the question is how was it being exploited, and is that exploit still achievable (or stoppable). eg. macroing mwd on/off would have worked to get mwd skill, but have ccp improved their capturing of macroers, and therefore it's not valid anymore?that should be answered before rejecting it out of hand. rejecting it on principle is a whole other matter :)"
"i wasn't rejecting it for the exploit reason - i was just pointing out that this system used to exist in eve.as for capturing the macro on/off thing - i doubt ccp's ability to do so considering it's a fairly subtle manipulation."
"yus please"
"a good idea but imagine the amount of coding and extra db load to make this happen. by giving everyone 7 wallets you are talking about adding over (based on the q1 economic report) 3 million new wallets to the game. the overhead of all that is probably why ccp will never do it. there are only about 40,000 corps so that's a much more manageable number. i support this but i'm not holding my breath that they'll ever do it."
"i like the idea."
"i like this idea also, bcause we have such a high technology in eve and cant build ships that dont have a steady run of ammo system? every halfbrained engineer would look for a steady going fire in a warship.i even would go further and make it possible to give the weapons a ammo mixture designed by players (i.e. emp; emp; fusion; emp.... ) so u can use 2 ammotypes without reloading............."
"the only problem i see is the potential to aquire a gtc with ingame isk, but if you actually look at the gtc system, you do not actually 'buy' gametime, you exchange isk for someone elses game time. eve is stll and will always be a one-way money sink.the only way to make money off eve is to sell isk to an isk selling site, and that's illegal in the first place. actually, if this went down, i think your macro farmers who sell isk wouldn't just be in violation of the eula, they would be in violation of international money laundering laws, whch would make them vulnerable to arrest...wait a minute...give me gambling yesterday damnit! i wanted it yesterday!"
"forget gambling making it 18+, all those exotic dancers..."
"btw: is it allowed to bump reasonable topics in csm forums?(intention is to move this one back from page two to page one)if not: sorry, too late now"
"medals? yeah, that's a good idea!isk, ships and items? nah, i don't like a meta aspect of a game giving you an advantage like that to be fairly honest.game time? a week of gametime if your bug report results in a new defect being opened or resolves one? i think that's quite reasonable.store credits? seems like a good idea, both from an incentives perspective and a business perspective. i can support that!i think this is a very good issue. i will look to raise this as an issue as soon as possible. is there more ideas for how it could be done? i think the above ideas are quite good really. but the more ideas we have, the better chance ccp rolls with it"
"i agree personally on the meta rewards, we all saw how that went over when ccp gave out faction fitted moms for getting a lot of referrals. i just listed them as ideas for discussion.csm rep taking up my cause 4tw!"
"the standings system is on the face of it a quick and easy way to tell friend from foe and mark other players in spacehowever it is too simple for the complexities of eve politics and has a number of major shortcomings that can range from inconveniencing and wasting players' time to major friendly fire incidents and serious loss of ships and equipmenti would ask anyone who wishes ccp to seriously re-examine the system with a view to solving a range of problems to support this threadbelow are the three main areas of play where standings are a serious problem"
"edit:formattingor removal overviewthe \"states\" filer in overview has a series of check boxes which you use to indicate who you want to appear on overview with regard to standings. unfortunately, these check boxes work on the basis that every ship and wreck is on the overview by default. when you unckeck a box, any ship that fulfills that property is taken off overview, even if it fulfills other checkboxes that are checked.so for example, say i set a corp that i don't like to -10. that corp then declares war on my corp. that corp has a pilot with -ve sec status and a bounty on him, and he warps to the gate i am at.if i have no states bar the \"pilot is at war with your corp/alliance\" checked, then i will not see the enemy pilot on overview. as far as overview is concerned, i haven't checked to see \"pilots with -ve sec status\" and this pilot has -ve sec status. so despite setting overview to what i would logically assume to be correct to see war targets only, i in fact will not see my war target until i add pilots with -ve sec status, horrible standings and bounties.this means i effectively have to turn on every state, check every box except what i don't want to see any of. that usually boils down to only having \"pilot is in my fleet/corp/alliace/has good standings\" turned offthe side effect is that pilots who i'm not at war with, but who still have -ve sec status or have bounties or have horrible standings show up. or if i turn them off i run the risk of having war targets that don't show up on overviewthis somewhat defeats the point of the overview filters, especially if i'm in high sec at war and start seeing other corps who i have -ve standings with but am not at war with on my overviewthe reason for doing it in this manner is that it is efficient. the client as soon as it gets a false against any one of the checks for that ship against your overview settings can say that ship will definitely not appear on overview and forget about it. however, it shouldn't be too much to ask that all ships be default to off overview and put on the overview when they satisfy just one of the check boxes"
"non-inheritance of alliance standings to corp structuresthe problem is that in overviews and in local, corps inherit their alliance's standings, whilst corp structures, things like outposts and pos, don't.for example, say we have person a, who has +ve standings with an alliance b, but not with a corp c, where corp c is in alliance b. now say that a pos owned by corp c is set to shoot everything that doesn't have +ve standings (not blue shoot it, nbsi for short).person a will now be shot at by the pos belonging to corp c. despite the fact that corp c members see person a as blue, their pos doesn't.this is a bigger problem for alliances managing their outposts. to prevent enemies from having safe haven in an alliance's outposts, they may set outposts so to deny docking to anyone with standings below a certain value (or more commonly, only let allies and those with +ve standings dock).however, since corp structures, such as outposts don't inherit alliance standings, it means that every corp that owns an outpost has to maunally set their standings rather than just use alliance standings. if an alliance has a lot of standings, this represents duplicate work for corporations to each make their own standings list match that of the alliance, and can take a very long time. not to mention that the separate standings lists can mean inconsistencies occur over time as allies are dropped or new ones made and enemies come and go.some alliances get round this by having a single corp that manages all the outposts. however this in itself has lots of problems. aside from increasing the potential for spies to cause damage across all outposts an alliance owns, rather than just a few, by getting into the outpost holding corp, it means that there is no pride or sense of achievement to individual corps who may have worked hard to build or conquer said outpost, disadvantaging alliances who opt for corp level management of outposts rather than alliance wide ownership / operation schemesthe whole thing can be rather embarrasing when allies who've been brought in to fight for your side can't dock or access fittings and repair shop because there are no directors of the corp owning the outpost online, and the outposts don't inherit alliance standings"
"standings slot limitcurrently there is a limit of 300 standings slots for each alliance. whilst no problem for most combatitive alliances who operate the afforementioned nbsi system, where most enemies will be neutral and not require a standings slot, it can be a problem for those who run the alternative \"not red don't shoot\" (nrds) system.the nature of the nrds system means that every enemy has to be set red, and usually fast, to avoid people not realising someone is hostile or an enemy until they are being attacked (as the natural assumption is that a neutral is not hostile until proven otherwise).over the 5+ years eve has been live, many alliances running nrds have found that the number of reds they have aquired has more than exceeded the 300 standings slot limit.this causes problems as it means a lot of time has to be spent deciding which hostile corps are old and have disbanded or moved onto other areas and can have their standings slot freed up for some more immediate threat, even though they are still hostiles / enemiesof course this is a problem if said enemies who have been some other part of the eve universe come back, at which point it will not be immediately obvious. that is to say the standings system then can't be relied on and so becomes less and less useful.my own alliance have actually implemented a database of all hostiles (over 800) and have to use a combination of alliance standings and an in-game front end ui to ascertain if others are friend or foethe issue is compounded by enemies who persistantly \"corp hop\" or who reside in npc corps and really require a personal red standingand the whole thing isn't helped by the fact that for the system to work, everyone who is part of the system has to follow the same list of reds, have the same standings. that means duplicate standings changing for lots of corps and alliances, not to mention the problems with outposts as detailed earlierthe point is 300 is no longer an arbitrarily high enough number that no one will ever reach it, and players are already having to find work arounds to make their chosen legal/standings system work"

"great little ships to have on you're side. looks cool too!they require allot of skills to be able to fly well but come'on. lets face it. there just overpowerd.falcons are usually unable to be scouted. thus leaving the fleetcommander clueless that his most important ships in his fleet will be put out of action.this allready makes them far better than the other 3 races in terms of recons.couple this with the fact they jam at 200km makes them almost inpossibly to kill with a close range 'tanking' fleet.they werent too much of an issue when everyone was nano'ing fast around the place as they would be quickly tackled and put out of action - this is no more.as an fc i'd quite honestly say i'd rather a mothership decloaked ontop of us than a falcon uncloaked 200km away.as i said. there excellent ships that require skill and skills to fly - however they just need to be taken inline with the other recons of its class.rooks, scorps and other jamming ships are not quite as nasty. you usually kno what your going in for with these before a fight.falcons range bonus should be removed - or a similar nerf to that effect.tho, this is just myside of a storry - as a falcon pilot myself.what you guys think?crax mcgee"

"why do they invite the csm to island right after the election and not at the end of the working period?wouldnt the csm be better prepaired? they have what now, a month (there are holidays in between) to get all the proposals together and worked out?i'm not sure thats the best way, any clarification on this?"

"well, if thats the only reason, i think its not a good enough one.you have to ask yourself what you want from the rl-meeting in iceland. are you going there just to meet and have a good time getting to know eachother or are you there to work, propose ideas, discuss concepts with the devs in detail.if its the latter, then a meeting at the end of the working period would be more apropriate in my opinion.sure, to be fair 2 meetings would be needed (one at the beginning and end of each period), but as thats not possible i would choose one at the end."
"last time we came up with a fine list of issues and we had some very good discussions.whatever seem to be the issue, i sure can't see it. you seem to make assumptions that in 1-2 months, the csm can't produce any \"worthwhile\" issues that justifies going to iceland. i beg to differ entirely."
"well, its your 2nd time now in csm right? tell me there was no progression in the group during this 6 months in how they work together, resolve issues, compromise. there is your difference.at the end of such a working period of 6 months i just think, taking from my experience, that the group would do better in front of the devs presenting themselves and the issues as one.but ok, its just my opinion and it will change nothing so i will let it go. i just wanted to know if there was a reason, but there seems to be none."

"why should falcons be changed? what evidence do you have to support the assertion that there is, in fact, a \"falcon problem\"? why are falcons overpowered, but rooks aren't, considering they both have the same ecm characteristics?furthermore, this is a perfect example of how not to write up a csm proposal."
"falcons are balanced very well, leave them be.at best they can solo an industrial... their role is support, and they fill that role well. there is no need to dumb them down just to suit folks unable to deal with them flown by enemies.oh, well, you can hire your own falcon pilot...or heck, even a blackbird. i had one bb pilot actually jam my (max skilled) falcon three times in a single engagement, and then again in a subsequent engagement. needless to say i was duely impressed. unfortunately that bb was the only ship that survived on his side (despite my inability to jam his fleet)."
"100% chance to disable 1 hac with 1 module on falcon is fine then ? ! dampener should set your lock range to 1km then, tracking distruptor should vut yyoutr optima land fall of by 99%, target painter should increse sig by 1000000x,web should reduce speed to 0 - to make all ewar even in campare of ecm."
"sounds like you got real unlucky. also, if you make those changes, make ecm work 100% of the time and then it'll be balanced.try not to exaggerate when you make claims."
"its exactly because they have the same ecm characteristics that they are a problem. one can cloak and the other cannot. but they both have the exact same utility as a ship otherwise.if i took a zealot, gave it another high slot and gave it a cloak bonus and called it a justicar, it would be impossible to say that this was balanced with the zealot.given that the falcon can cloak and warp cloaked it must pay for this ability in some way in order to be balanced. it does not, therefore is not balanced.granted, the other thing you could do would be to buff the rook[scorpion and blackbird], but i do not think that is a good idea."
"the rapier and the huginn share the exact same ewar bonuses. is the rapier overpowered because it can warp cloaked?indeed, it would be impossible. luckily, the falcon has fewer high slots and loses out on a damage bonus for the cloak bonus. in this hypothetical example, would a cloaking zealot that loses a bonus and has fewer turrets than the regular zealot be balanceable?it loses out on a high slot, three launcher hardpoints and a damage bonus.it does, you just don't think it's enough. given that three of the four sets of racial recons share the same bonuses for their racial ewar between the force and combat recons, why is the falcon the only one which is overpowered?note that i have no characters which can fly falcons, and i don't necessarily believe the current state of affairs is acceptable. but in order for me to support a nerf, you will have to come up with a stronger case."
"it pays for that ability in the fact that it has low hp and most pilots fit ewar/sensor boosters in their mids, which means there is no room for a booster/passive or active hardeners. it also pays by requiring high skills to fly it to max effectiveness. caldari recons are very specialized at what they do and they do it well. you don't see anyone getting solo kills in a falcon/rook.recons as a whole are very balanced.. if you don't like falcons fit sensor boosters or have a falcon in your gang to jam the falcon.. simple. if that does not work.. sniper ships could possibly solve this issue as i hear a rohk can swing out to 200+ km where most falcons sit. i can't even fly a falcon.~"
"they are not nearly the same. the rapier and huginn have secondary characteristics which are actually important[damage].that being said, huginns are generally considered to be inferior to rapiers for this reason. saying that damage is important on a falcon or rook is ignorant and laughable. saying it is important on a huginn or lachesis is less so."
"you cannot do this if you want to have a balanced system. the system that you designed after the scripting changes has excluded any type of bonus increasing solution from working. even small tweaks to the boost bonus on your celestis hulls will break rsd's in the other way, by making them too strong. you need to fundamentally look at what you screwed up in the formula and fix it.e.g.currently you can get 67.531% damps on a damping ship with all bonuses. if you change the bonus on the celestis hull from 5% to 6% you go from 67.531% top damp to 70.221.%. this is a 10% increase in damping.if you change the bonus from 5% to 7.5% you take your top damp from 67.531 to 74.273%. which is a 26% increase in damping strength.but wait, it gets worse. if you don't have an eos with you and you aren't rigged you go from 53.13% to 58.433% when you have max skills. which is a trivial amount.you have set up a system where any bonus that you apply to the ship which is not pitiful when you have max skills but no rigs or an eos to be ridiculously overpowered when you do. in order to make using a celestis hull a strong ewar platform without rigs and an eos you would have to change the bonus from 5% to 10%. but doing so, when you had an eos and were rigged would take your final damp to 81% per damp. a number which had previously been deemed \"unacceptable\". the situation gets even worse when you're dealing with people who do not have maxed skills. because each and every bonus over the last gets progressively stronger, and its only possible for 2 or 3 of the bonuses to come from module type attributes, which means that stacking penalties simply will not have much of an effect.you have to change the way that the bonuses stack with each other in order to get back to your solution. i wrote a bit about it hereread it, and don't do ******ed things."
"arrg, it didn't use my default character. that is me."
"i agree that gal e-war needs a major look at it."
"this issue has already been accepted by the csm and is being looked at. i posted this because i do not feel that the answer that ccp gave gave any indication that either side really knew what was going on."
"well, the stupid solution would be to buff the bonus to 10/12.5% and then nerf the eos into the ground! that would be completely stupid, of course, but considering the eos isnt that popular right now i'm almost of the opinion that they should do that just so that there'd be some useful damp boats at all. they could later just scrap information warfare alltogether and come up with something better."
"i would really like it if they changed bonus calculation back to how it was and then put info links back up to 25%.such a unbonused ship would perform similarly to a bonused ship if they were flying with an eos."

"having 6 meta level, storyline modules have attributes of 2 meta level modules (usually with a bit less fitting requirements). but the worst thing: manufacturing cost exceed 30m isk (even for frigate-sized modules), which make storyline modules manufacturing unpractical and its bpc nearly useless.i think storyline modules and its bpc needs rebalancing to fit 6 meta level."

"the easiest way to solve this is to re-do the making of a war dec mutual mechanic. i think when you make a wardec mutual, the war should last forever unless one side asks to surrender and the other side accepts.that way when you war dec, there is always a risk the otherside make it mutual and you find you are unable to back out until they let you.currently the only consequence to war decc'ing a corp is the loss of 1mil isk, which is hardly anything to most players, especially if you just use alts for your war dec grief corp and have your mission running main safely tucked away in a friendly corner of 0.0 or in npc corp missioning awayedit: apparently it is 2mil isk now to wardec according to one of the above posters...."
"1) if you read hte post, it says \"in a gank fit\". a gank moros easily puts out 6000 dps. that isnt a practical pos-shooting fit, but it is about the maximal you can get out of it at low-cost (3x ss mfs, seige ions, dread 5, cap gun 5). if that is possible, which it is, right now, on tq, and your ship does ten times that (which it does) it can get 60k dps. and you beleive that's balanced.2) sorry to be rude, but are you having a laugh, or just being malicious, when you post misleading and wrong numbers? there are no gunnery skills included in your numbers.add 10% for gunnery 5, 25% for cap gun 5, 20%+ for rapid firing 5, and 15% for surgical strike.then you mis-quote the highest damage ammo (which does 110.4 damage, not 96), and assume that people with seven-eight lowslots to play with will fit 0 damage mods.its absurd that you have the barefaced cheek to accuse me of \"failing math\" (by the way, maths is a plural, but i dont suggest you go re-take english class), when you're deliberately misleading what your crazy ship can do.be honest, your ship is capable of doing the dps of at least ten dreadnaughts. when combined with the ability to seige twice as fast, it means three of them, thats right, three pilots, could do the job of sixty dreads in getting all the towers in a system reinforced incredibly quickly. plus they tank harder, which combined with 5 minute seige means in a carrier blob they're almost unkillable."
"moved to features & ideas."
"if you wish to make the clam of dps out put i will ask you to please submit accurate mathematical equations to prove your theory in this calmed area of dps small technicality, what i should have said was high damage t1 ammo. i ask you again to please take the time to prove me wrong with detailed mathematical equations of how you think this ship is doing what you say it dose. other wise you have no foundation to make these accusations. i fixed the spelling for you, and then i ask you how you can assert that the flagship class dreadnought can do 10 times the dps with what i've asked for 3 times in this post. further more i want to know now, by your account, a flag ship that supposedly dose 10 times the dps of a dread, times 3 ships dose the job of dreads. i may not be the best at english but i can do 3 times 10. next"
"1) no, you're doing it wrong. you have managed to do 3 times ten, but forgotten to divide it by 0.5 seeing as your flagship does siege cycles twice as fast, as well as doing 10x the dps.sixty dreads = two groups of 30, going around killing poses every ten minutes (minimum time = 1 siege cycle). assume a group of 30 (equivalent to the three flagships i stated) can single cycle a tower.say you have ten towers in a system, thirty dreads can kill them in 100 minutes. if a flagship is ten dreads, and it does five minute cycles, three of them can, in 50 minutes, do all ten poses. that is twice as fast as the 30 dreads - or, as fast as sixty doing two towers at a time. ie. 3 of your ships = sixty dreads at tower killing. 5 minute cycles = double the amount of dreads needed to keep up. this isn't difficult.2) mathsi got a quote of 6000 from eft, but i can easily do the same right here from scratch:with max skills, on a revelation fitted with 3 navy heat sinks (quite cheap), a dual giga pulse has a damage mod of 12.1 and a rof of 4.8s12.1*7.25= 87.7 (an increase of 625% on 100% base)87.7 * 110.4 (navy/blood mf xl, available on jita market) = 9684 * 3 (guns) = 29054 damage / 4.8 (rof) = 6053 raw dps. (oh, and plus 300 from 5 t2 gardes or ogres). none of this is a crazy fitting. the giga pulses actually have an optimal of 25k, which means if you want you can hug the shield and hit a tower with these guns, easily. of course, if you expect enemy action fitting longer-ranged guns and sitting back a bit might be a better idea, but the option is there. the rev can do more than 6000 dps.your amarr flagship:6053 / 1.25 (remove revelation bonus) = 4825 * 6.25 (add flagship damage bonus level 5) = 30265 (thirty thousand, two hundred and sixty five dps). and thats with three guns. your flagship has six, giving a grand total of 60,530 dps. at a usable optimal. with 4 remaining lows, a resist bonus, 3 rigs and a seige mod for tank - in this gank fit. you can go tankier if you want, ofc.these are all accurate numbers as far as i am aware. certainly the eft numbers for damage mod and rof for my moros match those exactly given in game. i see no reason why the ones for a revelation quoted above would be any different."
"actually i don't have to .. it's great that we can finally settle the part where you agree that the above imaginery ship is doing 10 times the damage of it's dread counterpart. well it would be awesome if you would start to use damage mods, maybe faction ammo and *gosh* more gunnery skills than just \"mothernaught v\" in your calculation. i agree too lazy to do the math homework in detail, but adding skills and damage mods i get a duration of 4.8, damage mod, 11.15 damage mod (times three per gun so 33,45) and using a 105 damage faction crystal, which throws your numbers off by the factor of about 45,6k dps is thus achieved, 6k may be if you go higher faction crystals or more faction heat sinks."
"well seeing as you have posted what it would take to get that kind of dps out of this proposed ship type then i will concede that it is possible to get 6000dps out of a maxed skilled, faction fitted dread with faction ammo.i will say on the other hand that i could not see a fleet commander ever letting there dreads fit to get that kind of range. but, as i've said, as you have now pointed out,it is possible to get 6000 raw dps.now i will shift the argument that you are making that 3 flag ships would be able to siege a hole system 2 times faster then 30 dreads could, and with 3 flag ships doing short range max skilled damage you could rf, not kill a large tower in 5mins, and then move onto the next tower.now the question we need to ask our self's is would we rather have 3 super dreads or 60 other dreads.hes another way to look at it, do we want more capitals or less capitals. also when it comes to risk vs reward. 10 dreads is worth 16-19bils with fits and all that good stuff. that's how much i want these ship class to cost so there's no more or less isk going into your investment then with a fleet of 30 dreads. and don't start telling me that they would never die and they can't be killed, it would be a massive risk to use these ships but maybe with these kind of bonus we would see people using them. mother ships and titans can be killed and massive isk loss and so would these ships, so that can be used as a argument against this propsal."
"fewer capitals. incidentally, this proposal is antithetical to that ideal. the only thing this proposal will introduce is a new class of capital (or supercapital, as the case may be). you will end up with a handful of people in a fleet with these.....and everyone else who can fly a dread in a regular dreadnought. this is because there is no reason not to bring more. if three mothernoughts can rf a large faction tower in 5 minutes, three mothernoughts and a fleet of regular dreads will reinforce it in less than 5 minutes.the only thing you are contributing to by introducing a capital that is \"better\" is the proliferation of said capitals.coincidentally, i can't help but notice that massive morsus mihi underneath your name every time you try to resurrect this terrible topic. it makes me wonder if perhaps there isn't some sort of ulterior motive behind these requests. of course, i'm sure you are completely impartial and the massive benefits one of these would provide to an alliance defending its territory are not in any way an incentive to continue making posts about it."
"so ether way with or with out this ship in the game there will still be massive capital blobs and introducing this ship would do nothing to hurt or help the current situation. the only other thing it would do is make a large target with a 20bill kill mail waiting to happen. why is that a bad thing again, wouldn't you like to kill one of these?with proliferation of said ship there comes mineral use and more isk to miners and drone ratters driving mineral cost up which is good for the none capital player or all players of that base.yes i am a member of that alliance and this is a terrible topic with all people have to say is negative things like..correction, we are no longer under attack from bob, please read here for further information about bobs full withdraw from there max campaign, but as you said, this topic has nothing to do with that, and this would be an offensive ship, can't really see how you would defend with this type of ship. good defense is a good offense?btw, i have always loved you sig dianeces, no matter what may be above it."
"no. it wont be a case of \"3 mothernuaughts or sixty dreads\". those pilots wont go away. it would be 3 mothernaughts and 57 carriers ready to rep them as soon as they drop out of seige if they're fired upon. its just senseless capital proliferation without any downside except cost, and as we've seen with titan proliferation, thats hardly a downside to anyone who actually uses capital ships."
"alright so i'm now left wondering that every one in this thread would like to see titans and moms and hell for that matter all capital ships removed from that game. that is a really sad thought because even with the short amount of time i get to us caps i love them to death. now maybe i can spin this another way, if not to build a whole new super mothernought then why not take this and glue it to a titan, would you guys rather see a dd or a super tower killer.and please don't go on about how you all hate caps so much. that's all i hear in the back of my head when i read your arguments, and if you must. i really want you to explain in detail why you all hate caps so much, and saying that to many people have to many and its not fare to younger player base is not a argument, this game has been based on how fast you can skill up and build for the biggest pew pew ship with the highest stats and dps and then go kill something. at least that's what ccp has been doing. look at the speed nerf. this is the game we play, and caps are hear to stay. now just because you all could never afford this ship or would never fly it even if you could is no reason to shoot it down. its a dam good idea and i'll be honest, i do not want to fly a titan, but its were i'm heading because i can't see any reason to fly a motnership. i would rather sit in space in my mothernought for the rest of my eve playing career then in a titan unless these things are added to the titan when the dd gets taken away."
"so basically you want to deal concentrated ddd-amounts of damage? the dreadnaughts have siege modules and a 5% damage mod per level (iirc)...125%??and half the cycle time??and supercap so immune to ecm??why not just put siege modules on titans, then?"
"this is brilliant. you start by putting words in everyone else's mouths \"all i hear when you say x is y!\". then you challenge everyone to defend their viewpoint on y! its genius. if i were to say \"all i hear when you post is how much you like to murder children, try and defend that horrible viewpoint you freak!!\" it wouldnt exactly go down very well.if you want an honest answer to your daft question - nobody here proposed removing capital ships from the game. however, plenty of people, myself included, think \"having the biggest capital fleet\" should not be the qualifier for dominating the alliance scene, but great tactics using a rounded balance of all ship sizes and classes. a maxed-out veteran player (like myself) should have a reason to choose flying a frigate or dictor just as much as a carrier, wheras if i was currently involved in the alliance end-game i really would have to spend a lot of time in a dread. its not that bad, though - there is a need for bs fleets and support at the moment. but moving further towards cap-ships online is a bad, bad idea. titans and motherships in their original form were the perfect examples of this - barely any counters, obsoleting smaller ships and basically stupid for game balance. proposing a new level of super dreads above dreadnaughts, is just essentially an isk sink for the biggest alliances so they can dominate anyone who hasnt bothered or is slightly poorer, for six to twelve months, until everyone has the same and then we'd be ready for you to propose supertitanmothernaughts with 8 turrets and 250% bonus per level? why is it a damn good idea? what does it add to the game, apart from \"a really huge ship with guns\" which sounds fun, except there already is that, the dreadnaught. even if there is actually a reason for it, which there isnt, how is it balanced? its not just that its better than a dread in every way - so is a mothership to a carrier. but not by a factor of ten. the mom does 2x the no of fighters which is the secondary function of ac arrier - the primary, ie the remote repping, is just the same. this means that mom proliferation isnt insane because you dont need them to compete - carriers will in general do, and you need lots, so carriers make sense. this proposed ship does ten times the gun damage, which is the primary function of dreads. there's no reason not to fly it"
"cough cough... in the line of what i expected:1st csm turnout: 11,08%2nd csm turnout: 8,61%- 22,29%conclusion: most players are either not interested or consider csm irrelevant."
"you can actually posit quite a few \"conclusions\" from that... all of which would be reaching as you have no idea why people don't vote. by no means am i insinuating that people are indeed engaged really, but merely pointing out that the conclusion you've come to is not one you could have reasonably reached. it's stated as fact with no basis."
"since everyone who voted in the election is using the internet and eve-online's forums, a straight up online forum poll system would be a better representation of the playerbase.an in-game poll would be ideal. or combination of forum poll, in-game poll, and newsletter poll. by account of course~i am always sceptical of putting people into unnecessary positions of authority. review of the first csm's early sessions is a prime example of power abuse. kicking people from a chat channel, resubmitting the same issues in a different wrapper, uneven time investment in issue discussion.and consider all of the technical challenges that exist for managing issues, their status, and their importance. its a full time job; don't misunderstand, i'm not advocating csm by saying its a full time job. csm being a full time job is exactly why players shouldn't be performing the duty. this effects who is willing to participate in the csm. and lets face it, the leftovers from the first csm that made it into the second csm are either attention-***** prima-donnas, view it as an internship for ccp, or combo.and it sucks cause you only get to vote for candidates. i'd much rather they have \"screw the csm, vote for player polling.\" option to vote for. buuut instead i had to vote for a representative. and he didn't make it. so i have no representation but to post my opinion and hope that these asshats respect or care despite my not liking them. cause i sure as hell won't be kissing any ass.fayke edit: internally handled polls are also better cause you can cross-reference the player's relevance to the question.say you have a question dealing with alliance management and you have 3,000 opinions to view... well it'd be useful to find the relevance of the opinion. is this player currently affected by, or has ever previously been effected by alliance management? does he have the skills to potentially be effected by alliance management? oh? only 10% of those voters have any experience with it, lets filter out the other 90% and see what the relevant votes and points are about.and then you pay an unbiased analyst to read the forums and collect the coherent and well presented arguments, find interesting statistics in the poll voting, and present the findings ccp."
"-22% is a fact which is a direct consequence of people not voting. and since this voting takes place by net over many days, you can't refer to attendancy issues either. players don't vote either because they are not interested (for a wide range of reasons"
"people don't vote for all kinds of reason, and yes most of those reasons we can ignore, but your still faulty in presenting only 2 conclusions as to why they didn't vote. you either unaware or deliberatly ignoring an obvious 3rd conclusion, they are simple confused about what they are voting for, in those circumstances the natural action is inaction. i think a very strong argument can be made that ccp and the csm have not done enough to educate the majority of the player base who don't haunt the forum boards, who don't go to the eve website and who 'simply log on and play a game'.then there is the 4th conclusion, and i think you'll find that most people don't vote b ecause of this. they don't see the need for the csm or anything similar to it that could replace it. many many people work on the adage 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' and i strongly suspect that for the silent majority of non-forum going memebers of the playerbase they are perfectly happy with the way is run and the direction it is going in.that is not to say they are correct or incorrect, it's just their opinion as your is yours and mine is mine."
"i \"capisci\"'d the first time you wrote the exact same thing. nothing about the content of my post has been altered by your restatement of the same. the poster above me has quite clearly laid out 2 further possibilities and there are yet more beyond that. you are still reaching and are still not in a position to come to the conclusions you have. i can only assume you're making these attributions in cause for dramatic effect."
"i voted, but to be blunt i'm cynical about the effect the csm is able to have, for one simple reason: skill queueing.universally popular amongst players, supported by every member of the first csm and not every member of the second, item one on the agenda of the first meeting in iceland. there will never be another requested feature with so much community support.understand i'm not cynical because the feature wasn't implemented, i'm cynical because ccp were not moved to talk about the issue. there was no feedback, no discussion, no response for the entire term of the first csm.i don't expect ccp to implement or even want to implement every change requested by the csm, but at a minimum i would hope that the csm had the ability to throw a spotlight on an issue and have ccp take it seriously as a result. i don't believe that's been the case so far."
"as long as there are enough people giving them money ccp can do anything they want.they openly taunt joke about their players complaining on the forums. and its easy enough to play the cool rockstar dev that doesn't care. as long as people are paying.when eve gets competition, if eve gets competition, they'll have to step their game up and listen to their customers, cause income won't be guaranteed then."
"i do not support skill queuing depending on how it gets implemented if it does. ccp did have a discussion with the csm regarding this, the results of which are off the record. they did listen however and a dialogue was had. sorry to burst your bubble."
"what, the happy little world in which it seemed like ccp blew you off? if they took the issue seriously and talked about it that's a good thing, an off the record discussion's better than no discusison at all.my cynicism is based on what's on the record, which is kind of all i have to go on - if you're discussing the major stuff behind closed doors then people like me are going to continue to get the impression that you're being ignored, since we don't get to hear about the stuff you don't talk about."
"i understand implicitly dude and i apologize for coming across as snide. i have the memory of a goldfish and had assumed this information had been presented somewhere. assume that any of the items that have been voted \"yes\" by the council have been discussed with ccp. if you haven't gotten a result then there's a reason for it. either it's still being hashed out off the record, or it's been pushed off to the second council."
"so much for transparency."
"the lad has a point, i mean i think most of us can understand that some conversations with ccp may have to be 'off the record' for buisness reasons, but at least tell us when your having the discussion and a broad reason why it has to be 'off the record'."

"what are your opinions on the state of sov. warfare, and does moon mining need to be revisited again?it's a harder to draw a line like that in eve, since several aspects of the game are closed off depending on how trusted you are. in something like eq, a guild can be transparent from top to bottom because there are no high-value \"loose\" assets, no dirty secrets, no logistics, no micromanagement just to keep the water running, etc.that doesn't really change the damage that internal misconduct can cause either. you certainly don't need to have a leadership role to spawn items, abuse glitches, provide intel, etc.as a contrast, guild wars is completely transparent about developer membership in the game, the only restriction is automatic disqualification from events. there isn't really anything wrong with transparency, the problem is misconduct and not restricting the ways of perpetrating it."

"i like the idea of the the two types of special ammo (t2 or faction) having extra effects on target.as in: conflag \"emits an emp burst which slightly hinders cap recharge on target\" or something like that.kinetic ammos might cause a small amount of damage to automatically bleed down to the next protective layer.hail might damage target speed or something.void could add heat damage to target modules."
"imo *all* faction ammo should be removed from the lp stores, and the penalties removed from t2 ammo. all the penalties. no more tracking, cap, speed, etc.and t2 ammo needs to be head and shoulders above t1. it has been nerfed so many times that it's now useless, and t1 equipped ships are now able to come *very* close to t2 performance without the massive skillpoint investment of t2 modules.faction ammo needs to be very good, and very rare. why not change all those t1 loot drops to some racial faction ammo? make gallente navy bss drop a few thousand fed navy antimatter l rounds every once in a while. make faction ammo more common than it used to be three years ago, but not what it is now.current price for fed navy am l is 900 isk/unit, 10k units at that price. void is offered at 200 isk/unit and 5k units at that price. either way, the faction ammo is so cheap, there's no reason not to use it. hell, my gun repair costs are usually way more than my ammo costs or what i make in loot these days when i have to overheat my guns to break some stupid triple rep rigged exile booster overheated dominix tank."

"just double or triple the lp & isk cost for faction ammo in the lp stores.and then remove the pointless nerfs on some of the t2 ammos (some t2 ammo has a 'nerf' that doesn't affect the ammo much at all... barrage, for example, affects tracking but it is *long range* ammo where tracking counts for considerably less than short. hail should've been tracking nerfed, like void)"

"there are lots of faction ships of all sizes. but no faction based drone ship.drones only have 3 modules (sub capital, 4 counting the capital module) that affect drones.while there are a lot of different types of drones, most ships can use them as effectively as dedicated drone ships.and all the different variations of drones (webber, sd, energy neut, ect) have such severe stacking penalties that using them is a waste. ecm drones are the only exception to this rule and every ship, including caldari, can use them as effectively as any dedicated drone boat. more so in that they use drones to supplement their normal weapons system while dedicated drone ships have to sacrifice damage to gain utility.there are implants for almost everything, from bpo research to exploration and of course the dozens for each weapons system. but not one for drones. and while ccp has actually acknowledged this and said they will do something about it \"someday\", it just doesnt seem to be happening.the drone regions were created and faction drones were promised. but only the gal version have been released. they are rare as hens teeth, cost an arm and a leg in rare components to make. where are the min, amarr and cal faction versions?overall, drones are not high on the priority list but when was the last time they got real loving?where are the drone ships that enhance something other then damage, shield and armor? maybe a bonus to webber drone str, sensor dampening or energy neut str? lower sig radius? something to make a dedicated drone ship want to use anything other then damage drones? yet not one faction ship for droners.where are the implants to better control drones? better tracking, lower sig radius, greater control range or even (as mentioned above) something to make the use of noncombat drones an option (outside ecm's)?where are the modules the enhance drone use? allowing your drones to slowly regen armor, to use noncombat drones better... something.personally i would love to see something done to expand the role of dedicated drone ships. and i understand that by adding to general drone effectiveness you really give a boost to all ships using drones. but ignoring them is not the way to go.they are the only weapons system that can be destroyed. crying cause you have to change your fit to actually combat drones is really not worth crying about. drone ships are not all powerful as to use noncombat drones we have to give up damage.could some attention be paid to this weapons system?could some promises be kept about releasing the rest of the faction drones?how about differant bonuses to dedicated drone ships outside of a bonus to damage, shield and armor or their drones?how about some implants for drone use, seeing as how most weapons systems have 3-8 dedicated to them?what about a faction ship or two based around drones and their use?how about restrict some types of drones to being used by only dedicated drone boats?or just tell us you want them to be support systems only and some of us who are dedicated to our drones can start down and differant trainging path.as it stands now, there are many of us training our drone skills in hopes that someday you might show them love.stupid i know given that drones are the least developed system in the game and yet the easiest to diable.thank you for your time."
"supported?"
"sorry, hit the enter typing the title and posted a blank.supported."
"/signeddrones in general need to be looked at, and especially drone ships (vexor/domi etc). while they are pretty good at their role, they are not true dedicated drone ships. i see a dedicated drone ship have minimal/zero turret slots, instead replaced by utility slots and a bigger/better drone bonus for the skills.a few other things worth mentioning that's relevant here:- first off, no t2 drone modules. every other weapon system has t2 stuff, so why not drones?- coming straight from point one, faction drone modules? shadow serpentis and gallente navy drone modules from faction spawns/lp store.- mentioned before, no drone implants at all (although ccp highlighted they are possibly thinking about making some - check this link for more info and put your ideas forward).- 'improved' and 'augmented' drones. plain rubbish. only the gallente drones are available, extremely difficult to get and overall not worth it over normal t2 drones. how about empire faction drones with slight damage/hp/etc buff from lp store (maxe x-run bpc perhaps)? make the improved and augmented more powerful than what they are now if they are to be kept that rare - so long as other races ones come out, otherwise make them more available.- direct drone damage modules. we have ones that improve drone control range, speed and tracking but no damage. how about a low slot module (like mag stabs, bcu's etc) that increase all drones' damage? faction variants would be good here too.- better drone rigs. mainly drone damage rigs that aren't sentry damage rigs.- fighters in general. only 2 skills (1 if you don't have gallente carrier with thanatos) and 1 module that affects these. can we get more modules for them? make the other drone skills useful to fighters? t2 fighters? the list goes on.once tech-3 comes out i really, really hope we can make ourselves a proper dedicated drone ship, with, for example, bonuses to just drone stuff if we want to (e.g. gallente battleship bonus - same as dominix drone bonus and whatever skill to fly t3 ship either the same bonus, or things like better hp/speed etc). of course, i would love to have a dedicated ship with a monster drone damage bonus (mini-moros anyone? ) while foregoing guns etc.that is all."
"i'm not a heavy drone user, but i agree 100% - drones seem to have been forgotten, but they are effective weapon systems.yes, the faction drones need to have a higher concentration of drops for all 4 racial types.yes, there needs to be at least one faction drone boat (granted, no npc uses drones, but...)"

"agreed."
"in light of the recent qr changes to missiles, the only reasonable solution i can really come up with for making the raven, caracal and cerberus and probably the faction variants more balanced, is to remove 1 turret high slot and add 1 midslot. this would allow them to still fit the same amout of missiles, but they would lose 1 high slot that would be used for something else, and adds 1 midslot that could be used for a web, or target painter.i am not suggesting this for either the drake or the marauder, because they would be over powered with them.the raven already has 2 high slots that are different to its primary weapon which is missiles, compared with the mega which has only 1.leave the current missile changes in place, no one can complain that we wouldnt be giving anything up for an extra midslot, it would also mean one less slot for a raven to have a cloak put in, so a raven cloaker would be sacrificing more to fit that cloak.i know im going to probably get hate posts but it is really the only alternative that i can think of that will give something up, for something in return and would be taking something away from raven and cerb mission pilots while giving something to pvp pilots.i would also like to sugest a change to reduce power grid or cpu and perhaps a reduction bonus for a target painter as that is more in line with missiles, which would only allow a painter to be fitted to the midslots with the current shield tanking ability instead of a shield, web, scrambler or other modthere may be other missile ships that need it flame away....."

"after looking at all the varying posts concerning macros, i have come to this conclusion. there are mainly two people who are using this idea as an attack on miners. 1st group is pirates. over time they have noticed a decreased population of easy targets in their territory(a result of low sec ore being devalued and the ease of finding and killing miners with scanners and warp scramblers), they are calling for a relaxing of concord influence on higher regions in order to combat the so-called macro problem. let them police high sector - haha, so funny, they will get rid of these \"macro miners\". they also want to eliminate the protection of npc corporations so they can wardec and kill their ships and make them quit if possible. but for any small corporation, a wardec can easily mean the end of that corporation, when you have no recourse but to stay in your local station. then there is the 2nd group, which are older miners who have seen a decrease in their profit margins over the years they have played, so they are doing what they can to combat the source, i.e. eliminate any and all competition by any means. usually competition is some particular racial/ethnic group, which is very similiar to the idea such and such group is taking our jobs. prices of lots of stuff have gone down simply because more people are playing this game and better mining ships and skills of course.addressing pinchonsita's case1: \"they go to a random(or not) belt\" - why not just say they go to a belt. and don't all miners do this. the rest of it just sounds like a lazy/semi afk miner.case2:\"they are 23h!, 365 days of the year on ...\" - wow do you really watch them all day long? and if you really do have the stamina to watch someone for all day long, does that make you a macro as well. assuming there is actually someone who mines all day long. well there are some crazy people out there who go without sleep for many days and when they do sleep, they only sleep a few hours. \"convos off\"-maybe they don't want to talk to people, maybe they are shy, maybe they are obsessed with mining, maybe they are tired of getting smack talked by someone, there is alot of that going around in this game. \"they dont talk in local\"-err who is there to talk to anyways. for being around 20k people online at once, i tend to only see around 1/10 or less actually in the chat channels. i think a good amount people who play this game, just simply have no desire to talk to others. mining can be relaxing if done by yourself, maybe that's just their play style. \"allways minning ice or common ore\"-sounds like about all high sector ore to me, ie mining, everyone in high sector mining ore must be a macro miner according to that logic.case3:why would you mine ice in anything other than a mack? isn't that what macks are designed for? or is the +100% just for nothing. maybe they use a mack is because its more profitable. hulk is not really designed for ice, cargo space only really important if you are semi-afk miner, not a dedicated one. sounds to me like some miners took your spot and you want them to leave and they won't, so that really annoys you and since cpp won't get rid of them for you, you decided to complain in the forums.case4: so what if they orbit the asteriod? what's that prove? they could just as easily approach it or get to a certain distance and stop there and begin mining. oh and the price of tritanium is going up up and away, where are these \"macro miners\" when you need them.\"4 cases there is allways some common things:\"1. maybe they don't want to talk to people. cpp put that option in there for a reason, certainly not to help \"macro miners\" flourish.---------they have a character limit, hmm., not very nice"
"2. shield booster on. hmm. sounds smart to me. why wouldn't any miner in area where rats appear not have a shield booster if they can't fit one on. \"set drones out\"-not all ships can tank ranks, maybe they want the bounty for killing the rats and setting drones out is an easy/lazy way to go about protecting oneself or getting the bounty. it's funny, another post i've read said you could indentify macros by the fact they don't set their drones out as the hulk gets attacked by rats. and by putting drones out proves they aren't a \"macrominer\". jeez, make up your mind people, kill the rats or not? and as for the hulk pilots i've heard rats are too weak to do any serious damage, so drones out or not, what difference does it make.3.\"dont reply in local\" - maybe they don't even have it in view or even realize someone is even trying to talk and maybe they are just ignoring you. i remember one time, i was trying to mine in low sec, didn't have local on, got warp scrambled by some pirates, tried to run, then tried to get local back on in an attempt to save my life, but i was already dead and podded and back in my cloning station, before i could manage it. what's even sadder is when i did the calcuation for the value of mining kernite. i realized it was more profitable just to mine veldsar and use those profits to buy whatever minerals i need to build the thing i wanted to build. i'm not sure on the profitability of ice, but currently veldsar is the valuable ore. if you want miners to go back to low sec, maybe take veldsar out of high sec. from a profit standpoint, it's more of a low sec ore than any ore out there.4. when i mine it's usually the same spot, people are creatures of habit. sometimes asteriods aren't there, which is kinda annoying, because i have to find a different spot. do they repeatedly go to the same spot over and over with no asteriods there. if they do i'd like to see that. then again could be a real person doing that, many hallucinating asteriods, from lack of sleep, drugs or whatever they taking/doing that allows them to keep coming back to those asteriods over and over. drugs can make you do some real stupid stuff. have you been to a mental hospital lately? i hear some of the people there are actually run by macros, which is why all current medication is incapable of curing their obsessive compulsive/hallucinatory behavior. if anyone actually has any of this problems and is offended by this comment, it was only a joke, and hopefully will be taken as such.5. you really timing these guys, wow you must be bored. mining cycles are pretty regular. once your cargo bay fills up, you have to do something with it. if you are actually paying attention to your mining it can become like clockwork, maybe even set your watch to it. heh, maybe they time when their cargo bay is going to be filled, go afk, then come back exactly at the time they know it is going to be full. even before computers and television, there were people who lived very predicatable lives with very repetitive behavior that you could set your watch to.the explaination:1. mouse recorder- hmm, pretty neat trick, maybe you could teach me. but anyways with the way eve is, lag, bugs, weird stuff. i doubt that would work for very long.\"allways the same, whit a exact ammount of time, in the same place.\"-sounds like 99% of miners to me, maybe even sounds like you. either they go to random place or they go to same place and you say both are macros - contradiction maybe or maybe also where they go to proves nothing.2. \"ui macros\"-how does that work, err idk. there are alot of people who are always on. that doesn't make them macros, that just makes them fans of eve. alot of people log back in after downtime. are they all macros. sounds like you don't like people who mine for too long because you don't have the time or the stamina or desire to do the same, so you want cpp to get rid of that kind of behavior. \"warp to diff belts (or not)\"-includes all miners."
"\"exact ammount of time in a belt\"-any dedicated miner likely falls into this category. then you go on to contradict yourself by saying that sometimes it's not an exact amount of time, but it actually varies, hmm... sounding more human as you continue, i.e. your argument is falling apart.then we get to the real reason - money. some group of people is cutting down on your profit margin and i bet it's some racial group you feel that is doing it.convo him-that proves nothing. is it me or does noone ever think to mail a person. if they have convo off and aren't paying to local, which i doubt many people actually pay attention to local. local is dead unless you are in jita and jita is mainly just some people trying to scam you into paying more for an item than its worth. oh and it's also possible they don't speak english, and since most people speak that language, they see no reason to have convo on. so they replied to you, but they still probably a macro. basically you seem to have your mind already made up beforehand that they are a macro. try convoing the head of bob or goon and if they ignore you, they must be \"macros\" as well. hehe.oh and the funny names, hmm how funny like from another country funny or like a random ordering of letters. if another country funny, then i think you are just being racist. macros mining in groups, hmm. neat trick. wonder how they manage that. sounds difficult enough just to do for a normal player, much less creating a macro to do it. i wonder if macros really do exist. its like everyone sees bigfoot and nobody can provide me any scientific evidence of the real bigfoot.maybe cpp isn't banning them is because they have no real evidence that such person is really a macro and besides cpp is a business, they want to make money and as long as that person isn't effecting their profit margins, i doubt they care. calling a person a macro user, reminds me when people used to call people witches, people they didn't like, which resulted in that person being drowned, hung, burned at the stake etc. usually because one person didn't like another person because they thought they were different, etc. maybe cpp doesn't want to take your word for it and not let people's biases effect how they run their game.highsec gank-arghh, i'm sure pirates would love that.and also for those people who want to shame others. firstly maybe you are wrong and secondly, if you really want to shame someone, why not put your own reputation on the line instead of cpp's. just create a website of people you think are macrominers and you can have your friends help you.honestly in alot of games, i've heard of so-called macro users, but never really see them. it's supposed this big problem, but i guess apparently no game company has found an effective solution against them, otherwise all companies would have followed suit. making macros must require some sort of programming expertise, which means only a few people could make them, so unless somebody is just offering a free download of a macro, i doubt many are actually using them.to conclude, i've only been playing this game for like a month, so what do i know? and yes, i'm currently in an npc corp. i was briefly in a small corp(2-4 people)and it got wardecced and i also got kicked out. another small corp tried to recruit me. he didn't want to let me join immediately, so he invited me to the corp chat channel they had. he did that for a few days and then he just i guess forgot about me. well the corp got wardecced and they were all were getting massacred anyways, so it wouldn't have been all that fun getting killed and losing 5m+ for dieing and getting podded. actually now it would be around like 13m+ now i have better modules and better implants and if i died i'd be stuck mining in a bantam again. *cringes*so unless some scientific way exists of proving someone is or isn't a macrominer, then i'm against banning a person based on someone's opinion."
"geeze anarich...type much? its like the great wall of text. i will however agree that you have some good points, if i am mining for some strange reason i am usually doing something else while i am mining, like surfing the net or something. but i do think ccp needs to try and find a way to make it more difficult for people to use macros.it would be cool if the eve client would scan for running macro programs, however i don't think that would be very welcome by the general population."
"i would really like a skill queue. i see so many short skills and want to have them train overnight etc."
"comon ! skill queue now !"
"signing this great suggestion"
"yes plz plz plz, im in the military and go on deployments where there is no internet, and cant have a friend update my skills cause its against the eula, so im a 5 1/2 year char with 44 mil sp's :("
"well said."
"who needed ghost training? and who needs a skill queue? eve is a game which continues in rl; even if it is just on you to adjust your appointments or skill plan to get it done right.i do not commit to this boohay."
"i endorse said product and/or service."
"hi, guys"
"it also allows you to negate that traversal easier (you don't have to stand still during a fight you know).you know that autocannons have even shorter optimal, do you.there are also other types of ammo than am.null has only got 25% tracking penalty, and it also gives you extra falloff, so you now have 2.5 times longer optimal range over am, plus 30% more falloff. i'd say it's a fair trade.also every other turret race uses long range ammo, sacrificing damage and tracking.full skilled ion optimal is 3.8 km with am ammo, and then you have 10km of falloff (lets say that half of it is usable range) so this still puts you at almost 9 km range, no wonder that a bc can out-track you if you insist on fighting in such close range.and which ships don't use plates and armor rigs these days?on bs level: raven, rokh, mealstrom, scorpion...any other?two out of those 4 are among the least agile ships in game (rokh and meal), scorpion is going to be far away in most cases anyway, so that leaves the raven...which is usually shield rigged and/or shield extended, so it improves your tracking (bigger signature). like compared to autocannons?so maybe it's not a problem of blasters not doing enough damage, but lasers doing too much?only if you buff large projectiles first (and buff them a lot)."
"mother****ing signed"
"using null (-20.3% dps) leaves blasters with still lesser optimal range than lasers (multifrequency) or torps, and doing significantly less damage with an extra tracking penalty (if the range and damage were the same i would concede the megathron's tracking bonus outweighs that)i do agree autocannons need work, at the bare minimum projectile ammo needs to be brought inline with lasers and hybrids."
"this isn't a thread focused on projectiles. if you want one, go start your own instead of trolling mine.that being said, my acs work great. and they don't use massive amounts (the equivalent of having several neutralizers pointed at your ship) cap like my blasters do.and my acs have plenty of falloff to be workable far past where my blasters can hit. i should know, i use the same guns.i also corrected my tracking penalty figure for null. i was thinking of void when i typed it."
"you were saying that blaster aren't good enough compared to other weapons systems, which i countered with examples of projectiles.also full rack of neutrons using am uses less cap than a single t1 large neut pointed at you,and when using null you also have quite a lot of optimal and falloff to work in.torps also require a tp to get full potential, or at least a mwd running on the target, which after the nano nerf isn't required so much, and their damage is severely reduced by target staying at speed.so that leaves us with lasers being too good, not blasters being too bad."
"ccp makes me cry with all the damn nerfs to anything thats anygood."
"signed! i did tons of testing on sisi pre patch and found all of this to be true. i recently sold off all of my blaster ships. i tried to use them after patch, but the one and only instance where they actually performed well was when several corp mates had the target webbed. even in my deimos i was unable to trap cruisers. the pilot simply put me on orbit and almost all my damage was negated. t2 ammo for blasters hasn't been viable solution for a long time. especially since lp stores came into being. when a blaster ship commits to a target it is putting itself in danger cuz it is within web, scram, etc range. it is a very narrow operating envelope. right now it is impossible to achieve the damage blasters are known for. the only easy fix i can see to this is adding a role bonus to webs for ships that are designed to be used as blaster boats."
"/signed"
"for 500 mil ship i support giving black ops a fuel bay, t2 resistances, and slightly increasing it's jump range. let's say to 3ly.my comment on this jump range boost that it's not going to make black ops more competitive with capital ships with jump range of 5-6.5 ly, but only more usable and useful."
"i find that the war dec system in eve is a joke all that happens is people leave a alt in the corp and jump ship to a newb corp where they cant be attacked. also you get 3 year old mission running carebears being 100% safe cos you cant attack them at all by any means now (ie lofty gangs etc) ccp need to add a new set of npc corps which can be war decced, say for example you get asked to leave the current invicible newb corps after 6-8 months and get moved to one of these war deccable npc corps which forces you to either join a player corp or create one, where you can be war decced etc tbh i expect a load of moans from these types of people - (they tend to just sit on forums and mission run all day) but chnages need to be made, people who sit in newb corps trading in freigthers, mission running etc need to not be 100% safe its unfair and wrecks the essence of eve and mocks the war dec system"
"agreed. been saying this for 3 years, too, but ccp strictly stands by the anti-eve style of play.corp jumping:war declaration flags should persist per pilot, following them into whatever corp they jump to (for the pilot alone, but new corp can support the pilot with the appropriate aggression flags) for the duration of that war cycle. the same should go for corps jumping alliances.npc homesteaders:newb schools shoul automatically shift all pilots to their appropriate npc corp after 6 months. npc corps should instil heavy taxes over time.also:newb schools - level 1-3 missions only. l3 agents quality max = 0. no mining barges. no industrial capital ships.npc corps - all agents max qualty = 0. no exhumers or industrial caps (freighter, jf, orca) but can be trained. +10% tax on all transactions (market, mission, refine, & escrow) per month in corp.these changes won't kill the game for any of the players currently hiding in npc corps, as it will create hundreds of new small corps & alliances that can easly skate under the worst 'war dec everything' radar of empire pvp'ers. but it will force the elements that everybody hates (farmers/macro-miners) out of npc protection where they can be hunted properly."
"/facepalmhere we go again."
"this has always been a good idea. imo new players should be allowed to insure their ships for 6 months and stay in the noob npc corp for the same amount of time, after which they are moved to a 'veteran' npc corp that is continually involved in factional warfare."
"for yea nano nerf boo whinersif any of you had played for any amount of time you would know that the nano nerf isn't a nerf, never used to be able to make cruisers 8000 ms.just a return to common sense"
"boo whiners? does that include all the whiners that did not have cheese to their \"nanos are overpoweredomgwtfbbq!!!1111oneoneone\"-whine?"
"having the support of maybe 3k players with a player base of around 250k doesn't mean you have the support of the while forum, just means you have the support of all the forum *****s.i for one support the the nano nerf, if you have to use speed and kiddy type play style to win a fight i feel sorry for you. stop your ship and slug it out like a man."
"/signedthis isnt a nano nerf, its a nano change. if you read what nanofibers do, they dont say anything about giving a speed bonus. make the nano nerf an actual nerf meaning reduction!. warp disruptors disrupt navigation systems that allow you to pinpoint a warp exit point therefore making it impossible to warp. mwds do not require pinpointing, but they give a massive speed boost, i dont see why warp jammers should disable a speed boost module. nerf the nano***s and maybe nerf mwd speed boost but these changes just dont make any sense whatsoever. i think a large portion of the playerbase wanted a nano nerf but is all this really necessary?"
"uhh, im not playing eve if i log on just to change skill/ market orders. to me it only counts as playing if i leave the station that i was in. i would really appreciate skill queue because it lets me plan them better. there are also ppl who go on a trip somewhere without internet and they would be disadvantaged by a short queue."
"i agree, it's pass time for a skill queue change.i had to do some serious work arounds at work just so i can connect, reset my skill and logoff.all for a skill queue and possible a web accessible interface to change skills on the fly without loading the client.side note - i also usually stay logged in when training a 'short' skill just to save the hassle. not playing, just logged in."

"supported too :)thumbs up:)"
"supported :d"
"do want it"
"i would like to know if ccp will give us the option of mixing different race/faction modules, i doubt it since it would be an insane load on the server, but if it was possible i think it would really add to the eve experiance and further ccp's goal of more player generated content.i wonder if ccp could put together a combinations program that would take all of the modules and find all of the different combinations and store them on the server, it may help reduce lag if ccp does let us mix modules since the server would already know all the ship combinations...just a thought."
"hmm sounds like frigs would be a great way to start this action, don't think a frig is going to make the game totally unbalanced , maybe start w 1 frig that you can customize for each race , emm and skillset , have to be frig 5 , have to be frig construction 5 ,mm let see race specific rank 5 science skill to 5 too ."
"its five sections and five options within each section hence the 3125 combinations. from what was said there will be race specific graphics meaning we're getting at least 12,500 new pieces of art - more if npc's start showing up in their own versions.ship sizes shown varied tremendously dependent upon what options were used.with all of that arriving in march i'd imagine it's unlikely they'll be extending it to give additional options any time soon. besides - the various bits of \"tech\" has to be found first :)"
"this is most true, i will have to train up on my explo skills so i can go find a wormhole to barrel down into :-) maybe the modular ships will be classless?...since, as you mentioned, the sizes of the ships varied depending on which modules you have...now i am even more curious to see how ccp will do this...i think i am more excited about the modular ships then i am for walking in stations :-)"
"this issue hurts... ]"
"after reading all the whines about csm (again) i think people would be much happier if the csm was disbanded?thought same happened when the battlegrounds were implemented and that made people sad (panda). now it seems they have adopted?but this is the 2nd csm and people still whine so it makes clear that there is only one possible solution: to disband (obviously corrupted) csm!people do know what is best for them!"
"the zoo called... they want there banana's back./me thumbs down/me reports spammer"
"people will always whine about things, its a fact of life, however i believe that the csm is doing more good for our community then it is hurting it. they do practically shove our good ideas down the dev's throat, which is somehow, twistedly satisfying :-).....in short, not supporting."
"hello star,i like the base idea, making the ships less of an omgwtfbbqpwn ship and more of a mobile deployment and outpost. if the devs could work around the problem with ctd and such, it would be an excellent idea.the reason it isn't like this now is the coding, and if that changes, i see no reason this couldn't be implemented. with the smaller drone bays, where would all the fighters be?"
"hey bunyip, that's the point of the mothership re-design, the fighters are in the sma, docked in the station, they are the players of the alliance/corp of the pilot, those who chose to fly around with him, who are able to jump/death clone into him at his hour of need.. if he gets tackled in a safe spot and is miles away from anywhere, as long as he thought ahead and had a load of ships left in his bay by folks, he has a valid defensive force that can come to his aid. if he has no friends, didn't plan ahead and fill his ship with ships or simply doesn't see the attack.. (afk ftl) then he has to rely on up to 199 ogre ii's, sentry drones or pure luck. eve 0.0 pvp is all about the multiplayer after all."
"tbh i had on mind bit different direction, tho you have some good ideas. as i said this is very touchy issue, and requires lot of inputs.i will post some of my ideas in next week or two after csm starts working."
"this is exactly the kind of zomgwtf<U+FFFD>berpwn-mobilestation-thingy i would lika motherships and titans to becomeabout not launching fighters from the ms though.. maybe docked plots could launch fihgters from it like the 20 guns on the titanhate to say it though... if this was implemented they would have to remove every single ms/titan ingame and reinturdouce the new ones with twice the price tag..... or ask all ms/titan owners if they whant to pay for it again to not have theirs removed lol"
"fighters are overpowered, i like the idea but it's better to have people undocking to put their ships in harms way than sitting inside the super tank putting more dps down. right now this mothership, as a solo boat is about as powerful as 4 insanely tanked rr domi's with eccm and good drone skills, relatively harmless against most fleets.. with docked pilots with ships, it's a mobile pain wagon like you've never seen before. :-) yes, that's an interesting point. why would the new ones be more expensive though? they're not exactly cheap to build as it is. they could just replace them with the new design. if they wanted to bump up the cost, what they could do is either add a temporary \"reprocess\" function to the capital ship maintenance bay to allow you to turn them into their base components, you lose the rigs but get the huge amount of components it took to build them back to put toward the newer ship."
"okay then, by the same logic, there's no problem scheduling it for 9 pm gmt. (then you'd really know why i'd kinda like to see it changed!) will do and thanks - this is exactly the sort of info i was hoping for.good point.nope. simply don't have the time to wade through quintillions of forum posts for something that may or may not be there. (a decent frickin' search function for the forums would be excellent.) in any event, you're the one saying this has been done to death before, the onus is on you to demonstrate you're correct.thanks all for contributing. this is definitely shaping up as a no-hoper. and i'm fine with that, accusations of dimwittery notwithstanding! (gotta love the drive-by 'lol u r stoopid' remarks. the fine art of debate at its best.) i'll look at those figures from fanfest and then (probably) come back here and officially deep-six this."
"yep, this is one dead dodo.came across this before i found that fanfest presentation. but it was enough to determine that:usa: 37.3% of subscriberseur: 41.5% (defining \"europe\" as including russia)aus: 3.1%oth: 11.0%so even if only 10% of the europe subscribers were online in the 15:00-17:00 gmt space (the only time that looked remotely viable), then every single australian player would need to be online to have a hope of making it a fair swap. even then, it would be annoying 4% of the player base to make the 3% that are australian players happy. this is nothing like a convincing case!i concede. damn you, world! don't expect me to come and fight for you in the next war!"
"eve already is one big grindfest."
"ok i'll be that guy. i like this idea so long as the bonus is kept very small. why wouldn't actually using an object make the learning curve faster? ccp (and players) keep saying they want there to be some difference between playing and not playing, well here would be one example."
"holy **** a supporter, you must be my alt."
"/facepalm"
"i'm support this! with the new system while you active and currently training example a weapon skill what you use atm (ratting, or pvp), the skill training should go a little bit faster. so you want to get bs lvl5? set training and go out ratting, or pvp. training wont be 30+day it will be 25."
"i like the idea, if it maybe gives a bonus like a +1 implant or so, so nothing big.it would be good for new players, so they see a sense in theyr first weeks of playing, while skilling frigs to 5 or mining barge to 5, or so.atm there is no big thing during this time, they can't make big money or so, they simply wait for the next skill."
"stop whining and just go play wow!."
"your mother says hi."

"you're fat like scarlet."
"you just lost every bit of respect you had in this channel...i think its time you moved on and left... before you turn it into crime and punishment spam thread.... and get yourself banned from the boards."
"no wayeve is a special due to a number of reasons and the skill training process is a very big part in it. do not waste it. its balanced and working fine."
"i agree with these ideas."
"about one third of the world's flags are tricolor, and half of them assymetric. there are a lot of small, nationality based corps in game who would like to express this in the decorations they are creating for their members. besides, tricolor and assymetric badges do look cool. unfortunately, when designing the ribbon part of the medals, all patterns you can chose from are symmetric along their longer (vertical) axis, which makes it impossible to design proper, tricolor ribbons with one color on one side, another color in the middle and a third on the other side. i think this request is not very difficult to fulfill: all that needs to be done here is adding a few more patterns to the ribbon customization list, patterns which have a stripe on either the left side, or the right side. the current color selection and pattern layering mechanisms would allow the medal designers to use these new patterns to create proper tricolor ribbons."
"while the idea might have merit, i don't agree with your justification (rl world flags?!...)"
"scagga, you are from the uk, you cannot understand that part :) but even if you do not really agree with the justification, the concept of tricolor badges could still be something you support... i mean tricolor looks quite alright."
"of course i can't understand that part...i just didn't think this would be the first item you'd write up as a proposal on the assembly hall! it probably would look 'quite alright', but that imo is not a good enough justification for the csm to spend time on it. could you justify it in objective terms as to why it is worth the time to deliberate, escalate and put into action?"
"scagga... dude... bitter much?seriously... lighten up.this is a place to give ideas and suggestions.... and its an bloody good idea.is it earth shattering? no... is it something that deals with the largest issues on the table? no.but its something good and a boon to those who want to give a \"mission badge\" as opposed to a medal of honor. so long as they are not as expensive... maybe half the price tag.... and make them generic enough to be not so fancy.and yes.. i think this is a good idea.even if its overshadowed with other issues... all good ideas should be given there fair shot."
"no to any more ability to shove your rl nationality and/or religion in someone's face via corp emblems."
"a medal is not something you \"shove\" in anyones face. it is something ceos give their members as a token of acknowledgment for their deeds. it is pretty well hidden in the decoration tab. i mean, you have to click 4 times to get to the medal itself. it is not like if i would ask for the ability to color my ship red-white-green. a lot of corps have been using all kinds of design guides to provide a uniform look for their appearance on forums and ingame. assymetric ribbons are definitely something that would allow a better implementation of these design guide for the corporation medals."
"#ERROR!"
"imo they need a vast increase in the number of art objects available for corporate logos as well as the badges. considering how much... stuff they're going to implement with their secondlife project (stumbulation) then it would only be logical. enabling 3-d objects as a part of the corporate labelling and badging would also be appropriate."
"counties colors aside, i would like to see more patterns added to the ribbon list, including assymetric patterns. i have been designing a few medals for my corp and wish i had the option. i would also like to see more items to make the medal out of, maybe some jolly rogers, skulls, larger swords (single, crossed, and otherwise), maybe even some more colors to choose from, but one thing at a time. :-)"
"well, i don't think i have to say much more than my country has a tricolor flag."

"drone alloys and mission loots takes away from real miners, they have to train 15 mill sp and then work for peanuts, simply because everyone else can do what took them a couple years with just 2 mill sp.mining should be a profession, not an afk option, let the resources be extracted by real prospectors. let minining asteroids appear in random places and not available for macro miners.and still supporting"

"mmm funny < i have had several falcons wtf bbq\"d ,um i would say if your having so much success vs players w your falcon that you need to step it up a notch and fight some good pvp'ers ,also i have been able to drive off falcons plenty of times , and lastly one should always plan on having a falcon counter in fleets"
"falcon got 100% chance to remove 1 hac from fight with 1 module is this balanced ?"
"yes it is as when you fit eccm you prolly won't get jammed at all.so basically it's all about your fittingsone mod to jamone mod to counter itseems very fair to me"
"yep one mod to lower change to aprox 60% + lag + locking time mhm about 3 sec to shoot at thing ? = 1-2 shoots per minute."
"as i said im not botherd about rooks, scorps. cause we can fit agianst them. we do fit eccm but i wouldnt like to waste a mid slot on everyone of my ships just incase a falcon shows up. eccm is not 100% effective and if the enemy shows up with 2 or more falcons it still closses down our fleet.if im in a 10man fleet and a falcon appears from no where and jams half our 10man fleet its like half my fleet not being able to jump into the fight in the 1st place.you guys are the whiners who say there balanced. there just not. they need sorted."
"says the pot calling the kettle black.stop your griping... seriously.... they probably had some additional skills you didn't have... or they...or anyone that fell to the attack."
"as annoying as he can be, the guy above is right.falcons are not broken, they're doing exactly what they were intended to do.what were they intended to do?shut down half of your 10 man fleet! yes, exactly that, it is their sole function and they can do nothing other than that one function. just as effectively as a single lachesis can prevent them from locking beyond their own shadow or a pilgrim can drop their guns down to effectively zero range.the fact that the pilgrim can also neut as effecitvely as a bs or that a lach can shut your mwd down from 20 or so km forces these ships to balance one of their ew functions in favor of another.the falcon has no secondary ewar capability, they just jam. they do it well, and from decent range, which is their sole capacity. thus, they are balanced in lacking the second ew function (likewise with the rook), ability to damage a wet paper sack, or tank, or deploy drones."

"please consider a new ship for the next release: orca ii** ore compression **fittings:5 high slots5 middle slots3 low slots3 rig slotscapacities slightly larger than orca i but well below rorqadditional skills:mining director ivastrogeology vcommand ships idid i say ore compression? that would make this ship something to die for.jmhothanks/fly safe"
"i bit early yet for a t2 variant.ore compression (1 slot) would be quite handy.enough hangar capacity to store at least 2x bs would be better yet.oh, and t2 only get 2 rig slots..."
"so don't make it a t2 variant; there are 3 levels of t1 ships in most factions and classes, we only are asking for two levels here as the ii would have ore compression. could live with 2 rig slots, as long as we can have ore compression.agree the ii should have increased capacities all around; not sure if storing other ships besides barges and exhumers would keep it as an industrial.jmhothanks/fly safe"
"is it just me or are people trying to make the orca into an roqual (sp?) a bit too early?it's supposed to be a compromise with some bonuses."
"currently the orca is your jack-of-all-trades ship, and does pretty much all of its roles commendably well... that is, except for mining fleet support *lol*.it can haul mass quantities, it can haul fitted ships (a bunch of 'em! if they're frig sized), it can tractor from insane ranges making it an excellent wreck scooper too.really there doesn't need to be additional tiers of the thing... it's ace as it is. all i'd want is more maneuverability/speed, 2x bs in the hangar bay (or an equivalent number of smaller ships), and enough cargo to haul around a general freight can's worth of 'stuff'.note: anyone know just exactly how much one of these things can actually haul when it's been max cargo fitted?"
"so csm guys. i post this above text in features and ideas discussion thread on the forum discussion. but i'm pretty sure that you have more power face to ccp to make changes or improvements on the game. my suggestion is as follow:it is funny to be pos gunner, but it would be a lot more if you could incorporated the kill perform by pos gunner on somekind of killmail that could be used by most killboard on the net.it would be funny to see how much damage a pos could perform on a large combat fleet that is trying to get tower in reinforced.so pos gunner, would it be nice to be rocognized on kill board. at least you will have skilled gunner for an other reason than just help your corp gazgal jin"
"any other comments? suggestions?"
"you would have to be smoking something to think ccp would actually consider giving isk to players, they hardly replace ships when losing them was ccp's fault. i am with you on the life is busy thing, because it is, i don't have time to sit and run missions all day. i do however live in 0.0 and making isk isnt to bad and certainly isnt boring, bagging 1+ mil isk per bs rat keeps me happy, and i get to watch pretty explosions :-) not to mention the occasional pvp op with my alliance. i don't make tons of iskies, but its enough to keep losing ships doing stuff i enjoy :-)ccp won't even give players incentives to report macro miners, eula violations, etc... even if we did like the idea, ccp would never go for it."

"heh.rooks are generally considered to be inferior to the falcon. that being said, you didn't answer my question. is the rapier overpowered because it shares ewar bonuses with the huginn and can warp cloaked?i never said damage was important. i did, however, point out that your assertion that the falcon loses nothing in exchange for its ability to cloak was erroneous."
"rooks and falcons obviously suck because they can't wtfpwn things like every other recon. hth."
"seriously? that isn't a joke, you seriously think that?"
"yes. i truly believe the ellipsis is a legitimate punctuation mark."
"according to most english handbooks ellipsis are. /shrug"
"a falcon can't shoot its way out of a wet paper sack. it can't fit drones to chase away pesky inties if it can't jam them. it maneuvers like a slug making it ideal sniper bait, and dies amazingly swiftly to a salvo or two.so, the falcon sacrafices any ability to actually do anything other than... the one thing it does, and does well: jam.darn near every other cloaking recon can actually kill something if they choose wisely."
"14,5 racial jammer strenght vs 14 hac sensor strenght are you serious that im unlucky ?:d"
"yes there is, instead of having 10 dreads, you need only one, and then you can have 9 carriers and or mother ships. i feel that dreads do not do the amount a damage they should do. it takes 2 and half hours in siege to take down a large tower.plus, it would be fun to fly, and i know tons of people would be like, \"omg i wish i could buy one of those\". i feel it would fill the same role as a mother ship is to a carrier.how much more can a mother ship rep over a carrier when in tri mode."
"no, thats a reason to fly it. i asked what reasons there are not to fly it. what reasons are there to disadvantage this ship? in other words, what balances it? as for \"dreads not doing the damage they should do\"... what? why not back that up with more than a \"feeling\". they already do more (more than double) than any other single ship in the game. they already are used easily, even by smaller organisations, in enough numbers to single-cycle a large control tower (10 minutes). these are two good reasons why they do plenty enough dps. what reasons are there to make a bigger, better one other than \"it gives another thing to train for\". because where does that stop? do you make another one after that, and another, and another? how big is big enough? why isnt the dreadnaught big enough?as for \"the same role as a mothership is to a carrier\"... what role? there is no role. motherships are a bit useless since they got balanced. they cost 20x a carrier for ten more fighters and ew immunity. thats not a role, thats just a bigger version. ccp have said that they'd love to make them something unique and interesting and special, but havent defined that yet. zero. motherships and carriers have the same bonuses to remote reps, the same ability to fit triage mods, and while they have better cap, its not enough to be running lots of extra reps alone, let alone in triage. they have one more highslot, but also the ability to fit two more modules (remote ecm burst and clone bay) plus people are more likely to fit more smartbombs and a cloak as protecting your 20bn toy is a fairly high priority."
"i think you best ansured this question your self by saying.....mother ships do not risk using the tri mode because it increases the likelihood of the ship getting ganked. 20bills down the drain (14 in minerals )so if any one wanted to use a siege mod on a flagship then it would greatly increases the likelihood of that said ship getting ganked. i'm willing to take out the 50% reduction timer if that's the only other thing that your really bothered by now.but the 125% damage bonus is there because i feel the ship should put out the amount of two dread with out having to siege thus making it harder to kill ( but costing 25-30bills to build a ship that dose 2 times the dread damage with out siege is a little much just for that little plus).so how about that. if the 50% reduction was taken out, would that make you happy or just start going on about trashing it from another angle?op revised."
"oh no, why combat pilots get all the love?"
"so instead of presenting a reason for this short-sighted atrocity of yours to exist you turn the tables around, accuse us of things we didn't say, and now we are to jump the hoop you made up?what you proposed is a ship that, for all intents und purposes, counts as 10 other ships without any downside to it. why would anyone want to have such a ship in existence? if, as you say, a tower siege lasts for more then 2<U+FFFD> hours .. only guessing of how many dreads you are talking about then, where's the good deal to have it last 15 minutes instead? on top of it .. at the moment you need a certain manpower to fulfill the purpose of a cap fleet operation .. with your thing you have the same means as said cap fleet operation with suddenly lots of cap pilots to spare, for example you could have your 10 dreads in one ship, and 9 carriers to remote rep the hell out of it and each other.the game we play has some sort of balance to it, the one you are dreaming of has less so."
"i don't believe that's true, this ship has even more risk of loss then a mother ship or a titan because it would be stuck in place for 10mins. that's what gets dreads killed in most capital engagements.so planting your 30,000,000,000.00isk bulls eye in the sand yelling at people to come kill it, that's completely unfair and un-kill able? i think not, isk vs reward."
"ccp wont add any kind of cap sized combat ships stop losing ur time"
"isk vs reward is a player demand, not a ship design philosophy.anyway you make the usual assumption that something worth xy isk should balance out something else that's xy isk, or that something that costs 10x xy should be far better than xy in itself.the truth is, col, that if this atrocity of yours was to be implemented, it would replace one dread in manpower, but 10 dreads in firepower. so you would have for example .. take 10 players to get the damage of 10 dreads and maybe 9 carriers worth of remote reps. you wonder whether i'd stick to the sand? hell yeah .. two of those are a cap fleet all by themselves, the peeps formerly known as dread fleet are either landscape now, or remote repping the \"real\" damage dealer.don't forget - this thing would pop other dreads fast.btw. we are still waiting for the \"why\" of this ship .. and no, \"wouldn't it be awesome to..\" doesn't count."
"so your argument is that because seige mode is dangerous people wont risk using it? then why have any seige mode on it at all? double dread damage with no seige tank, but ability to warp at least starts to approach balance.you keep on avoiding the question:what is it for? other than having a big ship? dreads are big ships, why isnt it big enough?"
"a) you admit there yourself that this ship would be grander than a titan, what ccp have stated will be the biggest ship they'll implement in the game.b) you contradict yourself there, you gave it a 50% reduction in siege module cycle time. 10 min - 50% of 10 min = 10 - 5 = 5 minutes.and seeing that this thing is huge, has a siege module, all of them, iirc, have lvl bonuses on resistances, and that the nine now-free cap pilots will undoubtably be flying remote-repping carriers ... it may not be invincible, but it's gonna be damn ****ing close.also, i'm beginning to suspect this idea was put up as an excuse to argue with ppl / annoy ppl ..."
"this is very true, but can also be said about the tri mod for carriers. why have the ablity to fit it if the risk is to high. at least this ship will have a little more incentive to fit because of the higher dps output over a dread. risk vs reward. its our choice whether to fit one or not, but at least we would be able to chose.well why do we have a mother ship class of carrier. what purpose does a mother ship serve that a carrier could not other then being a larger ship that can not dock but is immune to all forms of electronic warfare. whether you hate the mother ship class or not you must see that there is a missing ship class when it comes to dreadnoughts. please read all op revisions before posting your thoughts and ideas about this ship, thank you.this is not an argument, this is a discussion brtween members trying to hammer out details about a proposed missing ship class in the dreadnought under score. if you feel annoyed but reading this thread then feel free to not post or read at all."
"both dread and carriers fit siege/triage modules. the only difference is that siege module provides such immense boost to firepower, using any other module instead of it just stupid. sometimes, fc on the spot decides not to go in siege for whatever reason. my point is: not fitting siege module when you can and have free slot for it is not an option, it's idiocy. that monstrosity of yours will always fit it, and may or may not use it just as dread. because mothership can provide several functions that are not fit for lesser class. cloning bay, remote ecm burst. furthermore, ccp themself claimed on several occasions that they are not satisfied with motherships just as bigger carriers. your \"ship\" is just dread on crack, nothing more.he obviously did. inconsistencies in your proposal and other statements are obvious.edit: so, at least you removed %50 timer reduction. i missed it too. nvm. guess why is everybody hammering it. it has more than 12 times firepower of a dread. 2 times, if you comparing it non-sieged vs sieged dread. not mentioning ewar immunity (lol), no siege penalties (omg lol) and ability to be remote repped (roflmao).edit: typos (dread != dead)"
"it was off the record because it wasn't officially on the agenda at that point in time. when it is officially on the agenda it will be \"on the record\" and you will have the complete details of the discussion."
"look you have used an 'off the record' conversations, that we can't independantly verify, as proof of ccp's actions and then you tell us that we can't be told about 'off the record' conversations until/if they becomes 'on the record'.please do yourself and the rest of the csm a favour and before posting, pause, think and triple check your facts because when one member of the csm posts it reflects on the rest of the csm. and the whole csm structure is already under a sustained attack by nay-sayers and forum bullies. remember the old saying ... \"please don't feed the trolls\"edit: okay before the wrong end of the stick gets grasped, as a csm your post carry a presumed weight of authority with the playerbase, irregardless of any lack or substance of real authority. sadly (and quite stupidly) we expect people who put themselves forward for election to be whiter than white and to never put a foot wrong. i doubt that i could personally live upto such high standards and i also doubt anyone will give you the benefit of the doubt when you prove to be human and screw up. such is the life of an elected official .... even in an internet starship game."
"*cough*"
"well, that among other things.fact of the matter is that if ccp was genuinely interested about player's opinions, all the pr stunt would be relegated to the second stage provided they give priority to substance over form and appearances...i mean come on, i could ask one of my programmers to design a polling system based on a postgresql db model and a rock-stable codecharge-generated web app in a half-day, and ccp can't come with a thingy like that in what ? 5 years ? and we are talking about an investment of less than 300 $ ?but yeah, it's way more efficient to put a bunch of peeps in a chat room to talk for ages about who does what, when, where, how, trips to iceland and all that sh.., while at the end accomplishing a poor record of representative objectivity since most of us simply can't be neutral even if we try...useless crappola imho."
"actually i responded to a specific example that was given. a gentleman specifically said item x wasn't being discussed. i merely responded to say it had. not every conversation that is had needs to be published. if you don't believe a conversation occurred then that's your bag. i'm not going to lose any sleep over it. thanks for the advice though."
"guys..get real:this whole csm farse was just another ccp's way of trying to limit whines on forums..they know that 30+ page topics with opposing oppinions to what ccp is doing arent a good showoff how they (don't) listen to playerbase.they managed to get 25% of whines into other section under idea that things are getting done and that we will forget about them sooner or later..csm thingy is just another crowd manipulation tool from ccp to keep us more calm about stupid changes or stupid nerfs of strange bugs or whatever they are not capable of repairing or using more brains to come out with some better solutions (nano-nerf for instance \"broke\" more things that it fixed..).i voted in first csm mandate, then i kept eye closely which things and what stuff is going to change with \"representative body\" between us and ccp..well..nothing changed!so..this time i just didnt bother..and all those: \"vote for your csm today..\" commercials were pretty annoying.."

"you know what it is truly that is represented by this case, is that regardless of the fact that this is a game or that you are \"in-game\" or \"out of game\" is not really the point. regardless of the fact however stupid it may be the goon alliance has openly declared war upon the honda accord. regardless of their motives or because of elections i am brought to the same conclusion of real life, and that is 2 things,war and politics go hand in hand &war and peace go hand in hand. for that i believe that both these points are valid to the goon alliance. still regardless of why or not it has been declared simply knowing as to why it has been declared would be nice but unfortunatly rests upon the commanders of the goon alliance to tell us there \"reasons\" for declaring war or not. i still hope and believe that there can be a peaceful resolution to this situation but i will make my self perfectly clear, in real life i am a soldier, i do not back down from anyone, i dont care weither i die or weither or not i live, i serve my country. the same applies for me in eve, i am still a soldier, and i will not back down from anyone regardless of the outcome. harassing and insighting weakness upon others is in itself a sign of fear of conflict and being a coward. those who do not insight these kinds of weaknesses do not openly mock others for what or who they are, they simply enact upon their orders. with this said i will humbly ask once that those from goonswarm stop \"predicting\" what we may do, because if this is your accurate prediction of what we are doing, your intelligence divisions are clearly not doing their job properly.still upon this i will ask that the leaders of goonswarm listen to common reason, and as i see it there is no true reason why war should have erupted other then to whet the appitite of those who hunger for battle.j.a. hardertadakatsu-obata corporationthe honda accord"

"i'd certainly like the idea to change my name, so long as there's an 'aka' tag attached, and that all records of the past name update automatically to the new one...i can imagine the server load that would cause.i'd also like to be able to change corp names without disbanding/reforming the corp. currently i run one of the oldest corps in eve and want to maintain the employment record/age of the corp but it's name is no longer particularly pertinent. :/oh... and the idiotic name that's screwing up my browser settings: cut the idiot's name in half or ban him."
"i would like the idea of allowing name changes, as long as your character sheet lists known aliases and locator agents are able to locate people using their former names. you would have to give every character a (hidden) unique identifier and change a few bits of code to not break buddy lists etc.employment history should never be in scope for anything like this, nor standings."

"threadnaughtf******ing ccp - half an hour typing a post and *poof* stupid authentication screen wipes it."
"idiot authentication should remember your input when it decides to dump you back to the login screen...anyway, changes to t2 should be (at a minimum) -a - remove all nerfs that affect the ship as a whole (speed, cap regen, ect) and limit any nerfs to a per weapon only case.b - reduce existing nerfs by 50-75% (or eliminate them altogether, current faction ammo does more and has no nerfs).since t2 do not require any skills to use allow all pos sentry systems to use t2 ammo.change t2 missiles: rage - increased rof, no damage bonus, 50% flight time.fury - damage bonus, identical flight time as t1precision - increased velocity, explosion velocity & radius. no damage bonus. reduced flight time to equal t1 range.javelin - +50% flight time, +50% velocity.torpedo explosion radius & velocity for all types needs adjustment to make them bs weapons again - with quantum fail their damage has been reduced against bs considerably, making them only capable as anti-capital weapons."

"that would be interesting. supported."
"trust me, they lose the total \"cool\" thing once they get destroyed and you are left without any dps. doesnt sound \"cool\" now do they. missile launchers do they same thing and you cant destroy them and they always hit.there are tons of things for missile users.um, drones are a primary weapons system and they are part of the current combat system, which (btw) works pretty well now. lets try not to continue treating them as secondary and start treating them as a primary weapons system that many players have great interest in."

"some of the best fun i had in eve came as a result of the efforts of the old event team. we mostly make our own fun in eve, but a little bit of well thought out interaction can be a massive catalyst.involvement in storyline adds value to gameplay in ways that simplistic npc ai (and simplistic players to be harsh) cannot hope to compete with."
"this would get my support as long as these events happen on weekends or during the us tz. one of the problems with the old events is that players in the western hemisphere could only read about them while still at work/school. without any assurance that we have a chance of inclusion, i don't really care if events come back."
"if someone saids somethign if ther eis such action, that perosn or ppl, use macros and they get fuked uppd: i did check times when i see somoene that i think is macro minning. so yea i did, and not because im bored, is because im tired of them."
"people who are unable to access the internet for periods of time due to work, military commitments etc.and if this gets implemented it doesn't mean you have to stop adjusting your appointments and skill plans."
"naaaowww, please :)although i joined the game partly because i could train while not subscribed/online."
"i was wondering why we dont have salvage drones, they'll be extremely usefull. no?"
"you can not force people to play the game the way you want them to, you can only force them to stop playing.ccp is a business. they exist to make money for their investors. eve is just a means to that end. forcing people to stop playing is not in their interest."
"while i can understand that avoiding wardeccing might be a bit easy, it should only be changed when wardeccing system is changed. because like it or not (/me gets his flameproof suit), wardeccing is pay to grief atm. for 2m a week you can harass a mining corp for as long as you want."
"this i support"
"how is anyone being \"forced\" to do anything?"
"this.all your promoting with another one of these ridiculous proposals is a massive zerg of 1 man corps."
"all ccp need to do is create a 20% noob corp tax level.they also have to ensure the level for \"non taxable earnings\" is set so that complete noobs won't be affected but older players running lvl3s and 4s and such will be inconvenianced.this incentivizes older players to move out of the noob corp so as to be able to earn in line with other players."
"you want to war dec players in noob corp, why?to grif them? why? you have personal grudge against someone in noob corp? suicide gank them and if you don't want to do that and still want to hurt them go get some fresh air outside and manage your personal vendetta elsewhere.@suggestion of taxing noob corp members, if we do that can we also give them almost all other benefits of being in a corp like if someone stole from a container/wreck of a noob corp member other noob corp members can hunt the thief down and benefits like that?thing is if people are in noob corp long after the character creation , it could mean many things like player are being harassed by people like you and only option they have is take shelter in noob corp and by doing this they are loosing way too much like the benefits player corporation members have. it could also be due to many other reasons so why not try to find out those reasons instead trying to make them leave the game and enjoy the game with all the player corporation members only while ccp is getting bankrupt due to all the canceled subscriptions."
"with two of the csm in noobcorps, i don't think you'll get anywhere.as for the actual reasons why i oppose this idea, you can look in one of the similar whine threads about this topic.and wardecs are indeed a joke, ccp called them pay-to-grief for a reason. what exactly do you expect that happens if a band of pvpers decs a defenseless industrial corp? and what's the point of deccing and ganking individual npc corp players with a blob? it's just senseless griefing and won't get my support."
"i personally don't want to wardec noobs.i think there is a serious mechanic fault that lets griefers hide in untouchable organizations when \"real corp\" griefers can be wardecced and punished for being annoying."
"if i wanted to be in a player corp i'd be in one (i'm a returning player, i could go back to my old one, the people i gave my old characters to offered to return them), but that's not what i want out of the game right now. i'll join a player corp or start a one-man when i reach the point where i want to do something that the existing restrictions on npc corps don't permit."
"i'm not saying that there aren't griefers and macroers in npc corps, as that's obvious. what i am saying is that players should be able to play this game the way they want to, even if it means solo.i've played the corp/alliance game, and it's not for me. the politics and wardecs are a headache to an industrialist. i don't think a 5% or so tax is going too far, but 20%+ taxes? please.if you don't like players being in npc corps, give them a reason why your corp is superior to npc corps. if this idea is implemented, we'll wind up with a ton of one-person corps, and a ton of lost subscriptions from ccp to go along with it."
"i disagree.players who find themselves 'capped' in npc corps (not booted out, just capped) will eventaully get fed up with the cap and move outward to progress upward. from skill-limited learning corps to earnings-limited npc corps to unlimited, uncapped player corps.so what if we get a zerg swarm of 1 man corps, the game can handle it. you'll also get zerg swarms of 1 man alliances, so be it (put minimum starting membership numbers on alliances to limit the number of zergling alliances).i'm not saying 'kick them out', nor am i saying 'make them war-declarable', just give them incentives to expand, or disincentives to stay. currently there are none. none, at all, whatsoever. yeah, so they can't erect a pos in empire, wow... big deal. that's pretty much it.and your classic 'macro' farmers won't leave, making it easier for ccp to find out who they are and deal with them. macro farmers in pc corps can simply be declared against... just make sure the flag sticks to them, otherwise they'll jump corps every 48 hours (101st, anyone?) to avoid any and all combat."
"well its say it all really doesn't it the two csm members complaining are carebears, let me guess you fly round in freigthers or a golem and laugh as all the people who want to kill you. kicking / overtaxing noob corps wont mean for the mission bears that they instantly get war decced it means people have a chance of war deccing them. it ruins the whole war dec system when people can shift into noob corps to hide why should mission runners be 100%. tbh i wish the max quality of agents in high sec would be 0 generally to force people out of high sec kinda like roid types try (but fail)to doi admit i war dec mission runner to kill them but why the hell shouldn't i be allowed to im only one man, i war dec 15 man corps, so in theory they shoudl easily be able to kill meits just the fact there scraed they might loose theirs iskiesif you dont want to do this then bring back the lofy mechanics. its unfair that these guys are 100% and spend all there eve life in these corps while piracy in low sec isn't great"
"as originally posted here.the current situation: currently several roleplaying channels exist within eve that act as a bar (famous example: the last gate), a gym, a club, and many more places that borrow themselves well to social interaction. the problem: with ambulation the idea seems to be that these can be converted into 3d environments, footage of fanfest shows us a bar for example. this means that if someone wants to visit a place, they have to be at the location, which just might be on the other side of the cluster! or worse, faction warface / sec status means you no longer can go to your favorite places. not to mention that certain stations will be very crowded (jita, anyone?) while others will be very quiet. this practically forces anyone that currently runs a channel to move to some trade hub or other popular system.the solution: the roleplaying community of eve seems to agree on the existance of holoprojectors. a holoprojector is a device that is installed at the destination, which you can connect to from a remote location, and projects a 3d holo of yourself that can walk around and see things from first person view. others can see your holo and interact with it in a limited way. ways of implementation:owners of a bar, corp office ect. can purchase this device and install it, upon which the service becomes available.holoprojectors are a station service. this may require you having been at the station before, just as with clones.the interface:players can connect to a holoprojector from their pod. additionally also the captain quarters, through the computer present there. while the user interface is visibly everywhere it would not make sense that you can control a holo while randomly standing in another station hall. not to mention all the \"spaced out\" pilots would look really awkward! this defeats the whole purpose of the suggestion as well.when a player connects he loses the view of where he originally is (so be careful in space!) and takes over control of the projection. in game mechanic terms this would be zoning into another area and applying the holo graphics (transparence and such) and limiting the interaction to walking/speaking. could perhaps play the minigames as holo too. having a drink however won't be possible"
"supporting myself, of course!"
"or just use a chat channel.if you're too lazy to go somewhere why should that be promoted?shouldn't rp be serious business?"
"this isn't just about rp. it is about making sure all stations will have people in them. certainly if this becomes a station service. think of the benefits for your own alliance for example. you can have the ceo's and directors of various corps gather in one station through this and have a meeting in style, rather than a boring old group chat."
"stations will have npcs in them.if you weant to reap the advantage of hanging out with your friends in avatar you have to pay the cost of actually getting off your ass and going their.ambulation is not designed so that people who never undock can play second life in eve.it's a social tool that is to work with the res tof the game.so you want to get to that high stakes poker game in lowsec? you'd best move fast and avoid the pirates.really worried about not being able to make corp parties? have a corp party jump clone ready at the bar you use.it's brilliant the way it is being planned right now, and diluting it with mediocrity is not a positive move for it.i do not think ccp should waste hundreds of man hours programming holoprojectors and how they work because players are too lazy to fly their spaceship in an internet spaceship game.make sense?"
"i think that this is something that the developers should consider for the mid to long term development of the eve world outside our ships.i'm actually not too fussed about the roleplaying angle as it goes, i just think that it's a general point that ambulation will be a lot more useful if people that can't physically be at a place can still interact with the players that can. say your corporation are gathering in the corp office in pator, but you're still stuck over in some obscure ****hole like 9uy4-h and can't get over there. you still want to be able to be involved somehow. some kind of flickery low res holographic projection would be excellent (\"help me obi wan etc.\")"
"you have a point jah'ret khan, but not entirely. holo's should indeed be limited in what they can do, to promote moving around, but saying jump clones is the solution is not entirely correct. this means that you'd have to give all your clones implants and can only move back after 24 hours. which means you are actually limiting social interaction rather than promoting it.also i am suggesting this now because the dev team can easily plan it in. who knows, maybe they already got something similar planned? or maybe even better? it never hurts to ask, and not trying is always losing"
"another more real problem with holo projecting is stress loading on the ambulation server.the system as you explain it allows all 40,000 people online to \"holo\" themselves into jita at once.mass swarming and crashing these servers becomes too logistically easy.sure they could impose player limits ons tation ambulation, but do you really want to be excluded from the party because there's \"too many\" people in the station?wouldn't you rather just fly there and be guarenteed a place in the fun?"
"if 40,000 people are going to fly to the station then the system is going to crash as well, so that doesn't always guarantee a place in the fun. sounds like a good security measure though to limit the amount of holo connections. if only to motivate people to go to the station so they won't have to fight over a holo place."
"perhaps just have an interbus depot on the station, whereby you can ambulate to it, then take the bus to where you want to be?travelling on the bus to somewhere then also becomes a game in itself. perhaps others are also travelling, and you can talk with them on the journey?especially if there's a distinct route for the buses, and you have to change at certain stations to get a bus to a specific destination.ofc, the bus would take time and isk, and once you arrive you won't have a ship there, so you'd have to make the journey back before you could undock or do other non-ambulatory stuff."
"as a note, according to the first, old designs the maximum amount of people at a specific room is limited. as such, the 40k people in a single bar isn't a realistic scenario, and would be easy to implement in an in-character way, as well. (\"the maximum amount of connections to this augmented reality node have been reached. you're #29876 in the queue, please wait.\") there might be other concerns, though, like blocking people from entering by remote connecting to the location, though likely it couldn't block people in if every place has access to the elevators (assumed \"quick transport system\" around the station).also, there could be (optional) connection fees, also explaining in-character why people would want to invest to a holoprojector in their establishment. of course, if the same module is available for corp offices, it could have other uses, like having all the people in the \"same\" room for viewing tactical maps (or then the tactical map should be synced across different offices and/or inspace map views)."
"i'm heavily in favor of this, especially the \"as a station service\" option, as it would allow people to go to a remote station and move around the whole station. saying \"oh, ambulation only exists to promote off-ship interaction for people who go to the station\", and \"invest in jump clones if you really care\" actually would end up meaning \"empty stations\".it's a vicious circle, really. in order to walk around a station, you'll have to press a button or something to get out of your ship and walk around. if there's no one in the station, wherever that may be, save the very rare occasion... well, then you just won't press that button. if we allow some sort of mechanism for people to ambulate in other stations than the one they are in, whether it be via special \"ambulation clones\" or interbus or holoprojectors, then more people will ambulate. sure, there will obviously end up being hub stations that have lots of ambulation action, and others which do not. at least, though, the stations *with* action will have lots of it.seriously, think about it. if ambulation is tied to the station you're docked in, how many people will be in your station? i hang out in airkio a lot. it's not an empty system, by a long shot. at the same time, judging by the number of people in it, the stations won't be jumping. if you hang out somewhere in low sec, or syndicate, or any of the bazillion places where you're likely to be the only one in system? too bad. sure, jita will be hopping. think about the people it will be hopping with, though. you'll ambulate into a bar, only to see \"navy vexor, 80m!!!\" - \"seling cheep isk!!!!\" - \"orestes modified jock strap 800mobo\". is that what you want ambulation to be like?"
"this is an entirely different solution, but one i could also find myself in favor off. has it's own pro's and con's. as long as -something- is done i will be happy maybe you should throw this one up in a different thread and see how popular it is?also very good point there shinto, even with an access list on a bar that is going to become a problem. isk sellers also spring to mind x_x"
"agreed.there are so many stations that no one will be able to assemble at 'just one'.holo-projectors should enable a distant character to project themselves to a remote location, but they can only interract with the other people at that location. they can't work the market or contract systems from their remote location.yes, they could just use a chat channel or voice, and they will. but for the visual imersion some may want to 'be there' and remote projection is the only viable path to that."
"i agree. from early on, a concern that ccp must be aware of but hasn't talked about at all is that you are going to have a lot of empty stations. eve, populous though it seems, just doesn't have the sort of numbers that would be needed to populate these hang out except in specific, mostly high security, systems.this also promotes the entire fame/notoriety aspect that the single server architecture is so good at creating. making your place interesting enough to become famous won't help if noone will visit it and notice. for people with somewhat limited play time particularly, they are not going to want to take the time to travel to a location to hang out when they could much more easily use a chat channel. interesting and compelling though interaction via actual 3d avatars might be, it just wouldn't be worth the time investment.it would be a shame if something like this wasn't included. as it is a significant part of eve is waiting - but it is usually waiting in a specific place for a specific thing to happen. the start of the next op, the fleet being ready to move, the invention job coming off the line. ambulation is an ideal way to make that down time interesting by giving you something to fill it with, turning what was previously a flaw into one of eve's strengths. however it become untenable if you can't snap right back to the spaceship side when and where you need to.so make it limited, sure. but put it in so that we don't have a hideous mess in jita and a forsaken - if pretty - wasteland everywhere else."
"you're kidding right? i mean, you seriously enjoy that style of play? no strategy, no interaction, just click orbit, turn on guns, sit back and watch? do you realize that that style of play is exactly like playing fscking pokemon? oh, look at the lvl 30 vexor i have. i just ran into a lvl 29 stabber! vexor! i choose you! *walks away while they are fighting* *comes back* !!! you're vexor has evolved into a megathron! *logs off thinking about how awesome a pilot he is*ffs man, if you're going to play a game, fscking play it. get yourself into a pre-patch nano ship. now go out there and try to not get blown up. try to last 1 day. i think you'll find out that it wasn't the speed that kept us alive. it was us interacting with our ship, paying attention 100% of the time, knowing exactly what our job was within the fleet, and the communications between your fellow nano pilots in the gang. i'm not saying i disagree 100% with the nano nerf. being able to build a 25 km/s vagabond was a bit excessive. but, then again we spent billions to make that happen. what ccp has done has completely shut down any sort of speed build. and thus, shut down any sort of strategy beyond \"you stand here, you stand here, now start shooting, blob moar\". this also means the fun part of eve is also gone. if i wanted to play pokemon, i would have played pokemon."
"supported - only thing i would change is the irreversible stuff to be located right at the bottom"
"this would be an easy win change to make a big improvement.doesn't alter the fact that they need to really sit down and rethink the ui from first principles."
"full support on this."
"also add another confirmation menu for trash it, like for quitting corps"
"i really like the idea of something like a researchable techtree in eve.i don't like your idea of ressetting everything, when a defined amount is researched. thats unfair, why should my work be ressetet, when i spent lots of time to get there and others should get the same, for doing nothing?another idea could be that the techtree is like skills, with a maximum level. so new coorperation could get closer to the level of the advanced corps.and make technologie sellable, so they can get it by buying.sorry for bad english^^"
"while a tech tree is nice, one of the goals that i was looking at was to never have the competition stop. when you own a moon, anyone can come and knock your tower over. you need to continually be ready to defend your moon.but pvp mechanics don't work in production and research. blueprints and materials are safely locked away in stations. such, once someone sets up their research chain or acquires a t2 bpo, there is no way to knock down and take their efficiency.research typically fills this position where people are always making better stuff. but if we do this, then we have a number of problems as we go up in module tech levels. the first is that we can create a bunch of useless junk that clutters up eve. the second is that either newer players and producers can never catch up, or research stops and you fall into the old \"no competition\" problem. all of these are bad. if newer players can never catch up then we have instituted a hegemony of the rich and old. if research stops and we fall into the same problem we had before, we didn't meet the goal of being able to research your way to a competitive advantage.this is why the regression has to occur. ideally on all tech 5, 4, and 3 modules and blueprints. its to ensure that there is always competition for the highest quality modules."
"+1 for periodically resetting research ladder"
"a way to detect cloaked ships without destroying cloaking completely"
"recently i thought of a different suggestion, which i wrote up elsewhere. basically:- give standard cloaks cap usage- give stealthbombers bonuses to avoid this- the cap usage is proportion to the ship's sig radius- cap recharge stops when you cloak"
"i disagree the problem isnt people cloaking its people being able to check local all the time, remove local and this whouldnt be a problem as a pilgrim whould ruin that raven pilots day."
"i dont support this idea, but perhaps some sort of cloaking sensor array could be developed for pos's that would give a general idea of where a cloaked ship might be in a system (like around the moon of the 7th planet). something that allows people to find the afk player, but doesnt make it easy. my idea: if you are online but afk, you should have some risk just as if you are sleeping in a park in nyc with money hanging out of your pocket."
"same old, same old.cov-ops cloak = completely cloaked.improved t2 = sig-res reduced to 0.5%. ship is not *visibly* removed from space. if you're close enough to see it you can move toward it (bear in mind that a bs is difficult to see at 40km), but it's not on your overview until 'decloaked'.standard t1 = sigres reduced to 0.5 - 10% (dependant upon meta level), ship not visibly removed from space, only overview.ships designed for stealth (bombers, cov-ops, recons, black ops, blockade runners) would always be fully cloaked regardless."
"this is bull****"
"lol. someone has delusions that ms's are solopwnmobiles. they're not. trust me.also: isnt allowing them to carry hundreds of pilots a little stupid??? think how big they'd have to be lol."
"...and what happens to everybody inside/docked within these mobile stations when the mothership/titian pilots logs off?"
"read up, i've explained it in an earlier thread. you'll be safe but stranded in the station unable to do anything but chat, do contracts, play with the local market (skills based) change skills or jc out.you won't be able to do anything with ships, undock, or anything with station services aside from jump cloning out. if you are in the ship when the pilot ctd's or logs, unless he's aggressed,you'll get a 10-15m \"downtime\" style counter where you can do pretty much anything as if the pilot was there, including undocking, docking etc. but after the 15 mins is up, the ship disappears and you'll either be stuck outside or in."
"i like this idea"
"/signed this would be awesome."
"more corp divisions aswell!"
"good idea."
"i like this idea.. it is a space ship.. what sense does it make to be able to password a gsc and not a ship?"
"makes perfect sense, thumbs up"
"use a station, or put a password on your pos, or get a pos hanger... or don't leave ships in space...nay."
"of course it does, because everybody knows captain kirk evacuates the entire ship and crew every time they have an away mission."
"because of the use of 3rd world workers, its almost impossible to knock out rmt in a game from that end since those countries don't have the legal infrastructure needed to support the game company.so maybe its time to go after the other end of rmting, their websites. you can't buy isk if you can't get on the sellers website.now, what's the most effective way of knocking a site off the net? ddos.what does a good ddos need? thousands, tens of thousands of host computers, connected to a central server to receive commands.what does eve consist of? a central server with thousands, tens of thousands of client computers connected to it at all hours of the day.just include a tickbox in the options that states \"i wish to partake in the active defence of eve against rmt offenders.\" and away you go."
"/facepalmanyway, good luck taking ebay down by using ddos."
"dos attacks are illegal. you do not know what sites you are taking down exactly, as you kill the server, not the site. besides, those guys could just ddos back, i really dont wanna see that happening. not supported."
"so is rmteye for an eye"
"i'm no expert, but aren't those dos attacks illegal in terms of laws enforced by government agents, while rmt is only illegal compared to the game's eula?"
"the real world does not work \"eye for an eye\".ddos attacks are illegal according to country law, rmt is illegal according to eve's eula. there is a small difference in that.no support."
"no it's not, ******."
"there has been a lot of discussion in general forums about this lately - the current state of low security space and changes that might be made to fix it.the basic problem that most of us see is that lowsec does not offer an even minimally linear relationship between risk and reward. just as it is possible to make a decent living in highsec for very little risk, and an excellent living ratting in nullsec for substantially more risk (discussions of 0.0 carebearing aside), it should be possible to make a substantial amount of isk in lowsec.fixes that have been suggested (not merely for the purpose of km whoring. ):-higher bounty rats, at least bs sized. not as much as in 0.0, of course.-better ore, although still not as good as 0.0 quality ore.-moving agents to lowsec, primarily higher quality level 4 agents.-fix fw plexing. while perhaps not making lowsec more profitable, it would certainly make fw about something, which would be good.i am fully onboard with the first two, and would consider supporting the third. of course, it is unreasonable to expect ccp to alienate so much of their playerbase by moving those agents, so that doesn't have to be on the table.one thing i am very interested in is the thing on the drawing board called viceroyalties. if this was implemented correctly, so as not to draw on the static pos style sovereignty warfare of 0.0, it would have great potential. of course, to make lowsec more profitable for yourself through being a viceroy, there has to be profit in the first place. please don't flame me for simply \"wanting more targets\". i'm not a pirate, although i have been, simply for the reason that piracy in lowsec isn't piracy, it's pvp. that's not the point. the point is that lowsec has potential to be a place free from 0.0 drama and gatecamps, be the last bastion of solo pvp, and still be a place where one can turn a tidy profit. i would appreciate it if the csm could at least put this on ccp's radar, and make noise about at least one character being interested in the viceroy system."
"not a bad idea...also not bad...agent quality is already based about sec status of a system so just by going into low sec their quality is improved. really what they should do is improve on l5 make them more lucrative than l4 missions while doing them in a gang while also making sure to promote doing them in a gang(being in groups makes people feel safer).meh, i like the plexes as they are, they act more like a beacon where you can find some fights.should also look at vastly expanding the amount of research, invention and copying slots in low sec this would promote people going out into low sec as there is a lot of demand for that and you can do most of it in small ships that can get past gate camps which will make people of course not be so damn scared of low sec all the time."
"i am also concerned about lowsec, and see the logic behind your proposal, but i see problems here. i am afraid that your proposed changes would not bring more people to lowsec, it would just create wealthier low sec pirates/carebears. you have been referring to the reward / risk forumla. right now this formula for low sec is way off. i consider lowsec to be more dangerous for the individual than null sec, because they are not among friends. and reward is lower than in nullsec. so... in order to bring the equation right by improving the reward, i think reward would need to be improved so drastically, that it would kip the balance of the game completely. to compensate for the riskyness of low sec, rewards would need to exceed those of 0.0, which would be just not right. i think reducing the risks of entering low sec is the part of the equation we should take a look at. maybe also boost rewards, but its the risk part that ruins low sec for almost everyone trying to make a living there right now."
"the key to making lowsec easy is having friedns.the game needs to promote group activities in lowsec.making lvl5s more lucrative is a good start.increasing station facility availability is also good, as lowsec production can make a killing.belt ratting and minerals are fine as they are.maybe more high end lowsec exploration sites would help too."
"the difficulty with low sec is that it's too dangerous for what you get. most folks realize that low sec is, for all intents and purposes, more dangerous than null sec simply because in null sec you're functioning in a (poorish) player operated variant of empire.one of the cautions to buffing low sec, without some mechanism to prevent it is that if low sec becomes too lucrative, the 0.0 empires will simply move in on the areas nearest their space and push the pirates out or absorb them. while they won't be able to claim sovreignty, there's nothing stopping them parking a fleet in there and running an nbsi program as long as they do it with low security standing toons.if the viceroy system comes into play, ccp will have to be careful or all the viceroys will be alliance leaders or officers.one thing that might be desireable is to come up with a way to make low-sec a place for corporations to reside. in empire you have a lot of solo toons and some new corps doing missioning etc. in low sec you can move your corp in to some marginal space and set up those things you'll eventually need to move out into 0.0 without being an existing alliance lackey. perhaps several corps who were successful in low sec could form an alliance and then move out into 0.0 to either stretch their wings and claim their own area or as allies of an existing alliance.there would also need to be room and opportunities for the small gang and solo pirates and pirate corps in low sec.just an idea. making things more moneyed isn't going to bring many folks down from high sec. you're more likely to get an alliance fleet and a bunch of dead pirates as the space falls to some null sec power and can never be taken away save by some other null sec alliance force."
"as you said yourself. the risk/reward is off. the way to make the risk/reward better is to increase the rewards.if you increase the rewards more people will come. how many more people? i don't know, but it will be more people.if you want to move people into 0.0 and low-sec we need to drastically increase the amount of production resources that can be harvested in both areas on a personal and immediate level.hopefully sometime in the week, i will get a chance to post some things regarding low-sec missions and a general issue of 0.0 wealth. but he is right. more rewards = more people."
"agreed!"
"when you research a bpo in eve, there are two features designed to stop abuse at public labs:1) no multi-run jobs can take more than 30 days2) if a job is canceled, the slot stays busy for the original duration of the jobthese two measures are very good and practical for public labs in stations. however, a mobile lab or anchorable factory should not have these options forced on them since they are corporate property. if i want to do a multi-run job that takes 60 days or 90 days i should be able to so. moreover, if i want to cancel a job i should be able to use that slot immediately. right now i have to unanchor and then re-anchor the structure to do so.i would like to suggest making the maximum multi-run job duration something that can be set by the ceo or director. in addition, i would also like to see the availability of a slot after cancellation something that can be set by the corporation."
"i like the 30 day job limit, imo. i like the idea of a corp slot opening as soon as the job is cancelled, but it should be logged who cancelled the job!what i don't like is the fact that you have to shuffle stuff all over the place to use them.imo the control tower should store all of the materials used by its anchored structures, and they should have a large storage capacity for 'goods'. all of the structures should draw from this resource pool and dump products back into it.look at a standard lab... 2 invention slots! can you imagine the hair pulling when you're inventing at a pos? or the manufacturing array (thank god they have more than 1 build slot now!), ammo manufacturing arrays, ship arrays, drone arrays... *gasp* that's a lot of needless logistic lunacy.give towers:small - 500k m/3 material storagemedium - 1m m/3large - 2m m/3faction - +25% to +50%also, when the tower goes boom it drops its storage just like freighters do (goods are dumped to a single static hangar such as 'deliveries' and then go to loot)."
"the entire concept that the drone regions is based on is horribly flawed. drones need to drop something unique and useful to the game (advanced drone parts for awesome t3 drones?) but *all* minerals dropped from killing targets needs to be removed from the game, regardless of security.no more base t1 loot in missions, named only, and reduced named drops, drones need to drop something else (again, advanced drone parts, similar to salvage, used to create new types of drones).minerals need to come from *mining*. wtf is the point of people mining when their efforts can be equaled or exceeded by others with no mining skills/equipment what so ever?"
"exumer 5 with all the t2 crystals, but not deep core mining, is about 5 millions sp. what are the other 10 millions sp?"
"damn my 4 votes didn't go in vain :)"
"give drones bounties, tags, or perhaps more of those drone parts to build the customized drones from. i have always understood these are underused and very expensive."
"lachesis does what now? you seriously believe that?lachesis' damps have an optimal of 45km - when you damp anything with it you get ****d by drones. when you damp multiple ships you get ****d harder.ffs, the falcon has three ewar bonuses to the arazu/lachesis one.as it is the arazu/lachesis aren't good for anything. they can web/scram someone but don't have the scan resolution of a interceptor or the tank of a heavy interdictor. they get a 25% bonus to hybrid damage but - nothing add 25% is still nothing. and on a *good* day using 3 phased muon sensor damps, with signal suppression v and 2 inverted signal field projecters you can do what a falcon can do with one ecm module. of course, five seconds later you'll get ****d by drones unlike the falcon which is sitting 200km away.yeah, f that.i'll agree the falcon isn't broken the day my arazu can shut down half your 10 man fleet. you want the 'secondary ewar capability' - you can have it. take the dps with it - it's free../end rant"
"falcons are overpowered ... if you don't prepare for them. there are plenty of modules and ships that can mitigate or eliminate a hostile falcon's effectiveness, but most pilots refuse to use them. you can't consider a ship overpowered if there is a valid counter to it. saying that falcons are overpowered when you don't use eccm makes as much sense as saying that interceptors are overpowered when you don't use webs or warp scramblers."
"falcon should be left alone.1. eccm needs to be made more applicable. you get nothing from fitting eccm. except a little bit of protection against falcons...-eccm should literally be a 1 fit autojamfree mod per jammer. 1eccm neutralizes 1 jammer. 2. arazu + sensor damps cant operate at real distances. often needing to be 50km or so from your target. 1 sensor damp really cant mess up a person. unlike a falcon who with faction jammers can really ruin your day.-the counter to sensor damps being sensor boosters which are fairly common.-sensor damps simply need to get a -1 locked target effect per damp. this would better cause issue.3. curse often not being able to use heavy mods; and due to the nos nerf... you have a real problem fighting against cap boosters. which are fit to the majority of pvp.-perhaps giving a fitting bonus to curse so it has the option to fit 1-2 heavy neut-nos.4. rapier.... ya lets nerf this. minnie scum dont know anything and cant do anything.edit/...why is sc-um word filtered?"
"i think you should just shut up. seriously: shut up.you have said nothing that hasn't been whined about, answered, and argued to death. you're a worthless troll deliberately posting flamebait.tl;dr: shut up"
"oh look, yet another person who believe that the way to fix his broken ship is to break everyone else's.why would you think that? why? are you one of those people who when they injure themselves, makes theself feel better by hurting someone else too, rather than being more careful? what is wrong with you?wait: don't tell me. i don't want to know. you should just shut up as well."
"\"falcon got 100% chance to remove 1 hac from fight with 1 module is this balanced ?\"not true. i prefer to use range rigs + 1600mm rt so i cannot jam a hac with 100% probability (signal dispersion v). facts: with a racial jammer i have a probability of about 78% to jam an non-eccm ishtar up to 198km (with rigs & ecm range skill at iv).so either you whine about falcons with 100% probability of jamming an non-eccm hac or you whine about ~200km jamming falcons."
"i will quote myself"
"read it again champ. then show me which part of my post is about changing the falcon in any way. mhmm? you fail!if you hadn't noticed i'm asking for changes to the arazu/lachesis to bring those ships up to the level of a falcon. take away the hybrid damage and give me sensor damp optimal range instead. note: i'm not asking for more damp strength, i'm asking for the ability to damp someone from a longer range.oh, and one last thing: read more carefully next time. don't put words in my mouth and don't flame."
"there's something in thisespecially the range, and the ineffectiveness of eccmadded, there prevailance in gangs of all sizes is stunning"
"don't you think that's a little high?"
"nooooo.having run into lachesis/arazu *fleets* back when damps could shut essentially any target down to sub-10km lock range i can say i was more than pleased that they got damped.did they get damped too much? i'm willing to conceed that perhaps they did, you don't see them in massive mobs any more. but then you also don't see damps on everything either, which you did for quite some time when they were the 'uber fotm' module, likewise only ecm specialized ships bother with them anymore typically.also, ecm works better from range than close, a mechanic i don't fully understand (i attribute this to the sensor strength falloff calculation similar to the one that scan probes use).falcons are force multipliers, they're not a foce unto themselves unlike the amarr/minmatar recons, and yes the non-cloaking gal recon as well. the gallente needs to be brought up to viability, rather than neutering the caldari.ever faced a scramming, damping lach with a short range ship? they're pretty painful in solo engagements, even if they only plink you - being nibbled to death is still dead. yes, drones do them a lot of hurt, but they likewise cause problems for min/amarr. all of these ships can engage you... the falcon simply can not.as the csm guy said: falcons cannot win a fight alone."
"\"don't you think that's a little high?\" basically \"thinking\" about ecm jam probablity is reduced to personal feelings :-)we all know arguments from both sides and although we know those arguments everybody feels right in his view :-)no i do not feel 78% is high, considering that this (typical) hac is not hardened against ecm. imagine attacking a ship with a resistance hole to your ammunition type. your attack will hurt him a lot.add a eccm and the probability drops down to about 39%. thats a sensor strength of a average recon ship. every time a recon ship with little amount of dps attacks me in my falcon, i run. i run because i know, i have a 60% probability of missing a jam cycle."
"pimping my idea ittthe idea:switch the falcon's optimal bonus for a falloff bonus. this means that jamming chance will decrease as the falcon gets further and further away from the target, creating a risk vs reward trade-off. the falcon pilot would have to pick between being closer and jamming more, or being safer at distance and failing more cycles.****this is only for the falcon not the rook****the bonuses: caldari cruiser skill bonus: 10% reduction in ecm target jammer capacitor use and -96% to -100% reduction in cloaking device cpu use per levelrecon ships skill bonus: 20% bonus to ecm target jammer strength and 60% bonus to ecm target jammer falloff range per levelnot ideal to move the cloak bonus onto the cruiser, but better than putting the ecm strength bonus on there imo. this will also mean that it's easy for all falcons to fit probes, take that as you will.the numbers: all jam % chances are done using 12.20313 strength racials despite the fact that fittings would probably change, i'm just too lazy to figure out what the new strength would be. edited the numbers, this is taking the 60% per level falloff (but accurately calculated )i have no idea what rita zechs is on about in this post so i'm just gonna round down to 1 before running falloff calcs which means @ 100kmhyperion = 43.9% iv // 45.2% vthorax = 67.3 % // 69.3% tristan = 82.8% // 85.2% @ 150kmhyperion = 26.7% // 29.6% thorax = 41.0% // 45.4% tristan = 50.3% // 55.8% @ 200kmhyperion = 16.2% // 19.4% thorax = 24.9% // 29.8%tristan = 30.6% // 36.6%for reference, jam chances in optimal (81km for racials) look like this: hyperion = 53.1% thorax = 81.4% tristan = 100%these new numbers look low to me, anyone else want to comment? the edits:"
"any changes that pushes a falcon into anyone's engagement envelope = removing the ship from use, period. just like the fate of the arazu/lachesis currently, and with web changes has pushed the use of rapiers/huginn down considerably.if you want to shoehorn them into the sub-100km envelope they should be considerably tougher than they are currently. likewise for the lach/araz & rapier. they're paper tigers that make a deimos look solid. if you want to force them into the hac roles, make them as tough as hacs."

"not against submarines, no...fof and defenders need to be fixed, in a big way.defenders... need to provide a defense screen. currently they can't hit anything that's fired within 40km simply because of the way they work. you can't fit very many in any sort of launcher that can make use of them (rocket launchers hold like... 10?).fix:shrink defenders to the size of rockets.give them rocket velocity and 'direct impact' flight mechanics (rather than the flyby and 1+ second 'redirect' to hit the target).don't reduce their damage, however. due to their rof, even with rocket launchers, they really don't do a lot to incoming dps, especially from multiple attackers.fof missiles - currently they're one big joke.fix:-- increase fof damage by 25-50% above targeted, because you're spamming these things and there's no way to focus on a single target except in a solo situation (and then they'll go after drones, too).-- remove the 'max range' on them (currently 80-ish with cruise). removing the 'max range' can also be a viable counter to the current whine-target: the falcon (or other potent e-war boats).imo fof's should target priority objects 'affecting' the launching ship (e-war) and if none go off after random hostiles."

"so you want rorqual?rorqual has ore compression and can go everywhere but high sec. while high sec has no need for ore compression."
"i give up, because you have consistently failed to come up with a single reason why the ship should exist. the argument that its \"missing\" because presumably there needs to be a tier 2 ship in all classes is utter junk. plenty of ship classes dont have more than one ship in them - freighters, titans, logistics, hictors, dictors, destroyers, marauders, black ops, jump freighters, the list goes on.secondly, you try and pass this off as a real reason by saying \"well otherwise why do motherships exist\". i've already adressed this point. there is no reason for motherships at the moment. they dont do anything special. ccp have said that they want them to have a real role, and are looking into it. why on earth would they want to make the same mistake twice in introducing a ship that has no role differentiation from the smaller alternative, but is an incredibly overpowered version of it, which is then inevitably nerfed (which is exactly what happened with motherships).i'm not going to bother asking you again what the role of the ship is, if you are going to try and claim nonsense like \"its a missing ship\". it just exists in your head, in fantasy land."
"so you want me to say what, kill towers and capitals, that is a given, and yes, its the same a dreads but way more risk and power with that risk.this game is a \"fantasy land\". one were you can't kill my dreams, but my dreams can very much kill you(i just had to say it)"
"hmm, i dont think u can do anything in this way..its still ccps look onto u guys and what they should do with ideas u supported..and its not like u can demand from ccp anything, and tbh, i dont think they give a f*ck if anybody from csm would sign in resignation in case chosen thing doesnt go through..like i said: just another crowd control tool..ccp never got any intentions on listening to our ideas, be it directly expressed in suggestions forum or via csm support. but they managed to get some of those whines into \"readable\" topics and into some queue with big large \"maybe we will listen if u get enough supporters\" stamp onto it..good example was that thread about against nano nerf and \"whine\" from bellum about blasters beeing useless now.."
"why not give the new csm a chance to prove themselves before spouting such counter-productivity?"
"because it threatens those who want to return to the 'he who whines loudest and longest wins all' days, in the mistaken belief that that is actually how it worked before?"
"i'm just curious - some of you opposing the csm, what exactly did you expect from them? they're not magicians, they're not full-on ccp employees, ccp hasn't ceded decision making power to them. those of you whining about the nano nerf for example - do you seriously think things like balance issues should be put to a vote? that'd just split the camp in two, between \"i fly a nano ship\" and \"i got killed by a nano ship\", neither of which have any real relevance to the issue and how it affects the vision of the game ccp has. there are some things that are just going to be beyond the player's control, and new balance changes are one of them. now, if the changes have been in play for a while and serious issues develop, then bring those issues to attention and you might have some success. i look at the csm this way - at absolute worst, they're changing nothing and it's all a waste of time. but really, whose time is being wasted? ccp's time? they're running the csm again so clearly they feel it's worthwhile. the candidate's time? there were several candidates who have run again, so clearly to them it's worthwhile. now, at best, the csm is capable of bringing ideas to ccp that they may not have thought of - thousands of heads are better than the few they have there, and it's natural that the players will think of things that ccp just may not have even considered. whether the ideas are accepted or rejected, it's a good thing that they're even being heard.sorry for this wall of text, but it's just so silly to see strong opposition to such a harmless concept.just because your pet idea isn't being pushed through doesn't mean nobody's listening."

"it's good to see you working on your ideas - i look forward to them turning into proposals. the areas they are addressing are quite important."
"/warning long long verbose post and i can't be asked to spell check or check grammer neither /endwarning\"the 2nd poll will define the (ir)relevance of the csm\"perhaps not, in fact i doubt that even the 3rd, 4th or even 23rd poll will define the csm.now before we start and while the trolls are still hopefully reading, i believe the csm is a good thing a very good thing, i just think it's implementation was misjudged.ccp's attempt to bring the players voice to the table via a democratically elected panel is revolutionary, but is doomed to irrelavence as no revolution gave birth to it.i feel, and i'm sure you'll all argue with me at length, there are two problems standing between the csm and it's defining moment. but before we get into that the first question should be 'why does it need a defining monment'?democracy, in all it's varied guises and shapes, has always been a solution to a problem (and not a solution to every problem) and that problem has always been ... being uncomfortable. forget the right to free speech, forget the right to self-determination, for get human rights and justice. the main, and in a lot of cases the only, concern for most people is simply is their life comfortable or not. give someone enough food, shelter, recreation and the slightest glimmer of being able to fullfil their material dreams and you can have any form of government you want.so typically democratic insitutes evolve because enough people are uncomfortable with their lives to over turn the exsisting order. i cannot personally think of a single instance of a dictatorship sponsaniously standing down in favour of a democracy. in all case either internal or external focres are applied to remove the old problem, internal pressure being prefferable as when democracy is externally forced upon a regieme it often leads to failure, if you want examples just turn on any news channel.this application of force, and from now on i will only be talking about internal forces not external foces, are galvenised by a defining moment, a moment that brings unity and resolve of purpose, without this catalyst the odds arn't in your favour. as a side note these defining moments which bring a nation together are also temporay, if you don't believe me look at election turnouts for almost any '1st world' nation and you will see a steady decline in voter turn out since the time the ability to vote was won.you will probably argue that eve has had that defining moment. you'll say something about alligations of gm's aiding certain alliances etc etc etc. but in doing so you'll be ignoring one main fact, that incident did not make the playerbase of eve any less comfortable than they already were. it was a scandal and a disgrace, but more importantly it only eaffected a small, but vocal, minority of the player base. you'll no doubt agrue how it affected everyone, but the reality of the situation is that if the majority of the player base beileve that what they can see harms them.so no defining moment has occured and we have a csm structure waiting to rise to the occasion when it happens, and it will."
"my second point follows on from an observation in my first point. only what you can see can harm you, or inversley what you cannot see cannot harm you. so the second major stumbling block to csm relavence is visibility to the playerbase.at the moment the csm has only really two ways to communicate with the playerbase en masse, either by the forums (which is a two way procress with the csm and the players being able to communicate with each other) or the web page (a one way process, realistically information can only be distributed via it). this i suspect is a major barrier to the csm being able to communicate in a meaningful way with the playerbase.i strongly suggest that the majoirty of the playerbase (if not the vast majority) have not been to the forums, and those who have have read enough never to return. i would also suggest that the number of players using the webpage on a regular basis is very small as well.again i'm sure figures can be provided and explain as to why this is not the case, although most of these figures will range from the down right wrong to the wildly innacurate.therefore for the csm to become 'relavent' (and i use that term loosely) to the vast majority of the playerbase the csm itself must break the stranglehold the forums has on it's operation. the how and why i leave to well meaning people with even more time on theor hands than i.once these two problems are over come the csm will come into it's own and have an opportunity to shine bright in the lives of the playerbase, until then they will toil on under near constant and unwarrented attack, doing the best they are able to do with the limited authority they have."
"well after the last csm took \"credit\" for the suicide ganking nerf i'd say at absolute worst they will be listened to and we can look forward to such excellent ideas as bunyip's alliance deployable gate guns in 0.0."
"bhutan did in 2003, iirc."
"i can't really disagree that this is how the first csm worked, but we're working to change that. i've already implemented a channel where i can answer any questions/review ideas on forums/hear new ideas. i can't guarantee that the other candidates will join me on the channel, but the csm is still a diamond in the rough, being refined and improved.fyi, the channel is called csm chat. feel free to join it and address any issues you feel deserve it to me and perhaps my other candidates (it's up to them). the csm does have some minor power, but we need your input on ideas and other issues before they can be instituted.tl;dr: don't throw us out yet. let us prove our capabilities to you as we refine who and what the csm is and it's relation to the playerbase."
"ccp is attempting to promote within eve a souped-down version of representative democracy limited to consultative views when and where it pleases them, which in turn is just a mass delusion deflecting the impact that eve login polls could induce.i'm not against the csm because it exists, if folks have enough free time to spend like that it's certainly none of my business to tell them if what they're doing is a futile exercise or not. i'm against the csm as concept aiming supposedly at bringing ccp closer to the player's opinions on a variety of issues. it's pr plain and simple since there are much more cheaper and efficient methods suitable to provide extremely precise results and on a much wider statistical base.but the problem for ccp is that integrating login polls would create a relatively factual and documented set of data about the majoritary opinions of players on the issues at hand, and they would run into trouble as soon players would significantly diverge on a given point from ccp's position. what would they do ? release the data without taking into account these opinions later on would sunk their image. release the data and later on take into account these opinions would create a precedent where players would expect said degree of compliance on every major issue. perform the poll and not release the data would induce suspicion, etc...that's why you folks get the csm. it's a convenient solution when you don't really care. interested players get the illusion that they can somehow influence the game by conveying some opinions, and ccp reserves the right to care about the csm like the socks of their office cleaner grandma.there are plenty of consultative commissions in rl, either in private or government spheres. unfortunately, in most cases, these commissions are just a waste of time and resources. anyone thinking on problems without enjoying the tiniest shadow of executive authority or guarantee that his opinions will be considered is as efficient in the achievement of a concrete solution than a guy making crosswords when pooing. you may have fun at it, but that's it..."
"one can argue that about any major implementation of democracy, but then i also tend to beileve that centralized democracies are the route of all evil, but hey that's just me.ignoring the faults with the system i can't enirely agree with you here, i believe that the csm is a compromise between the two interests. i find it hard to believe that ccp are capable of so cold, cynical and ultimatly logical thinking as to purely create the csm for pr purposes, as any company capable of think in such ruthless terms would at least be able to release a bug free game couldn't agree more, but then were talking about a buisness not a government and at the end of the day ccp has to do what's best for ccp not the player base, although bare in mind that there interests are not always mutally exclusive.but once the system is in place it can be altered, potentially for the better, and lets face it the old adage is true 'there are no guarantee's in life'. as someone very intelligent to me once said .... \"it is easier to change something from within than to do from without\""
"issler, i understand your angst in this situation. ccp has said that wardecs are essentially a pay-to-grief system, and i concur with that judgement.as a csm delegate, it falls to us to tell ccp our ideas on how to improve this broken system. goons will be goons, that is inevitable. now you know one of the reasons i remain in an npc corp."

"so what ccp think actually about this concerns? are you satisfied with the nerf and think that its all balanced now or there s still someone out there who pay attention on what ppl moans about?"
"disagree. with the nano nerf, even with the missile rebalance is no longer possible to speed tank missile ships nearly as effectively, you wanted a nano nerf, missiles needed balancing too, you can't have your cake and eat it. if you wish to shoot at a smaller class use the approapriate t2 ammo/use drones.get out there and play the game, then report back."
"hmm seems like you didnt read or understand anything from what is written on those 15 pages.. we were saying that we were not able to hit targets of our size with max dmg.. = bs vs bs or bc vs bc etc.. even not only equal sizes but we even do crap dmg to moving targets bigger then our ship's size (this is with maxed missile and spaceship command... and i already reported back if you go a few pages above.. now you go play the game with what i play with and report back"
"i think the changes are fine, the missile nerf was needed given the way speed was nerfed. i have an alt who runs missions in a raven, and i can't say they are more difficult. now this thing about doing max damage to ships of the same class. in a turret based ship the only way i do max damage is if they are sitting still, which should hold true for missile users, and does hold true under the current nerf."
"i have been playing for approx 4 year, almost solely pvp, most kills with blasters and drones but also use lasers and missles.i sign this petition as the nerf was completely wrong and made a whole weapon category useless."
"yea, sounds boring and tedious beyond measure. alot in this game needs automation, which would greatly increase the enjoyment of the game. but i guess that is the price you pay for one of the biggest money making devices in the game."
"agreed.pos managment is a chore that i would not wish on the most dedicated miner.anchoring anything once the tower is in place and online should be defined by the character's anchoring skill, or starbase management skill, or something. you can anchor (or unanchor) one item per level of skill. subsequently the supporting skill would reduce onlining time.also, introduce fuel rod blueprints. 1 for each race. each 'run' of the blueprint would produce a fuel rod for 24 hours (of a standard pos) and reduce the 'size' of the fuel load by no more than 10%. you will still need to bring the 'consumables' for powergrid, cpu load, and starbase charters, but the raw fuel needs to be made a whole heck of a lot more logistic friendly.oh! and for the love of jove make enriched uranium fit into cans! i hate nothing worse than trying to lay aside my next duration's fuel in a can only to be told that i can't fit my uranium into it."
"i understand that ccp intends to make drastic changes to the entire soverignty mechanic... but until then -don't decrease tower anchoring time, just increase the number of items that can be anchored at a time once it's in place.once sov 4 has been achieved limit the possiblity of anchoring towers to corps with +1 to the soverign alliance.if two forces are at war, or have negative political standings, increase anchoring time for the faction that has the weaker (non-existant) soverignty status. and put up a beacon in local that lets everyone know what's going down (for the soverign alliance only)."
"pos deployment. we hates it! yes..precious!building on the idea of predeploying a pos:pos-in-a-box.you basically get out into space and 'prefit' the pos, selecting from a list of possible towers and structures. note that this requires no actual items. once you have your pos design all set out, you complete it, and receive something like a bpc or reaction, let's call it the 'deployment plan' or dp. you then take the pos tower out, and anchor/online it as normal, then drop all of the modules for it into a new storage space, along with the dp. then hit the 'deploy' button on the pos and watch all your pretty structures appear and begin anchoring and onlining, one at a time. once done, you can recover the dp from the tower and reuse it as much as you like.note that you cannot make an impossible dp, such as a small tower with 50 large guns. cpu and pg requirements will be checked during dp creation."
"add a tax to anyone in an npc corp, starting at zero and slowing growing to a maximum of 25% as a function of their age in eve. something like:1 month: 5%3 month: 10%6 month: 15%1 year: 20%2 years: 25%as long as the wardec system is so called 'pay to attack', npc corps should be 'pay to be safe'."
"currently it is too cheap to wardec a corp, 1-2m a week(basically free), even a starting account can make that. for that price a pirate or pvp veteran corp can cost industrial/mining/newb/small corp millions to billions. maybe if it was raised to more like 20m a week or maybe 100m a week. it's just too cheap. you force people into corporations, they are going to quit. some don't like the politics of corps or being bossed around by another. as far as macros and farmers, you won't be able to force them out. all they need to do is create another account and they could also still hide under a large alliance. the people you really are going to hurt are the non-pvp types and the new players and seriously at 6 months you don't have good enough skills to handle yourself out in the wild against people with 3+ years worth of skills. piracy is dead because there is no profit in low sec. it has the same value as high sec or less, but with all the risk of 0 sec. veldsar is worth more per m3 than kernite and all other high/low sec ores. and there isn't sufficient bonus in mission value for doing low sec agents. plus low sec doesn't have the sweet ores, moons etc of 0 sec. seriously if you want to go fight someone go to 0 sec and stop complaining."
"unless they enjoy chatting with random people in the npc corp.yes, you just war dec each macro pilot individually because each pilot is in its own corp."
"too true, too true. but finding 5 separate corps mining into 1 jetcan scooped by an orca in a 6th corp would scream: i'm a macro! perhaps ccp might get off its ass and take a look, follow their transactions.and i can make back my 2m wardec fee by popping just one of those macks, or just sit my alt in their system so that their macro keeps them docked while i go to work.imo they need to bring back the 'joining a gang with a warred party makes you open to attack' hole that lofty screwed up so brilliantly. that way when the orca tractors i can shoot it."
"1: taxation of a npc corp = stupidwhy: isk is too easy to make.... and the worst case scenario is you lose your playerbase. not to mention your bloody idea is biased and completely based on the fact you seek 24/7 pvp'ing and war-dec's up the wazoo.2: war-dec's are too cheap = factit's too easy to form a corp... mind your own damn business.. some hot shot corp see's 3 of your members flying battleships for the first time... they get war-dec'ed..griefed.. all in the name of \"fun\" but no one ever thinks of the other side.. and they call this \" its a sandbox... deal with it\" well sorry to say... most players don't think that way....3: this thread = stupid/repeatsorry... do a search... you'll see this is the 1000th time its been asked.all result in a no-win situation...the solution is lies in war-dec'ing itself... not the corps.i have no problem with war-decing...my biggest problem is there's nothing to stop the war-dec's from being stacked....repeated...and dumped on.. for the most utterly stupid ideas on the planet... other than smack talk or something \"rational\".and what is the most frequent suggestions made?1: you poor baby.... go join a bigger corp.counter: well gee... so no more new corps being made. so much for new stuff in eve!2: hire a merc corpcounter: got the money for that? we just started!3: ditch your corp and leave an altcounter: thats even worse!4: go to 0.0 space!counter: you just bankrupted us! thanks.... we can go to 0.0 on nothing.so yes.... thats just the tip of the iceberg of reasons... carebear or not.you guys need to find a middle ground or you will never get anywhere.yes there are exploits.... but punishing npc corps is completely wrong.you need to fix the war-dec system and how it functions.and you can forget attacking the macro problem... i don't care how you spin it... you will always make them stronger or short change the legitimate guys.start thinking 100 steps ahead of your short sightedness.put yourself in the shoes of the individual your affecting before you go off on some wild harebrained idea."
"actualy with rest of csm not in noobcorps, and few of us mentioning this particular issue in our campaign presentations, this issue will be aproached, but very carefully. we need to fix current wardec system, without allowing more griefing of noobies, but to prevent people hiding in npc corps for eternity. diversity we have atm in csm is great for issues like this when thoughts are drasticly divided. needless to say, that is allowing us to look at both sides of the medal and to aproach problem from every possible aspect."
"all this complaining about the war declaration system is bunk, just an empty excuse not to join the game as it was intended.noobcorps were never intended to be the ultmate umbrella of immunity, same for npc corps. it's a place to start offering immunity at a heavy cost for a limited period of time. pretty much every game system (solo or multi) have a 'starting zone' but to get very far in the game you have to leave the starting zone.npc corps offer the same immunity, at a similar cost, while you're looking for a new team or making a team of your own (even if it's an army of one).currently war declaration is far from easy, nor is it fast *hah*! you guys saying its fast are a joke... it's 48 hours, minimum, to initiate a war. obviously you've never declared one or paid for one on your own, or hired a merc corp.possible changes to the war declaration system? like what?last year i mentioned that we already have an existing system that could be modified to make war far more dynamic: the contract system. turn war into a contract, with counter-offers and other requirements that, when met, end the war in 30 minutes rather than 24 hours. currently any diplomacy has to be conducted on the meta-game level.make it more expensive? no! my gods... you've already limited the number of wars one can have by exponential costs (thanks bunches, privateers), and it takes 48 hours to get one going, and if your target doesn't want to fight they don't have to... they sit in station, log, or move. often times a war corp won't see a single member of a 200 man corp until 10 minutes after it lapses... or the targets just jump corp.that is a design that needs changing with any other changes to warfare... corp jumping to escape wars needs to cease. often times 'nuubcorps' are wardecced by 'mercs' because one of their nitwits smacktalks or steals... and that nitwit jumps leaving the rest of the corp to deal with their actions.another reason people who do war want people in declarable corporations is smacktalk and thieves hiding under the protection of npc corp skirts. there is currently no way to deal with them. having a nuubspy in an npc corp scouting you at a gate is bad enough since you can't get rid of them, but someone that hides in an npc corp and smacktalks all day long is downright annoying for anyone outside of 0.0 (and yes, i reside in 0.0, i have fought wars in all security levels, even fw).there are many reasons players want npc corps capped, many want them outright declarable, and there are no valid counter arguments to let them stay there without paying a cost for the immunity which is what they now enjoy."
"npc taxes aren't the solution - that ultimately just becomes a way to \"pay\" to avoid a large part of the game (dealing with other player corps). honestly there's no reason why anyone older than a few months should need to be in an undeccable corp. if you can't find anyone to run with at all in that time, then something's pretty much wrong with you, not the game. the only support i see for the issue is generally from the same type of people who don't want to deal with the risk of playing the game. it'll be a glorious day when those types of opinions are just ignored completely."
"fully in support of this, given the general consensus in the rp community."
"i'm down with this, because it's better than retooling the jump clone system to accomodate barhopping."
"this is a bit of a difficult idea - it has the potential to be used as an intel tool as you can find out who's in a station remotely?its also anti-immersive, which i am surprised that the role players would be for. not signed."
"not at all an intel tool if it doesn't give you access to the station's roster o docked pilots. maybe if they happen to be hnging out in the same bar as you.i would argue, as a long time rper, it would be more immersive. it would make sense that in eve they would have developed an advanced tele-presence ability."
"face it man, if you knew how to fight you wouldn't say this crap, thanks for the free bump though. i love it when tards learn to type... you make all of mm look like a bunch of smack tards when i know they have people that know how to fight in nanos which was a skill, fighting them was a skill, flying interceptors was a skill, earning the isk was a skill, and having the balls to fly that much isk in something that could die with one error or lag spike is gone from eve... this is just part of the bigger overall overhaul to the combat system. the changes suck, the design direction sucks, and ccp continues to put a lot off effort in things that the players don't care about. sure glad my subs are all canceled, few more days left... good time to try some other games anyway! cheers!"
"though it may be too late, i cast my vote against these changes. i feel just violated after the change, too far too much too quickly. just no."
"gotta love the fact that it has gone to over 70 pages and they just don't give a ****."
"your right, with a finit techtree, there will be a point, with no competition. but the skilltree is finit too, and there is always competition :-)but when the system is resetet periodicaly, then there is no improvement.and what sense did research make without improvement?and why should we clutter the database with lot's of useless stuff, we have t1, t1 metas and t2 atm, and in around 3 months, maybe t3. thats a lot to research, we don't need new things. :-)industrie has other mechanics, than pvp, there counts isk and workforce (the right word?).so maybe obtaining a new tech should be really hard, and there the competition can start.maybe an example on how to get a technologie:you and your corp have a bpo for a standart missile launcher. ok, now you need a skilled player (scintist), the bpo and maybe some of those t1 standart launchers and research can start. maybe you can put in more scintists, more bpos and more items.so we have the isk and workforce mechanism.after some time and with a bit of luck, maybe more than invention... or less?... your corp gets the standart missile launcher technologie.maybe this can work as a bpo in every of you corp offices, but cannot be stolen, nor destroyed.then you can do standart me/pe research with it.or you can make a copy/bpo? from it and sell it on the market. so they would be \"stealable\", too.ok, now your corp decides to make the next step and wants to research the meta 1 t1 standart launcher. it requires the knowlege of the t1 standart launcher, maybe some of the items(optional) and a skilled scintist or more.maybe some other technologie too, like gurista understanding, heat controll whatever. hope it's understoodable, what i want to say :-)like i said, make the techtree like the skilltree, and let it take lot's of time to gain new techlevels, but also make technologie sellable, so newer players, can compete with isk and workforce, with the older ones.so basic technologies will be availabe to the newer players for a cheap price, whats nearly like a reset :-)maybe think about civilization or so and theyr tech-trade."
"the difference is that there is a clear mechanic by which people can fight in space. there is not such a mechanic by which people can fight for technological advantage.e.g. lets say an alliance produces the first tech 5 bp after a reset. that alliance would have the amount of research time it takes to produce tech 5 items producing and owning the only tech 5 items in the game. if it took 1 month to research a tech 5 bpo, then the things that they can do with this are impressive. they could use the technological advantage to give them an edge in the war, producing the items for their pilots and their pilots only. they could sell the items at a large profit, they could support the side of a conflict or induce people into conflict in trade for these items.but then why is there no improvement? because constant improvement makes the game bad for the majority of the people. in the end, we have to remember that this is a game with, ideally, an expanding userbase. we want people to come and stay, and if they get here and the old guard are constantly increasing their skills and item quality then they wont want to stick around. anyone who stops playing for a bit will lose competitive advantage and be unable to ever regain it. this is a bad thing for the game.what sense does it make? well, as technology progresses, the advances that are pioneered are eventually merged into the baseline performance that everyone sees. what was expensive yesterday is cheap today, what was extraordinary yesterday is commonplace today. however, we have already figured that we cannot just advance everything to infinity by the previous paragraphs. such, we have to find a way to simulate this constant advancement without actually doing it. we simulate it by regressing the items and saying that the technological advancements have been assimilated into the norm. now they offer no specific advantage over the baseline, and, because of that they have the same statistics."
"while your idea is interesting, it has some huge flaws. first off, the database would have to expand dynamically in order to accommodate all the various tech levels of goods. ccp has already said (with ship customization) that they refuse to do this.second, it'd make the monopolies and starting character difference much more dynamic than it already is. monopolies in any economic structure is a recipe for disaster, and separating the veteran characters from the newer ones will not bode well for this game.sorry, but i can't support this option."
"uhh are we reading the same proposal? because in the first freaking post i list your two complaints as the biggest problems that need to be worked around and then spend the next two discussing how you do thatthis specifically lists a dynamically expanding database entry system as unfeasible and works to get around itthis specifically creates a system which limits starting character differences towards old characters. the \"monopolies\" it creates are all temporary and not long lasting. this nearly perfectly follows the model of patents.with regards to the second issue of \"monopolies\":1. monopolies in any economic structure are not a recipe for disaster. in fact they are a necessary component for research and creative production to take place. i assume you have never heard of a patent or copyright. a copyright is an enforced monopoly on an piece of text. it exists because if the person who creates the text cannot be ensured they can control it, then they will never get paid. a patent is an enforced monopoly on a method[technically a method of doing something]. it means that no one else can use your method until the patent ends. this is in place because otherwise, no one could make anything new without anyone else ripping it off and not having to pay the cost of research.1. games are not perfectly competitive markets. they are not constrained by the same laws that constrain real economies and the actions that a game company can take are not similar to the actions that a government can take.in short:i am left wondering whether or not you actually read the proposal"
"my carrier can be a lovely solo pwn mobile. i've never flown a nyx in combat but i can't imagine it being anything but better than a thanny, except slower to lock.. but with double or so the dps? w00t. as for the size, have you seen how big they are at the moment? :-) for rp accuracy they'd probably need to be a big bigger but bear in mind, you'd never fit a domi inside a thanatos, or a nyx for that matter, it's too fat innit? so either there's a compression metric or ccp don't care too much about that sort of accuracy."
"sup"
"what rocket said. flying a mom is tantamount to holding a sign up with 'kill me' written in big neon letters.they need either a complete role change to make them actually useful in fleets (cos newsflash, they aint); or a serious buff in respect to dmg output and tanking ability."
"a massive increase to mothership ship maintenance bay to allow them to carry around a small fleet is a no brainer and should be included as a buff even if nothing else you propose changes."
"this is a good option, but what about those of us who are csm delegates and have alts (such as myself)? if we would be set to our csm delegate name, or have the account name with the small csm delegate logo, i'd be all for this."
"how about setting the forum system to only allow the highest sp character in the account to post (usually the main). granted the loophole is that someone can setup a forum alt account, but on the flip side they will have to pay for that privilege."
"well, i like this idea. it's not a new idea, but it's an important idea.the problem really comes down how ccp wrote the forum. ccp now refuses to make major changes to the forum until they get around to doing a new one.but i think it's important to push for a new forum and for this kind of functionality. the first csm was asked at our last meeting with ccp, what we thought were the single most important issue. i think it's he forum. i'm sorry to say, the current one stinks.we need a new forum and we need to get rid of alt posting. it's long due."
"terrible idea.stealth nerf versus alt scams, alt spies and alt activities in general.implementing an ignore button is a better idea to let each user filter out the non-contributors and blatant alts they don't want to read."
"this either implies your guilty of said actions... or your paranoid.: o )have something to hide?"
"oh noez!outed as bobaltspy!that's why this idea sucks :("
"it would not affect eve at all, just the forums. your evil alting ways would be perfectly safe."
"grinding for reward, i think it's already in the game.grind for loyalty points = money/geargrind for sec status = cops don't shoot at you / get to be a nasty pirate guilt free for 15 minutes till it drops back below -.5grind for isk = faction/t2 rig fitted/navy issue ships that look great on our kill mailsgrind for status = access to agents/price discounts/rpi think the real reason this keeps popping up every 6 months or so is because some people just can't get over the fact that they will never catch the oldest players in terms of sp.it's not fair sure, but eve wasn't ever about things being fair, which makes it all the more interesting."
"agreed. no skill grind please. isk macros are bad enough without seeing buffbots as well."
"daily quests are bad."
"thanks for the laugh op"
"what?i do not think so!not supported!"
"because i haven't seen any good arguments against this;yeah, give me carkeys. *bleep bleep* and make those lights flash too!"
"ccp or representativetopic: severe interference while running (private) missions.problem:when running missions i and others are being interfered with by real players.some players are becoming a nuisance and will cause the mission to fail by repeated harassement.i'm referring to the vandalistic individuals camping out in the mission locations. some even hint to extort isk to let you complete. one instance in particular, i am running a storyline mission and am being prevented to complete it.. short of bringing in a militia of my own to combat real opponents. the intruder asked for 60 million isk to let me complete ! in normal gameplay i would say he needs commended for his crafty strategy.. but to trap people in missions, he should not be allowed to abuse the gaming system.. (his profile mentions the trap and even brags about it)discussion:some argue that an open universe is what eve is all about. i agree totally in normal gameplay.. eve is the best game out there for economics both financial and strategic.. but in missions i strongly disagree that this open universe concept applies as its more like player against environment. the typical scenario i use to explain this is as follows - ask yourself when running a \"storyline\" mission does it sound correct to be ganked by 5 real players? what part of the intended story was that? you will have a hard time convincing me that being ganked by 5 real players is a part of the \"kiddnappers strike\" mission. by the way ccp did a great job writing the mission (if others were prevented from messing it up). the mission was well balanced with my skills until these 5 players interferred. the last round of harrasment cost me one awesome maelstrom plus about 300 million (or more)in lost augmentations and ship equipment. i would not mind the loss if it had been in pvp where i accepted the risk openly.proposal:my proposal is to create \"instances\" where the person granted the mission and his chosen fleet can compete with the intended opponents >> npc players only..i love to fight real people, but not while in missions please. i am trying hard to raise faction standing and i want focus on that while running these missions that entail many hours and a great deal of dedication to complete. this concept is the same as concord policing in high sec..please dont get me wrong > ccp has done a wonderful job with this game, genius in fact. i merely bring this subject to attention so that the game may be more enjoyable and fair..thank you,zeur femmefataleceo - zeur ethereal group"
"no instances, never.sorry"
"if no instances for missions.. then offer another solution please.this is a critical flaw."
"hello zeur,while in games like world of grindcraft you can have instances (barring the doors to the dungeon, etc), in eve we're in space. even though we have deadspace, we can still warp to beacons and such.i know what you're talking about regarding mission invaders, and that's why i created one possible solution, linked in my signature. while i have no problems with people 'invading your space', there should be a way to defend against them, and that is part of my idea.if you don't like the interference, just move to a different agent. there are many agents out there, and while you might take a small hit to your income in a lower-quality agent, you'll get the peace of mind that comes with a greatly reduced chance of invaders."
"hey bunyip,thanks for your mature response.problem is i find all higher level agents tend to drag me into low sec where the problems occur. correct me if im wrong here as i havent been to all corners of the universe yet..dont get me wrong i love to fight pvp and that is what i'm skilling up for it's just when i'm in mission mode i'm in mission mode ya know.. will look at your suggestion link..thanks again..zffp.s - i'm not a wow fan either yak"
"solution - get friends."
"whats next.... allowing gankers to camp mission areas frequented by rookies?i swear... no one thinks of anything beyond pvp freedom 24/7"
"no, please no instances.but, some way to defend yourself, as bunyip suggested, would be good. people shouldn't have the ability to camp missions, but should still be able to probe you out and warp to you then. if you gank me on a mission, you should've worked for it, imo.ab"
"absolutely not supported as it would destroy an essential characteristic of eve."
"you have ways to defend yourself. watch scanner, stay aligned, refuse lowsec missions, be extra vigilant with scanner watching if you move around unaligned.it's pretty much impossible to catch a lowsec mission runner who's on the ball."
"thanks for all of your replies and thoughts.i believe khan has the best answer interim.is anyone trustworthy, willing to fleet up and assist in completion of this mission?or could you refer me to a protection company?i pay a handsome reward.please let me know if you have information as my mission counter is ticking..best regards,zff"
"to the top!!"
"giving out medals - not a terrible idea.giving out commodities with an in game value - terrible idea and just asking for a t20 scandal.or you could always click the volunteer panel on the elft and apply for the... bughunters!i'm sure they get rewards..."
"last i checked... volunteers don't get anything.it's to prevent any unbalanced effects or \"conspiracy's\" with the benefit/status of being in said program."
"are you confirming you are on the volunteer programme and speaking with absolute correctness?"
"they got cool badges for fanfest, just like the csm do. i wouldn't be surprised if ccp paid their flight and hotel for fanfest as well.but volunteers are... volunteers. if they got a medal, it would out their mains. that would get them removed form the bh program .the issue here is that people don't tend to fill in bug reports. bug hunters are there to try and reproduce the bug reports we do. so the logic is kinda flawed."
"i like the idea of superficial rewards like medals or flags on your character or whatever, but i don't like the idea of giving actual ship/isk rewards etc. the idea is to encourage people to actually report bugs, not to get people to spam reports with the hopes of getting free stuff."
"seriously? have you tried ratting in lowsec? i have. gave that up fast. i just think that pve against npc's in the various levels of security space should scale with the risk/sec status of the system. highsec as compared to lowsec is completely too profitable, because the standard there is level 4 missions, while missions in lowsec are too engaging to notice the pirate fleet warping up your ass.as for the proposed changes just making people richer, i respectfully disagree. there are no lowsec pve-ers now because there is no wealth to be had - you have to be rich before you can become richer.you're right about the real problem being the risk attendant to lowsec operation though. even if lowsec rats and minerals were buffed considerably, the risk would probably increase, not decrease. so i hope that once the viceroy system is implemented, there will be a way of protecting your space against unwanted incursions. as of now, there is absolutely no way to operate safely."
"i support this issue!moar targets!"
"yes.made millions, then moved to nullsec and raked it in big.quitter."
"agreed. the topic about poses is also very relevant, and they should have a status inheritance from the controlling corporation.while increasing the number of hostile corps might be a strain on the database, we could have an option for people who hop corps to have it \"amber: this pilot used to be part of a corp that you are hostile to.\" another way to make this easier is to allow whole alliances to be set to negative standings instead of just the individual corps."
"somehow the idea is familiar to me :)small change - big improvement"
"yes.i'd also like to see more base medals and more images to put on them, such as stuff like a lion, bear, griffon, book, lotus, and that sort of stuff as the medals are quite limited now and we got too many swords, birds and laurels in there."
"signed. i'll add this to the list of changes i support from my website."
"hey, if you say you've got a website... link it, ay?all of you csm folks should have a way for us to carry on discourse on the subjects you support that is 'away' from the confusion and flames of the forums. somewhere where you can just merrily delete dissenting viewpoints... or ban flamers & trolls."
"hmm.. sorry, i really don't like the idea at all. you are nerfing the ships that i fly as a pirate. i fly often a cruiser or t2 frigate. basicly i need a whole big ass gang just to get 1 target? i get engaged by that navy wherever i attack my target?no.... i even prefere that sentries would kill a bs in a instand then nerfing all the ships where i am specialized in. i wouldn't be able to kill a bloody frigate with my own frigate. a cruiser wouldn't be able to do the job because they warp off way to fast anyway. no no & nooo"
"so you want to make piracy in anything less than a hac impossible?stupid idea."
"assembly hall is the new caod."
"currently you can see a dev post, or a gm post, or a moderator post, by the nicely colored bar in the forum listing.ccp: please implement a color tag for csm posts so we know what posts they're actually bothering to respond to? i don't believe green is currently in use."
"supporting myself, of course, because the ccp web coders won't let me do it when i create this thread."
"that was one of our initial suggestions to ccp. i can see that it was obviously left out. do i think it's a good idea? yeah.i will look to inform ccp that a green set of bars for csm posts, but only in the csm-related forums, is something that would be lovely."
"i agree to this, and think it could be used in the planetary interaction concept. however, the option to enslave should also be available for the amarr. if the 'livestock' become useful again, as with planetary interaction, this has a whole option available to it, which i plan to describe on my webpage."
"the meeting in iceland is more than a chance to meet the other representatives and familiarize yourself with where they stand on key issues. it also allows the developers to review the candidates whom the playerbase voted into office.this is also one of our only benefits for taking on the responsibility of being a delegate. having it at the end would seem too much like a 'good job, now get out of the way' instance.while the issues may be better developed over the time the players acted in the csm role, it would nevertheless be counterproductive imho. for those issues, the delegates meet quite often to discuss ideas and debate about their practicality/effect on the game."
"the ceo does, not the directors"
"i never know ceo gets mail, thanks for giving input thats even more simple for ccp to deliver it to directors level, but almost all things that ceo can do directors can also do, and ceo isn't online all the time plus many directors are recruitment heads and suffer greatly for not having this feature. if directors get the application for entry into corporation then why not he should receive the resignation too?"
"this is hilarious.....just proves a lot of peoples concerns on the electionif goon cannot keep csm issues out of game...would it stand to reason that they couldn't keep in game politics out of the csm?"
"tada-o!"
"so for folks that have wondered, not such a big deal. we are enjoying blowing them up.issler"
"in the end goonnoobs are nothing more then they're name implies :)"
"it hasnt failed has it, you are here now whining like a lil baby about it!i pity the peeps that voted you in as a csm!"
"you know i didn't agree with much with darius in the last session of the csm but seriously. this wardec mechanism as a \"pay to grief\" theme is terrible. eve's huge selling point is the freedom and consequence of actions in the single server environment and you can't really separate things off completely. even csm reps deserve to have fun in game at the end of the day. hell, i wardecced the goons last session because darius annoyed me in council. its just a thing you know"
"omg i agree with jade! this is a weird feeling"
"voted for anybody other than goon,as the recent activity on isslers corp and its postshow...goons cannot seperate csm and game play"
"the csm's only purview is gameplay... we play a video game... you play it too..."
"are you telling me it's just a video game? blasphemy"
"eve is far from a video game. it's an addictive substance that has weakened my will towards everything else in reality.the csm is concerned about gameplay, but it's also a group of real people interacting, not just characters. there should be some differentiation of fantasy and reality, even in the csm.oh, and if it matters, i voted for myself. not very altruistic, but i really believe in the things my candidate has to say."
"for me there was only really one option..lvvftw!"
"i voted darius johnson due to his valuable experience as a returning council member, his proven ability to get things done and his push for, what i believe, are positive changes for eve online.issler."
"no. miners in n.p.c. corps. are almost risk free. you can't war dec them, you cant suicde gank them and if they are using secure containers you cant flip or steal from them. mission runners in empire space are not risk free. agent runners lose ships all the time. you cant say the same for empire miners can you?"
"mission runners in npc corps are also protected in the same way as miners, you cant war dec them. if mission runners pay attention and dont accept missions beyond their capabilities, they shouldnt loose ships.unaware miners also lose ships to rats, but its very rare.its not true that you cant gank a miner in high sec space, goonswarm made that clear for alot of miners, with their jihad swarm operation.due to the restrictions for secure cans, you cant really make a living mining with them, since they need to be spaced a certain distance from other cans and ore, it makes it very impractical, when the cargospace (m3) in the container is so small. ofcourse you can use them and be pretty much risk free, but your isk/hour is so low, that most people wont bother with it, and do missions instead.ive heard of people doing level 4 missions, that simply warp into the missions in their marauder bs and perma tank the rats, then put out their drones to take care of the rats, while watching a movie on tv, if that isnt easy isk i dont know what is."
"they shouldn't loose ships but they do loose ships.that is very rare.since the jihad swarm operation suicide ganking has been rendered near impossible by changes to concord response time and the whole security review. suicide ganking simply isn't a viable operation anymore.that isn't risk free as there is always risk to your ship and you stand to loose a great deal if your marauder's tank fails. this is not easy isk."
"if you want to be safe from ore theft, bring a hauler along (alt account or friend, whatever). if you're not willing to do that, deal with the risks. bringing up the safety of mission runners is pointless as well, since that's a whole other problem that needs a solution that'll bring it more in line with other moneymaking ways. making mining safer in reaction to that is the exact opposite direction game changes should be going in. this is eve online, not world of starcraft."
"we need you to show your support for this!"
"i think it's a good idea.i also think the buddy list should just be emptied whn the name is changed and then the character can tell anyone who they actually want to know their name that they have/are going to change it, would make much more sense seeing as one of the reasons people change their names is to try and not be recognised...as for people saying about scammers and thieves abusing this feature, surely the fact that you can already have 2 alts along with your main on a single account is more than enough for them to change their identity when they want/need to. the employment history could stay the same so if you knew of any events in other corps, you would still be able to link them to the various corps and add 2 and 2...all in all it has my support"
"it's an interesting idea, but the name is the main (human) identifier in eve, what gains and loses reputation in the universe. i'd definitely like to do this with 2 of my characters (really crap names from other players). in additions to other suggestions here, the scam factor could be removed by;- only enable any character (ie. characterid) to change name once. ever.- only the name changes (nothing else, not id etc.) this way all the \"friends lists\" would be current- flag the character id information with \"former name:\".as a side effect, i can see the market for sold characters would become more popular, as people could pick a new name for the character when they bought it (and would presumably differentiate 2nd hand characters vs. 3rd, 4th etc. characters)."
"i think a good solution would be allow faction t2 ammo, with stacked bonuses and penalties."
"i find it hilarious that already ship having primary weapon system something else than drones, like missiles!, and has very limited drone bay, still has to rely on drones providing significant amount of dps. usually around 30% even on missileboat!so no, drones don't need boost. they are already overpowered in so many ways.if there would be any new additions to drones those should be very carefully nerfed accordingly to keep all that stuff in balance."
"i agree that drone dps is fine, but all the other drone abilities need some love. implants and tech 2 fittings would be nice too!"
"i dont think their use should be enhanced in any way, shape or form on none drone specialized ships. personally i would limit their use a lot more for non drone dedicated ships but that is not the point of this thread.drones are now being used to fill gaps in ship balance for missile and gun boats but this \"everyone gets some\" method means those drone dedicated ships cant be augmented, no new drone modules or implants can be added without boosting 80% of the ships out there.and i agree that on non dedicated drone boats they are just right in dps and such. overpowered even. but dont nerf the domi or myr cause you want to reign in the raven or thorax.for the dedicated drone users and their drone specialized ships it means we get ignored cause our beloved drones have been pimped out onto almost every ship ever made.but just to clarify, i am not asking for any added utility or whatever for non drone dedicated ships.i am asking for the same attention to be given to dedicated drone users that has been given to gun and missile users since day one.if it were up to me i would limit what drones could be used on gun and missile boats. why should a caldari raven use ecm drones as well as a ship built around the use of all drones?why do you have to nerf every other utility drone so bad that using them is stupid because they are allowed to be used by every ship with a big enough drone bay?i am asking for ccp to make up their mind and show some love to us drone users, not buff drones as a secondary weapons system for anyone else.that is what has happened with every utility drone out there and look what you get. they are worthless to use, even on drone spec'd ships. when was the last time you saw energy nuet drones being used? how about td drones? well?you see tons of ecm drone used by non drone specialized ships! why? cause if my myr or domi uses 5 ecm drones of any size i will be blown to bits cause my major bonus is to drones and their damage.personally i would double the drone control cost on non drone spec'd ships. i would add bonuses to all the drones when used by a dedicated drone boat. i would make their use of advanced drones on a raven or a typhoon difficult and basic so that the more complicated drone drones could be used by the ships that are built around them. using them to fill a gap in ship design has screwed us. if you add damage mods for normal drones you boost 80% of the ships in service. not because no damage mod is needed, but because drones are *****d out to every ship in the universe now days.but this is not about that.it is about ccp realizing they need to pay attention to them and stop whoring them out. fix it so that if you boost drone ships you dont end up boosting every ship in eve. balance drones to work well on drone spec'd ships and give those who train for it fun and interesting toys that every other weapons system has had from the beginning.dont get me wrong. it is a big job. ccp will have to make some changes in the basic use of drones by every ship in the game to begin adding drone based content.there is a flaw in drone implementation.it effects every drone capable ship in eve (80%+ ships in use).and if it isnt addressed, drones will fall into a \"add-on\" role, forever religated to a secondary role. no new drones or implants or mods will be successfully introduced. they will become ho hum.i would prefer that doesnt happen."
"so needed.gallente navy ogresgallente navy gardesdominix navy issue.rogue drones dominix."
"i wouldn't say drones are overpowered seeing as how easily they are destroyed, forgotten and left behind, requiring very good skills in a proper drone ship (or as close to one as we have now - domi/vexor etc) to do any meaningful damage to the target. of course, when you add 5 drones from each person then we start to see a difference, but even then non-drone ships don't really contribute to the damage, seeing as how their damage comes from missiles/guns/whatever.the only *real* boost drones had (if you can call it that) when the ships speed were reduced allowing drones to actually hit their intended targets (light drones are now more dangerous to things like inties etc). as stated, drone damage is ok right now, but still not a primary weapon and we do need new drone modules as well as t2 modules (listed earlier) as well as the implants.as for new drones, better rogue drone 'drones' (the augmented and improved) for all the races, as well as things like an/db praetor, gn/ss ogre's, cn/dg wasp's and rf/d berserker's as well as the smaller drones and sentry."

"posting from an ancient computer while visiting my parents. if there were a skill queue, i wouldn't lose 5 days of training because a skill finished while i was out of town."
"yersh!"
"this is probably already mentioned, but want to note it into this thread:have training to a specific certificate. so you just select training for the certificate, all skills on the certificate are trained, and balanced it by having a trade-off of cycle-training the pre-requisite skills. by cycle training the skills, i mean: train all pre-reqs level 1, then all level 2 etc., so nothing gets to the pre-req required level, until all other required skills are at the pre-req required level -1.then it's not useful for training level 5 skills repeatedly, but is useful for training where you have lots of short skill changes, or inconvenient ones."
"3 year old player should have found join/create new corp button already. i'm pretty sad for them who haven't :pso definetly supporting the basic idea. and tax for npc corps. oh yeah baby."
"or you have no interest in others, just like kewl internet spaceships?ccp i'm pretty sure are aware of this issue. maybe they've even heard of it before this thread... not sure how much action your going to get out of them since they are a business and this just *might* affect their bottom line, as there are a bunch of people (apparently enough to complain about) that don't want to play this way... i'm just sayin'...ak"
"\"whaa, people don't want to pay this game to be my targets2 thread number 1 million +care to give any reason to support your argument beside \"but changes need to be made\", a totally unsubstantiated argument based on your gaming preferences?"
"pvp pilot (anyone starting combat with another pilot) not allowed to get any mission as they are clearly homicidal psychopaths (in eve, not rl).these change won't kill the game for any of the pvp players as they will easily create pve alt to accept the mission that will be done by the pvp main. see how your logic can be used for really stupid arguments like yours?"
"wrong as usual stoned.it scream \"we are all the property of 1 player\" or even \"we were a industrial corp but after the last wardec we decided to split 6 ways to make life more difficult for the griefers\".curious as several different dev have stated, more than once, that avoiding war dec moving in npc corps is a intended game mechanic."
"alas the war dec system is broken beyond repair esp high sec wars, but it certainly needs looking at, fee's need to be higher for sure. the reason it is broken is that eve is full of pvp'ers who mostly have got either carebear alts or alts as scouts and haulers in non aligned corps earning them there isk and giving intel and logistics, so while the pvp'ers make war they are free to also keep operating earning isk with alts. i guess the war system can only work if it is corps fighting over resources or something tangible and not just for the fight, ie the corps need to be balanced encompasing all types of playstyle, miner's, industiralists, traders , misionrunners and the pvp'ers all in together in the same corp which would be impossable to do as everyones alt charactors and 2nd accounts etc would need to be placed in the same corp and people would just hate that ( me incl ).risk and reward and all that because there is no risk to the pvp corp as they get a fight which is what they want but their carebear alts get all the reward with no risk as they get buisness as usual. anyway i do beleive the npc corps should get taxed and makes sense to say after 3 months it is set at an average player corp rate which i guess is 10%."
"so people allowed to play eve are only those that can dedicate at least an average of 3 hours day to it, are willing to wake at strange hours for the mandatory corp ops and so on?npc corps are good for players with limited time. you get to find a lot of people on line to cooperate and chat without the need to guarantee your presence and availability for tomorrow ops or the defence of the corporate assets.when i run my npc corp alts i speak and sometime collaborate with people that is going to bed while i am doing breakfast before going to work, but if for some day or week i don't log in nothing negative will happen to them or me because of my absence. those alts in the npc corp have no reason or need to be in a player corporation, what they do has no need for a corporation support, so why i should limit them because you can't find enough member for your corporation or enough targets? the only way to \"cure\" the problem is to get better player run corporations, not worse npc corporation. i have seen my share of player corporations and most ceo are only serf serving, interested in aggrandizing themselves and bossing over other players. some corp has a good leadership, both competent and not sel centered, those corps have success, the other see the players leaving for the npc corps."
"this.i once told a corpmate all i was really after was people to talk to in corp chat and occasionally mine with. an npc corp provides the former (better than most player corps), but doesn't the latter (criminal flagging doesn't carry over, even to other gang members). since i haven't trained mining past rank 1 on this character the mining thing isn't a big deal yet.yes. running a corp/guild/clan in an mmo requires real world skills. not entirely the ones a real business calls for, but close. the most effective mmo ceo types i've dealt with have been people who are lower or middle management in real life, generally in industries that have a fair amount of turnover."
"your getting warmer folks... but you got one major problem... your attacking human nature and greed.not an easy thing to fix. and most dont give a damn.i agree tho... better player owned corps who do more team work and less frakking around."
"yea lets just make up complete nonsense instead of coming with actual arguments. that will work. most corps do not require you to play, or log on at certain times. certainly not high sec corps, and you always have the option of making your own corp. complete bs. it has nothing to do with corp leadership and everything to do with beeing immune to attacks in high sec. thats why many people in good corps in high sec and 0.0 keep their alts in a npc corp to separate their isk making/hauling chars from their pvp chars etc."
"no change is necessary for this stuff.they should simply have a graduated tax for newb corps with failwarfare npc corps negated.if you make 50mil an hour and ur in a newb corp... 10% tax going to the newb corp is fine.if you make 5mil an hour ... 1% tax. is fine.you are paying for your safety.the exception obviously is trading and such which isnt taxed by corp tax."
"and this is the one thing that always destroys this argument.no one , especially ccp wants to see an even larger number of 1 man corps.if you try to stop people jumping into npc corps, they will simply make 1 man corps and do the same thing. and as stated before, the thing you guys are complaining about is an intended game mechanic. ccp has stated so in dozens of places. using alts as spies, and to escape pay-to-grief was intended."
"says the pot calling the kettle black."
"it's not unianimously supported mr yatta."
"yep, seems there is a group all for and a group all against. while i know you can't please everyone with every new thing you implement, i see this suggestion more and more as a work in progress and food for thought about which impact ambulation will have on roleplay. of course ambulation is for everyone to enjoy, so it should be tailored so it is an enjoyable addition for each play style it was also not my intention to speak on behalf of the entire roleplaying community, that would be rather naive of me. sorry if it seemed like that!"
"i think the funniest thing about this \"expansion\" is, it's not an expansion, it's just a patch of nerfs, and a ship or two. coming back to this after 8 months, it's a tad disheartening. i'm not the type of guy who will take a punch if i can just step to the side and punch back. that's why nanoships fit me so well. well, this has really killed most of the fun in the game for me. i might have to think again about staying."
"with the recent nerf bat to the face of the stealth bombers i for one demand the ability to warp while cloak to put this class of ship in line with recon and black ops ships. ccp you owe us sb pilots some freaking slack of this magnitude"
"bah, bombs just don't work as intended. you might as well strap a jacket of c4 on and scream viva amarr as you drive into the enemy line. end result is pretty much the same.sb are not viable in their role any longer, they're hardly a threat to even a basic fit rifter.give them the ability to fit cov ops cloaks.give them the ability to passive target while cloaked (at 10% their max uncloaked scan res).increase their cruise missile bonuses to a +250% explosion radius and +250% explosion velocty. remove the range and damage bonuses.reduce bombs to cost lest per run than the ship launching them!!!and another great role for them: anti-covert warfare. enable a cloaked covert ops the ability to find other cloaked ships with their on-board scanner. they would, of course, then have to chase it down to decloak it... but only while they are cloaked and are subsequently decloaked themselves."
"i actually like that idea. it's not giving them too much, because you are only given a range for the cloaked ships. hmm, thinking about it again, i'm not sure. this would allow a sb to find a cloaked ship's range, then have normal ships warp to them at that range. still, might not be too much."
"i agree with making bombs less expensive, however i do not think the vulnerability while deploying should be removed. once a bomber drops a bomb, it should be a sitting duck if it didn't come with support.supporting because bombs still need to be looked at."
"no, it would apply to the game as well. thieving and stealing are part of eve. implementing this idea would make it harder to do./unsupport"
"another approach would be to only enable posting to the forum from the character with the most skill points on any account. that would force players to use the voice of their most important character (by skill investment.)ironically, that would mean i can't post with this character, but at the same time, i could shuffle my other characters off the account if it's really so important to me to post with this character. i could live with that for better quality forums and less trolls and *****s.has anyone noticed an improvement in caod posting since the requirement to have \"at least 10 people in your corporation\" was introduced?"
"let<U+FFFD>s try."
"uh.. where do you get that idea from?the boards and the game are completely independent of each other.... they just happen to share the same account system.you could just as easily severe the 2 of them and have them tied to the primary account like your username or whatever name you wish to don for that main.the problem is this \"post with your main\" crap that goes on with all the alt's upon alt's upon alt's.paranoid much people?x o d"
"no. this would encourage macroing and grinding which are already too constant part of this game and should be get rid of, in my opinion.point of eve is not to gather most of skillpoints as fast as possible so you could one-shot-kill all other players in game. too bad there's already too much that also."
"whoa... i must be getting tired. theres no way a thread this silly could exist."
"/me vote against op idea."
"current method good."
"i think this would be great for doing batches of t2 production from invention to the sale of the final product, i was complaining about the current deficiency of the wallet (and its lack of divisions) to my roomate the other day.the ability to automatically calculate expenses and credits would be a major improvement."
"really good idea"
"simple, but very nice idea."
"what about having an actual bank where you could put your money in that earned interest? make is like a real savings account.then it would be more obvious for players what they were doing, wouldn't require additional clutter of the player ui, and you'd get the bonus of interest.the simple reason not to do this is it already exists. eve bank."
"this is a complete rehash of the previous 426 threads about either subject created in the last 365 days, and as such contains no new ideas or proposals but does allow me to pass myself of as a devout eve purist, who has wholeheartedly dedicated his forum life to attacking those who refuse to play the way eve was intended to be played (and by that i mean how i say you should play the game) upto and including such a time that it leads to the downfall of eve, at which point i will blame the carebears.(yes i am aware that this is a troll, but please prove to me how this [idea] is any different from all the other [idea] thread which propose the same solutions to one or two of the games least important problems, which ccp has stated it is already looking into so your solutions are doubly redundant, over and over and over again, each time get voted down or drowned out with logical argument?)"
"absolutely brilliant!i stand in awe of your scintillating intellect!ak"
"yes... lets force everyone to play the game the way you think it is.great idea..../facepalm"
"hello all.i was just wondering what you all would think about the possibility of introducing multiple undock points as seen in this trailer.i believe that by introducing multiple undock points, stations will feel 'busier.' this would also reduce the congestion around undock points."
"yes!stop ignoring this!doooo itttt!/signed"
"actually, i'm somewhat in favor of instancing. not for the everyday hum-drum missions, but instances dedicated to new in depth epic fleet missions."
"/me vote against instancing."
"only if the rewards of those missions can't be removed from the instance."
"another reason people move out of lowsec... it's far too easy for someone to wander in and rip the mission group to ribbons (and no matter how many friends you bring, they will bring more).i'm all for the ability to lock the gates, so long as the hunters do have some complicated, skill intensive process to get in (skill intensive to reduce the number of throwaway alts used solely for that purpose).or have the mission rats cycle to new arrivals so the pirates don't have tens of rats on their side.no closed instancing, however. no need, we have plenty of 'space'.another alternative method is to move the missions in lowsec beyond 25au from the system center. this will force mission pirates to use low-strength long range probes and more time to find their target. currently many missions are within areas that can be scanned by an exploration probe with it's x1000 scan strength."
"thishowever.... moving missions farther out could be a problem with running out of cap to warp.but that's minor compared to the problem of mission ganking."
"what private missions? are no private missions in eve. you must be mistaken. you can scan down anyone in a mission; thusly it's public mission.oh and before you whine about me being a pirate or something. my sec status is 5.9 and faction standing above 9.5. i'm a carebear.as opposed to? you have to do your missions in these missions hubs? if they steal mission completion items... i'd just petition it and keep bothering the gms until they fix the issue... perhaps declining the mission without loss... ive yet to have someone scan me down and i've done a ton of missions. the issue clearly here is you being in motsu or dodixie.no, never, at no time, dont hold your breath, forget it, nevermore, not at all, not ever, not in any way, not in the least, not on your life, not under any condition, no way in hell should we ever get instances."
"one of the great things about eve is that there is no instancing. instancing is really a bad idea as stated above. the adapt or die scenarios described above are really where the solution lies. maybe you're highlighting a larger problem though - why are so many people joining eve to play mmos (mmo solo)? is it just that elite was a brilliant game concept, and needs a chat client to go with it?"
"low-sec is underutilized? omfg! your kidding!?!why is low-sec underutilized?because there is nothing to do in low-sec, that cannot be done as well in high sec (and safer) or no-sec (and safer). except pirating/pvp'ing (easier than hi-sec - and don't have to deal w/bubbles from 0.0) - and thats just not drawing the people in, is it?if the only thing \"better\" about low-sec is the ability to pvp, then thats who its going to attract, which seems to have limited the base, so to speak.how to attract other types of players?only one way - design/implement changes that make doing something in low-sec better / easier / more lucrative than doing the same thing in hi-sec or 0.0.ideas:corporations - that are headquartered in low-sec get a 25% bonus to taxed income (not out of the players pockets, just \"added\") for all income generated in a system of .4 security or lower.mining - capturable mining belts, different ores, defendable/deployable \"bunkers\" to mine a belt from.missioning - i have no clue how to fix this - pve ships are just shiney targets for pvp fitted ships, and pvp fitted ships don't pve very well...invention - maybe a new type of complex? \"mad scientist\" complex - first person that finds it, can research (or produce) 3 (or 5 or 10 or 50) blueprints at 50% increased level? this would draw people out (with nice loot too!).manufacturing - npc stations give a discount on manufacturing done on their stations because of players \"bringing business out to the hinterlands...\" npc stations not collecting taxes on new corps formed to manufacture items in low sec?t2/t3 production \"pluses\" in low - sec? absolutely have the right idea here man - low-sec, your home away from 0.0/hi-sec space!i do think that with wormholes ccp may be bringing some of these changes about... we'll have to wait and see...akedited for spelling/grammer and to show support!"
"i do not believe the prospect of wealth is enough to overcome player hesitation of entering low sec. i do not believe this is an issue of reward at all, but rather an issue of disproportionate risk.this may be an issue where eves open pvp may be too open for its own good. but that's just my opinion."
"it's exactly the same, whether it's because it's too dangerous or not rewarding enough it still comes down to risk vs reward. there are two solutions to that; making it safer and making it more rewarding. i don't really see how making it safer is an option aside from the players working together so that leaves you with upping the rewards.what is needed is for the rewards to become significant enough for a corp to move to low sec as a whole, which would in turn make it a safer place having friendlies in local.as with 0.0 though, low sec should not be a place for players with no interest in pvp. there just has to be something worth fighting for.- low sec ores need a significant boost.- high sec missioning needs a nerf. i'm sorry but the income from a well trained l4 mission runner is completely ridiculous for the zero risk they put themselves at.- low sec exploration is already profitable but giving it a boost wouldn't do any harm.- low sec rats are fine as they are, it can provide a good income to new players who are willing to take the risks. it shouldn't be a considerable income for any experienced player.so yes supported but not your proposal in it's entirity."
"surely at least all the corporation logo's should be available as part of the medal designs as well, i mean medals are generally for a service provided to the corp kinda thing..."
"this issue somehow improves the game for the majority of players? after all the campaigning on much more urgent and serious matters, this is the first issue you deem important for the players of eve? hell's teeth...arithron"
"sounds good"
"i would like to see the morphite replace by equal value of tritanium at the ccp standard price (i.e. trit is 2). this would allow drones to still be valuable, and not nerf drone space. it would also lower the mining value of veldspar in empire."
"in last expansion the drone droppings got nerfed by like 33% from lvl 4 missions."
"i still say it would be an interesting idea"
"just goto venal? seems like it's pretty quiet right now there. :)you lose the ability to stop others from docking; and messing with your market.if you cant see the difference between outpost vs titan vs unique tournament trophy? why bother...so what happens when you have a griefer alliance... all they do is go around to capture outposts, give them to the enemy andthen move on? then like all outposts eventually become npc stations?"
"interesting idea and would need to be balanced by being able to capture/take over npc stations from npcs as well :)from an rp perspective, couldn't an npc faction simply take over the outpost if they wanted it? maybe something to organise via events?personally i'd like to see all npc stations have the behaviour of outposts, so that you can actually disable services on npc stations :dofc, the time to repair would be pretty short when all the guristas healing carriers showed up!"
"hadnt thought of that. then again it is low sec and not no sec. if you dont want concord to be coming down on you... goto actual 0.0 so you can operate solo in small ships.if the change means i'm protected from frigs and similar from attacking me. i then have to only worry about hacs or larger. i can count on my escape time and disappear before being targetted. this would be a good increase in security that might be plenty to actually get miners and mission runners into low sec."
"so you wouldnt mind the sentries be increased 10x the dps? 3500 dps. aka 100% no gatecamps?that'd make traveling through low sec very easy... but not doing anything in low sec."

"sigh, goonswarm peeing about again. war-deccing is pay-to-grief atm. simply because the system cannot handle super alliances like bob or the goons. i'd say that war-deccing in highsec space should be still allowed, but at a much higher cost than it is now, as well as making sure that sec status is still hit for the pvping."
"i say this without a trace of irony:go play world of warcraftevery time someone like you posts it just really strikes me that this isn't the game for you. things like the wardec system and never being truly safe aren't little fringe features added, they're core values. the fact that people like you can play the game, not like these features, and then actively try to change them is pretty disgusting."

"so yeah, i've been spotting the same tendencies/habits/behaviorisms throughout nearly all mmos and thought it would be interesting to post them here. enjoy:top 10 mmo golden rules(or a checklist for developers to consider)1) if there is the possibility for abuse or exploitation ingame, players will always find it and abuse the hell out of it to its fullest extent.2) players will always look for ways to cheat. whether it be through ingame mechanics, third party software, or by some other method.3) when given the choice, players will always choose the path of least resistance. the fastest, easiest, cheapest, and laziest route to their end goals.4) content is only as good as how the playerbase perceives it to be. developers could pour their hearts and souls developing content for years, but it's nothing more than dog poo if the players don't like it.5) never ignore the player concerns when content is in development. sure a few whiners and complainers will surface, but the playerbase as a whole wields a strong understanding of the game. sometimes the devs can't see the forest through the trees.6) trolling and bad player behavior is contagious. especially when little or no action is taken against them. some players genuinely find joy through ruining the fun for others. it's vitally important to both recognize this sort of behavior and take appropriate and timely actions against it. spare the rod and spoil the child.7) if you promise something to the playerbase then you darn well better honor that promise. time tables may fluctuate, but promises are promises. players don't forget and they never miss an opportunity to remind us all.8) the vocal minority that populate mmos may be the minority, but they hold a very strong social influence over the silent majority. often the vocal player opinions translate and imprint onto the silent players.9) like it or not, min/maxing is here to stay in the mmo genre. those who min/max are often at the top of the food chain, and those who wish to stay competitive or alive must also follow this path.10) always stick to your policy guns. if it's against the rules for some players, it must be universal amongst all players. alternatively, if some players are allowed to do x, then all players must be allowed to. playing favorites and granting special privileges will always cause drama."
"these are taken from raph kosters website and i believe these are valid for eve.macroing, botting, and automationno matter what you do, someone is going to automate the process of playing your world.corollary:looking at what parts of your game players tend to automate is a good way to determine which parts of the game are tedious and/or not fun.ownership is keyyou have to give players a sense of ownership in the game. this is what will make them stay--it is a \"barrier to departure.\" social bonds are not enough, because good social bonds extend outside the game. instead, it is context. if they can build their own buildings, build a character, own possessions, hold down a job, feel a sense of responsibility to something that cannot be removed from the game--then you have ownership.if your game is narrow, it will failyour game design must be expansive. even the coolest game mechanic becomes tiresome after a time. you have to supply alternate ways of playing, or alternate ways of experiencing the world. otherwise, the players will go to another world where they can have new experiences. this means new additions, or better yet, completely different subgames embedded in the actual game.is it a game?it's a service. not a game. it's a world. not a game. it's a community. not a game. anyone who says, \"it's just a game\" is missing the point."

"ccp should never operate big changes (more than 10%) in any attribute. it's a game supposed to have a evolutive story line. how could someone enjoy the coherent storyline if technology can have unevolutions. a piece of tech that gives you 16% a boost of something should never be changed to give you 10% after some day. or missiles with an explosition effect should not have that effect hardly changed.this makes the proposal of a persistent universe with a coherent story line totally crap. how could people be confident in cpp adminstration? why should i think in eve universe as a thing where should i make plans to my character ? the plann can be at any time invalidate ! ! !if some tech got to much power the right way to re-balance is launch counter-tech to deal it the situation. just like in real world. an army don't ask another to reduce effectiveness of their weapons. they develop new counter-weapons.sorry if servers are not able to deal with speed (it's an internal problem) should never had come to users. to re-balance speed why not some kind of device to deal with this? why not an implant disruptor which disable some implants in user? or a better web ? to deal with missiles doing damage to frigs why not a new hardener that works better againt missiles? some kind of flare like in real life or eletronic guidance disruptor that reduces precision of missiles. or even turn frig more resitive to missiles is more accepteable that turn missiles less effective. observe that the result are the same but those option doesn't break the feel of continuity in eve universe.in my point of view ccp got hardly un-imaginative in this patch. loosing player base confidence by complete lack of imagination on how to deal with the speed problem.having in mind the absence of imagination should be better to roll-back this patch and re-think the role product... what are you selling? an story line consistent playing experience or just new models and nice images to see? can we invest our time doing plans or is it better to stop to do that at this point? what skill plan users should do that will not be invalidated in near future? can we have the nice feeling of rock solid commitment from you or it's just an investment from our part without commitement from you?that's why i'm signing this petition. it's not a question only on nerf of missiles."
"look, i can adapt just like others. i've now found that my t1 cruise do far more damage against all ship classes than my t2's. which, i guess, saves me isk on not buying so much t2 ammo any more. the most frustrating thing is they say it will work the same against the same class, which is still not true. the t1 cruise do almost 100hp better per missile than the t2's against bs's. the only exception i've found so far is zor in l4 damsel in distress where my t2's finally hit like they should, and of course structures. my drones still chew cruise and smaller class ships. the only thing i'm upset on is the fact that i spent time training for t2 cruise missiles that are now, for the most part, completely useless. look on the bright side, at least cruise missile specialization doesn't affect damage, but launcher rate of fire, so at least all is not lost.anyway, signed, maybe not to be returned to previous state, but reviewed for functionality."

"raise cpuadd capital cruise launchers to complement torp launchers.make capital cruise/torp launchers follow the pattern of non-capital.naglfar can suddenly pack highest or near highest close range dps with largest falloff (traditional advantage of mini close-range gear) giving them the best engagement capability at non-sniping ranges i.e. we cyno'd right on top of a cap blob.also, by reducing the need for sensor boosters etc for hitting sniping range, midslots can be focused on tank. save one low for backup sensor array or just a pdu or cap gear for extra tank.pulse revelation is so-so and blaster moros is merely theoretical without a very good cyno opportunity. close range phoenix would be quite a bit better off. currently there is no launcher to differentiate phoenix loadouts.pheonix gets a faster main capital weapon (easing the pain of slow citadel torps) and still has dumb citadel torps for hot-drop ambushing at close range. to balance the dps if it's going to come out too high, do some pg tweaking on citadel launchers such that the phoenix comes up about 5% short and can sacrifice a damage mod for a pdu and get a little bit more tanking as well.with the naglfar, capital cruise/arty would just be a pg swap for capital torp/ac's, leaving it with enough grid for either setup. having the extra cpu given back by cruise launchers would also help with the extra cpu required by arties, so it'd be a tight but doable fit in either stance.finally, the mini hull with split weapons would actually have some versatility that isn't code-word for sub-optimal. easier requirements of capital cruise launchers and added cpu would take away the fitting pain for long-range setups. close range setup would have lots of falloff to minimize impact of being out of optimal, allowing it to have consistent, superior close-range dps to any other dread. capless weaponry leaves it with full cap for burst tanking into the loving arms of carriers.i would fly that naglfar. it would still be sub-par in long-range setups, but not ridiculous like it is. it would in return rock more than any other dread in close-range hot-drops."
"alliance hangars as an extra layer above corp hangars, yes."
"iirc in the 1st csm meeting ccp said there was a technical limitation in the architecture of player>corp>alliance and hangar code that would require a major re-write.what is the major thing you want to solve with this? would it be satisfied by having market orders restricted to alliance only, or a faster way to make alliance only contracts?"
"i would love to share with the forum members here with ways we use to detect macro-miners but unfortunately if i did i would be foolish since the macro-miners would then be alerted to our tactics. what i will say is that some of the observations of macros mentioned in this thread would not be atypical of their behaviour. ccp are not going to ban the macro miners since this is a notable amount of revenue for them. when replying to your petitions i would imagine some of them must feel guilty if they believe that you have caught a genuine macro miner and they cant take action due to the criteria they use in the procedure for removing a macro account."
"what about the rest of eve (non miners) that benifit from macro minners? because of macro minners i get cheaper ships and moduals, so from my perspectinve they are great.manufacturures will build at what ever margin they see fit if ore goes up then ships/moduals go up does not really effect them either way.but for us generaly players that dont mine macro minners are a good thing (purly isk wise) removing macro miners may help your walet but it will certainly hurt mine so i see it as a bad thing. keep macro miners ingame!"
"they are paying subscription to ccp....why would ccp ban them? i mean, theyd lose money!"
"i can certainly understand how a lot of players see this as a non-issue, or see it as an excuse for the 'pew pewer' to propose solutions which are thinely veiled attacks on 'carebears'.i can just about see how some people think that it's not 'real'.i would ask people to have a look at this, it's a short and interesting read which neither preaches nor condems but it will educate you about a large part of this issue."
"no, dedicated miners do not do the exact same things, over and over, w/out fail and you know it. people have timed these guys... down to the second... and your going to make an excuse for it? folks, this is the shotgun defence measure, you throw tons of s**t around and see if anything sticks...excuse me mr. macro-mining lawyer alt - you fail.akbye the way - the above link \""

"nice article. regardless of the working conditions of rmt+macro+farmers, the reality is that it's bad for eve. at the end of the day, the only reason they do it, is because it's a rl profitable exercise. so got any suggestions for making it not profitable in rl? i would have thought introducing plex would help make it a less interesting exercise. or do plex just make it easier to **** legitimately - by selling plex in-game for rl currency?actually for a stream of conciousness, maybe that's why they can't leave a station - because if they did, they could be jettisoned and collected, with no log of the event. maybe ccp are watching afterall :)"

"at this rate, we will have ambulation before we get our implants back"
"they were never ingame though were they? at least not tq?you couldnt ever get them from lp stores. you couldnt put them on market nor contracts.so really the question would be an introduction of the implants to the game. perhaps i could have my drone implants before invention?"
"i good pilot can narrow the cone down to range and direction. if the cloaker is sitting still the one hunting them can just... drive right up to them and decloak them (both).also, a cloaked ship should be able to see an em fringe around other cloaked ships... like their own cloaking effect. the pilot would actually have to see this fringe, by looking. obviously it would take a keen eyed pilot to pick out the enemy cloaker at much beyond 10km... and even at 3km it would be a challenge."
"and what happens if you have two characters on the same account and they did different things? i have to give up my high sec research business that i get via the forums because i want to post with my 0.0 character? what if i have two rp characters? i can sell stuff ingame on an alt but i can't on the forums? that is not balanced.also, if i can make an alt to spy, scout, steal, scam and am allowed to do anything in eve that other people can, then i sure as hell should be allowed to post in the forums like everyone else. i can play each character as a separate entity if i wanted to and i don't see why that should be destroyed because an alt owned you verbally in a thread. what you are suggesting is alt-oppression and we will not stand for it. if you feel a post is trolling then report it. i've reported rant threads and they have gotten locked. if you are tired of seeing one-liners and stuff, well then just don't read the forums because guess what, every forum in the universe is like this."
"don't even need character portraits, as has been pointed out, forums are mostly seperate from the game, so maybe people could use whatever avatar they liked, even, , upload one?people using forums for ingame services can always direct ingame mail/contact to the correct character via their post."
"the sooner the forums are brought under 'any' sort of control the better.i dare say that the forums put off an many new players, if not more, than the 'steep learning curve' ccp keep going on about. which wouldn't be bad if they were putting off the 12 yr immature 'oh arn't i cool i can swear in public' gamers but sadly it's forum trolls and bashers that show these players they have a home where they can feel loved and encouraged.(although lets be honest how many of us have though about reply to this thread with an alt stating something like people should be forced to troll on the forums because it will improve the population of the forums and bring the forums into line with the original ethos behind the forums, and if the sensible, polite and considerate forum posters leave because of it all the better )"
"a potential issue with ambulation is the lack of people in most stations. in another thread, people mention the use of holograms to be places.an alternative suggestion is then to perhaps just have an interbus depot on the station, whereby you can ambulate to it, then take the bus to where you want to be?travelling on the bus to somewhere then also becomes a game in itself. perhaps others are also travelling, and you can talk with them on the journey?especially if there's a distinct route for the buses, and you have to change at certain stations to get a bus to a specific destination.ofc, the bus would take time and isk, and once you arrive you won't have a ship there, so you'd have to make the journey back before you could undock or do other non-ambulatory stuff.problems then, of devaluing jump clones, and tactical uses of the interbus.some of these problems have been discussed:so, an interbus would allow people to travel to ambulate in a selection of other places, which might help with there being few people in many stations."
"yes as posted before medo it"
"ya.. this would be a nice idea.. could also be used to confuse people who station camp.. go in one hole.. out the other.edit: i feel dumb.. forgot to support a great idea"
"yeah, if anyone has watched the nuubship swarm in the 'eve hell' video they know just how messed up ship stacking at the undock point is.the 15 degree variance is good, but there needs to be a larger 'exit' area... and there needs to be a limited docking area too. it's insane seeing a ship sitting 60km away from the undock port 'dock'...the 'docking collision bubble' should only be like 10 to 20km radius centered on the one (or several) undocking port(s), not the entire damn station."

"pirates online? oh snap! you mean potbs (pirates of the burning seas) - yeah, that game will be gone in a year or two... because of what you kinda outlined... eve's been around a lot longer, because they have the mix about right - hi-sec is \"mostly safe\", low-sec is \"mostly lawless\" and 0.0 has only as many rules as the players enforce... no one is forcing you into low-sec or 0.0.ummm, (scratches head) - missions are only a couple of years old in eve..., be carefull what you ask for. they were placed in the game after it had been released for a couple years, they can be removed...as for \"forcing\" people into corps? i'm not for that... yet... ;)not supporting this measure...ak"
"thanks for all the support! it's good to know that the pirates aren't the only group interested in lowsec. though if these changes go through, i may have to reconsider piracy as a profession."
"outpost upgrades are terriblethe problem lies in what they offer vs. their price. it is fine that they are so expensive, but what they give for your money is pitiful. <rant>consider the minmatar refinery outpost. say you upgrade it to tier 2, adding 2 levels of one upgrade, and one level of another. the total cost will be 10bil for the platforms, plus 3bil for 2 basic and 1 normal upgrade, 13bil overall.lets say we get a refinery upgrade one level, from 35% to 40%, and two factory (plant) upgrades, giving us a whole 8 (yes eight) factory slots extra, giving 10 overall.now consider that you can get the same benefits from erecting a pos and using mods on that (material multiplier aside), for a fraction of the cost, and you need pos anyway to claim sov and hold your outpostnow consider that an npc station might have 50% refinery, 40 factory slots and 20 of each lab slot as well as 15+ offices.now consider that if you upgraded two outposts in such a way, then for the same amount it cost, you could build an entire new outpost.so it's no wonder alliances make the judgement that until every system they own has an outpost, outpost upgrades just aren't worth it beyond tier 1. add to the fact you'll never beat npc stations and the whole thing becomes pointlesswho in their right mind is going to pay 2.5bil to get a whole 3 extra factory slots in a minmatar outpost if you get just the 1st tier upgrades</rant>point is, outpost upgrades either need buffing, or to be made cheaper, or no one will ever get them, especially above foundation lvl"
"arent the upgrades permanent though? you only can damage them into disabling the deal?you go from no refinery to 30% base or 50% if u started with minnie outpost. that's pretty good in my books.the real reason they arent gone beyond tier 1 is because they are conquerable. you can drop 15bil into upgrades and next week lose docking rights to the outpost. 15bil lost pretty much.though ya factory slots and offices upgrades do seem to need a bit of a boost."
"isn't it a balance issue because it's cheaper to get more services by dropping another outpost than to upgrade an existing one. so as a large 0.0 alliance, you're going to keep dropping outposts, rather than upgrade existing ones; this can be perceived as bad (0.0 becomes full of outposts) or good (0.0 has so many outposts, lots of little alliances can get a foothold), depending on your perspective."
"im a new player to eve who has over the last 6-8 months made a lot of progress with my skills....the orca has filled a niche for the industrial pilots and credit to ccp for delivering.now for us more pvp inclined how about us getting a ship midway towards a carrier?something similar to the orca or even a military version of the orca?something drone based perhaps?it would provide corps a cheaper alternative to carriers and moms but would also help people who are new to the game to remain intrested."
"military version of a orca, umm like a command ship maybe ?"

"two things protect one's character. first the ship, secondly the pod. once your pod has been destroyed you end up in a station, effectively podless in one's clone, hopefully an up-to-date one. the loss of a ship can be quite high, but the loss of one's pod and thus current body can be much higher due to loss of implants and potentially even skillpoints. first all pods are the same - boring. second if your ship is destroyed you are practically guaranteed to get podded if in low/0.0 sec. third pods have low hp, low resists, low cap, easily warp scrambled, slow, a death trap in low sec/0.0 sec. a market currently exists for these items even though noone has yet to suggest the idea. logically they should exist if pods exists at all. some may think this is a carebear attitude, but is really a balance issue. pods are of no danger to anyone and of no value to anyone except a collector or a bounty counter(of corpses). if you think about it, pods are really like small ships that get ejected when the main one gets blown up. for a dread owner to pop out a pod with the same attributes as frigate owner is ridiculous. with this idea implemented, we can finally see all the \"carebears\" and other such high sec players finally moving towards low sec and 0.0, creating new targets for the pirates and mega alliances. everyone is happy.-edited, adding spaces to create paragraphs."
"paragraphs please and thank you. got about 1 \"paragraph\" through this and quit reading"
"no need to be a douche about his formatting. just because you have a crap attention span doesn't mean you have to take it out on the intelligent people cruising these forums.that said, i would have more to say to the op if there was any content to his post at all. i assume these \"upgradable\" pods would have attributes like higher (lol even higher) agility, smaller sig radius, or even extra warp points? an interesting idea, to be sure.of course, there is no good reason to be podded in lowsec except for serious lag. and making pods invulnerable to warp disruption fields might make them overpowered."
"got your pod ganked recently?personally if they speak english and have half a brain these days i don't mind either... or i'd be a hypocrite with my spelling/grammer : o pop - noand its not that its a bad idea.... its just that the only time you see a pod is when you get your ship destroyed..and half the time they are too small to be even noticed.but too much fluff : o pand upgrading them would be a waste as they are nigh dang near hard to catch."
"yes i have been podded recently and every time my ship is destroyed by a player it has been podded and it was destroyed within a second or two after my ship was destroyed. they warpscrammed my pod and proceeded to instapop it. as far as spotting a pod. it's easy just look at the overview. after the 1st time though i used an alternate to go moving around lowsec/0.0 sec. 1st time i got killed was by a pirate gang. i'm not talking about making pods completely invunerable, just slightly decreasing the odds from 99% chance to get podded to maybe something around 30-50% chance to get podded. no content to my post - wow, this game is remarkable notorious for having alot of rude people. exactly, what content are you looking for? but then again, you speak from a pirate's viewpoint and you love to pod people - i'm sure. oh and not sure what op means. you say dang near hard to catch, but i get caught every time. i've been playing a month and have gotten podded 3-4 times, basically any time i ventured into .4 or below space for more than a few minutes. i tried to warp away every time, but it was a pointless exercise. seriously though, why do most people not go to lowsec/0.0 sec or if they do they are in a jump clone. getting podded is a high probability and people's behavior shows it. it took me 2 weeks of mining for many hours a day to buy my current implants and ship fittings. not going to risk my main when i'm guaranteed to get podkilled in low/0.0 sec. i could have easily suggested getting rid of the act of pod killing altogether but i didn't.and the pods don't have to be drastically different, just enough to give people a chance to survive, increase the population of people in low/0.0 sec. is that such a bad ideal? i thought this is what pirates/pvpers wanted. seriously though pirates and carebears and pvpers, what would make this idea acceptable to you?"
"there's no reason you should be getting podded unless you're stuck in a bubble. as soon as you know your ship is going to die, you should have something selected and be mashing the warp button. pods literally insta-warp and it takes at least a second or two to lock you even for a frigate..."
"i propose that ccp implements a second option in the clear cache option that actually doesnt, you know clear all your freeking settings.*ahem* that is all."
"this and one further proviso, that you can utilise copy slots at a lab within an alliance, provided those labs are setup to accept alliance jobs, cancellation logging also to be applied to this."
"we have combat logs.we have transaction logs.we have escrow logs.why can't we have invention logs??? only a few fields are needed:t1 bpt2 item producedmeta level (of t1 item)meta level (of decryptor)success/failthe more invention jobs that fall under identical criteria are totaled as two 'stacks' (suc/fail) and the differance averaged to give us a true indication of how well our invention processes are doing.i've seen some return consistent failure rates using meta-3 and -4 items, but are on the mark when using no items at all. (one module returns 23.1% with meta 4, 31% with meta 3, and 48.71% without items at all, this averaged on 1000 total attempts 320/320/360). lucky on that module the meta items were very inexpensive.this will also help the heavy end inventors discover bugs such as the one that i pointed out above."
"i ran a lvl 4 q 13 mission agent the other day and got a chump little drone mission just because i was bored.total number of ships destroyed: 90+all frigs/cruisers.5 drops total, about 50m3, best mineral gained was mexallon.less than 20 salvage parts total.sooooo.... how is this breaking 0.0 high-end mining? my single hulk pilot can bring in more isk in 5 minutes in 0.0 than i did for that entire mission, loot, and salvage (about 40 minutes total work).in a skiff he can make considerably more... but hauling that stuff is such a chore i just gave up on it.really... ccp should just do one of the following:option 1 >> increase rat bounties across the board and remove all drops, salvage only. give drones bounties. add meta-item blueprints as possible loot. officers drop higher end meta bps.option 2 >> remove all bounties and force ratters to loot & salvage to make their isk. turn everyone into miners, even if they're mining with tachyon beams. this will not continually 'inject' isk into the game from ratting. the only 'new' isk will be generated by... by... <gasp> mission rewards!"
"i like this idea - anything that can get rid of them other than nano/snipping ships.those who like to fight facetoface on the gate have no chance agianst falcons"

"5) form and deadline of issue submissions to the agendasit was decided that issues to be discussed need to be added to the agenda by no later than 23:59 on the wednesday evening prior to the meeting.dr. eyejog mentioned that csm needs to look at the volume of topics they are submitting and to think about whether they can actively follow up on so many issues. serenity mentioned that issues should be prioritized for ccp when submitted. inanna noted that while there is a large amount of issues, they are brought up by the community and the csm is representing the community. dr. eyejog agreed on prioritization as being very helpful. pattern clarc wants the csm to be more 2 way communicative; dr. eyejog agreed and pointed to recent efforts from ccp to include csm (which cannot be mentioned due to nda) and thinks that is starting to happen more. meeting end."
"where does the honda accord live i want to pew pew."
"generally a good post but only really valid for the young'uns. age is wonderful in that regard, you usually don't mind taking the time to do a thing properly.those weak of mind and/or young, yes. i have never nor will i ever consciously exploit a bug. i do report holes i find though. games for me is a way to stimulate my mind, real life has enough of the cheating/dodging for it to be of much use to me for recreational purposes.no argument. so far i think ccp has been a bang up job overall on these points. carrier and thorax changes were scrapped due to feedback, and the world we play in is growing nicely when it comes to stuff to do. human behaviour/psychology is hard to beat down. if you regulate too much people will leave, if too little you get chaos. find the middle ground and allow users to block people they find offensive. same as we have in-game.why spend 3 hours on a job when you can do it in 30 minutes by tweaking? time is everything to me and wasting it gives me mental rashes like you wouldn't believe. min/max itself is not an issue, mankind did not survive this long by ignoring efficiency. the problems start when a specific min/max becomes so prevalent for any given activity (nos, uber-speed, ecm domis, speed tanking missions etc.) that it skews everything else (ie. unbalances).ack, have to cut it short, too many thoughts for my own good. summation: good post, but hardly a revelation since we are talking about the single most vindictive, spiteful, egotistical and violent creature ever to grace the planet earth"
"the issue i wish to raise:removal of t1 meta 0 loot from npcs"
"since the thread is locked.removal of t1 meta 0 loot from npc's will have a net negative or no effect for meta 0 producers. as proposed in the thread, any increase in higher meta item drops will produce a reduction in price of those items. since meta 0 items are substitutes for named items and since named items are higher quality than meta 0 items it will be even harder to be a tech 1 producer after your proposed change."
"goumindong, i've refined the idea on my webpage to what i think is a workable mechanic. in it, the chance of meta 1+ items dropping isn't changed, but a 10% bonus to bounty is applied to compensate for the lost minerals/items.this will enhance t1 meta 0 item manufacture, as it's currently subsumed almost completely (except with items with no meta, such as ammo and ships) by item drops in npcs. the cost to destroy an npc is extremely small, then reselling the item on the market means that the manufacturer-wannabe makes almost no effort to create the item/items and resell them.as a mission-runner, i can make more minerals from missioning than mining, and that doesn't include the salvage/bounties/mission rewards/etc. this is a broken mechanic, and needs fixed desperately.this will also have the net effect of making mining more used, to be joined with future topics of improving mining in general. overall, this idea will only serve to expand the game, and not penalize as you might think."
"i'm going to be laying down the framework for an investigation into t2 turret ammo, especially considering the changes done to missile t2 ammo after the patchrelevant threadi'm sure the ccp is aware of this issue so it would be helpful if we could have the relevant balance dev available at the meeting for live q&a"
"that is great, this is the place where we discuss things, not your website. if you want to enter into the record things from your website, do it first before you expect anyone to know what you are suggesting.this is not true. it is not a broken mechanic, since the barrier to entry for missions is so much more than mining. similarly there is more risk involved and a higher amount of time needed for production."
